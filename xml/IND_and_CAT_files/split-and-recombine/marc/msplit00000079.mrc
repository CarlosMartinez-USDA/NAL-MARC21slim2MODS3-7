Optimum biosorption/bioaccumulation conditions were estimated as a function of contact time and temperature. The equilibrium was achieved after about 180min at 30°C temperature. Non-linear regression analysis was performed for determining the best–fit kinetic model based on three correlation coefficients and three error functions and for forecasting the parameters involved in kinetic models. The results exhibited that Brouser–Weron–Sototlongo for both As(III) and As(V) was able to provide realistic explanation of biosorption/bioaccumulation kinetic. Applicability of mechanistic models in the current study exhibited that the rate controlling step in the biosorption/bioaccumulation of both As(III) and As(V) was film diffusion rather than intraparticle diffusion. The estimated thermodynamic parameters ΔG⁰, ΔH⁰ and ΔS⁰ revealed that the biosorption/bioaccumulation of both As(III) and As(V) on the adsorbent attached with biofilm was feasible, spontaneous and exothermic in nature. The activation energy (Ea) assessed from Arrhenius equation indicated the nature of biosorption/bioaccumulation being ion exchange type. Increasing concentration of As(III) and As(V) furthermore improved the initial sorption rate, h. Acquired results indicated that the biofilm supported on adsorbent tried are very encouraging for removal of arsenic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadsorbents 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3abiofilm 3abiosorption 3acorrelation 3aequations 3agroundwater 3aheat production 3aion exchange 3aions 3akinetics 3amechanistic models 3aregression analysis 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3awastewater 0aArsenic 0aBiosorption/bioaccumulation 0aBiofilm 0aKinetic 0aMechanistic 0aThermodynamic1 aMajumder, C.B.0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2016 Aug.,  Sept., v. 2-3 p.53-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2016.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009700173300001600270520101800286592002801304650002301332650001601355650001401371650002601385650001601411650002101427650001401448650001401462653002201476653001401498653001901512653002101531653001601552653001501568653000901583700002201592700001901614700002201633700002201655700001901677773014501696856008301841852000901924655001201933IND60612305020221118013527.0190415e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061230502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsci.2016.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarao, Preetinder S.10aDonors for Resistance to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) from Wild Rice Species  ap. 219-224.  aOut of 1 989 wild accessions sown in seed boxes for screening, only 1 003 wild accessions with good germination were screened against brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) under greenhouse conditions.

This study is the first comprehensive evaluation that examines the spatial and temporal patterns of pesticide use and associated environmental risks. The pesticide use data from 1996 to 2010 were obtained from the Pesticide Use Reporting database. The Pesticide Use Risk Evaluation indicator was employed to evaluate the pesticide environmental risks based on the pesticide properties and local environmental conditions. Analyses showed that the use intensities (UI) of insecticides (oils accounted for 86% of the total insecticide UI) and herbicides both increased from north to south; fungicides showed the opposite spatial pattern; and fumigants were used most intensively in the middle region. The UI of fungicides and herbicides significantly decreased and increased, respectively, throughout the study area. The insecticide UI significantly decreased in the north but increased in many areas in the south. In particular, the organophosphate UI significantly decreased across the study area, while the pyrethroid UI significantly increased in the south. The fumigant UI did not show a trend. The regional risk intensities of surface water (RIW), soil (RIS), and air (RIA) all increased from north to south, while the groundwater regional risk intensity (RIG) decreased from north to south. The main trends of RIW, RIG, and RIS were decreasing, while the RIA did not show a trend in any region. It's noticeable that although the herbicide UI significantly increased, the UI of high-leaching herbicides significantly decreased, which led to the significant decrease of RIG. In summary, the temporal trends of the pesticide use and risks indicate that the California almond growers are making considerable progress towards sustainable pest management via integrated pest management, but still require more efforts to curb the fast increase of herbicide use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalmonds 3adatabases 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental health 3afumigants 3afungicides 3agroundwater 3agrowers 3aherbicides 3ainsecticides 3aintegrated pest management 3aoils 3apesticidal properties 3apyrethrins 3aradioimmunoassays 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3astakeholders 3asurface water 3aCalifornia 0aPesticide 0aEnvironmental risk 0aPest management 0aRegulation 0aAlmond 0aCalifornia1 aZhang, Minghua0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 472 p.517-529dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245008300173300001600256520130900272592002801581650001601609650001201625650001801637650001301655650002201668650001401690650001401704650001001718650001501728653001901743653001501762653001001777653001201787653001701799653003801816700002801854700002101882773010201903856008702005852000902092655001202101IND60545511520221120094013.0160902e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054551152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodayan, Angela10aOzonation of wastewater: Removal and transformation products of drugs of abuse  ap. 763-770.  aIn this study amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine (COC), benzoylecgonine (BE), ketamine (KET) and oxycodone (OXY) in wastewater at concentrations of 100μgL−1 were subjected to ozone to determine their removals as a function of ozone dose and to identify significant oxidation transformation products (OTPs) produced as a result of ozonation. A method based on high resolution mass spectrometry and differential analysis was used to facilitate and accelerate the identification and structural elucidation of the transformation products. The drug removal ranged from 3 to 50% depending on the complexity of the matrix and whether a mixture or individual drugs were ozonated. Both transient and persistent oxidation transformation products were identified for MDMA, COC and OXY and their chemical formulae were determined. Three possible structures of the persistent transformation product of MDMA (OTP-213) with chemical formula C10H16O4N, were determined based on MSn mass spectra and the most plausible structure (OTP-213a) was determined based on the chemistry of ozone. These results indicate that ozone is capable of removing drugs of abuse from wastewater to varying extents and that persistent transformation products are produced as a result of treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphetamine 3acocaine 3aillicit drugs 3aketamine 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3awastewater 0aDrugs of abuse 0aWastewater 0aOzone 0aCocaine 0aAmphetamines 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry1 aSegura, Pedro Alejandro1 aYargeau, Viviane0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 July 15, v. 487 p.763-770dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245006300201300001800264500002000282520178700302592002802089650002002117650001102137650002302148650001802171650001802189650001302207650001602220650001002236700001202246700002102258773012602279856007702405852000902482655001202491IND60788031520221121015234.0220811e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078803152DNAL7 a10.1002/2017WR0219702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilly, P.

The relative weakness of the temperature effect at the annual time scale hinders understanding, but may belie substantial importance on climatic time scales. Here we develop and evaluate a simple theory relating variations of streamflow and evapotranspiration (E) to those of precipitation (P) and temperature. The theory is based on extensions of the Budyko water‐balance hypothesis, the Priestley‐Taylor theory for potential evapotranspiration (Ep), and a linear model of interannual basin storage. The theory implies that the temperature affects streamflow by modifying evapotranspiration through a Clausius‐Clapeyron‐like relation and through the sensitivity of net radiation to temperature. We apply and test (1) a previously introduced “strong” extension of the Budyko hypothesis, which requires that the function linking temporal variations of the evapotranspiration ratio (E/P) and the index of dryness (Ep/P) at an annual time scale is identical to that linking interbasin variations of the corresponding long‐term means, and (2) a “weak” extension, which requires only that the annual evapotranspiration ratio depends uniquely on the annual index of dryness, and that the form of that dependence need not be known a priori nor be identical across basins. In application of the weak extension, the readily observed sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation contains crucial information about the sensitivity to potential evapotranspiration and, thence, to temperature. Implementation of the strong extension is problematic, whereas the weak extension appears to capture essential controls of the temperature effect efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abasins 3aevapotranspiration 3alinear models 3anet radiation 3aresearch 3astream flow 3awater1 aKam, J.1 aDunne, Krista A.0 tWater resources research.g2018 Apr., v. 54, no. 4 p.2624-2641dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR0219703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245079700165246015800962300001801120520125201138592002802390650002102418650002002439650001202459650001702471650001102488650001702499650001002516650001602526650001902542651001602561700002002577700001802597700001702615700001802632700002402650773009702674856004802771852000902819655001202828IND50059611820221121232130.0121102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005961182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-012-0875-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Sung-Hoon10aUne approche de modélisation hybride pour évaluer le système d’écoulement des eaux souterraines aux niveaux bas et intermédiaire du site de stockage de déchets radioactifs de Gyeong-Ju en Corée du Sud Una aproximación de modelo híbrido para evaluar el sistema de flujo de agua subterránea de un repositorio de residuos radiactivos de nivel bajo e intermedio en Gyeong-Ju, Corea 用一种混合建模方法评估韩国庆州市中低放废物处置场地下水流系统 한국 경주 중저준위 폐기물 처분 부지의 지하수 유동 시스템 평가를 위한 혼합 모형 접근 방법 Uma abordagem de modelação híbrida para analisar o sistema de fluxo subterrâneo no local de armazenamento de resíduos radioativos de nível baixo a intermédio em Gyeong-Ju, Coreia3 aA hybrid modeling approach to evaluate the groundwater flow system at the low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste disposal site in Gyeong-Ju, Korea  ap. 1341-1353.  aThe development and implementation of a hybrid discrete fracture network/equivalent porous medium (DFN/EPM) approach to groundwater flow at the Gyeong-Ju low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste (LILW) disposal site in the Republic of Korea is reported. The geometrical and hydrogeological properties of fractured zones, background fractures and rock matrix were derived from site characterization data and implemented as a DFN. Several DFN realizations, including the deterministic fractured zones and the stochastic background fractures, whose statistical properties were verified by comparison with in-situ fracture and hydraulic test data, were suggested, and they were then upscaled to continuums using a fracture tensor approach for site-scale flow simulations. The upscaled models were evaluated by comparison to in-situ pressure monitoring data, and then used to simulate post-closure hydrogeology for the LILW facility. Simulation results demonstrate the importance of careful characterization and implementation of fractured zones. The study highlighted the importance of reducing uncertainty regarding the properties and variability of natural background fractures, particularly in the immediate vicinity of repository emplacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater flow 3ahazardous waste 3ahybrids 3ahydrogeology 3amodels 3aporous media 3arocks 3auncertainty 3awaste disposal 3aSouth Korea1 aPark, Kyung Woo1 aLim, Doo-Hyun1 aKim, Chunsoo1 aKim, Kyung Su1 aDershowitz, William0 tHydrogeology journal.g2012 Nov., v. 20, no. 7 p.1341-1353dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-012-0875-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014200165300001600307520184700323592002802170650001502198650001302213650001202226650001602238650001402254650001602268650001502284650000902299650001302308650001102321650003302332650001102365650001402376650002802390650001502418651001002433653001602443653001502459653001202474653001302486653003902499653002702538700002402565700001802589700002402607700001702631700002902648700001802677773012902695856008202824852000902906655001202915IND60561568520221118003455.0180905e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056156852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2016.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Nilotpal10aEffect of river proximity on the arsenic and fluoride distribution in the aquifers of the Brahmaputra Floodplains, Assam, Northeast India  ap. 130-142.  aGroundwater samples were collected from the Brahmaputra Flood Plains (BFP) to study the effect of river proximity on the arsenic (As) and fluoride levels (F⁻). Arsenic and F⁻ contamination was found to be higher in the south bank. Higher carbonate weathering was found to elevate the alkalinity in the south bank which in turn appeared to influence the groundwater As and F⁻ levels. Low NO3⁻ levels in the groundwater indicated the existence of a predominantly reducing condition, which is confirmed by low ORP levels in majority of the groundwater samples. Positive correlation between As and Fe, along with close grouping in principal components analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis indicated the involvement of reductive hydrolysis of Fe (hydr)oxides. Principal components analysis showed that reductive hydrolysis was more common in the south bank, which could explain the higher As levels detected in that bank. Higher sedimentation rates on the south bank could also influence the elevated As levels in its groundwater. Co-occurrence of As and F⁻ was also found to be more likely in the south bank as indicated by hierarchical cluster analysis, the process appeared to be influenced by dissolution of Fe (hydr)oxides. Distance from the river and groundwater As level appear to be related, newer sediments close to the river are more likely to have higher As compared to older sediments away from the river. Fluoride on the other hand appears to have an inverse relation with river proximity, as recharge interrupts rock-water interaction, which is the main pathway for F⁻ release. Overall occurrence of groundwater As appears to be a more widespread problem in the floodplains, while F⁻ in groundwater is localised and limited to isolated pockets which promote higher mineral and water interaction over long periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3afloodplains 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3anitrates 3aoxides 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asediments 3asustainable development 3aweathering 3aIndia 0aGroundwater 0aWeathering 0aArsenic 0aFluoride 0aMultivariate statistical technique 0aBrahmaputra floodplain1 aDeka, Jyoti Prakash1 aShim, Jaehong1 aPatel, Arbind Kumar1 aAbhay Kumar,1 aŚarma, Kālī Prasāda,1 aManish Kumar,0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2016 Aug.,  Sept., v. 2-3 p.130-142dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2016.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010500172520178800277592002802065650002502093650002302118650002102141650001302162650001202175650001602187650000802203650001602211650001602227650001002243651001902253653002102272653002102293653001302314653001602327653001902343700002202362700001902384700002002403700001802423700001802441700002202459700002002481773009502501856008402596852000902680655001202689IND60686525720221118045830.0200621e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068652572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2020.1046692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalland, Alyssa R.10aAssociations of self-reported eating disorder behaviors and personality in a college-educated sample  aIn order to better understand factors motivating eating disorder (ED) behaviors and better identify persons at-risk for these behaviors, we sought to identify which personality domains and facets were associated with behaviors for weight control.ED behavior information was gathered from the University of North Carolina Alumni Heart Study using the question, “have you ever used any of the following to lose weight?” Respondents endorsed any combination of the following: “Vomiting,” “Fasting,” “Laxatives,” “Excessive physical exercise.” Personality was measured using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R). One-way ANOVAs were performed comparing personality domains and facets to reported ED behaviors, computed both as separate behaviors and the number of cumulative behaviors.Of 3496 respondents, 9.41% endorsed ever having used at least one ED behavior, with the majority endorsing only a single ED behavior. For both sexes, endorsing greater numbers of ED behaviors was associated with higher scores on Neuroticism and Openness. For women, the strongest associations for behaviors with personality were: excessive exercise with high Impulsiveness; fasting with high Impulsiveness and low Gregariousness; laxative use/purging with high scores on Activity and Feelings. For men, the strongest associations were: excessive exercise with high Impulsiveness; fasting with high Ideas; laxative use/purging with low Modesty.Data collected from this sample showed a sex-modulated pattern of association between personality domains and facets with ED behaviors. Our findings support that obtaining personality profiles of individuals exhibiting subclinical eating behaviors will enhance our understanding of who is at risk of developing an ED diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aat-risk population 3aeating disorders 3aexercise 3afasting 3ainventories 3amen 3apersonality 3aweight loss 3awomen 3aNorth Carolina 0aEating disorders 0aEating behaviors 0aNEO-PI-R 0aPersonality 0aWeight control1 aSiegler, Ilene C.1 aCosta, Paul T.1 aRoss, Leanna M.1 aZucker, Nancy1 aFrench, Robin1 aHauser, Elizabeth1 aHuffman, Kim M.0 tAppetite.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 151 p.104669-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.1046693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009600171300001600267520153300283592002801816650001201844650001601856650001501872650001501887650001201902650002101914650001701935650000901952650001101961650001501972650001601987650002002003650002402023653002202047653001602069653002102085653002002106653001502126700001902141700005902160700001902219773011302238856008602351852000902437655001202446IND60607377320221118205823.0180831e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060737732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.02.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xian-Wei10aPhytic acid as a bio-based phosphorus flame retardant for poly(lactic acid) nonwoven fabric  ap. 114-119.  aBio-based phytic acid as a nontoxic naturally occurring compound has a promising prospect in the field of the flame retardant modification of polymers because of its high phosphorus content. Bio-based and bio-degradable poly(lactic acid) has aroused considerable interest and its use is growing, but its flame retardancy needs to be improved when it is used as a flame retardant material. In this work, phytic acid was used to improve the flame retardancy of poly(lactic acid) nonwoven fabric by a pad-dry-cure technique, and the effect of phytic acid dosage on the flammability as well as the flame retardant mechanism of the treated fabric was discussed. The limiting oxygen index and vertical burning tests revealed that the treated fabric exhibited good flame retardancy. The microscale combustion calorimetry analysis showed that the treated fabric had significantly decreased heat release rate, total heat release and heat release capacity compared with the untreated fabric. The char residue formation of the treated fabric during thermal degradation, and the high phosphorus content of the burned fabric residue suggested that a significant condensed-phase mechanism contributed to the flame retardancy of the treated fabric. The flame retardant system in the present study is applicable to the poly(lactic acid) fabrics without the durability requirement. The use of phytic acid provides an opportunity for producing the flame retardant poly(lactic acid) materials using a sustainable and cleaner flame retardant agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acalorimetry 3acombustion 3adurability 3afabrics 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aheat 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aphytic acid 3apolylactic acid 3athermal degradation 0aPoly(lactic acid) 0aPhytic acid 0aFlame retardancy 0aFlame retardant 0aPhosphorus1 aGuan, Jin-Ping1 aTang, Ren-Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7220-860X1 aLiu, Kai-Qiang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 June 15, v. 124 p.114-119dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.02.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012800172300002000300500001900320520194000339592002802279650001102307650001902318650000902337650001502346650001102361650001302372650001702385650001302402650001302415650001702428650001602445700006002461700001802521700001602539700001902555700005402574700005302628773012202681856008702803852000902890655001202899IND60720760720221119002055.0201217e20201127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072076072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c031852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pengqian10aInvestigation on Co-Gasification Characteristics of Semicoke and Bituminous Coal in a CO₂ Atmosphere at High Temperatures  ap. 16132-16146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCo-combustion of semicoke and coal under oxy-fuel conditions is a promising approach for the utilization of semicoke with a low volatile fraction. The devolatilization and gasification of fuels at high temperatures in a CO₂ atmosphere is the preliminary stage of oxy-fuel combustion and significantly impacts the following processes of ignition, burnout, and fuel nitrogen release. In this paper, CO₂ co-gasification of semicoke and bituminous coal was performed using a high-temperature drop tube furnace with a focus on interactions between the two fuels on the porous structure of resultant chars and fuel nitrogen transformation. The results indicated that blending semicoke and coal resulted in the lower Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) of mixture char than semicoke char at 900–1100 °C but led to the higher SBET of mixture chars at 1300–1500 °C. The SBET of resultant chars in a CO₂ atmosphere was evidently higher than those of the chars in a N₂ atmosphere. The interactions between the two fuels tended to promote the release of NOₓ and its precursors during CO₂ co-gasification and were enhanced by the more content of semicoke. The O/N ratio had a more remarkable correlation with NO yield than the H/N ratio and the fuel ratio. The interaction between the semicoke and coal promoted the CH₄ release at 900–1100 °C but turned to show inhibition with a further increase in temperature. Less CH₄ was yielded in a CO₂ atmosphere than in a N₂ atmosphere due to the reactions of CO₂ and hydrocarbon. The high temperature and CO₂ atmosphere promoted the release of char-N, which was hardly impacted by the interaction between the two fuels. The release of hydrogen was much faster than that of carbon during CO₂ gasification. The release rate of nitrogen was lower than carbon at 900–1400 °C, while the similar release rates of carbon and nitrogen were found at 1500 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenergy 3afurnaces 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aWang, Chang’an1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1730-740X1 aWang, Chaowei1 aYuan, Maobo1 aZhang, Jinping1 aDu, Yongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0371-284X1 aChe, Defu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1881-41360 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Nov. 27, v. 34, no. 12 p.16132-16146dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c031853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245019900168500001400367520148700381592002801868650002701896650001601923650001501939650002001954650001701974650001701991650001402008650001802022650002202040650002102062650001802083650001502101653001202116653000902128653002802137653001302165653001302178700005602191700006002247773009102307856009002398852000902488655001202497IND60719944720221118072906.0210219e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071994472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1292002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Bo10aN-nitrosodimethylamine formation potential (NDMA-FP) of ranitidine remains after chlorination and/or photo-irradiation: Identification of transformation products in combination with NDMA-FP test  aNAL-light  aN-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable carcinogenic disinfection by-product, can be formed with high molar yields following chloramination of ranitidine (RNTD), a histamine H₂-receptor antagonist. Although RNTD and some of its transformation products (TPs) have been studied under chlorination and photo-irradiation, the relationship between RNTD TPs and NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) remaining after those processes is still unclear. This study investigated the effects of chlorination and/or photo-irradiation on NDMA-FP derived from RNTD, simulating an urban water environment receiving treated wastewater. After chlorination and/or photo-irradiation of RNTD, ten TPs including five new ones were identified by liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTof-MS). In addition, important RNTD TPs responsible for NDMA-FP (e.g., chlorinated and hydroxylated RNTD: TP-364) were also confirmed by the relationship between detected peak area and NDMA-FP. The results showed that NDMA-FP remained due to the presence of RNTD TPs, although RNTD itself was significantly removed by chlorination and/or photo-irradiation. TP-364 was only formed by chlorination of RNTD and could not be removed by photo-irradiation. TP-314 (a stereoisomer of RNTD), -299, and -286, which were mainly formed by photo-irradiation of RNTD but not by photo-irradiation after chlorination, had strong positive correlations with NDMA-FP (R² > 0.90; F-test, P < 0.01).  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-nitrosodimethylamine 3aantagonists 3abyproducts 3acarcinogenicity 3achlorination 3adisinfection 3ahistamine 3ahydroxylation 3amass spectrometry 3aphotoirradiation 3astereoisomers 3awastewater 0aNDMA-FP 0aRNTD 0aTransformation products 0aChlorine 0aSunlight1 aZhou, Jiajun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8454-48271 aNakada, Norihide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3536-68090 tChemosphere.g2021 Mar., v. 267 p.129200-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1292003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245011200202500001400314506007600328520112300404592002801527506003701555650001901592650002201611650001501633650001101648650002701659700002201686700002101708700002001729773011901749856007401868852000901942655001201951IND60654558220221207130553.0190725e20190629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065455822DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90703972doi7 aPMC66810512pmcid7 a312619342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosselot, Paula 10aBehavioral and Physiological Differences between Working Horses and Chilean Rodeo Horses in a Handling Test  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNon-invasive measures are preferred when assessing animal welfare.

Behavioral and physiological responses of working and Chilean rodeo horses subjected to a handling test were assessed. Five behaviors, number of attempts, and the time to cross a bridge were video recorded and analyzed with the Observer XT software. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), to assess the physiological response to the novel stimulus, were registered with a Polar Equine V800 heart rate monitor system during rest and the bridge test. Heart rate variability data were obtained with the Kubios software. Differences between working and Chilean rodeo horses were assessed, and within-group differences between rest and the test were also analyzed. Chilean rodeo horses presented more proactive behaviors and required significantly more attempts to cross the bridge than working horses.

Inter and intra-specific genetic diversity among P. colocasiae isolates collected from same field was assessed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker. Seven primer pairs produced 431 markers, of which 428 (99.2 %) were polymorphic. Considerable genetic variability was displayed by the isolates. The average value of the number of observed alleles, the number of effective alleles, mean Nei’s genetic diversity, and Shannon’s information index were 1.993, 1.385, 0.261, and 0.420, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that the majority (85 %) of the diversity were present within populations of P. colocasiae. Dendrogram based on AFLP molecular data using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) classified the P. colocasiae isolates into two major clusters irrespective of their geographical origin. Clustering was further supported by principle coordinate analysis. Cophenetic correlation coefficient between dendrogram and original similarity matrix was significant (r = 0.816).

The objective of this study was to develop a simulation model to calculate the cost of raising replacement dairy heifers using different inputs that reflect different management decisions and evaluate their influence on the total cost. In this simulation, 84 calves were modeled between 0&ndash;2 months of age to reflect a 1000 heifer herd. The decisions associated with housing, liquid diet source and allowance, labor utilization, and health were calculated. Costs and biological responses were reflective of published surveys, literature, and market conditions. A 10,000-iteration economic simulation was used for each management scenario using @Risk and PrecisionTree add-ons (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA) to account for variation in pre-weaning mortality rate, weaning age, and disease prevalence. As milk allotment increased, total feed cost increased. Feeding calves a higher allowance of milk resulted in a lower cost per kg of gain. Average feed cost percentage of the total cost was 46% (min, max: 33%, 59%) while labor, and fixed and variable cost represented 33% (20%, 45%), 9% (2%, 12%), and 12% (10%, 14%), respectively. Total pre-weaning costs ranged from $258.56 to $582.98 per calf across all management scenarios and milk allotments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adisease prevalence 3aeconomic analysis 3afeed prices 3aherds 3alabor 3aliquid diet 3amarkets 3amilk 3amortality 3asimulation models 3aNorth America1 aBurdine, Kenneth 1 aAmaral-Phillips, Donna 1 aCosta, Joao  H.C.0 tAnimals.g2019 July 23, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90704713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001900187245006200206300001800268506007600286520037800362592002800740506003700768650003000805650001100835650002500846650001400871650001400885651001100899700001900910700001800929700001800947700001800965700002400983700001901007700002001026700001901046773012701065856008001192852000901272655001201281IND60117644020221207120220.0141126e20130627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011764402DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00185-132doi7 aPMC36504372pmcid7 a236614782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiu, Chi-ming10aDraft Genome Sequence of Lactobacillus pobuzihii E100301T  ap. e00185-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLactobacillus pobuzihii E100301T is a novel Lactobacillus species previously isolated from pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia) in Taiwan.

Mass spectrometry (MS) provides a high-throughput technology that enables the identification of large numbers of phosphosites. PhoPepMass is designed to assist human phosphopeptide identification from MS data based on a specific database of phophopeptide masses and a multivariate hypergeometric matching algorithm. It contains 244,915 phosphosites from several public sources. Moreover, the accurate masses of peptides and fragments with phosphosites were calculated. It is the first database that provides a systematic resource for the query of phosphosites on peptides and their corresponding masses. This allows researchers to search certain proteins of which phosphosites have been reported, to browse detailed phosphopeptide and fragment information, to match masses from MS analyses with defined threshold to the corresponding phosphopeptide, and to compare proprietary phosphopeptide discovery results with results from previous studies. Additionally, a database search software is created and a “two-stage search strategy” is suggested to identify phosphopeptides from tandem mass spectra of proteomics data. We expect PhoPepMass to be a useful tool and a source of reference for proteomics researchers.

In lieu of detailed data on plant characteristics, the site specific technical information has been collected, analyzed, and complemented by four simulations that integrate the effects of plant performance-enhancing methods such as regeneration, cooling, hot/cold water injection, steam injection, heat recovery by heat pump and energy recovery by turbo-expander. Firstly, given the avoidable irreversibilities at the exhaust, recuperation and regulating valve replacement with a turbo-expander was established to compensate plant irreversibilities. Secondly, the effects of a vapor compression refrigeration equipped with evaporative cooling were also studied, along with assessing five refrigerants, to decrease the compression work. In the third simulation, the effect of utilization of the hot and cold water injection was investigated. It was shown that water injection by two cooling mechanisms such as evaporation and wet-compression enhances plant Round Trip Efficiency. Finally, in steam injection investigation, the required heat source was provided by employing a novel very high-temperature heat pump. The evaluation of novel combined solutions revealed that the regeneration, compression cooling, water and steam injection improve plant round trip efficiency by 37.81%, 3.22%, 2.5% and 2.78% respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair 3acommercialization 3acooling 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy recovery 3aengineering 3aevaporation 3aheat pumps 3aheat recovery 3ainformation 3ainjection 3amethodology 3aplant characteristics 3arefrigeration 3asolutions 3asteam 3astorage 3awater 0aCAES 0aHuntorf plant 0aWater injection 0aSteam injection 0aRecuperation1 aSoltani, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0878-62741 aNathwani, Jatin0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 209 p.112662-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1126623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001200181245010600193500001400299506007600313520123700389592002801626506003701654650001601691650001601707650002101723650002401744650000901768650002401777650001001801650000901811700002501820700001301845700001301858700001401871700001301885700001501898700001401913700001501927700001501942773011901957856007402076852000902150655001202159IND60654558620221207130635.0190725e20190723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065455862DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90704722doi7 aPMC66805412pmcid7 a313405662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, L. 10aOptimization of Dietary Zinc Requirement for Broiler Breeder Hens of Chinese Yellow-Feathered Chicken  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to establish the optimal dietary zinc requirement of Chinese yellow-feathered Lingnan broiler breeders. A total of 576 breeder hens aged 58 weeks were randomly assigned to six treatments, each with 6 replicates of 16 birds (n = 96/treatment). The hens were fed either a basal diet (22.81 mg/kg Zn) or the same basal diet supplemented with additional 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 mg Zn/kg up to 65 weeks of age. Compared to the results of birds fed the basal diet (22.81 mg Zn/kg), the dietary supplementation with additional Zn (mg/kg) showed higher egg laying rate (at 48&ndash;120 mg), EM (at 96 mg/kg), yolk Zn content (at 24&ndash;120 mg/kg), fertility (at 48&ndash;120 mg/kg), hatchability (at 48&ndash;96 mg/kg), tibial breaking strength (at 24&ndash;48 mg/kg), tibial ash content (at 48 mg/kg), serum CuZnSOD activity (at 72 mg/kg) and T-AOC (at 48 mg/kg), and ovarian CuZnSOD and GSH-Px activities (at 96&ndash;120 mg/kg), and lower FCR (at 96 mg/kg). The regression model showed that the optimal supplemental Zn for maximal egg laying rate, yolk Zn content, fertility, and hatchability of Chinese yellow-feathered broiler breeders aged 58 to 65 weeks were 71.09, 92.34, 94.44 and 98.65 mg/kg diet, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aash content 3ablood serum 3abroiler breeders 3adietary supplements 3aeggs 3aregression analysis 3atibia 3azinc1 aAbouelezz, K.

Postdepositional weathering processes are known to increase the permeability of aquitards in the near surface but not impact on deeper parts of relatively thick formations. However, syndepositional processes affecting the hydraulic properties of aquitards have previously received little attention in the literature. Here, we analyze a 31 m deep sediment core recovered from an inland clay‐rich sedimentary sequence using a combination of techniques including particle size distribution and microscopy, centrifuge dye tracer testing and micro X‐ray CT imaging. Subaerial deposition of soils within these fine grained alluvial deposits has led to the preservation of considerable macropores (root channels or animal burrows). Connected pores and macropores thus account for vertical hydraulic conductivity (K) of 4.2×10−9 m/s (geometric mean of 13 samples) throughout the thick aquitard, compared to a matrix K that is likely < 10−10 m/s, the minimum K value that was measured. Our testing demonstrates that such syndepositional features may compromise the hydraulic integrity of what otherwise appears to have the characteristics of a much lower permeability aquitard. Heterogeneity within a clay‐rich matrix could also enhance vertical connectivity, as indicated by digital analysis of pore morphology in CT images. We highlight that the paleo‐environment under which the sediment was deposited must be considered when aquitards are investigated as potential natural hydraulic barriers and illustrate the value of combining multiple investigation techniques for characterizing clay‐rich deposits.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Centre for Groundwater Research and Training  cAustralian Research Council  cNational Water Commission  aFP7/2007‐2013cEuropean Community Seventh Framework Programme  aFT120100216cARC Future Fellowship  am65cAustralian Government 3aanimals 3acomputed tomography 3adyes 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amacropores 3amicroscopy 3apaleoecology 3aparticle size distribution 3apermeability 3aresearch 3awater1 aAcworth, R.

Prebred Holstein heifers (n = 128, ages 4 to 8 mo) were blocked by weight (low, medium-low, medium-high, or high) with 32 heifers per block. Heifers in each weight block were grouped by RFI and randomly assigned to obtain 2 pens of high (HRFI) and 2 pens of low RFI (LRFI) heifers within each block (8 heifers/pen). Heifers with LRFI were hypothesized to have greater feed efficiency than HRFI heifers. Dietary treatments were a high-energy diet (HE; 66.6% total digestible nutrients, 14.0% crude protein, and 36.3% neutral detergent fiber, dry matter basis) and a low-energy diet (LE; 63.8% total digestible nutrients, 13.5% crude protein, and 41.2% neutral detergent fiber, dry matter basis). Each pen of heifers was randomly assigned to a treatment to obtain a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement (2 RFI levels × 2 diet energy densities). Diets were offered in a 120-d trial. Dry matter intake was not affected by diet, RFI, or their interaction. Average daily gain (ADG) was affected by diet, with heifers fed HE having greater ADG than heifers fed LE. In addition, RFI affected ADG, with LRFI heifers having greater ADG than HRFI heifers, whereas the interaction of RFI and diet was not significant. Feed efficiency was improved for heifers fed the HE diet, but it was not affected by RFI or the interaction of RFI and diet. Overall, feed efficiency of prebred heifers was not dependent on predicted genomic RFI, because the greater ADG of LRFI heifers was accompanied by slightly higher dry matter intake. Feed efficiency of heifers was reduced when heifers were fed the LE diet, but this resulted in more optimal ADG compared with the HE diet fed for ad libitum intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aad libitum feeding 3aaverage daily gain 3acrude protein 3adairy heifers 3adry matter intake 3aenergy density 3aexcretion 3afeed conversion 3agenomics 3ahigh energy diet 3alow calorie diet 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutrients 0adairy heifer 0adiet energy 0aresidual feed intake1 aWeigel, K.A.1 aCoblentz, W.K.1 aEsser, N.M.1 aSchlesser, H.1 aHoffman, P.C.1 aSu, H.1 aAkins, M.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 May, v. 102, no. 5 p.4041-4050dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-155043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245017900175500001400354520148900368592002801857650003001885650002401915650001101939650001501950650001901965650002101984650002202005650002202027650001702049650000902066650001102075650002202086650001802108650002302126650002402149650001202173650001402185650002502199653001902224653001702243653002102260653002002281653002102301700001702322700001602339700001902355700002702374773011602401856008702517852000902604655001202613IND60686526220221118045900.0200804e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068652622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1126632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichailos, Stavros10aBiomethane production using an integrated anaerobic digestion, gasification and CO2 biomethanation process in a real waste water treatment plant: A techno-economic assessment  aNAL-light  aThe biomethanation of CO₂ from anaerobic digestion within the power to gas concept has recently emerged as a promising technology to upgrade biogas, to decarbonise the domestic and industrial heat sector, provide long term energy storage and deliver grid balancing services. In addition, the utilisation of the digestate, through a process such as gasification, offers a circular economy approach and has the potential to enhance the deployment of power to gas systems. To this direction, the study focuses on exploring the techno-economic feasibility of coupling biomethanation with digestate gasification for the wastewater industry. The study constitutes the first endeavour to assess the viability of such an integrated energy system. Four different scenarios have been designed and assessed. The energy efficiency of the concepts lies between 26.5% and 35.5% while the minimum selling price (MSP) of biomethane is in the range of 135–183 £/MWh. The implementation of appropriate policy mechanisms and the inclusion of by-products revenues reduces the MSPs by approximately 32%–42%. The conduction of a typical sensitivity analysis has identified the electricity price as the prime cost driver and this is followed by the cost of the electrolyser or the gasification plant depending on the scenario. Finally, a 2030 analysis, that incorporates projected techno-economic advances, has been carried out and revealed that under certain circumstances profits can be generated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abyproducts 3acarbon dioxide 3acircular economy 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy efficiency 3agasification 3aheat 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amarket prices 3amethane production 3aprofits and margins 3astorage 3aviability 3awastewater treatment 0aBiomethanation 0aPower to gas 0aBiogas upgrading 0aCO2 utilisation 0aTechno-economics1 aWalker, Mark1 aMoody, Adam1 aPoggio, Davide1 aPourkashanian, Mohamed0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 209 p.112663-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1126633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002400171245006200195300001600257520126600273592002801539650002501567650002501592650002101617650003101638650002401669650001001693650002401703650002601727650002201753650003001775650005901805650003801864650004801902650001301950650003801963650001702001650006802018650003202086650003202118650004102150650003902191650001602230650004902246650003102295653003102326653003102357653003502388653003102423653002502454700002902479773010902508856008702617852000902704655001202713IND50060514120221122025626.0190318e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006051412DNAL7 a233524112pmid7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2012.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetolino, Joseph F.10aDesigned transcriptional regulators for trait development  ap. 128-136.  aDevelopment is largely controlled by proteins that regulate gene expression at the level of transcription. These regulatory proteins, the genes that control them, and the genes that they control, are organized in a hierarchical structure of complex interactions. Altering the expression of genes encoding regulatory proteins controlling critical nodes in this hierarchy has potential for dramatic phenotypic modification. Constitutive over-expression of genes encoding regulatory proteins in transgenic plants has resulted in agronomically interesting phenotypes along with developmental abnormalities. For trait development, the magnitude and timing of expression of genes encoding key regulatory proteins will need to be precisely controlled and targeted to specific cells and tissues at certain developmental timepoints. Such control is made possible by designed transcriptional regulators which are fusions of engineered DNA binding proteins and activator or repressor domains. Expression of genes encoding such designed transcriptional regulators enable the selective modulation of endogenous gene expression. Genes encoding proteins controlling regulatory networks are prime targets for up- or down-regulation via such designed transcriptional regulators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aabnormal development 3aagronomic traits 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aregulatory proteins 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDroughts 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aProtein Interaction Mapping 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRegulatory Elements, Transcriptional 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aTemperature 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscriptional Activation 0aTranscriptional activation 0aTranscriptional repression 0aDesigned transcription factors 0aEndogenous gene regulation 0aDNA binding proteins1 aDavies, Johnq(John P.),0 tPlant science.g2013 Mar., v. 201-202 p.128-136dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2012.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245022700202500001900429500002000448520173600468592002802204596004102232650001802273650001802291650001202309650001802321650001902339650002702358650002102385650001702406650001402423650001502437650001302452650001702465650002102482650001202503650001602515650001602531700002102547700002302568773014402591856007402735852000902809655001202818IND60710592820221120034152.0200912e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071059282DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.147132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalczyk, Dariusz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5523-621910aEffect of carboxymethyl cellulose/candelilla wax edible coating incorporated with ascorbic acid on the physicochemical and sensory qualities of prepackaged minimally processed carrots (Daucus carota L.) during cold storage  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMinimally processed carrots (MPC) was coated with ascorbic acid‐added carboxymethyl cellulose/candelilla wax emulsion, then placed in plastic boxes with perforated polyethylene wrap, and stored at 5°C. It was found that the horizontal cross‐section of samples absorbed larger amounts of emulsion than the lateral surface. The individual wax globules of the coating deposited in the interior of the damaged (by peeling) cortical cells were visualized using scanning electron microscopy. The coating improved water vapor resistance of MPC, temporarily increased the respiratory rate, decreased the activity of polyphenol oxidase, and prevented the formation of “white blush.” The acidity, total phenolic content, and texture of the MPC were not affected by the coating treatment. In summary, the edible coating (along with packaging) can serve as a promising approach for maintaining the fresh‐like characteristics of minimally processed carrots through 21 days of cold storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The treatment of minimally processed carrots with the carboxymethyl cellulose/candelilla wax/ascorbic acid emulsion results in increased moisture retention. Consequently, the coated carrots exhibit reduced weight loss, unchanged hardness, and no “white blush.” As expected, the coating inhibited the activity of polyphenol oxidase, most likely due to the MPC surface acidification. In summary, the edible coating (along with packaging) can serve as a promising approach for maintaining the fresh‐like characteristics of minimally processed carrots through 21 days of cold storage. However, the noticeable disadvantage of the coated carrots is the waxy circular deposit around the pericycle and endodermis cells.  aPublisher supplied data  aN N312501540cNarodowe Centrum Nauki 3aDaucus carota 3aacidification 3aacidity 3aascorbic acid 3acandelilla wax 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acatechol oxidase 3acold storage 3aemulsions 3aendodermis 3ahardness 3apolyethylene 3arespiratory rate 3atexture 3awater vapor 3aweight loss1 aSkrzypek, Tomasz1 aŁupina, Katarzyna0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2020 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.e14713-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.147133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245008500159300001800244500002000262520197900282592002802261650001602289650002602305650001602331650001102347650002202358650001602380650001702396650001602413650001202429700001702441700002502458700002002483700002202503700002202525700002802547773009102575856007202666852000902738655001202747IND60571255520221118232025.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057125552DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.18312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZipkin, Elise F.10aIntegrating count and detection–nondetection data to model population dynamics  ap. 1640-1650.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThere is increasing need for methods that integrate multiple data types into a single analytical framework as the spatial and temporal scale of ecological research expands. Current work on this topic primarily focuses on combining capture–recapture data from marked individuals with other data types into integrated population models. Yet, studies of species distributions and trends often rely on data from unmarked individuals across broad scales where local abundance and environmental variables may vary. We present a modeling framework for integrating detection–nondetection and count data into a single analysis to estimate population dynamics, abundance, and individual detection probabilities during sampling. Our dynamic population model assumes that site‐specific abundance can change over time according to survival of individuals and gains through reproduction and immigration. The observation process for each data type is modeled by assuming that every individual present at a site has an equal probability of being detected during sampling processes. We examine our modeling approach through a series of simulations illustrating the relative value of count vs. detection–nondetection data under a variety of parameter values and survey configurations. We also provide an empirical example of the model by combining long‐term detection–nondetection data (1995–2014) with newly collected count data (2015–2016) from a growing population of Barred Owl (Strix varia) in the Pacific Northwest to examine the factors influencing population abundance over time. Our model provides a foundation for incorporating unmarked data within a single framework, even in cases where sampling processes yield different detection probabilities. This approach will be useful for survey design and to researchers interested in incorporating historical or citizen science data into analyses focused on understanding how demographic rates drive population abundance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrix varia 3aenvironmental factors 3aimmigration 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3aprobability 3areproduction 3aresearchers 3asurveys1 aRossman, Sam1 aYackulic, Charles B.1 aWiens, J.

Thus, it is necessary to find an effective method to immobilize selenium in the soil to make it less bioavailable and less accessible. In this study, the low-cost biochar-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron and polysulfide (PS-nZVI@BC) are produced and used for the immobilization of selenium (Se) in soil. The FTIR, UV–Vis, XRD, VSM, SEM and XPS techniques validate surface properties and morphology of PS-nZVI@BC. Introduction of S²⁻ led to the in-situ formation of FeS on the surface of the biochar supported zero valent iron. Two intense Bragg peaks (2θ) of 40.5°, 44.5° were corresponded to Fe⁰ basal plane, indicating the presence of nZVI in nZVI@BC and PS-nZVI@BC. The modified biochar presents a magnetic saturation value of 0.008 emu/mg, reasonably less than the reported values of bare nZVI. The soil immobilization showed that the PS-nZVI@BC is more effective for the control of selenium than the biochar and nZVI@BC. The available selenium content decreased by 77.29% in PS-nZVI@BC amended soil after 30 days. From sequential extraction procedure (SEP) results, it was observed that PS-nZVI@BC promoted the conversion of more accessible Se (water-soluble and exchangeable fractions) into the less accessible forms (acid-soluble, organic, and residual fractions) to reduce the toxicity of Se. Surface sorption, reduction and complexation were dominant mechanisms for Se immobilization. Hence, PS-nZVI@BC is promising and effective for immobilizing Se in contaminated soils and improving the soil properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3ahuman health 3airon 3amagnetism 3aplant growth 3apolluted soils 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aselenium 3asoil amendments 3asoil pollution 3asoil properties 3asorption 3asulfides 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awater solubility 0aBiochar composites 0aSelenium pollution 0aPolysulfide-iron 0aHeavy metal immobilization 0aSoil remediation1 aPu, Shengyan1 aWang, Xiaoke1 aMa, Hui1 aBai, Yingchen0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 708 p.134831-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1348313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007700172300001600249520083100265592002801096650001301124650001601137650001601153650001101169650001601180650001001196651001601206653001601222653002501238700002901263700001801292700002001310773010801330856008601438852000901524655001201533IND50070333120221119073308.0190318e20131111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007033312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulley, Anton K.10aGroundwater responses to the recent Canterbury earthquakes: a comparison  ap. 171-181.  aThe recent Canterbury/Christchurch earthquakes and aftershocks generated groundwater level responses throughout New Zealand. However, the greater part of damage has been sustained by the city of Christchurch which is built on a layered sequence of artesian aquifers. In this paper we focus on responses in these coastal aquifers. We quantify groundwater responses with a simple model which differentiates between immediate earthquake induced response (spike) and post-seismic change (offset). The most significant feature of our analysis is the consistent pattern of groundwater response to the earthquakes: deeper wells correlate with negative offset and shallower wells correlate with positive offset. This is consistent with the upwards vertical movement of water. We consider the hydrological and engineering consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aearthquakes 3agroundwater 3amodels 3awater table 3awells 3aNew Zealand 0aGroundwater 0aEarthquake hydrology1 aDudley Ward, Nicholas F.1 aCox, Simon C.1 aKaipio, Jari P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2013 Nov. 11, v. 504 p.171-181dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010200165300001600267520113000283592002801413650002501441650001201466650002001478650001301498650001801511650001701529650001901546650002001565653002601585653001801611653002501629653001901654653002001673700001601693700001901709700002001728700002501748700001701773700001301790700001501803700001701818700001301835773011001848856008301958852000902041655001202050IND60612306020221118013401.0190415e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061230602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2017.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qingqing10aTransporter-Mediated Nuclear Entry of Jasmonoyl-Isoleucine Is Essential for Jasmonate Signaling  ap. 695-708.  aTo control gene expression by directly responding to hormone concentrations, both animal and plant cells have exploited comparable mechanisms to sense small-molecule hormones in nucleus. Whether nuclear entry of these hormones is actively transported or passively diffused, as conventionally postulated, through the nuclear pore complex, remains enigmatic. Here, we identified and characterized a jasmonate transporter in Arabidopsis thaliana, AtJAT1/AtABCG16, which exhibits an unexpected dual localization at the nuclear envelope and plasma membrane. We show that AtJAT1/AtABCG16 controls the cytoplasmic and nuclear partition of jasmonate phytohormones by mediating both cellular efflux of jasmonic acid (JA) and nuclear influx of jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and is essential for maintaining a critical nuclear JA-Ile concentration to activate JA signaling. These results illustrate that transporter-mediated nuclear entry of small hormone molecules is a new mechanism to regulate nuclear hormone signaling. Our findings provide an avenue to develop pharmaceutical agents targeting the nuclear entry of small molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aanimals 3agene expression 3ahormones 3ajasmonic acid 3anuclear pore 3aplant hormones 3aplasma membrane 0ajasmonate transporter 0ajasmonic acid 0ajasmonoyl-isoleucine 0anuclear import 0aAtJAT1/AtABCG161 aZheng, Jian1 aLi, Shuaizhang1 aHuang, Guanrong1 aSkilling, Stephen J.1 aWang, Lijian1 aLi, Ling1 aLi, Mengya1 aYuan, Lixing1 aLiu, Pei0 tMolecular plant.g2017 May 01, v. 10, no. 5 p.695-708dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2017.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245015700173300001800330520094400348592002801292650001501320650001101335650001001346650001801356650001301374650001301387650001301400650001401413650001801427650001501445650002201460700002801482700003501510700002401545700002001569773013701589856005501726852000901781655001201790IND4468843520221122025847.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446884352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2012.03081.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmiele, Marcio10aRheological properties of wheat flour and quality characteristics of pan bread as modified by partial additions of wheat bran or whole grain wheat flour  ap. 2141-2150.  aThe use of bran and whole grain flour changes dough rheology and causes difficulties in manufacturing bakery products. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of substituting refined wheat flour (WF) by wheat bran (WB; 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%) or whole grain wheat flour (WGWF; 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%) on dough rheological properties and pan bread quality characteristics. The addition of WB and WGWF increased water absorption and resistance to extension and decreased stability, extensibility and peak viscosity. Effects with WB were more pronounced. The presence of WB or WGWF increased crumb moisture content, firmness and hardness and decreased specific volume of pan bread. It is important to set new farinographic and extensographic standards when using WB and WGWF, allowing for a correct correlation between rheology and quality characteristics of bakery products, as the same standards used for WF are not valid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abreads 3adough 3aextensibility 3afirmness 3ahardness 3arheology 3aviscosity 3awater content 3awheat bran 3awhole wheat flour1 aJaekel, Leandra Zafalon1 aPatricio, Stella Maris Cardoso1 aSteel, Caroline Joy1 aChang, Yoon Kil0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2012 Oct., v. 47, no. 10 p.2141-2150dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2012.03081.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014300168300001400311520168100325592002802006653001402034653001402048653001802062653003702080653001202117653002502129700001202154700002202166700001802188773008502206856008202291852000902373655001202382IND60561569520221118003448.0170118e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056156952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apmt.2015.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKattan, Nessrin10aCrystal structure and defects visualization of Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles employing transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction  ap. 52-59.  aA detailed analysis of the structure of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystals synthesized by hot-injection in the presence of oleylamine is provided employing high resolution TEM, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED). The nanostructures were investigated as-grown and after vacuum thermal treatment at 550°C. As-grown materials consisted of polycrystalline particles with an average size of 7±3nm, which grow an average size of 53±13nm after the vacuum annealing step. This thermal treatment allows investigating the initial stages of high quality film growth required in photovoltaic devices. Sets of SAED and CBED patterns, where individual crystals after annealing were viewed down different prominent zone axes, enabled us to reveal the presence of weak reflections due to cation ordering, and confirm a tetragonal unit cell consistent with either the kesterite or stannite structure. We demonstrate how these approaches enable to distinguish CZTS from secondary phases such as ZnS. Structure defects of partially annealed CZTS crystals were also investigated using bright and dark field images taken in 2-beam diffraction conditions as well as by high resolution lattice imaging. The material exhibited dislocations, along with lamellar twins and stacking faults characterized by local hexagonal structure on {112} planes. High resolution TEM images showed preferential growth on {112} planes during vacuum annealing, which is consistent with X-ray diffraction patterns. These studies provide key information on nanoscale crystal defects which may have important consequence on the performance of CZTS photovoltaic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCu2ZnSnS4 0aKesterite 0aNanoparticles 0aTransmission electron microscopy 0aDefects 0aElectron diffraction1 aHou, Bo1 aFermín, David J.1 aCherns, David0 tApplied Materials Today.g2015 Nov., v. 1 p.52-59dElsevier Ltdx2352-94077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2015.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013500173300002000308500001900328520108800347592002801435650002501463650003501488650001301523650001101536650001001547650002101557650001901578650001501597650001501612650000901627650002701636650002001663650001401683700005201697700001501749700005301764773012201817856008701939852000902026655001202035IND60720761620221118231046.0201217e20201203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072076162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c032342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chunquan10aDesign and Fabrication of Anionic/Cationic Surfactant Foams Stabilized by Lignin–Cellulose Nanofibrils for Enhanced Oil Recovery  ap. 16493-16501.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt has been decades since foams were adapted in further developing water-flooded oilfields. Foam stability is regarded as the governing factor that directly determines the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) efficiency of a foam injection. In this paper, we focus on a series of anionic surfactant-based foaming agent [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)] and non-ionic surfactant-based foaming agent [alkyl polyglycoside (APG)] stabilized by lignin–cellulose nanofibrils (LCNFs), in the absence or presence of a cationic surfactant [hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)]. Particular attention was placed on the proportion of LCNFs/SDS/CTAB and LCNFs/APG/CTAB as well as their synergism assessment, including foamability, drainage half-time, foam decay, surface tension, and micromorphology. Our results demonstrate that the synergism between cationic/anionic surfactants and LCNFs retarded film drainage and, thus, produced robust foams. The synergism mechanism, contributed to the electrostatic reaction and hydrogen bond between LCNFs and the surfactants, has been discussed and proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adrainage 3aenergy 3afoams 3ahydrogen bonding 3amicrostructure 3ananofibers 3aoil fields 3aoils 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurface tension 3asynergism1 aXue, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0594-76451 aHuang, Dan1 aWei, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7075-82100 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Dec. 03, v. 34, no. 12 p.16493-16501dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c032343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01774naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011400165300001400279520072000293592002801013653001801041653003401059653002601093653002801119653002501147700001801172700002101190700001301211700001901224700001701243773008501260856008201345852000901427655001201436IND60561569620221118003609.0170118e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056156962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apmt.2015.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, M.U.10aHighly efficient PLEDs based on poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) and Super Yellow blend with Cs2CO3 modified cathode  ap. 45-51.  aPolymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs) based on the blend of 90% poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (F8) and 10% Super Yellow (SY) were used as the emissive layer and it exhibited high luminous efficiency up to ∼27cdA−1.

The age of white pupa was assumed to be 0 h and the process of metamorphosis was monitored, onward between 6 and 96 h at 25°C. The profiles in the neuropil showed degeneration at 6 h and its extent increased by 12 h. The presence of glycogen in some of these profiles indicated their larval character. Between 12–18 h, the neuronal profiles became separated from one another, the intervening space was filled with extracellular fluid, and some of the larval synapses degenerated. Synaptic vesicles started reappearing around 18 h and synapses were detectable by 24 h. Neuronal processes compactly filled the neuropil by 65 h and the maturation of synapses continued until 86 h. The degeneration of profiles in the neuropil was found to be bimodal, peaking at 12 and 42 h, and that of cortical cells was unimodal with a peak at 42 h. The number of neuronal profiles increased with the development time, indicating that more branching of neuronal profiles occurs in neuropils as the metamorphosis progresses. Average number of synapses per unit area (or volume) is minimum at 18 h and maximum at 72 h, when the average number of synapse per axon profile is 0.54. Because 2 axon profiles share one synapse, a value close to 0.5 for monad synapses shows that, on an average, each axon profile at least makes one synapse at this stage of development. Subsequently, there is more than 75% of reduction in the number of synapses during 73 and 78 h.In muscles, vacuoles suggesting histolysis appeared by 6 h. Their ultrastructure became deranged between 12–18 h and myoblasts were found to be present since 8 h. Except for a few muscles in the thorax, such as larval oblique muscles and pharyngeal muscles, most of the muscles in the head and thorax lost all the ultrastructural details and histolyzed by 18 h. Around 38 h, imaginai muscles were detectable, and well-developed muscles were found by 55 h. However, myofibrils continued to be added laterally to the preformed muscles even at 96 h.Electron-dense mitochondria (EDMITs) were found in the neuropil, cortex and muscles of pupa, along with mitochondria of characteristic shape and normal appearance. These EDMITs often occurred in large clusters of more than 100, at times near the surface of the tissue. A few of these were enclosed in vacuoles and were darker than the rest of the EDMITs and normal looking mitochondria. Histochemistry with diaminobenzidine showed the presence of cytochrome c and marker enzyme cytochrome oxidase, both in EDMITs and normal mitochondria. EDMITs were not found to be present in any tissue of the adultDrosophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophilidae 3aaxons 3acentral nervous system 3acortex 3acytochrome c 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aglycogen 3ahead 3ahistochemistry 3alarvae 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3amyoblasts 3amyofibrils 3apharynx 3apupae 3apupation 3asynaptic vesicles 3athorax 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3avacuoles1 aSingh, R.

Short-time response on soil biochemical properties  ap. 39-44.  aIn this paper we studied in the laboratory the bioremediation effects of an oxyfluorfen herbicide-polluted soil with and without three earthworms (Eisenia fetida, Lumbricus terrestris and Allolobophora molleri) and its influence on soil biochemical properties over 90 days. Glutathione-S-transferase activity (GST) and weight in earthworms were measured at four different incubation times (3, 15, 60 and 90 days). Cocoon numbers, average weight per cocoon and hatchlings per cocoon were measured 30 days after the oxyfluorfen exposure. Herbicide in soils and the earthworms was determined during the incubation period. To observe the effects of bioremediation of the contaminated soil, ATP, and urease, phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities were measured. Although the bioaccumulation factor of oxyfluorfen was 1.4- and 3.5-fold higher in A. molleri than for E. fetida and L. terrestris, respectively, compared to the unpolluted soils, the GST activity of A. molleri significantly decreased by 19% in soils polluted with oxyfluorfen, whereas for E. fetida and L. terrestris the GST activity significantly decreased by 23.3% and 34.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the earthworms’ weight, cocoon numbers, average weight per cocoon and hatchlings per cocoon showed a pronounced decrease among L. terrestris, E. fetida and A. molleri, respectively, in polluted soils. When the concentration of herbicide decreased, so did enzyme activity. This decrease inhibition was more pronounced in soils with A. molleri than E. fetida and L. terrestris. Of the three species tested, A. molleri appears to the best suited for bioremediation of oxyfluorfen-contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllolobophora molleri 3aEisenia fetida 3aLumbricus terrestris 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aarylsulfatase 3abioaccumulation factor 3abioremediation 3aearthworms 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione transferase 3aoxyfluorfen 3apolluted soils 3asoil biological properties 3aurease 0aOxyfluorfen 0aEisenia fetida 0aLumbricus terrestris 0aAllolobophora molleri 0aSoil remediation1 aGómez, Isidoro1 aFranco-Andreu, Luis1 aBenitez, Concepción0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Jan., v. 86 p.39-44dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.09.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245013300186300001800319520151200337592002801849650002101877650001001898650002501908650001201933650001101945650001101956650001601967650001501983650001201998650001002010700002102020700002202041700001902063700002002082773010002102856008102202852000902283655001202292IND60081839720221122003016.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008183972DNAL7 a250490522pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-014-4044-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuha, Lopamudra10aBehavioral and electrophysiological responses of Aedes albopictus to certain acids and alcohols present in human skin emanations  ap. 3781-3787.  aHuman skin emanations attract hungry female mosquitoes toward their host for blood feeding. In this study, we report the flight orientation and electroantennogram response of Aedes albopictus females to certain unsaturated acids and alcohols found in human skin. In the Y-tube olfactometer, odors of lactic acid and 2-methyl-3-pentanol attracted 54–65 % of Ae. albopictus females at all doses in a dose-dependent manner. However, at the highest dose (10⁻² g), the acids repelled 40–45 % females. Attractancy (ca. 62–68 %) at lower doses and repellency (ca. 30–45 %) at higher doses were recorded for 3-methyl-3-pentanol and 1-octen-3-ol, while 5-hexen-1-ol, cis-2-hexen-1-ol, and trans 2-hexen-1-ol odor repelled ca. 55–65 % of Ae. albopictus females at all doses. Antenna of female Ae. albopictus exhibited a dose-dependent EAG response up to 10⁻³ g of L-lactic acid, trans-2-methyl-2-pentenoic acid, 2-octenoic acid, trans-2-hexen-1-ol and 1-octen-3-ol stimulations; however, the highest dose (10⁻² g) caused a little decline in the EAG response. EAG response of 9–10-fold was elicited by lactic acid, 2-octenoic acid, trans-2-hexenoic acid, and 3-methyl-3-pentanol, while cis-2-hexen-1-ol and trans-2-methyl pentenoic acid elicited 1–5-fold responses compared to solvent control. A blend of attractive compounds could be utilized in odor-baited trap for surveillance and repellent molecules with suitable formulation could be used to reduce the biting menace of mosquitoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes albopictus 3ablood 3aelectroantennography 3afemales 3aflight 3ahumans 3alactic acid 3amonitoring 3aoctenol 3aodors1 aSeenivasagan, T.1 aIqbal, S.

The effects of temperatures of 10, 15 and 25 °C and humidity of 6% and 12.5% were tested against the larvae of Tenebrio molitor. The nematodes were tested in two concentrations of 50 nematodes and 500 nematodes per box. S. carpocapsae was generally significantly more efficient at the highest temperature (25 °C) than S. feltiae, especially at the lower concentration of 50 nematodes per box. S. feltiae recorded higher insect mortality at lower temperatures (15 °C and 10 °C). The virulence of both tested nematode species was low (0-26%) at 10 °C after 7 days, but in the case of S. feltiae increased to 66% after 14 days. The efficacy when tested with 6% moisture at 15 °C was low (4% for both nematode species) compared with 12.5% moisture, where after seven days it reached 54% for S. carpocapsae and 70% for S. feltiae, although generally, S. feltiae was more efficient under dry conditions than S. carpocapsae. Insect mortality inreased significantly after remoistening of the soil, especially with S. feltiae (500 nematodes per box) where mortality reached 46% two weeks after remoistening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3aTenebrio molitor 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3ahumidity 3ainsects 3alarvae 3amortality 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3avirulence 0aSteinernema carpocapsae 0aSteinernema feltiae 0aefficacy 0asoil conditions 0aTenebrio molitor1 aTrnka, Susanna,0 tJournal of agrobiology.g2010 Aug. 9, v. 27, no. 1 p.1-7dVersitax1804-26867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10146-009-0001-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011400172300001400286520085900300592002801159650001601187650003001203650001801233650002101251650001501272650001401287650001001301650001301311650002201324650003601346650001101382650001101393653003001404653002901434653001601463653002201479653004501501700001301546700001701559700002501576700001801601700001801619773009401637856008501731852000901816655001201825IND60544329520221119192731.0190415e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054432952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2013.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTirichine, Leïla10aHistone extraction protocol from the two model diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana  ap. 21-25.  aPost-translational modifications of histones affect many biological processes by influencing higher order chromatin structure that affects gene and genome regulation. It is therefore important to develop methods for extracting histones while maintaining their native post-translational modifications. While histone extraction protocols have been developed in multicellular and single celled organisms such as yeast and Arabidopsis, they are inefficient in diatoms that have a silica cell wall that is likely to hinder histone extraction. We report in this work a rapid and reliable method for extraction of large amounts of high quality histones from the two model diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana. The protocol is an important enabling step permitting downstream applications such as western blotting and mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aThalassiosira 3aWestern blotting 3acell walls 3achromatin 3agenes 3ahistones 3amass spectrometry 3apost-translational modification 3asilica 3ayeasts 0aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 0aThalassiosira pseudonana 0aEpigenetics 0aMass spectrometry 0aPost-translational histone modifications1 aLin, Xin1 aThomas, Yann1 aLombard, Bérangère1 aLoew, Damarys1 aBowler, Chris0 tMarine genomics.g2014 Feb., v. 13 p.21-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12137x1874-77877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margen.2013.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01166naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245005400134300001600188520048300204592002800687650002500715650002500740650001100765650001500776773012400791852000900915655001200924IND60312845020221122223733.0150714e20140523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031284502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHvistendahl, Mara10aWhile emerging economies boom, equality goes bust  ap. 832-835.  aLongitudinal surveys, better cross-sectional data, and renewed attention from scholars have exposed extraordinarily high levels of inequality in developing countries.

In the absence of management, rich fen flora are displaced as a result of succession. This leads to an increase in competitive species and subsequent biomass accumulation. In order to reverse this trajectory and increase species richness, management consisting of a single mowing event was employed. Mowing was conducted in two degraded fen communities in north-west Wales (U.K.) across three sites: (i) a species rich, tussock alkaline mire, dominated by Schoenus nigricans and Juncus subnodulosus (SN community) and (ii) a species poor basin mire Cladio-Molinietum dominated by Cladium mariscus (CM community). The early vegetation responses were monitored over two years. Results show a large treatment effect on species richness in the CM community, where mean species richness increased by 51% in the second year following mowing. Consequently, total species number across all sites increased to 74 in the treatment compared to 44 in the control. Mowing reduced vegetation height and litter cover and increased bare ground. These treatment effects combined with a reduction in graminoid and shrub cover collectively contributed to the initial stages of rehabilitation. Conversely, the SN community showed no increase in species richness, in spite of a reduction in litter cover and increased bare ground. Strong site heterogeneity and a sustained canopy height caused by rapid re-growth of the dominant graminoid S. nigricans may have impeded treatment effects. Therefore, increased mowing frequency in alternate years, switching between autumn and summer would be necessary to develop species richness in the SN community. Ongoing intervention in each fen community is needed to achieve an optimal trajectory of increased rich fen and reduction of secondary succession species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladium mariscus 3aJuncus 3aautumn 3abasins 3abiomass production 3acanopy 3afens 3aflora 3agraminoids 3agrazing 3amowing 3aplant communities 3asecondary succession 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3avegetation 3awetland plants 3aWales 0aRich fens 0aMowing 0aCladium mariscus 0aSchoenus nigricans 0aWetland restoration 0aWetland management 0aEcological restoration 0aPlant ecology 0aPlant succession1 aFenner, N.1 aPullin, A.S.1 aJones, P.S.1 aGuest, J.1 aJones, L.0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Jan., v. 86 p.210-222dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.09.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245007900172300001800251520125900269592002801528650001201556650001401568650001201582650002501594650002001619650001501639650001501654650002101669650002001690650001301710650001101723700001601734700001601750773009501766856008601861852000901947655001201956IND4462214020221120031821.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446221402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, Kimberley14aThe mechanism of fiber cutting during enzymatic hydrolysis of wood biomass  ap. 3943-3950.  aThe relationship between fiber dislocations and fiber cutting during the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignin-free fibers was investigated. Dislocations are morphological changes in the microfibril direction of cellulose. It was hypothesized that enzymatic activity is concentrated at dislocation sites, resulting in fiber cutting. Bleached softwood kraft pulp was analyzed during enzymatic hydrolysis (Novozynme 188 and Celluclast 1.5L) to confirm fiber cutting and explore its relationship with dislocation sites via microscopy, fiber length, and sugar determination. Results reveal that fibers were quickly cut through during enzymatic hydrolysis, resulting in shorter fiber fragments during the initial 60% of hydrolysis. Polarized light microscopy images show a relationship between dislocations and fiber cutting during enzymatic hydrolysis. Images show fibers partially cut at dislocation sites, and that there are no dislocations on cut fibers after 6h hydrolysis. PLM and FQA data revealed that there were about seven major dislocations per fiber and each fiber was cut through about 6, and 10 times after 4 and 6h of enzymatic hydrolysis, respectively. In combination, this data strongly implicates dislocation sites as the location of fiber cutting.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acellulose 3acutting 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrolysis 3akraft pulp 3alight microscopy 3apolarized light 3asoftwood 3asugars1 aLi, Xinping1 aLi, Kecheng0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2011 Oct., v. 35, no. 9 p.3943-3950dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016700165300001600332520238000348592002802728650001102756650002602767650001602793650002102809650001102830650001702841650002402858651001002882700001802892700002002910700002402930773010302954856004803057852000903105655001203114IND50062141120221120082008.0130321e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006214112DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-012-1779-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaiti, Saumen10aDelineation of shallow resistivity structure around Malvan, Konkan region, Maharashtra by neural network inversion using vertical electrical sounding measurements  ap. 779-794.  aModeling resistivity profiles, especially from hard rock areas, is of specific relevance for groundwater exploration. A method based on Bayesian neural network (BNN) theory using a Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulation scheme is applied to model and interpret direct current vertical electrical sounding measurements from 28 locations around the Malvan region, in the Sindhudurg district, southwest India. The modeling procedure revolves around optimizing the objective function using the HMC based sampling technique which is followed by updating each trajectory by integrating the Hamiltonian differential equations via a second order leapfrog discretization scheme. The inversion results suggest a high resistivity structure in the north-western part of the area, which correlates well with the presence of laterites. In the south-western part, a very high conductive zone is observed near the coast indicating an extensive influence of saltwater intrusion. Our results also show that the effect of intrusion of saline water diminishes from the south-western part to the north-eastern part of the region. Two dimensional modeling of four resistivity profiles shows that the groundwater flow is partly controlled by existing lineaments, fractures, and major joints. Groundwater occurs at a weathered/semi-weathered layer of laterite/clayey sand and the interface of overburden and crystalline basement. The presence of conduits is identified at a depth between 10 and 15 m along the Dhamapur–Kudal and Parule–Oros profiles, which seems to be potential zone for groundwater exploration. The NW–SE trending major lineaments and its criss-cross sections are indentified from the apparent and true resistivity surface map. The pseudo-section at different depths in the western part of the area, near Parule, shows extensive influence of saltwater intrusion and its impact reaching up to a depth of 50 m from the surface along the coastal area. Further, the deduced true electrical resistivity section against depth correlates well with available borehole lithology in the area. Present analyses suggest that HMC-based BNN method is robust for modeling resistivity data especially in hard rock terrains. These results are useful for interpreting fractures, major joints, and lineaments and crystalline basement rock and also for constraining the higher dimensional models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aelectrical resistance 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3asaline water 3asaltwater intrusion 3aIndia1 aGupta, Gautam1 aErram, Vinit C.1 aTiwari, Ram Krishna0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2013 Feb., v. 68, no. 3 p.779-794dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-012-1779-8  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245004800166300001600214500001100230520072900241592002800970650002500998650001301023650002201036650002001058650002001078650001101098650002201109650002101131650002501152650002001177650003401197650002101231650000901252650001201261650003301273773011501306856007401421852000901495655001201504IND60642827220221118042442.0190508e199909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064282722DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029412532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasbekar, Durgadas P.10aAscribing functions to the lamin B receptor  ap. 401-408.  aReview  aThis article reviews the research on the inner nuclear membrane protein lamin B receptor (LBR).

The results support that n-ZnO MW/p-Si film PDs have potential application in the field of UV-visible detection and might be used as elements for powering low-energy micro/nanosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3alight intensity 3ananotechnology 3asilicon 3avapors 3azinc oxide1 aYan, Xiaoqin1 aChen, Xiang1 aCui, Yan1 aLin, Pei1 aShen, Yanwei1 aZhang, Yue0 tRSC advances.g2013 Sept. 17, v. 3, no. 39 p.17682-17688dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra41713a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01304naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245003100165300001600196520048200212592002800694650002200722650002200744651001100766651001800777700001900795773012400814856007900938852000901017655001201026IND60312845220221122223817.0150714e20140523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031284522DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12519362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiketty, Thomas10aInequality in the long run  ap. 838-843.  aThis Review presents basic facts regarding the long-run evolution of income and wealth inequality in Europe and the United States.

An increase in the frequency of the most common culling category - category 58 (other health reasons) - was identified in both the Holstein and Czech Fleckvieh breeds between 2000 and 2007: from 35% to 59% in the Holstein cows and from 19% to 41% in the Czech Fleckvieh cows (X² test; P<0.001). This brought the Czech Fleckvieh cows to the same level of frequency as in the Czech Republic population, while the frequency among Holstein cows was on average 11% higher than in the Czech Republic population. The frequency of category 58 was higher in the Holstein than in the Czech Fleckvieh cows, but category 52 (low milk production) was more frequent in the Czech Fleckvieh than in the Holstein cows (P<0.001). There is a link between category 58 ‘other health reasons’ and an increase in the milk productivity of the cows; this results eventually in a higher incidence of metabolic disorders and is discussed in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aSimmental 3adairy cows 3afarms 3ametabolic diseases 3amilk 3amilk production 3amountains 3aCzech Republic 0areasons for culling 0aHolstein 0aCzech Fleckvieh 0alow-input farm1 aŠlachta, Martin1 aKobes, Milan0 tJournal of agrobiology.g2010 Aug. 9, v. 27, no. 1 p.41-48dVersitax1804-26867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10146-009-0006-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245014400186300001400330520166800344592002802012650001002040650001202050650001302062650001202075650001202087650001302099650001602112650001202128650002002140650001502160650001902175650003302194650001202227650003402239650006402273650002102337650001702358650001102375650004902386650004002435650004902475650002902524650003502553650003702588700001902625700001802644773009802662856004802760852000902808655001202817IND4484524220221120102657.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448452422DNAL7 a219721342pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-011-1245-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorrmann, Claudia10aTubulin potentiates the interaction of the metalloendopeptidase nardilysin with the neuronal scaffold protein p42IP4/centaurin-α1 (ADAP1)   ap. 89-98.  aWe found colocalization of the neuronal protein p42IP4 (centaurin-α1; ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology domain [ADAP1]), the metalloendopeptidase nardilysin (NRD; involved in axonal maturation and myelination) and tubulin in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. To examine the importance of tubulin for the interaction of NRD with p42IP4, we treated cells with nocodazole, which interferes with tubulin polymerization. Nocodazole did not affect the colocalization of p42IP4 and tubulin but caused a clear redistribution of the proteins in cells, so that the colocalization of p42IP4, tubulin and NRD was visible exclusively in multiple foci. To reveal the mechanism of the interaction between NRD, p42IP4 and tubulin observed in neuronal cells, we performed Far-Western blotting, a technique that directly detects protein-protein interactions on Western blots. This technique demonstrated that tubulin enhanced the binding of NRD to functionally renatured p42IP4. The mutation of a highly conserved cysteine residue in NRD to alanine abolished the potentiation by tubulin. NRD lacking the characteristic acidic domain was able to bind p42IP4 but addition of tubulin did not significantly potentiate the binding of this deletion mutant to p42IP4. A function-abolishing mutation of the Zn2+-binding motif of NRD did not affect the potentiation by tubulin. Thus, the capacity of tubulin to enhance the interaction between p42IP4 and NRD together with the known interaction of p42IP4 with F-actin support the novel notion that p42IP4 plays a possible role as a linker between the two networks, actin and tubulin, in neural cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aalanine 3acysteine 3acytosol 3amutants 3amutation 3amyelination 3aneurons 3aplasma membrane 3apleckstrin 3apolymerization 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atubulin 2aActinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aHEK293 Cells 2aHumans 2aMetalloendopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNerve Tissuexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNocodazolexpharmacology 2aTubulinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTubulin Modulatorsxpharmacology1 aStricker, Rolf1 aReiser, Georg0 tCell and tissue research.g2011 Oct., v. 346, no. 1 p.89-98dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-011-1245-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01812naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013800162300001600300520056400316592002800880650004300908650001400951650001600965650001900981650002201000650002101022650002101043650003401064650001101098650001701109650001901126650001901145650001301164700001801177700002101195773011501216856007401331852000901405655001201414IND60642827620221118042530.0190508e199909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064282762DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029412422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidya, C.

However, differences exist between trajectories generated from the model with different input datasets. In this study, backward trajectories in Hong Kong in the entire year of 2011 are derived by HYSPLIT model. Two sets of Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) output data associated with different horizontal and vertical resolutions (GDAS1 and GDAS0P5) are used as drivers in an attempt to quantify the differences between the results and discover the underlying reasons responsible for discrepancy. The results reveal that the significant differences between back trajectories generated from the two GDAS datasets can be mainly attributed to different vertical velocity calculation methods due to the absence of vertical velocity in GDAS0P5 dataset. The HYSPLIT trajectories are also sensitive to the horizontal and vertical resolutions of the input meteorological data, but to lesser extents. Results of cluster analysis indicate that when the air mass is from the north, northeast, or west with a long-to-medium range, the HYSPLIT backward trajectories are sensitive to the vertical advection calculation method and data resolution, whereas when the air mass is from the south or southwest with a long range, the trajectories are more likely to remain unchanged with the shifting of vertical velocity or data resolution. By comparing the vertical velocities with the observations and the performance in retrieving PM contributions from different directions, we conclude that GDAS1 dataset is more plausible in backward trajectory analysis in the Pearl River Delta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aair 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3afate and transport models 3ameteorological data 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3aChina 0aHYSPLIT 0aGDAS 0aBackward trajectory 0aVertical velocity 0aHong Kong1 aYuan, Zibing1 aFung, Jimmy C.H.1 aLau, Alexis K.H.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 506-507 p.527-537dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.11.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011000175300001600285520110900301592002801410650001901438650001101457650001801468650002001486650002101506650001001527650001401537650002301551650001801574650001401592650001101606650001301617650002001630653002101650653002701671653002101698653001301719653001901732653001701751653002501768700001401793700002001807700002001827700002301847700001801870700001801888700002401906700002101930773010901951856008802060852000902148655001202157IND60565737320221117071010.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056573732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaddad, Samuel P.10aOntogenetic dietary shifts and bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine in Mugil cephalus from an urban estuary  ap. 155-162.  aThough bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals has received attention in inland waters, studies of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine systems are limited. Further, an understanding of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation across size classes of organisms displaying ontogenetic feeding shifts is lacking. We selected the striped mullet, Mugil cephalus, a euryhaline and eurythermal species that experiences dietary shifts with age, to identify whether a model base, diphenhydramine, accumulated in a tidally influenced urban bayou. We further determined whether diphenhydramine accumulation differed among size classes of striped mullet over a two year study period. Stable isotope analysis identified that ontogenetic feeding shifts of M. cephalus occurred from juveniles to adults. However, bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine did not significantly increase across age classes of M. cephalus but corresponded to surface water levels of the pharmaceutical, which suggests inhalational uptake to diphenhydramine was more important for bioaccumulation than dietary exposure in this urban estuary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMugil cephalus 3aadults 3aage structure 3abioaccumulation 3adietary exposure 3adrugs 3aestuaries 3aeuryhaline species 3ainland waters 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aontogeny 3astable isotopes 0aUrban ecosystems 0aBioaccumulation factor 0aBioconcentration 0aEffluent 0aStriped mullet 0aUrbanization 0aEstuaries and coasts1 aDu, Bowen1 aScott, W.

Successful breeding of long-term resistant varieties requires widening of the genetic base of resistance, preferably by pyramiding of resistance genes. One of the perspective resistance genes is rym 11, resistant to all strains of Barley Mosaic Virus complex, but which is known to be present only in the cultivar Russia 57. In this work, the identification of potential new rym 11 resistance donors on the basis of haplotype analysis of the SSRs surrounding rym 11 locus is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acultivars 3agenes 3agenetic background 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant protection 3aviruses 3awinter barley 3aRussia 0abarley 0aBaYMV 0aBaMMV 0aresistance 0arym 111 aMařík, Pavel0 tJournal of agrobiology.g2011 Feb. 3, v. 27, no. 2 p.67-72dVersitax1804-26867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10146-009-0010-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04307naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001600188245013600204300001600340500001500356506007600371520239600447592002802843506003702871650001502908650002302923650001402946650001002960650001202970650002802982650001503010650001503025650002203040650001603062650002003078650001203098650005203110650002003162650001503182650001103197650000903208650001503217650002403232650002903256650001603285651001103301651001103312653002003323700002703343700002703370700002303397700003003420700002003450700002103470773008803491856008103579852000903660655001203669IND60080188820221207122301.0151029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008018882DNAL7 aPMC41039992pmcid7 a246044282pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-014-0390-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBajer, Anna10aLong-Term Spatiotemporal Stability and Dynamic Changes in the Haemoparasite Community of Bank Voles (Myodes glareolus) in NE Poland  ap. 196-211.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLong-term field studies on parasite communities are rare but provide a powerful insight into the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping host–parasite interactions. The aim of our study was to identify the principal factors regulating long-term trends in the haemoparasite communities of bank voles, and to this end, we sampled three semi-isolated populations of bank voles (n = 880) in 1999, 2002, 2006 and 2010 in the Mazury lake district region of NE Poland. Overall, 90.8 % of the bank voles harboured at least one of the species of haemoparasites studied. Whilst overall prevalence (all species combined) did not vary significantly between the surveys, different temporal changes were detected among voles in each of the three sites. In voles from Urwitałt, prevalence increased consistently with successive surveys, whereas in Tałty, the peak years were 2002 and 2006, and in Pilchy, prevalence oscillated without a clear pattern. Across the study, bank voles harboured a mean of 1.75 ± 0.034 haemoparasite species, and species richness remained stable with no significant between-year fluctuations or trends. However, each of the five constituent species/genera showed a different pattern of spatio-temporal changes. The overall prevalence of Babesia microti was 4.9 %, but this varied significantly between years peaking in 2006 and declining again by 2010. For Bartonella spp., overall prevalence was 38.7 %, and this varied with year of study, but the temporal pattern of changes differed among the three sites. The overall prevalence of Haemobartonella (Mycoplasma) was 68.3 % with an increase in prevalence with year of study in all three sites. Hepatozoon erhardovae had an overall prevalence of 46.8 % but showed a marked reduction with each successive year of the study, and this was consistent in all three sites. The overall prevalence of Trypanosoma evotomys was 15.4 % varying significantly between sites, but showing temporal stability. While overall prevalence of all haemoparasites combined and species richness remained stable over the period of study, among the five haemoparasites, the pattern of spatiotemporal changes in prevalence and abundance of infections differed depending on parasite species. For some genera, host age was shown to play an important role, but a significant effect of host sex was found only for Haemobartonella spp.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatozoon 3atemporal variation 3aparasites 3alakes 3asurveys 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3aBartonella 3aMycoplasma 3aspecies diversity 3aTrypanosoma 3aBabesia microti 2aAnimals 2aArvicolinaexbloodxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aBabesia microti 2aBartonella 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMycoplasma 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSpatio-Temporal Analysis 2aTrypanosoma 3aPoland 0aPoland 0aHaemobartonella1 aWelc-Falęciak, Renata1 aBednarska, Małgorzata1 aAlsarraf, Mohammed1 aBehnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta1 aSiński, Edward1 aBehnke, Jerzy M.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 68, no. 2 p.196-211dSpringer USx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-014-0390-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245011900162300001400281520147700295592002801772650002201800650002701822650002601849650001501875650001501890650001301905650001701918650003101935650002101966650002201987650001902009650002802028650002202056650001302078650001502091650001202106650001502118650004002133653001102173653003302184653002402217653002202241653002702263700001902290700002002309700001802329700001802347700001602365700002102381700001602402773009402418856008502512852000902597655001202606IND60544330520221118041348.0190415e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054433052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2013.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Bin10aCellular metabolic responses of the marine diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries associated with cell wall formation  ap. 29-38.  aIn this study a comparative proteomics approach involving a mass spectrometric analysis of synchronized cells was employed to investigate the cellular-level metabolic mechanisms associated with siliceous cell wall formation in the pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries. Cultures of P. multiseries were synchronized using the silicate limitation method. Approximately 75% of cells were arrested at the G2+M phase of the cell cycle after 48h of silicate starvation. The majority of cells progressed to new valve synthesis within 5h of silicon replenishment. We compared the proteome of P. multiseries at 0, 4, 5, and 6h of synchronization progress upon silicon replenishment using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Forty-eight differentially expressed protein spots were identified in abundance (greater than two-fold change; P<0.005), some of which are predicted to be involved in intracellular trafficking, cytoskeleton, photosynthesis, lipid metabolism, and protein biosynthesis. Cytoskeleton proteins and clathrin coat components were also hypothesized to play potential roles in cell wall formation. The proteomic profile analysis suggests that P. multiseries most likely employs multiple synergistic biochemical mechanisms for cell wall formation. These results improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying silicon cell wall formation and enhance our understanding of the important role played by diatoms in silicon biogeochemical cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3abiochemical mechanisms 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acell cycle 3acell walls 3aclathrin 3acytoskeleton 3agene expression regulation 3alipid metabolism 3amass spectrometry 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological transport 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asilicon 3astarvation 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0aDiatom 0aPseudo-nitzschia multiseries 0aCellular metabolism 0aBiosilicification 0aComparative proteomics1 aLuo, Chun-Shan1 aLiang, Jun-Rong1 aChen, Dan-Dan1 aZhuo, Wen-Hao1 aGao, Ya-Hui1 aChen, Chang-Ping1 aSong, Si-Si0 tMarine genomics.g2014 Aug., v. 16 p.29-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12137x1874-77877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margen.2013.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014700168300001400315520128900329592002801618650001301646650001401659650001801673650001601691650001201707650001101719650001801730650001001748650001001758650001301768650001801781650002301799650001101822650001101833653002501844653002301869653001701892653001601909653001801925653001201943700001701955700001901972773008901991856008102080852000902161655001202170IND60480318920221119101618.0160127e20110203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048031892DNAL7 a10.2478/s10146-009-0011-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠlachta, Martin10aFunction of coprophagous beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae, Hydrophilidae) in cattle pastures inferred from pitfall trapping data  ap. 85-91.  aAn analysis of data on the dry weight biomass of coprophagous beetles in standardized dung (4.5 l) was conducted in order to characterize the spatial and the seasonal distribution of the beetles' biomass in cattle pastures and to elucidate their function in dung decomposition. Nested Anova with factors of farm, site (nested in farm), seasonal period and year was used to evaluate the effect of these factors on the biomass of four functional species groups: the dung dwellers of Scarabaeidae (subfamily Aphodiinae), the dung dwellers of Hydrophilidae, the small tunnellers of Scarabaeidae (subfamily Coprinae) and the large tunnellers of Geotrupidae. The spatial variation of biomass (between the sites and the farms) was insignificant (P>0.05) in the two dung-dweller groups and in the large-tunnellers group. On the other hand, a significant (P<0.05) seasonal variation of biomass was found in all but the large tunneller group. In dung dwellers, the spring biomass was formed mainly by two species, Aphodius prodromus and A. sphacelatus. In summer, most of the biomass was accounted for by Sphaeridium lunatum, S. scarabaeoides and A. rufipes. In the two tunneller groups, Onthophagus fracticornis, Geotrupes stercorarius and G. spiniger formed a majority of the biomass in dung.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphodius 3aGeotrupes 3aHydrophilidae 3aOnthophagus 3abiomass 3acattle 3adata analysis 3afarms 3afeces 3apastures 3apitfall traps 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 0acoprophagous beetles 0adung decomposition 0aScarabaeidae 0aGeotrupidae 0aHydrophilidae 0apasture1 aFrelich, Jan1 aTonka, Tomáš0 tJournal of agrobiology.g2011 Feb. 3, v. 27, no. 2 p.85-91dVersitax1804-26867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10146-009-0011-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01598naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245012800173300002000301520059600321592002800917650001400945650001400959650002400973650002500997650001201022650001201034650001401046700001701060773012401077856007401201852000901275655001201284IND60664527020221118042539.0190912e20130812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066452702DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra41721b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, Sabbasani Rajasekhara12aA simple and efficient method for mild and selective oxidation of propargylic alcohols using TEMPO and calcium hypochlorite  ap. 14929-14933.  aOxidation of propargylic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes and ketones was achieved at room temperature using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) and calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl)₂).

Heavy metal concentrations of Pb and Zn in topsoil were very high, with a maximum value of 6189.53mg/kg and 16,046.72mg/kg, respectively. Investigations of metal accumulation in the screened plants indicated that metal accumulation in different plants varied by species, tissues and metals. Eight native plants under high combined Pb–Zn–As–Cd pollution conditions, including Calystegia hederacea Wall., Cirsium setosum (Willd.)MB., Cynanchum chinense R. Br., Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn., Humulus japonicas (Lour.) Merr., Kalimeris indica (L.) Sch.-Bip., Metaplexis japonica (Thunb.) Makino, and Taraxacum mongolicum Hand.-Mazz, were tested and recognized as Pb hyperaccumulators according to a standard of greater than or equal to 1000mgPb/kgDW in plant aerial parts. Native Pb hyperaccumulators could accumulate substantially higher As–Cd–Zn concentrations than other plants. The bioconcentration factor of Pharbitis nil (L.) Choisy was much lower than 1, indicating that it was an excluder of heavy metals, especially for As and Pb. Obtained results were particularly useful for soil remediation technologists in providing information to identify native hyperaccumulators, and conducting the reclamation of sites affected by metallurgical slag in northern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalystegia 3aCirsium arvense 3aIpomoea nil 3aTaraxacum mongolicum 3aaerial parts 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3ahyperaccumulators 3aindigenous species 3alead 3apollution 3arural areas 3aslags 3asoil remediation 3atissues 3atopsoil 3azinc 3aChina 0aHeavy metals 0aHyperaccumulator 0aContaminated soils 0aMetallurgy waste site 0aPhytodiversity1 aChen, Jiajun1 aWang, Xingwei1 aLv, Ce0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Jan., v. 86 p.60-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245011200208300001400320506007600334520122000410592002801630506003701658650001501695650001001710650001201720650001201732650002601744650001701770650002101787650001301808650000901821653000901830653000901839653001701848653003301865653001201898653001001910653000801920653001201928653000901940653000901949653000801958653000801966653000801974653000901982653000901991653001002000700001902010700001702029700001802046700001602064700002102080700001502101700002002116700001502136773012202151856008102273852000902354655001202363IND60602185420221207140336.0180709e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060218542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2015.10.0122doi7 aPMC48821572pmcid7 a264980312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzarashvili, T.10aCombined effect of G3139 and TSPO ligands on Ca2+-induced permeability transition in rat brain mitochondria  ap. 70-77.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPermeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane is determined by the activity of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) which are regulated by many factors and proteins. One of the main partner-regulator of VDAC is the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), whose role in the regulation of membrane permeability is not completely understood. We show that TSPO ligands, 1 μM PPIX and PK11195 at concentrations of 50 μM, accelerate opening of permeability transition pores (mPTP) in Ca²⁺-overloaded rat brain mitochondria (RBM). By contrast, PK11195 at 100 nM and anti-TSPO antibodies suppressed pore opening. Participation of VDAC in these processes was demonstrated by blocking VDAC with G3139, an 18-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, which sensitized mitochondria to Ca²⁺-induced mPTP opening. Despite the inhibitory effect of 100 nM PK11195 and anti-TSPO antibodies alone, their combination with G3139 considerably stimulated the mPTP opening. Thus, 100 nM PK11195 and anti-TSPO antibody can modify permeability of the VDAC channel and mPTP. When VDAC channels are closed and TSPO is blocked, permeability of the VDAC for calcium seems to be the highest, which leads to accelerated pore opening.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3abrain 3acalcium 3aligands 3amembrane permeability 3amitochondria 3aoligonucleotides 3aproteins 3arats 0aVDAC 0aTSPO 0aMitochondria 0aPermeability transition pore 0aPK11195 0aG3139 0aANT 0aPK11195 0aPPIX 0amPTP 0aRBM 0aROS 0aTPP 0aTSPO 0aVDAC 0aΔΨm1 aKrestinina, O.1 aBaburina, Yu1 aOdinokova, I.1 aGrachev, D.1 aPapadopoulos, V.1 aAkatov, V.1 aLemasters, J.J.1 aReiser, G.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 587 p.70-77dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002800146245009300174300001600267520154600283592002801829650002301857650001101880650001401891650002301905650001201928650002501940650001701965650001601982650001201998650001302010650001602023650002602039650001902065650001302084650002302097650001502120700002902135700002102164700001602185700001902201773012902220856008202349852000902431655001202440IND4461720320221120061909.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446172032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2011.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSulaiman, Shaida Fariza10aEffect of solvents in extracting polyphenols and antioxidants of selected raw vegetables  ap. 506-515.  aThirty-seven raw vegetables were extracted using four solvent systems: 70% acetone, 70% ethanol, 70% methanol, and distilled water. The extracts were tested for their total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and antioxidant activities (using diphenylpicryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays). The results revealed the effect of different extracting solvents in altering the quantitative analyses of all vegetables and 70% acetone was identified as the most efficient solvent for extracting polyphenolic antioxidants from the vegetables. The highest total phenolic content and total flavonoid content were obtained from 70% acetone extract of Portulaca oleracea (138.2±2.1mg GAE/g dw basis) and 70% methanol extract of Cosmos caudatus (27.7±1.0mg QE/g dw basis), respectively. The 70% acetone extract of Etlingera elatior with moderate amount of total phenolic content exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in both assays. The correlation analyses within 37 different extracts of each solvent extraction demonstrated weak to moderate relationships between all the studied parameters. The highest r value of 0.7139 (p<0.001) was determined between total phenolic contents and FRAP values of the 70% methanol extracts. Meanwhile, a wide range of correlation coefficients was derived from correlation analyses within four different extracts of each vegetable, with the highest relationship between total phenolic contents and FRAP values for the extracts of Coriandrum sativum (r=0.9998, p<0.001).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aCosmos 3aEtlingera 3aPortulaca oleracea 3aacetone 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acorrelation 3aethanol 3amethanol 3apolyphenols 3aquantitative analysis 3araw vegetables 3asolvents 3avegetable extracts 3avegetables1 aSajak, Azliana Abu Bakar1 aOoi, Kheng Leong1 aSupriatno, 1 aSeow, Eng Meng0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2011 , v. 24, no. 4-5 p.506-515dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2011.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01594naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006900167300001400236520059200250592002800842650001500870650001700885650002100902650002600923650001700949653002500966653001500991653003901006653002001045653002501065773010601090856005101196852000901247655001201256IND50075866720221122034924.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007586672DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2010.5336662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarı, Aynur10aPhenolic compounds from Scorzonera latifolia (Fisch. & Mey.)

The objective of this study was to investigate the kinetics of CaCO3 precipitation in an anaerobic digestion process integrated with a silicate mineral (wollastonite).The first series of experiments studied the precipitation kinetics during the methanogenic phase by addition of calciumacetate to anaerobic batch reactors. CaCO3 precipitation initiated when the ion activity product of Ca2+ and CO32− exceeded calcium carbonate monohydrate solubility product (Ksp of 5.7×10−8 at 35°C). Addition of calcite seed crystal at the start of the experiment showed that the precipitation could be initiated earlier by reducing the induction period. In these experiments, precipitation of CO2 in the form of CaCO3 showed an 52% increase in CH4 content of the biogas (71±0.5% v/v CH4) compared to that of the control experiment fed with sodium acetate (53±0.5% v/v CH4).In the second set of experiments, single-stage anaerobic batch digestions with 25g/l wollastonite (63–125μm) at two different substrate concentrations (5.5g/l and 17.5g/l insoluble starch) were studied. In these experiments the main processes of wollastonite dissolution and calcite precipitation occurred, however the limited separation of fermentation and methanogenesis phases resulted in a limited increase in methane content of the biogas. Although the precipitation was observed at lower supersaturation, the crystal growth followed the same pattern as in previous experiments with calcium acetate. In both sets of experiments, a self-regulating pH could be achieved in the system as the result of the presence of wollastonite which caused the pH to remain in the range of 5.7–7.9. Obtaining an improved biogas and a self-regulated pH in a digester contribute to the advantages of CO2 sequestration by means of silicate minerals in anaerobic digestion systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiofertilizers 3abiogas 3acalcite 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium silicate 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3afermentation 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aneutralization 3apH 3asilicate minerals 3asodium acetate 3asolubility 3astarch 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aSilicate minerals 0aMineral carbonation 0aBiogas 0aCalcium carbonate precipitation 0aBiobased products 0aWollastonite1 aBozkurt, O.D.1 avan Turnhout, A.G.1 aKleerebezem, R.1 avan Loosdrecht, M.C.M.0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Jan., v. 86 p.105-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012400165300001800289500001900307520153800326592002801864650002001892650001401912650002401926650002001950650002101970650001001991650001402001650001502015650002202030650001302052650002002065650001602085650002102101650001202122650001502134700001902149700001902168700002002187700001302207700002502220700001902245700001702264700001402281700001902295773013602314856004802450852000902498655001202507IND6036780020221120062904.0210726e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603678002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-0829-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPires, J.

GAs were applied to define the activation function in hidden layer and the number of hidden neurons. METHODS: Two of the methodologies define threshold models, which assume that the behaviour of the dependent variable (O3 concentrations) changes when it enters in a different regime (two and four regimes were considered in this study). The change from one regime to another depends on a specific value (threshold value) of an explanatory variable (threshold variable), which is also defined by GAs. The predictor variables were the hourly average concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and O3 (recorded in the previous day at an urban site with traffic influence) and also meteorological data (hourly averages of temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity and wind speed). The study was performed for the period from May to August 2004. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Several models were achieved and only the best model of each methodology was analysed. In threshold models, the variables selected by GAs to define the O3 regimes were temperature, CO and NO2 concentrations, due to their importance in O3 chemistry in an urban atmosphere. CONCLUSION: In the prediction of O3 concentrations, the threshold model that considers two regimes was the one that fitted the data most efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3achemistry 3ameteorological data 3aneural networks 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3apollution 3aprediction 3arelative humidity 3aresearch 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3athreshold models 3atraffic 3awind speed1 aGonçalves, B.1 aAzevedo, F.

In this study organic-inorganic hybrid sols were synthesized through hydrolysis and condensation of 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane (GPTMS), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TIP) in acidic solution. Chitosan was doped into sol-gel matrix and self-assembled over aluminum substrate. The resultant chitosan-doped-Hy/nano-TiO2 sol-gel coating was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analyses. The as-tailored aluminum substrate was evaluated for corrosion resistance in neutral medium. The protection ability of these coatings was evaluated by electrochemical impedance studies (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PP) measurements in 3.5% NaCl medium. The EIS and PP results showed that chitosan-doped- Hy/nano-TiO2 sol-gel coating exhibited better protection from corrosion than the undoped Hy/TiO2 nanocomposite coating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3atitanium 3acoatings 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3acorrosion 3aatomic force microscopy 3ananocomposites 3asilane 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aelectrochemistry 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aaluminum 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3ahydrolysis 3asodium chloride 3aRaman spectroscopy 0aCorrosion 0aSol-Gel 0aimpedance 0aHybrid 0aTiO2 0aChitosan1 aM.G., Sethuraman0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.03.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245009700191300001600288520120500304592002801509650001801537650001101555650001901566650001001585650001701595650001101612650001401623650001401637650001201651650002701663650003101690650002701721650002401748650004401772650002601816650001601842650002601858650001401884651001401898700002101912700002001933700002201953700002001975700001901995773008802014856008102102852000902183655001202192IND60080189220221120075628.0151029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008018922DNAL7 a246192332pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-014-0397-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaragoza, William J.10aOutcomes of Infections of Sea Anemone Aiptasia pallida with Vibrio spp. Pathogenic to Corals  ap. 388-396.  aIncidents of coral disease are on the rise. However, in the absence of a surrogate animal host, understanding of the interactions between coral pathogens and their hosts remains relatively limited, compared to other pathosystems of similar global importance. A tropical sea anemone, Aiptasia pallida, has been investigated as a surrogate model to study certain aspects of coral biology. Therefore, to test whether the utility of this surrogate model can be extended to study coral diseases, in the present study, we tested its susceptibility to common coral pathogens (Vibrio coralliilyticus and Vibrio shiloi) as well as polymicrobial consortia recovered from the Caribbean Yellow Band Disease (CYBD) lesions. A. pallida was susceptible to each of the tested pathogens. A. pallida responded to the pathogens with darkening of the tissues (associated with an increased melanization) and retraction of tentacles, followed by complete disintegration of polyp tissues. Loss of zooxanthellae was not observed; however, the disease progression pattern is consistent with the behavior of necrotizing pathogens. Virulence of some coral pathogens in Aiptasia was paralleled with their glycosidase activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio shiloi 3acorals 3adisease course 3ahosts 3amelanization 3amodels 3apathogens 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoaxmicrobiology 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aMelaninsxbiosynthesis 2aMicrobial Consortia 2aSea Anemonesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aStress, Physiological 2aTemperature 2aVibrioxpathogenicity 2aVirulence 3aCaribbean1 aKrediet, Cory J.1 aMeyer, Julie L.1 aCañas, Gabriela,1 aRitchie, Kim B.1 aTeplitski, Max0 tMicrobial ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 68, no. 2 p.388-396dSpringer USx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-014-0397-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009300156300001600249520093700265592002801202650001001230650001601240650001101256650001901267650001101286650002701297650001301324650001201337650002701349700002201376700001501398700001401413700002101427773011401448856007401562852000901636655001201645IND60642828320221118042520.0190508e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064282832DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029426592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, K.

Glial tumours arise from the supporting cells of the brain. They have a poor outcome and often recur. The present study was undertaken to compare the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of p53 gene in pairs of primary and recurrent gliomas and to try and correlate it to the degree of malignancy and recurrence interval. LOH of p53 was taken as an indicator of the inactivation of p53 due to genetic changes. Ten patients with recurrent gliomas were studied. Three patients had LOH at primary surgery and two of these had LOH at recurrent surgery. One patient had LOH of p53 only at recurrent surgery but not at primary surgery. No indicative correlation was found between p53 heterozygosity status on one hand and grade of malignancy (primary and recurrent) and recurrence interval on the other.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3achromosomes 3aglioma 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3aloss of heterozygosity 3apatients 3asurgery 3atumor suppressor genes1 aChattopadhyay, P.1 aSarkar, C.1 aSinha, S.1 aMahapatra, A.

In the present work, the performance of a fixed-bed ion exchange (IE) process with a novel strong-acid cation exchange resin has been tested for the removal of iron from secondary-treated olive mill wastewater (OMW-2ST). This secondary treatment is based on Fenton reaction and it uses iron (III) chloride as catalyst, therefore concentrations of iron up to 5mgL−1 could be present in OMW-2ST. The influence of the concentration of iron in the feedstream has been investigated, and equilibrium behaviour has been modelized by means of Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms. It was found that Langmuir isotherm provides the most accurate prediction of the experimental data (R2>0.99). Results reveal that the adsorption process is spontaneous (negative value of ΔG°). Iron IE process was found to undergo pseudo-second order kinetics, as supported by the high square fit (R2>0.999) and low sum of squared error values. It can be deducted that the assayed resin provides fast kinetics in the uptake of iron (up to 4.96gmg−1min−1) as well as higher sensibly sorption capacity (28.0mgg−1) than biosorbents like olive stones (2.12mgg−1). This resin supposes also minor operating costs in comparison with other synthetic ones. The equilibrium was reached after 30min, providing removal efficiency close to 100%. Thereby, iron concentration in the eluting stream was maintained below the standard limit for reuse of the purified effluent in the proper production process (200μgL−1).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiosorbents 3acatalysts 3acation exchange 3aindustry 3airon 3ametal ions 3aolives 3aoperating costs 3aprediction 3asorption isotherms 3astreams 3asustainable development 3athermodynamics 3awastewater 0aAdsorption isotherms 0aKinetic study 0aIndustrial wastewater 0aIon exchange 0aIron removal1 aOchando-Pulido, J.M.1 aMartínez-Ferez, A.0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Jan., v. 86 p.53-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245014300173300001400316500001900330500002000349520063600369592002801005650002201033650001601055650001301071650001601084773014101100856009001241852000901331655001201340IND60592797520221121023315.0180622e19730112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059279752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.1973.tb01779.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, D.

To begin to address this issue, the impact of ablating L-FABP (LKO) or SCP-2/SCP-x (DKO) individually or both together (TKO) was examined in female mice. Biliary bile acid levels were decreased in LKO, DKO, and TKO mice; however, hepatic bile acid concentration was decreased in LKO mice only. In contrast, biliary phospholipid level was decreased only in TKO mice, while biliary cholesterol levels were unaltered regardless of phenotype. The loss of either or both genes increased hepatic expression of the major bile acid synthetic enzymes (CYP7A1 and/or CYP27A1). Loss of L-FABP and/or SCP-2/SCP-x genes significantly altered the molecular composition of biliary bile acids, but not the proportion of conjugated/unconjugated bile acids or overall bile acid hydrophobicity index. These data suggested that L-FABP was more important in hepatic retention of bile acids, while SCP-2/SCP-x more broadly affected biliary bile acid and phospholipid levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abile acids 3acholesterol 3aenzymes 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3afemales 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3ametabolism 3amice 3aphenotype 3aphospholipids 0aL-FABP 0aSCP-2 0aSCP-x 0aGene ablation 0aBile acid 0aSexual dimorphism1 aLandrock, Danilo1 aLandrock, Kerstin K.1 aHowles, Philip N.1 aAtshaves, Barbara P.1 aKier, Ann B.1 aSchroeder, Friedhelm0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 588 p.25-32dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03638naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245011500188300001600303520184200319592002802161650001602189650001502205650001502220650001902235650001302254650001402267650001202281650002002293650000902313650001702322650001102339650001002350650004202360650001502402650001802417650001002435650001902445650001302464650001202477650002902489650002902518650002302547650001102570650004202581650000902623650003402632650002402666650002702690651001102717651001102728651001202739651001102751651001102762651001202773700002502785773008802810856008102898852000902979655001202988IND60080189320221120090116.0151029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008018932DNAL7 a245959082pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-014-0399-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshaq, Suzanne L.10aHigh-Throughput DNA Sequencing of the Ruminal Bacteria from Moose (Alces alces) in Vermont, Alaska, and Norway  ap. 185-195.  aIn the present study, the rumen bacteria of moose (Alces alces) from three distinct geographic locations were investigated. Moose are large, browsing ruminants in the deer family, which subsist on fibrous, woody browse, and aquatic plants. Subspecies exist which are distinguished by differing body and antler size, and these are somewhat geographically isolated. Seventeen rumen samples were collected from moose in Vermont, Alaska, and Norway, and bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced using Roche 454 pyrosequencing with titanium chemistry. Overall, 109,643 sequences were generated from the 17 individual samples, revealing 33,622 unique sequences. Members of the phylum Bacteroidetes were dominant in samples from Alaska and Norway, but representatives of the phylum Firmicutes were dominant in samples from Vermont. Within the phylum Bacteroidetes, Prevotellaceae was the dominant family in all three sample locations, most of which belonged to the genus Prevotella. Within the phylum Firmicutes, the family Lachnospiraceae was the most prevalent in all three sample locations. The data set supporting the results of this article is available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), available through NCBI [study accession number SRP022590]. Samples clustered by geographic location and by weight and were heterogenous based on gender, location, and weight class (p < 0.05). Location was a stronger factor in determining the core microbiome than either age or weight, but gender did not appear to be a strong factor. There were no shared operational taxonomic units across all 17 samples, which indicates that these moose may have been isolated long enough to preclude a core microbiome among moose. Other potential factors discussed include differences in climate, food quality and availability, gender, and life cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aFirmicutes 3aPrevotella 3aaquatic plants 3abrowsing 3achemistry 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adeer 3afood quality 3agender 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobiome 3aribosomal RNA 3arumen 3arumen bacteria 3atitanium 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxclassification 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDeerxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aHigh-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing 2aMale 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRumenxmicrobiology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aAlaska 3aNorway 3aVermont 0aAlaska 0aNorway 0aVermont1 aWright, André-Denis0 tMicrobial ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 68, no. 2 p.185-195dSpringer USx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-014-0399-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245007400167300001600241520198300257592002802240650001802268650001502286650002802301650001202329650001802341650001002359650001602369650003702385650002602422650001902448650002402467650001202491650001602503650001002519650001502529650002302544651001102567653001802578653001902596653002302615653001402638653000802652653001002660700002302670700001802693700002302711700002402734773010202758856008702860852000902947655001202956IND60545674320221116143340.0170713e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054567432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.11.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Qun10aCommuting behaviors and exposure to air pollution in Montreal, Canada  ap. 193-198.  aVehicular traffic is a major source of outdoor air pollution in urban areas, and studies have shown that air pollution is worse during hours of commuting to and from work and school. However, it is unclear to what extent different commuting behaviors are a source of air pollution compared to non-commuters, and if air pollution exposure actually differs by the mode of commuting. This study aimed to examine the relationships between commuting behaviors and air pollution exposure levels measured by urinary 1-OHP (1-hydroxypyrene), a biomarker of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).A cross-sectional study of 174 volunteers living in Montreal, 92 females and 82 males, aged 20 to 53years was conducted in 2011. Each participant completed a questionnaire regarding demographic factors, commuting behaviors, home and workplace addresses, and potential sources of PAH exposure, and provided a complete first morning void urine sample for 1-OHP analysis. Multivariable general linear regression models were used to examine the relationships between different types of commuting and urinary 1-OHP levels.Compared to non-commuters, commuters traveling by foot or bicycle and by car or truck had a significantly higher urinary 1-OHP concentration in urine (p=0.01 for foot or bicycle vs. non-commuters; p=0.02 for car or truck vs. non-commuters); those traveling with public transportation and combinations of two or more types of modes tended to have an increased 1-OHP level in urine (p=0.06 for public transportation vs. non-commuters; p=0.05 for commuters with combinations of two or more types of modes vs. non-commuters). No significant difference in urinary 1-OHP variation was found by mode of commuting.This preliminary study suggests that despite the mode of commuting, all types of commuting during rush hours increase exposure to air pollution as measured by a sensitive PAH metabolite biomarker, and mode of commuting did not explain exposure variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3abiomarkers 3across-sectional studies 3afemales 3alinear models 3amales 3ametabolites 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apublic transportation 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3aurine 3avolunteers 3aworking conditions 3aCanada 0aAir pollution 0aTransportation 0aCommuting behavior 0aCommuters 0aPAH 0a1-OHP1 aBouchard, Michèle1 aChen, Dongmei1 aRosenberg, Mark W.1 aAronson, Kristan J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 508 p.193-198dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.11.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245018700159300001600346500002000362520114000382592002801522650001001550650001401560650004301574650001101617650002801628650001001656650001601666650004201682650002101724650001201745700001701757700001501774700001301789700001801802773013301820856007301953852000902026655001202035IND60571542320221119083126.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057154232DNAL7 a10.1111/jvp.123172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurmańczuk, A.10aPharmacokinetic investigations of the marker active metabolites 4‐methylamino‐antipyrine and 4‐amino‐antipyrine after intramuscular injection of metamizole in healthy piglets  ap. 616-620.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMetamizole (MT) is a pyrazolone nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug labelled for humans and animals. The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of its active metabolites 4‐methylamino‐antipyrine (MAA) and 4‐amino‐antipyrine (AA) in male piglets after a single intramuscular injection of MT. Eight healthy male piglets were administered MT (100 mg/kg) intramuscularly. Blood was sampled at scheduled time intervals, and drug plasma concentrations evaluated by a validated HPLC method. MAA and AA plasma concentrations were quantitatively detectable from 0.25 to 48 h and 0.50 to 72 h, respectively, in 6 of 8 and 7 of 8 animals. The average maximum concentrations of MAA and AA were of 47.59 and 4.94 mg/mL, respectively. The average half‐lives were 8.57 and 13.3 h for MAA and AA, respectively. This study showed that the amount of MAA and AA produced in piglets is different to that in the animal species previously investigated. Further studies are necessary to understand whether these differences in MAA and AA plasma concentrations between animal species necessitate diverse therapeutic drug dosing.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ahalf life 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aintramuscular injection 3amales 3ametabolites 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3apharmacokinetics 3apiglets1 aKowalski, C.1 aGiorgi, M.1 aOwen, H.1 aGrabowski, T.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2016 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.616-620dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0140-77837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvp.123173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014400164520123300308592002801541650001701569650001401586650001901600650001301619650000901632650001901641650001201660650001901672650001201691650001701703650002401720650001501744650002201759653002401781653002201805653002501827653003501852653002301887700001301910700001601923700001601939700001501955773012201970856008102092852000902173655001202182IND60724125320221118225444.0211030e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072412532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1109172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Liping10aMechanical, thermal stability and microstructural properties of emulsion-filled gels: Effect of sugar beet pectin/soy protein isolate ratio  aThe current study focused on how matrix ratio affected the gel properties and microstructures of sugar beet pectin (SBP)/soy protein isolate (SPI)-based gels with and without emulsion. Roles of emulsion stabilized by Tween 20 and different ratios of matrices in gelation induced by laccase and heat treatment were evaluated. The textural, rheological and thermal stability properties of either gels or gels containing emulsion were enhanced with increasing level of SBP and weakened with increasing concentration of SPI. With the increase of SBP concentration, the emulsion addition showed no significant influence on the textural parameters of gels. However, the thermal stability of gel was weakened because of the emulsion addition. The E/P212 showed improved textural and rheological properties compared with the gel without emulsion. All gels exhibited a frequency-independent behavior, and the water holding capacity of each gel was about 90%. Moreover, microstructure analysis indicated that the well-filled honeycomb gel was formed in E/P212. The gelation behavior was mainly dominant by SBP, and the underlying gelation mechanism was that the SBP was cross-linked to promote the gelatinization reaction and rate of SPI.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3agelatinization 3agelation 3agels 3aheat treatment 3alaccase 3amicrostructure 3apectins 3apolysorbates 3asoy protein isolate 3asugar beet 3athermal stability 0aSoy protein isolate 0aSugar beet pectin 0aEmulsion-filled gels 0aComposition-property relations 0aGelation mechanism1 aJia, Xin1 aYan, Jinxin1 aYan, Wenjia1 aYin, Lijun0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Apr., v. 141 p.110917-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1109173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008500168300001600253520077700269592002801046653000901074653002001083653001301103653001701116773009401133856008401227852000901311655001201320IND60561566220221118003512.0170118e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056156622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mtcomm.2016.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerillo, P.M.10aFlexible gas sensor based on TiO2 membrane nanotubes for detection of butylamine  ap. 117-121.  aTiO2 membrane nanotubes prepared by anodization method was used for detection of d-butylamine (DBA) operating at low temperature.

However, it is unclear how different salt types affect carbon mineralization as a response to salinity levels. In this study, soil samples (0–13 cm) collected in the Liaohe estuarine wetland were amended with NaCl and Na2SO4 salts at five salt levels: 1 mS·cm−1 (EC1), 3 mS·cm−1 (EC3), 5 mS·cm−1 (EC5), 10 mS·cm−1 (EC10) and 18 mS·cm−1 (EC18). The amended soils were incubated for 193 d, and the carbon mineralization rates were periodically measured. NaCl has decreased carbon mineralization at all salinity levels, but the effect of Na2SO4 was found only in the high salinity level (EC18). We found a significant ion-specific effect of salt types on carbon mineralization at the lower salinity levels (EC1, EC3 and EC5) but no significant ion-specific effect at the higher salinity levels (EC10 and EC18). The salt effects highly varied with incubation time and the time changes were depended on salt types. The results suggest that there may be a salinity threshold (5–10 mS·cm−1) that impacts the ion-specific effect (NaCl and Na2SO4) on carbon mineralization, depending on the salinity level and the ionic physiochemical behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aestuaries 3amineralization 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3asoil amendments 3asoil sampling 3awetland soils 3awetlands 0aCarbon mineralization 0aSalinity 0aNaCl 0aNa2SO4 0aEstuarine wetland1 aYang, Jisong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7421-36991 aYu, Miao1 aZhao, Wei1 aXiao, Ying1 aZhou, Di1 aZhan, Chao1 aYu, Yang1 aZhang, Jingjing1 aLv, Zhenbo1 aYu, Junbao0 tGeoderma.g2019 June 15, v. 344 p.179-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009500172300001600267520144000283592002801723650002301751650001501774650002501789650001301814650002201827650001501849650001901864650000901883651001101892653002801903653002801931653002601959653001701985653001802002700001802020700002102038700002202059773010702081856008502188852000902273655001202282IND50064479720221122224118.0190215e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006447972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2012.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGauthier, Perrine10aQuantifying habitat vulnerability to assess species priorities for conservation management  ap. 321-325.  aIdentifying species priorities for management and regional conservation plans requires explicit consideration of the relative vulnerability of their habitats. In this paper we propose an objective methodology to quantify habitat vulnerability based on three parameters: the priority status of the habitat (according to the E.C. Habitats Directive), the conservation status of the habitat(s) based on a recent E.C. assessment, and the proportion of known occurrences of the species in the study area which do not occur in a regulatory protected area. To illustrate the method we studied the 124 listed plant taxa that are present in the Pyrenees National Park (France). We combined the scores for the three parameters to produce five classes of habitat vulnerability which were combined with criteria for the territorial responsibility of the National Park for each taxon and their rarity in the National Park to produce a ranking of species. Discussion with park staff was undertaken to finalize species priorities for conservation action, and notably monitoring, not only because of their endemism or rarity but also their vulnerability and risk of extinction in the region. The use of parameters to score vulnerability that are based on European-wide conservation policy and assessments and a simple gap analysis of the proportion of protected populations allows the method to be easily adapted to other regions and taxonomic groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3aextinction 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3arisk 3aFrance 0aConservation priorities 0aConservation management 0aHabitat vulnerability 0aRare species 0aNational Park1 aFoulon, Yoann1 aJupille, Olivier1 aThompson, John D.0 tBiological conservation.g2013 Feb., v. 158 p.321-325dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245011000207300002000317500001900337520136500356592002801721650002201749650001201771650001101783650001401794650002301808650001701831650002001848650001101868650001301879650001201892650001801904650001301922700001201935700005701947700001602004700001302020700001502033700001302048700001502061700001902076773012202095856008702217852000902304655001202313IND60720758820221117235321.0201217e20201123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072075882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c030852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3706-448110aSize-Dependent Catalytic Cyclohexane Dehydrogenation with Platinum Nanoparticles on Nitrogen-Doped Carbon  ap. 16542-16551.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEfficient dehydrogenation of cyclohexane at low temperatures is of great importance in the field of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs). In this paper, a series of Pt nanoparticles with a size distribution of 1.6–3.1 nm were loaded on nitrogen-doped carbon (Pt/CN) as the catalysts for cyclohexane dehydrogenation under low temperatures (180–210 °C). The effect of the Pt particle size on its catalytic performance was systematically explored. It is found that a volcanic trend exists between Pt particle size and its catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The conversion of cyclohexane to benzene reaches up to 96.03% at 210 °C within 90 min using the Pt/CN catalyst with a Pt particle size of 1.9 nm. The corresponding activation energy of cyclohexane dehydrogenation is calculated to be as low as 36.2 kJ·mol–¹ when compared with that using the other synthetic catalysts. By detailed characterizations of all Pt/CN catalysts, it is deduced that the Pt particle size effect on cyclohexane dehydrogenation can be attributed to the competition between the increased active sites and the covered active sites by products when decreasing the Pt particle size. This work provides not only a systematic study on the size effect of Pt particles but also a new way to design efficient and stable catalysts for cyclohexane dehydrogenation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abenzene 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acyclohexanes 3adehydrogenation 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3aparticle size 3aplatinum1 aLiu, He1 aFan, Shiguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0917-66811 aLi, Weining1 aLi, Zhuo1 aYun, Huiru1 aXu, Xuan1 aGuo, Aijun1 aWang, Zongxian0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Nov. 23, v. 34, no. 12 p.16542-16551dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c030853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01716naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012800159300002000287520049300307592002800800650003500828650002200863650002300885650002000908650004400928650002200972650002200994700001701016700001201033700001601045700001301061700001401074700001701088700001801105773012401123856007401247852000901321655001201330IND60642146820221119234814.0190506e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064214682DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08683k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhenliang10aIsolation, structure elucidation, and KDD study of (−)-Celosine, a new skeleton with potent anti-atherosclerosis activity  ap. 50875-50879.  aNatural (−)-Celosine was isolated as a novel endocyclicditerpene with an unprecedented skeleton from Celosia cristata L.

To better understand the structures and functions of Akirin2 gene, the cDNA of the Tianfu goat Akirin2 gene was cloned. Sequence analysis showed that the Tianfu goat Akirin2 cDNA full coding sequence (CDS) contains 579bp nucleotides that encode 192 amino acids. A phylogenic tree of the Akirin2 protein sequence from the Tianfu goat and other species revealed that the Tianfu goat Akirin2 was closely related with cattle and sheep Akirin2. RT-qPCR analysis showed that Akirin2 was expressed in the myocardium, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, leg muscle, abdominal muscle and the longissimus dorsi muscle. Especially, high expression levels of Akirin2 were detected in the spleen, lung, and kidney whereas lower expression levels were seen in the liver, myocardium, leg muscle, abdominal muscle and longissimus dorsi muscle. Temporal mRNA expression showed that Akirin2 expression levels in the longissimus dorsi muscle, first increased then decreased from day 1 to month 12. Western blotting results showed that the Akirin2 protein was only detected in the lung and three skeletal muscle tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acids 3acattle 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3agoats 3akidneys 3aliver 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat quality 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3amyocardium 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3askeletal muscle 3aspleen 0aCDS 0aRT-qPCR 0aMS 0aSNP 0addPCR 0aEST 0aQTL 0aRT-PCR 0aORF 0aAA 0aPMSF 0aGAPDH 0aSDS 0aPVDF 0aAkirin2 gene 0aComplete CDS 0aSequence analysis 0aExpression analysis 0aTianfu goat1 aXu, Gangyi1 aWan, Lu1 aWang, Nianlu0 tGene.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 554 p.9-15dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.09.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245011000161300001800271500002000289520208300309592002802392650001602420650002502436650002802461650002602489650001202515650001102527650001702538650001502555650002002570650001502590650001902605650002802624650001102652650001102663650001702674650001102691650001102702650001102713651001102724651001802735700002402753700002702777700002102804700002302825700001702848773009002865856007202955852000903027655001203036IND60571253120221118232542.0170712e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057125312DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.17902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLaren, Jennie R.10aShrub encroachment in Arctic tundra: Betula nana effects on above‐ and belowground litter decomposition  ap. 1361-1376.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRapid arctic vegetation change as a result of global warming includes an increase in the cover and biomass of deciduous shrubs. Increases in shrub abundance will result in a proportional increase of shrub litter in the litter community, potentially affecting carbon turnover rates in arctic ecosystems. We investigated the effects of leaf and root litter of a deciduous shrub, Betula nana, on decomposition, by examining species‐specific decomposition patterns, as well as effects of Betula litter on the decomposition of other species. We conducted a 2‐yr decomposition experiment in moist acidic tundra in northern Alaska, where we decomposed three tundra species (Vaccinium vitis‐idaea, Rhododendron palustre, and Eriophorum vaginatum) alone and in combination with Betula litter. Decomposition patterns for leaf and root litter were determined using three different measures of decomposition (mass loss, respiration, extracellular enzyme activity). We report faster decomposition of Betula leaf litter compared to other species, with support for species differences coming from all three measures of decomposition. Mixing effects were less consistent among the measures, with negative mixing effects shown only for mass loss. In contrast, there were few species differences or mixing effects for root decomposition. Overall, we attribute longer‐term litter mass loss patterns to patterns created by early decomposition processes in the first winter. We note numerous differences for species patterns between leaf and root decomposition, indicating that conclusions from leaf litter experiments should not be extrapolated to below‐ground decomposition. The high decomposition rates of Betula leaf litter aboveground, and relatively similar decomposition rates of multiple species below, suggest a potential for increases in turnover in the fast‐decomposing carbon pool of leaves and fine roots as the dominance of deciduous shrubs in the Arctic increases, but this outcome may be tempered by negative litter mixing effects during the early stages of encroachment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula nana 3aEriophorum vaginatum 3aRhododendron tomentosum 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3afine roots 3aglobal warming 3ainterspecific variation 3aleaves 3amixing 3aplant litter 3ashrubs 3atundra 3awinter 3aAlaska 3aArctic region1 aBuckeridge, Kate M.1 avan de Weg, Martine J.1 aShaver, Gaius R.1 aSchimel, Joshua P.1 aGough, Laura0 tEcology.g2017 May, v. 98, no. 5 p.1361-1376dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.17903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011500169300001600284500001400300520165400314592002801968650002401996650003302020650002702053650001102080650001402091650001902105650002302124650001102147650001602158650002302174650001002197650001202207650001502219650002402234650000902258650002602267650000902293650001102302650001102313653002502324653002102349653001902370653002302389653002502412653002302437653002002460653001502480700002202495700002302517700001702540700002102557700002302578700002002601700002002621700001902641700001902660773008002679856008102759852000902840655001202849IND60700437320221119074656.0200630e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070043732DNAL7 a10.1163/15685411-000033242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaerbout, Jolien10aPratylenchus penetrans, a potential risk in glasshouse-grown lettuce: population dynamics and damage threshold  ap. 577-590.  aNAL-light  aThe root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans, causes growth reduction in glasshouse-grown lettuce and is mainly controlled by chemical soil disinfestation. Integrated management strategies require more knowledge about the population dynamics and damage threshold densities. We monitored the population during 2.5 years in a commercial glasshouse by sampling soil in the same four 1 m² spots at 0-30 cm and 30-60 cm depth. The grower grew lettuce in rotation with leek, applied 1,3-dichloropropene in summer and left the field fallow during winter. Growing leek reduced the nematode population slightly but chemical soil disinfestation lowered the numbers drastically, although 41% of the nematodes in the deeper layer survived. Black fallow resulted in a slight increase of the population, probably due to hatching. Two pot experiments with ten densities of P. penetrans were conducted to estimate the damage threshold for a summer and autumn cultivar (‘Cosmopolia’ and ‘Brighton’, respectively). The thresholds for lettuce weight were 669 and 3834 P. penetrans (100 ml soil)⁻¹ in summer and autumn, respectively, but with considerable variability in estimated parameters. The thresholds for root damage were much lower: 204 and 48 P. penetrans (100 ml soil)⁻¹. Nematode numbers did not increase on lettuce in the pot tests (maximum multiplication rate was 0.40) but increased slightly in the commercial setting. These results show that populations of P. penetrans build up slowly when butterhead lettuce is rotated with leek and fallow, but chemical soil disinfestation is required to avoid numbers resulting in root damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,3-dichloropropene 3aLactuca sativa var. capitata 3aPratylenchus penetrans 3aautumn 3acultivars 3adisinfestation 3aeconomic threshold 3afallow 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3aleeks 3alettuce 3anematology 3apopulation dynamics 3arisk 3aroot lesion nematodes 3asoil 3asummer 3awinter 0aAllium porrum (leek) 0afield monitoring 0aLactuca sativa 0apopulation density 0aroot-lesion nematode 0aSeinhorst equation 0atolerance limit 0ayield loss1 aNeukermans, Jenny1 aVandevelde, Isabel1 aDecombel, An1 ade Sutter, Nancy1 aDeeren, Anne-Marie1 aVenneman, Sofie1 aBleyaert, Peter1 aHöfte, Monica1 aViaene, Nicole0 tNematology.g, v. 22, no. 5 p.577-590dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685411-000033243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001500187245011500202300001800317506007600335520057700411592002800988506003701016650002301053650002201076650001001098650001001108650001701118650002001135650002501155650001201180651001001192700001901202700001201221700001301233700001701246700001401263700001701277700001901294700001701313700001601330773012501346856008001471852000901551655001201560IND60117641920221207120120.0141126e20130502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011764192DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00221-122doi7 aPMC36246872pmcid7 a235807132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qunhui10aGenome Sequence of a Novel Reassortant H3N2 Avian Influenza Virus from Domestic Mallard Ducks in Eastern China  ap. e00221-12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe H3 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) can provide genes for human influenza virus through gene reassortment, which raises great concerns in terms of its potential threat to human health.

This industry is still developing, so it is important to understand what drives environmental changes, particularly in NPP, when shale gas pads are constructed in sensitive areas. Few previous studies have addressed this issue, so we quantified how the NPP changed, and what drove the changes, when a large shale gas area was developed at the end of 2012 in a mountainous karst area in Sichuan Province. We calculated the trend in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2012 to 2017 and used the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to calculate the changes in NPP at different distances from the pads using remote sensing images for July 2012 and July 2017 and field survey data from July 2017. We then identified the factors that drove the changes with Geodetector. The results showed that the NDVI increased across 64.2% of the shale gas development area from 2012 to 2017 because of climate change, and only showed a significant decrease across 0.3% of the area, mainly because of the shale gas development. The NPP decreased by 110.1 t because of the shale gas development in July 2017, or by about 0.35% of the total NPP. Of this, 93.8 t were associated with the pad construction areas, and 16.3 t were associated with the area around the pads. The changes in NPP around the shale gas pads were mainly confined to within 150 m during the construction phase and 90 m once the construction was completed. The NPP at different distances from the pads during the construction period was related to the distance from the pad, slope, and land use. Once completed, the NPP mainly varied with distance, land use, and the distance from the pad to rural settlements. The NPP was most strongly influenced by the distance from the pad and the area of the pad. We suggest that, when planning the construction of shale gas pads, the pads should be sited on gently sloping areas, the number of wells on each pad should be optimized, land use type changes outside the pad should be limited, and the land beyond the pads should be reclaimed in a timely manner to allow the NPP to recover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aindustry 3akarsts 3aland use 3amodels 3amountains 3anet primary productivity 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3ashale gas 3asurveys 3atemporal variation 3avegetation 3awells 3aChina 0aShale gas pad development 0aNPP 0aDistances from the pad 0aGeodetector1 aZhang, Xinyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8135-21441 aWang, Qiubing1 aChen, Hongkun1 aDu, Xianyuan1 aMa, Yuping0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 701 p.134769-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1347693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008700161300002000248520099000268592002801258650001401286650002101300650001801321650002301339650001401362700002201376700002101398700002501419773012401444856007401568852000901642655001201651IND60642147020221119234845.0190506e20171130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064214702DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08696b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLenz, Timothy K.10aProtein-free ribosomal RNA folds to a near-native state in the presence of Mg²⁺  ap. 54674-54681.  aThe assembled bacterial ribosome contains around 50 proteins and many counterions. Here, focusing on rRNA from the large ribosomal subunit, we demonstrate that Mg²⁺ causes structural collapse in the absence of ribosomal proteins. The collapsed rRNA forms many native-like RNA–RNA interactions, similar to those observed in the assembled ribosome. We assayed rRNA structure by chemical footprinting in the presence and absence of Mg²⁺. Our results indicate that Mg²⁺-dependent conformational change is focused in non-helical regions, consistent with tertiary interactions. In the presence of Mg²⁺, the large subunit rRNA adopts a state that includes the core inter-domain architecture of the assembled ribosome. We infer that the rRNA–Mg²⁺ state represents the core architecture of the LSU which, while not catalytically active, positions the residues of the LSU rRNA in such a way as to promote native interactions with rProteins to ultimately form a functional LSU.  aPublisher supplied data 3amagnesium 3aprotein subunits 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes1 aNorris, Ashlyn M.1 aHud, Nicholas V.1 aWilliams, Loren Dean0 tRSC advances.g2017 Nov. 30, v. 7, no. 86 p.54674-54681dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra08696b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245005800180300001600238520105700254592002801311650001201339650001901351650001601370650002001386650001201406650002101418650002201439650001301461650002101474650001301495650001601508650002001524700001901544700002001563773010401583856004801687852000901735655001201744IND50062228020221119154851.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006222802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-011-0743-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Yalagala Poorna Chandra10aDeacidification of Coconut Oil by Membrane Filtration  ap. 498-508.  aUltrafiltration (UF) of coconut oil was carried out using a Millipore membrane cell at different pressures (0.1–0.4 MPa) and with different molecular weight cutoff membranes, that is,YM-1 (1 kDa), YM-3 (3 kDa), YM-10 (10 kDa), YM-30 (30 kDa), and PLTK-30 (30 kDa).

The effects of temperature and applied pressure on the permeate flux and oil rejection were also studied with membranes using multistage filtration. As pressure increased from 0.1 to 0.4 MPa, the permeate flux and oil rejection increased linearly. A significant reduction of FFA was observed, which is in proportional with the amount of solvent in the feed used. The oil loss was less at lower temperature (25 °C) and pressure (0.2 MPa). Using PLTK 30 membrane with three-stage filtration, reduction of FFA was achieved up to 93% and 94% with methanol and ethanol solvents, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3acell membranes 3acoconut oil 3adeacidification 3aethanol 3afree fatty acids 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aultrafiltration1 aRavi, Ramasamy1 aKhatoon, Sakina0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Feb., v. 6, no. 2 p.498-508dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-011-0743-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010600169520168700275592002801962650001101990650001702001650001802018650001702036650001402053650001202067650001502079651001002094653001902104653001102123653002102134653001002155700001502165700001302180700001402193700001702207700001402224700001902238700001402257773009802271856008702369852000902456655001202465IND60686523920221118045720.0200503e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068652392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1071622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jun-Yao10aQuantitative assessment of weathering degree of the Touzhai rock-avalanche deposit in Southwest China  aWeathering is one of the main preparatory causal factors for rock-avalanche events and weathering assessment of involved materials can refine understanding of geomorphic processes of this class. The weathering degree of the deposit of the Touzhai basalt rock avalanche in China, is quantitatively evaluated herein through an integrated geochemical analysis, coupled with meso- and micro-scopic examination of fragments, which can help to understand the inhomogeneity of weathering in rock slopes. The clasts of 12 size classes of the debris making up the deposit, ranging from meter-sized boulder to fines of <25 μm, are assessed with 16 geochemical parameters and eight weathering indices. The results show that the debris can be subdivided into two distinct groups: fresh (or fresh-slightly weathered) and weathered (moderately-highly weathered). Group 1 includes five classes of several meters, 15-10 cm, 5-4 cm, 2-1 cm and 1-0.5 cm, and Group 2 covers a particle size range of <0.5 cm to <25 μm. Of special interest is that fresh debris accounts for at least ~80 wt.% of the rock-avalanche deposit. The unexpectedly significant proportion of fresh debris appears to be a necessary prerequisite for the rock-avalanche occurrence and can be attributed to the aphanitic texture and low permeability of the basalt. On the basis of the low bulk density and strength of saprolite (completely weathered rocks), the slopes containing ~ 80-90% of unweathered materials may fail as rock avalanche-debris flows. They may collapse as rockslide-debris flows if saprolite crusts continue to thicken. In addition, the slopes made entirely, of saprolite, would not host catastrophic failures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3abulk density 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3asaprolite 3atexture 3aweathering 3aChina 0aRock avalanche 0aDebris 0aWeathering index 0aCreep1 aXu, Ze-Min1 aRen, Zhe1 aWang, Kun1 aGao, Hai-Yan1 aYang, Kui1 aTang, Yong-Jun1 aTian, Lin0 tGeomorphology.g2020 June 15, v. 359 p.107162-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1071623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245016000194300001800354500002000372520162700392592002802019596004302047596005202090596005202142596005202194650001102246650001902257650001402276650002102290650002002311650002002331650001202351650002302363650001002386650002202396650001102418650001302429650001002442650002102452651001002473700001402483700001802497700005702515700001702572773012602589856007702715852000902792655001202801IND60788030020221120233732.0220811e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078803002DNAL7 a10.1002/2017WR0214202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuil, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8805-205610aExploring the Influence of Smallholders' Perceptions Regarding Water Availability on Crop Choice and Water Allocation Through Socio‐Hydrological Modeling  ap. 2580-2604.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhile it is known that farmers adopt different decision‐making behaviors to cope with stresses, it remains challenging to capture this diversity in formal model frameworks that are used to advance theory and inform policy. Guided by cognitive theory and the theory of bounded rationality, this research develops a novel, socio‐hydrological model framework that can explore how a farmer's perception of water availability impacts crop choice and water allocation. The model is informed by a rich empirical data set at the household level collected during 2013 in Kenya's Upper Ewaso Ng'iro basin that shows that the crop type cultivated is correlated with water availability. The model is able to simulate this pattern and shows that near‐optimal or “satisficing” crop patterns can emerge also when farmers were to make use of simple decision rules and have diverse perceptions on water availability. By focusing on farmer decision making it also captures the rebound effect, i.e., as additional water becomes available through the improvement of crop efficiencies it will be reallocated on the farm instead of flowing downstream, as a farmer will adjust his (her) water allocation and crop pattern to the new water conditions. This study is valuable as it is consistent with the theory of bounded rationality, and thus offers an alternative, descriptive model in addition to normative models. The framework can be used to understand the potential impact of climate change on the socio‐hydrological system, to simulate and test various assumptions regarding farmer behavior and to evaluate policy interventions.  aPublisher supplied data  aDK W1219‐N22cAustrian Science funds  aSES‐1360463cU.S. National Science Foundation  aSES‐1360421cU.S. National Science Foundation  aBCS‐1115009cU.S. National Science Foundation 3abasins 3aclimate change 3acognition 3acropping systems 3adata collection 3adecision making 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3afarms 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aresearch 3awater 3awater allocation 3aKenya1 aEvans, T.1 aMcCord, P.

Specifically, a cotton fabric was tuned to have an optimal pore structure, on which CNT/rGO and PPy were coated by dip-coating and chemical polymerization, respectively. The mass loading of CNT/rGO is up to 7.7 mg cm⁻², to balance which the PPy has a mass loading of 5.7 mg cm⁻². The resulting asymmetric supercapacitor with a voltage window of 1.8 V exhibits a super-high areal energy density of 0.26 mW h cm⁻².

We take advantage of this special chemistry to use catechol as the cross-linking species in a radical polymerization to form robust polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels. Hydrogels are prepared by the radical co-polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate and a methacrylamide catechol derivative monomer. The crosslinking results from the catechol groups, through the generation of aryloxy radicals that react with the CC monomer double bonds. These lignin-mimicking hydrogels display a high swelling degree (near 2400%), good mechanical properties in their swollen state (up to 390Pa) and free catechol groups that can be used for further functionalization. These hydrogels can therefore be used as a platform for the preparation of a more advanced multifunctional material by incorporating magnetite nanoparticles and cyclodextrin macrorings (CD). The magnetic-CD- functionalized PEG hydrogel exhibits a high water-swelling capability, robust mechanical properties (G′≈1900Pa in the swollen state), magnetic behavior, a great Doxorubicin loading capacity (ca. 0.6mg Doxorubicin per gram of dried gel) and highly controlled temporal drug release. As a result, this hydrogel shows high potential as an advanced drug delivery system.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHydrogel 0aCatechol 0aLignin 0aCyclodextrin 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aDrug delivery1 aLópez-González, Mar1 aTrabado, Isabel1 aRodrigo, M.

In this study, we propose a novel nonlinear parameter estimation method for soft tissues. Firstly, an in-house data acquisition platform was used to obtain external forces and their corresponding deformation values. To provide highly precise data for estimating nonlinear parameters, the measured forces were corrected using the constructed weighted combination forecasting model based on a support vector machine (WCFM_SVM). Secondly, a tetrahedral finite element parameter estimation model was established to describe the physical characteristics of soft tissues, using the substitution parameters of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio to avoid solving complicated nonlinear problems. To improve the robustness of our model and avoid poor local minima, the initial parameters solved by a linear finite element model were introduced into the parameter estimation model. Finally, a self-adapting Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm was presented, which is capable of adaptively adjusting iterative parameters to solve the established parameter estimation model. The maximum absolute error of our WCFM_SVM model was less than 0.03 Newton, resulting in more accurate forces in comparison with other correction models tested. The maximum absolute error between the calculated and measured nodal displacements was less than 1.5 mm, demonstrating that our nonlinear parameters are precise.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal tissues 3adata collection 3adeformation 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3asupport vector machines 3asurgery 0aNonlinear parameter estimation 0aFinite element method 0aSubstitution parameters 0aForce correction 0aSelf-adapting Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm1 aYuan, Zhiyong1 aZheng, Mianlun1 aLiao, Xiangyun1 aZhu, Weixu1 aZhang, Guian0 tGenomics, proteomics & bioinformatics.g2017, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12107x1672-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2017.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245012900207300001600336506007600352520147900428592002801907506003701935650002001972650002401992650001302016650001902029650002402048650001602072650001202088650002402100650002902124650001802153650003302171650001202204650002702216650002502243700002602268700001902294700002602313700001802339700002002357773009402377856008102471852000902552655001202561IND60520712320221207115547.0160522e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052071232DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-012-0076-22doi7 aPMC35971342pmcid7 a283245662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaâssi, Dalel10aDecolorization of the azo dye Acid Orange 51 by laccase produced in solid culture of a newly isolated Trametes trogii strain  ap. 115-125.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study concerns the decolorization and detoxification of the azo dye Acid Orange 51 (AO51) by crude laccase from Trametes trogii produced in solid culture using sawdust as support media. A three-level Box–Behnken factorial design with four factors (enzyme concentration, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) concentration, dye concentration and reaction time) combined with response surface methodology was applied to optimize AO51 decolorization. A mathematical model was developed showing the effect of each factor and their interactions on color removal. The model predicted that Acid Orange 51 decolorization above 87.87 ± 1.27 % could be obtained when enzyme concentration, HBT concentration, dye concentration and reaction time were set at 1 U/mL, 0.75 mM, 60 mg/L and 2 days, respectively. The experimental values were in good agreement with the predicted ones and the models were highly significant, the correlation coefficient (R²) being 0.9. Then the desirability function was employed to determine the optimal decolorization condition for each dye and minimize the process cost simultaneously. In addition, germination index assay showed that laccase-treated dye was detoxified; however in the presence of HBT, the phytotoxicity of the treated dye was increased. By using cheap agro-industrial wastes, such as sawdust, a potential laccase was obtained. The low cost of laccase production may further broaden its application in textile wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrametes trogii 3aagricultural wastes 3aazo dyes 3adecolorization 3aexperimental design 3agermination 3alaccase 3amathematical models 3ametabolic detoxification 3aphytotoxicity 3aresponse surface methodology 3asawdust 3atextile mill effluents 3awastewater treatment1 aZouari-Mechichi, Hela1 aFrikha, Fakher1 aMartinez, Maria Jesus1 aNasri, Moncef1 aMechichi, Tahar0 t3 Biotech.g2013 Apr., v. 3, no. 2 p.115-125dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-012-0076-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245016000209300001600369506007600385520081100461592002801272506003701300650002501337650001101362650002801373650002401401650001001425650001301435650000701448650001601455650001401471700002101485773009401506856008101600852000901681655001201690IND60520712420221207115549.0160522e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052071242DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-012-0077-12doi7 aPMC35971332pmcid7 a283245672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarai, Debabrata10aResponse surface optimization for xylanase with high volumetric productivity by indigenous alkali tolerant Aspergillus candidus under submerged cultivation  ap. 127-136.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, a novel isolate Aspergillus candidus was employed for xylanase production using low cost agro residues.

Under optimized condition, enzyme titer level enhanced to 69 IU/ml at 48 h with volumetric productivity 1437 IU/l h. Growth and enzyme production were observed even at pH 11.0, indicating its ability to sustain at high alkaline environment. Little amount of cellulase was produced concomitantly with xylanase during the course of the process. Volumetric productivity of xylanase was found as a function of temperature.

This interplay can be significantly influenced by the flood control strategy adopted by a society, i.e., how a society sets its desired flood protection level and strives to achieve this goal. And this interplay can be further complicated by rising land‐sea level differences, seasonal water level fluctuations, and economic change. But not much research has been done on how various forms of flood control strategies affect human‐flood interactions under these disturbances and therefore flood resilience in the long run. The current study is an effort to address these issues by developing a conceptual model of human‐flood interaction mediated by flood control strategies. Our model extends the existing model of Yu et al. (2017), who investigated the flood resilience of a community‐based flood protection system in coastal Bangladesh. The major extensions made in this study are inclusions of various forms of flood control strategies (both adaptive and nonadaptive ones), the challenge of rising land‐sea level differences, and various high tide level scenarios generated from modifying the statistical variances and averages. Our results show that adaptive forms of flood control strategies tend to outperform nonadaptive ones for maintaining the model community's flood protection system. Adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust target flood protection levels through close monitoring of flood damages and social memories of flood risk can help the model community deal with various disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflood control 3amodels 3aresearch 3arisk 3asociety 3awater 3aBangladesh1 aJeong, Hanseok1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0587-66291 aSangwan, Nikhil1 aYu, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9929-19330 tWater resources research.g2018 Apr., v. 54, no. 4 p.2661-2680dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR0214403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245008700161300001800248500002000266520137100286592002801657650002401685650002401709650001301733650001701746650002101763650001501784650001101799650001601810650001001826651001801836700002501854773009001879856007201969852000902041655001202050IND60571253720221118232407.0170712e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057125372DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.17732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLutscher, Frithjof10aBehavioral responses to resource heterogeneity can accelerate biological invasions  ap. 1229-1238.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe abundance and spatial distribution of resources in a landscape and the behavioral response of individuals determines whether and how fast an invasive species spreads in an environment. Whether and how landscape manipulations can be used to slow invasive species is of great interest, in particular in forest ecosystems, where tree removal, thinning, and increasing tree diversity are discussed as management options. Classically, the focus is on availability and accessibility of resources; more recent considerations include individual‐level behavioral movement responses to a spatially heterogeneous resource distribution. We derive a novel model for insect–host dynamics that includes three common behavioral aspects of foraging: higher movement rate in resource‐poor areas, lower ovipositioning rate in resource‐poor areas, and movement preference for resource‐rich areas. We show that each of these basic mechanisms can increase the speed of invasion in a source–sink landscape above that in a homogeneous landscape with larger overall resource availability. We parameterize our model and illustrate our results with data for emerald ash borer, a recent highly destructive forest pest in North America. Our results highlight the importance of empirical work on movement behavior in different landscape types and near the interface between types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aecological invasion 3aforaging 3aforest pests 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aoviposition 3atrees 3aNorth America1 aMusgrave, Jeffrey A.0 tEcology.g2017 May, v. 98, no. 5 p.1229-1238dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.17733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245015400168500001400322520093900336592002801275650002701303650001301330650002901343650002501372650001501397650001501412650001901427650001401446650001501460650001101475650001701486650001901503650002201522650001101544650001901555653002501574653001901599653002701618653002001645653001801665700001301683700001301696700001801709700001801727773009101745856009001836852000901926655001201935IND60719943520221118072843.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071994352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1291872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yang10aModification of polyvinylidene fluoride membrane by silver nanoparticles-graphene oxide hybrid nanosheet for effective membrane biofouling mitigation  aNAL-light  aMembrane biofouling poses severe impacts on the membrane lifespan and performance.

Constructed wetlands were proposed as a suitable tool for removal of nitrogen from agricultural drainage in the early 1990s. Until now, the vast majority of constructed wetlands designed to treat tile drainage were free-surface constructed wetlands. In 2018, three experimental constructed wetlands with horizontal subsurface flow were built to treat tile drainage from 15.73 ha watershed. The wetlands have a surface area of 79, 90 and 98 m² and were planted with Phalaris arundinacea and Glyceria maxima in parallel bands. The substrate in the first two wetlands is gravel (4–8 mm) mixed with birch woodchips (10: 1 volume ratio). In one of those wetlands, the water level is kept 10 cm above the surface, in the second one the water is kept below the surface. The third wetland has 20 cm layer of birch woodchips on top of gravel. The mean total nitrogen concentration eliminations during one-year period were 61.2%, 62.6% and 70.9% for wetlands 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The average load removals amounted to 0.516, 0.323 and 0.399 g N m⁻² d⁻¹ or 1885, 1180 and 1457 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in wetlands 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The plant uptake and nitrogen sequestration in aboveground biomass contributed only marginally to the overall nitrogen removal. The results revealed that the selection of the best option depends on the fact whether concentration or load is taken as the most important parameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aGlyceria maxima 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aaboveground biomass 3acoastal water 3aconstructed wetlands 3adrainage 3aeutrophication 3agravel 3anitrogen 3anonpoint source pollution 3asubsurface flow 3asurface area 3asurface water 3atile drainage 3atotal nitrogen 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awood chips 0aAgricultural drainage 0aMacrophytes1 aSochacki, Adam1 aFučík, Petr,1 aŠereš, Michal1 aKaplická, Markéta1 aHnátková, Tereza1 aChen, Zhongbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8801-48420 tEcological engineering.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 155 p.105943-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1059433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011100166300001400277520111800291592002801409653001901437653001201456653001901468653001701487653002001504700002001524700001901544700002001563700002001583773009301603856008401696852000901780655001201789IND60561567420221118003526.0170307e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056156742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mtcomm.2016.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Woohwa10aHot-pressing for improving performance of CNT/conjugated polymer thermoelectric films and power generators  ap. 41-45.  aThis study demonstrates a post-treatment method for enhancing the thermoelectric power factor of carbon nanotube (CNT)/conjugated polymer nanocomposite films. For the fabrication of the nanocomposite films a mixture of P3HT (50wt%) and few-walled CNT (50wt%) in o-dichlorobenzene (oDCB), or a mixture of PEDOT:PSS (50wt%) and few-walled CNT (50wt%) in distilled deionized (DDI) water was used. The uniaxial hot-pressing treatment of the as-prepared nanocomposite films resulted in their densification and increased the electrical conductivity and power factor. It was found that the thermoelectric power factor of the CNT/P3HT and CNT/PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite films increased from 150±9 to 217±30μWm−1K−2, and from 371±44 to 572±92μWm−1K−2, respectively, after hot-pressing. We fabricated organic thermoelectric generators using the hot-pressed CNT/conjugated polymer nanocomposites and evaluated their capabilities of electrical power generation. The maximum power outputs of the hot-pressed CNT/P3HT and CNT/PEDOT:PSS OTEGs were 46.0 and 36.3nW, respectively, under a temperature difference of 10K.  aPublisher supplied data 0aThermoelectric 0aOrganic 0aNanocomposites 0aHot-pressing 0aPower generator1 aKang, Young Hun1 aLee, Jun Young1 aJang, Kwang-Suk1 aCho, Sŏng-yun,0 tMaterials Today Communications.g2017 Mar., v. 10 p.41-45dElsevier Ltdx2352-49287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mtcomm.2016.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010200165300001600267520160900283592002801892650002001920650002101940650001301961650001201974650001401986650001302000650001602013650002002029650001302049650001602062650001002078650002102088650000902109651001302118700002802131700002002159700002602179773008502205856004802290852000902338655001202347IND4473987220221121211505.0120524e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447398722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-011-0511-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Shahid10aMineral bioavailability in grains of Pakistani bread wheat declines from old to current cultivars  ap. 153-163.  aEstimating variation in grain mineral concentration and bioavailability in relation to grain yield and the year of cultivar release is important for breeding wheat with increased content of bioavailable minerals. The grain yield and yield components, grain phytate concentration, and concentration and bioavailability of minerals (zinc Zn, iron Fe and calcium Ca) in wheat grains were estimated in 40 wheat cultivars released in Punjab (Pakistan) during the last five decades. Mean grain Zn and Ca concentrations in current-cultivars were significantly lower (â¥14%) than in obsolete cultivars released during the Green Revolution (1965â1976). Much of this variation was related to increased grain weight in current-cultivars. There was a positive correlation among minerals (rÂ =Â 0.39 or higher, nÂ =Â 40) and minerals with phytate in wheat grains (rÂ =Â 0.38 or higher, nÂ =Â 40). The tested cultivars varied widely in grain yield and grain phytate-to-mineral molar ratios (phytate:mineral). Compared to obsolete cultivars, the current-cultivars had a higher phytate:mineral ratio in grains, indicating poor bioavailability of minerals to humans. The study revealed a non-significant relationship between grain yield and phytate:mineral ratios in grains. Therefore, breeding for lower phytate:mineral ratios in wheat grains can ensure increased mineral bioavailability without significant reduction in the yield potential. Future breeding should be focused on developing new genotypes suitable for mineral biofortification and with increased mineral bioavailability in grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abiofortification 3abreeding 3acalcium 3acultivars 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3amineral content 3aminerals 3aphytic acid 3awheat 3ayield components 3azinc 3aPakistan1 aMaqsood, Muhammad Aamer1 aRengel, Zdenko,1 aKhan, Muhammad Khawar0 tEuphytica.g2012 July, v. 186, no. 1 p.153-163dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-011-0511-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245013700167300002000304500001900324520185300343592002802196650000802224650001202232650001902244650001502263650001502278650001102293650001302304650001202317650001502329650001302344650001102357650001602368700001602384700005602400700001802456700001702474773012202491856008702613852000902700655001202709IND60720759720221117235157.0201217e20201113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072075972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c031162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Rui10aExperimental Study of SO₂ Emission and Sulfur Conversion Characteristics of Pressurized Oxy-Fuel Co-combustion of Coal and Biomass  ap. 16693-16704.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPressurized oxy-fuel combustion is a solution to achieve low-cost CO₂ capture and higher operating efficiency. The combination of pressurized oxy-fuel combustion technology and biomass combustion technology can achieve negative CO₂ emissions. However, pressurized oxy-fuel co-combustion of coal and biomass lacks mechanism understanding and the studies on pollutant emissions are scarce. To investigate SO₂ emission concentration, the conversion rate of fuel sulfur to SO₂, sulfur mass balance, and sulfur content and forms in the fuel ash of pressurized oxy-fuel co-combustion of coal and biomass, a series of co-combustion experiments were carried out in a horizontal tube furnace. The experimental fuels were lignite and corn straw, and the experimental parameters were biomass blending ratio (Mb = 0, 30, 50, 70, and 100%), combustion atmosphere (air, Oxy-21, Oxy-30, and Oxy-40), reaction pressure (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 MPa), and combustion temperature (800, 850, and 900 °C). The experimental results showed that SO₂ actual emissions decreased as Mb increased while the conversion rate of fuel sulfur to SO₂ was lowest at 50% Mb. Ash analysis indicated that more sulfur converted to CaSO₄ at 50% Mb. SO₂ actual emissions was highest in the air atmosphere and lowest in the Oxy-21 atmosphere. Higher reaction pressure suppressed SO₂ actual emissions and promoted the sulfur converted to other forms of sulfide, and reaction pressure had no obvious effect on CaSO₄ and K₂SO₄ in the fuel ash. Higher combustion temperature slightly promoted SO₂ actual emissions and conversion rate of fuel sulfur to SO₂. Except for 100% Mb, the three slagging indexes for all combustion experiments were in the criteria of low slagging trend. According to T-A, slagging caused by alkali metals may occur during 100% Mb combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3acorn straw 3aenergy 3afurnaces 3alignite 3apollutants 3asulfides 3asulfur 3atemperature1 aLiu, Qinwen1 aZhong, Wenqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0700-45921 aLian, Guoqing1 aYu, Hongqian0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Nov. 13, v. 34, no. 12 p.16693-16704dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c031163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04247naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012000172300001400292520252400306592002802830650002702858650001902885650002402904650002102928650001002949650001102959650001002970650001302980650001902993650001403012650001503026650000903041650001603050650001103066650001003077650001603087650001003103650001103113650001403124650001103138650001303149650001303162653004203175653002703217653002403244653004703268700001803315700002103333700002303354700001703377700002003394700002703414773011203441856008303553852000903636655001203645IND60534548020221119100051.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053454802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodward, Martin J.10aDrinking water application of Denagard® Tiamulin for control of Brachyspira pilosicoli infection of laying poultry  ap. 87-95.  aAvian intestinal spirochaetosis (AIS) caused by Brachyspira spp., and notably Brachyspira pilosicoli, is common in layer flocks and reportedly of increasing incidence in broilers and broiler breeders. Disease manifests as diarrhoea, increased feed consumption, reduced growth rates and occasional mortality in broilers and these signs are shown in layers also associated with a delayed onset of lay, reduced egg weights, faecal staining of eggshells and non-productive ovaries. Treatment with Denagard® Tiamulin has been used to protect against B. pilosicoli colonisation, persistence and clinical presentation of AIS in commercial layers, but to date there has been no definitive study validating efficacy. Here, we used a poultry model of B. pilosicoli infection of layers to compare the impact of three doses of Denagard® Tiamulin. Four groups of thirty 17week old commercial pre-lay birds were all challenged with B. pilosicoli strain B2904 with three oral doses two days apart. All birds were colonised within 2days after the final oral challenge and mild onset of clinical signs were observed thereafter. A fifth group that was unchallenged and untreated was also included for comparison as healthy birds. Five days after the final oral Brachypira challenge three groups were given Denagard® Tiamulin in drinking water made up following the manufacturer's recommendations with doses verified as 58.7ppm, 113ppm and 225ppm. Weight gain body condition and the level of diarrhoea of birds infected with B. pilosicoli were improved and shedding of the organism reduced significantly (p=0.001) following treatment with Denagard® Tiamulin irrespective of dose given. The level and duration of colonisation of organs of birds infected with B. pilosicoli was also reduced. Confirming previous findings we showed that the ileum, caeca, colon, and both liver and spleen were colonised and here we demonstrated that treatment with Denagard® Tiamulin resulted in significant reduction in the numbers of Brachyspira found in each of these sites and dramatic reduction in faecal shedding (p<0.001) to approaching zero as assessed by culture of cloacal swabs. Although the number of eggs produced per bird and the level of eggshell staining appeared unaffected, egg weights of treated birds were greater than those of untreated birds for a period of approximately two weeks following treatment. These data conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of Denagard® Tiamulin in reducing B. pilosicoli infection in laying hens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachyspira pilosicoli 3abody condition 3abody weight changes 3abroiler breeders 3acecum 3acloaca 3acolon 3adiarrhea 3adrinking water 3aegg shell 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3afeed intake 3aflocks 3aileum 3alaying hens 3aliver 3amodels 3amortality 3aspleen 3astaining 3atiamulin 0aAvian intestinal spirochaetosis (AIS) 0aBrachyspira pilosicoli 0aDenagard® Tiamulin 0aPoultry model and treatment regime for AIS1 aMappley, Luke1 aLe Roy, Caroline1 aClaus, Sandrine P.1 aDavies, Paul1 aThompson, Gavin1 aLa Ragione, Roberto M.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2015 Dec., v. 103 p.87-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002600156245014600182300001800328500002000346520150700366592002801873650002201901650001301923650001401936650001601950650001701966650002401983650001802007650001402025650001202039700003302051700002002084700001702104773010902121856009002230852000902320655001202329IND60571323320221119200807.0170712e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057132332DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.tb09978.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorawicki, Rubén O.,10aBiosynthesis of 1‐Octen‐3‐ol and 10‐Oxo‐trans ‐8‐decenoic Acid Using a Crude Homogenate of Agaricus bisporus: Reaction Scale Up  ap. E367-E371.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe enzymatic reaction that produces 1 ‐octen‐3‐ol and 10‐oxo‐trans‐8‐decenoic acid was successfully scaled up from a 1 ‐L to a 10‐L bioreactor using a crude mushroom homogenate of Agaricus bisporus. For this non‐Newtonian reaction broth, the agitation rate was considered the most important controlling factor for the scale up. An agitation rate of 600 rpm, for an aeration rate of 0.44 m³/m³/h, was found to be the minimum to maintain the yield constant for the 1‐L reactor. Subsequently, the agitation rate for the 10‐L reactor was determined using 2 different approaches: a constant power per volume of liquid and a constant volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa). The constant power per volume of liquid approach predicted an agitation rate of 364 rpm that resulted in being too low to maintain the same yield obtained with the 1‐Lreactor. Measurement of the kLa for the 10‐Lreactor, at 364 rpm and an aeration of 0.44 m³/m³/h, produced a value of 11.7/h, thus confirming that the reaction in the larger reactor was oxygen‐deprived. Therefore, the use of constant volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) strategy was used instead. kLa was experimentally determined at different agitation rates for the 10‐L reactor. It was found that 750 rpm produced a kLa of 40.2/h. Confirmatory reactions were run in both reactors with the same batch of mushrooms, and the results were equivalent, thus indicating that was a good criterion for scaling up this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aaeration 3aagitation 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3aenzymatic reactions 3amass transfer 3amushrooms 3aoctenol1 aBeelman, R.

In this study, we provide an integrated assessment of climate change impacts on ecosystem services, considering uncertainties in both climate projection and model parameterization. The SWAT model was used to evaluate the impacts on water regulation, freshwater, food, and erosion regulation services for the Broye catchment in Western Switzerland. Downscaled EURO-CORDEX projections were used for three periods of thirty years: base climate (1986–2015), near future (2028–2057), and far future (2070–2099). Results reveal that in the far future, low flow is likely to decrease in summer by 77% and increase in winter by 65%, while peak flow may decrease in summer by 19% and increase in winter by 26%. Reduction in summer precipitation reduces nitrate leaching by 25%; however, nitrate concentrations are projected to increase by 14% due to reduced dilution. An increase in winter precipitation increases nitrate leaching by 44%, leading to an increase of nitrate concentration by 11% despite increasing discharge and dilution. Yields of maize and winter wheat are projected to increase in the near future but decrease in the far future because of increasing water and nutrient stress. Average grassland productivity is projected to benefit from climate change in both future periods due to the extended growing season. This increase in productivity benefits erosion regulation as better soil cover helps to decrease soil loss in winter by 5% in the far future. We conclude that water regulation, freshwater and food services will be negatively affected by climate change. Hence, agricultural management needs to be adapted to reduce negative impacts of climate change on ecosystem services and to utilize emerging production potentials. Our findings highlight the need for further studies of potentials to improve nutrient and water management under future climate conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aagricultural management 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental impact 3afood service 3afreshwater 3agrasslands 3agrowing season 3aleaching 3anitrates 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awater management 3awatersheds 3awinter 3awinter wheat 3aSwitzerland 0aWater regulation 0aFood 0aErosion regulation 0aSWAT1 aAbbaspour, Karim C.1 aHolzkämper, Annelie0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 708 p.135212-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1352123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009400171520135700265592002801622650002301650650002701673650000901700650002101709650002301730650001601753650001701769650001701786650003001803650002301833650001301856653000801869653000901877653000801886653000901894653000901903653001601912653001001928653000901938653001101947653000801958653001601966653002601982653001602008653002502024700002702049700001502076700001702091700002002108700001602128773010302144856008602247852000902333655001202342IND60679021020221122225100.0200117e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067902102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.1053802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuerta, Belinda10aSea lamprey cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics after exposure to TFM and its metabolites  aPopulation control of invasive sea lamprey relies heavily on lampricide treatment of infested streams. The lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) is thought to impair mitochondrial ATP production through uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. However, the effect of TFM on the entire electron transport chain (complexes I to V) in the mitochondria is not clear. In addition, TFM is reduced in phase I metabolism by sea lamprey at higher levels than in other fish species. The effects of these TFM reductive metabolites on mitochondria have not been explored. In this study, we sought to examine the effects of TFM and its reductive metabolite amino-TFM (TFMa) on cardiac mitochondrial oxygen consumption and membrane potential to delineate potential mechanisms for toxicity. To determine if molecules with similar structure also exhibit similar effects on mitochondria, we used 4-nitro-3-methylphenol (NMP) and its reductive metabolites 4-amino-3-methylphenol (NMPa) and 4-nitroso-3-methylphenol (NMPn) for comparisons. We found that mitochondrial bioenergetics was heavily affected with increasing concentrations of TFM, NMP, and NMPa when complexes I and II of the electron transport chain were examined, indicating that the toxic action of these compounds was exerted not only by uncoupling complex V, but also affecting complexes I and II.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetromyzon marinus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3afish 3ainvasive species 3amembrane potential 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3anitrophenols 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxygen consumption 3atoxicity 0aTFM 0aTFMa 0aNMP 0aNMPa 0aNMPn 0aNiclosamide 0aUDPGT 0aFCCP 0aRho123 0aRCR 0aSea lamprey 0aMitochondria toxicity 0aLampricides 0aReductive metabolism1 aChung-Davidson, Yu-Wen1 aBussy, Ugo1 aZhang, Yizhu1 aBazil, Jason N.1 aLi, Weiming0 tAquatic toxicology.g2020 Feb., v. 219 p.105380-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.1053803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245008400176300001600260520142700276592002801703650002001731650001501751650002201766650000901788650001301797650000901810650001601819650001101835650002101846650002001867650001001887650002101897650001601918650002101934650001701955653001301972653000901985653002001994653003302014653001702047700003402064700002302098700002302121700002602144773011402170856008302284852000902367655001202376IND60534548220221119100105.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053454822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Beusekom, Cyrina D.10aFeline hepatic biotransformation of diazepam: Differences between cats and dogs  ap. 119-125.  aIn contrast to humans and dogs, diazepam has been reported to induce severe hepatic side effects in cats, particularly after repeated dosing. With the aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this apparent sensitivity of cats to drug-induced liver injury, in a series of in vitro experiments, the feline-specific biotransformation of diazepam was studied with liver microsomes obtained from cats and dogs and the possible inhibition of the bile salt export pump (Bsep) was measured in isolated membrane vesicles overexpressing feline and canine Bsep. In line with previous in vivo studies, the phase I metabolites nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam were measurable in microsomal incubations, although enzyme velocity of demethylases and hydroxylases differed significantly between cats and dogs. In cats, the main metabolite was temazepam, which also could be glucuronidated. In contrast to dogs, no other glucuronidated metabolites could be observed. In addition, in the membrane vesicles an inhibition of the transport of the Bsep substrate taurocholic acid could be observed in the presence of diazepam and its metabolites. It was concluded that both mechanisms, the slow biotransformation of diazepam as well the inhibition of the bile acid efflux that results in an accumulation of bile acids in the hepatocytes, seem to contribute to the liver injury observed in cats following repetitive treatment with diazepam.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abile salts 3abiotransformation 3acats 3adiazepam 3adogs 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aliver 3aliver microsomes 3ametabolites 3ataurocholic acid 3atransporters 0aDiazepam 0aCats 0aGlucuronidation 0aBile salt export pump (Bsep) 0aLiver injury1 avan den Heuvel, Jeroen J.M.W.1 aKoenderink, Jan B.1 aRussel, Frans G.M.1 aSchrickx, Johannes A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2015 Dec., v. 103 p.119-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013000168500001400298520067700312592002800989650001801017650001301035650001401048650001201062653002701074653001501101653000901116653001601125653004501141700001501186773010601201856008601307852000901393655001201402IND60700246320221122042555.0201202e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070024632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.1130282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDafiah, P.M.10aVariations in the amplitude and duration of hyolaryngeal elevation during swallow: Effect of sour and carbonated liquid bolus  aNAL-light  aAltering sensory properties of food is relevant to the management of swallowing disorders.

One fundamental aspect is the need for tools to guide decisions about the allocation of human activities at sea in ways that are ecosystem-based and lead to sustainable use of resources. The MSP Directive was the main driver behind the development of spatial and non-spatial DSTs for the analysis of marine and coastal areas across European seas. In this research we develop an analytical framework designed by DST software developers and managers for the analysis of six DSTs supporting MSP in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. The framework compares the main conceptual, technical and practical aspects, by which these DSTs contribute to advancing the MSP knowledge base and identified future needs for the development of the tools. Results show that all of the studied DSTs include elements to support ecosystem-based management at different geographical scales (from national to macro-regional), relying on cumulative effects assessment and functionalities to facilitate communication at the science-policy interface. Based on our synthesis we propose a set of recommendations for knowledge exchange in relation to further DST developments, mechanisms for sharing experience among the user-developer community, and actions to increase the effectiveness of the DSTs in MSP processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acoastal zone management 3acomputer software 3aecosystem management 3ahumans 3ainformation exchange 3aBaltic Sea 3aMediterranean Sea 3aNorth Sea 0aDecision support instruments 0aGeospatial tools 0aMaritime spatial planning 0aEcosystem-based management 0aCumulative effects assessment1 aHansen, Henning Sten1 aSchrøder, Lise1 aBergström, Lena1 aRomagnoni, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2208-30171 aSteenbeek, Jeroen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7878-80751 aGonçalves, Magali1 aCarneiro, Gonçalo1 aHammar, Linus1 aJónas Pálsson,1 aCrona, Jan Schmidtbauer1 aHume, Duncan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9266-20571 aKotta, Jonne1 aFetissov, Mihhail1 aMiloš, Andžej1 aKaitaranta, Joni1 aMenegon, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4488-87450 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 209 p.105644-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1056443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009300168300001600261520133000277592002801607650002501635650001301660650001701673650001701690650001601707650002101723650000701744650002001751650000901771650001101780650002101791653002601812653002101838653002101859653002201880653001101902700002001913700002401933700002901957700001801986700002102004700001902025773011102044856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60593121120221118031056.0190207e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059312112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBush, John A.10aPrevention and management of silica scaling in membrane distillation using pH adjustment  ap. 366-377.  aMembrane scaling by silica is a major challenge in desalination, particularly for inland desalination of brackish groundwater or geothermal water, which often contain high concentrations of silica and dissolved solids. Adjustment of feed pH may reduce silica scaling risk, which is important for inland facilities that operate at high water recoveries to reduce brine disposal costs. However, water recovery of reverse osmosis is also limited due to increased osmotic pressure with feed water concentration. Membrane distillation (MD) is a thermally driven membrane desalination technique that is not limited by increased osmotic pressure of the feed. In this investigation, pH adjustment was tested as a strategy to reduce silica scaling risk in the MD process. With feed water pH less than 5 or higher than 10, scaling impacts were negligible at silica concentrations up to 600 mg/L. Scaling rates were highest at neutral pH between 6 and 8. Cleaning strategies were also explored to remove silica scale from membranes. Cleaning using NaOH solutions at pH higher than 11 to induce dissolution of silica scale was effective at temporarily restoring performance; however, some silica remained on membrane surfaces and scaling upon re-exposure to supersaturated silica concentrations occurred faster than with new membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acleaning 3adesalination 3adistillation 3agroundwater 3aosmotic pressure 3apH 3areverse osmosis 3arisk 3asilica 3asodium hydroxide 0aMembrane distillation 0aMembrane scaling 0aMembrane fouling 0aMembrane cleaning 0aSilica1 aVanneste, Johan1 aGustafson, Emily M.1 aWaechter, Christopher A.1 aJassby, David1 aTurchi, Craig S.1 aCath, Tzahi Y.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 May 15, v. 554 p.366-377dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013400172520166000306592002801966650002301994650002102017650001302038650002202051650001102073650002602084650001402110650001602124650001502140650002102155650001302176650001802189650002102207650001902228650002502247653001902272653001502291653001502306653001802321653002102339653001902360653001502379700003402394700002502428773012702453856008602580852000902666655001202675IND60676228920221118190121.0210603e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067622892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepehri, Arsalan10aInteraction between Chlorella vulgaris and nitrifying-enriched activated sludge in the treatment of wastewater with low C/N ratio  aWastewater treatment based on algae-bacteria consortia is expected to find use among other biological processes. In this report, the effects of the inoculation ratios of a Chlorella vulgaris and nitrifier-enriched-activated-sludge (NAS) consortium on nutrient removal, carbon capture, and metabolite generation were investigated under autotrophic conditions. The maximum NH₄⁺-N removal (100%) was observed within 7 days in a photo-bioreactor containing 10% C. vulgaris: 90% NAS (w/w); this consortium is referred to as B10. The maximum PO₄³⁻-P removal (87.5%) was observed in a pure culture of C. vulgaris after 14 days. Due to the fast nitrification achieved using B10, this system showed the highest nitrate accumulation value of 19.73 mg NO₃⁻-N/L at the end of the experiment. The DO concentration in B10 reached 4 mg/L due to the photosynthetic activity of C. vulgaris, providing appropriate conditions for the NAS. Among all the tested consortium ratios, B90 (90%:10% C. vulgaris/NAS, w/w) showed the highest carbon capture (156 mg), while B10 captured only 43.2 mg of carbon. Furthermore, metabolite analysis showed a positive correlation between the proportion of C. vulgaris and the generation of metabolites in the cultures. A trade-off was observed between nutrient removal and carbon capture in C. vulgaris and NAS co-cultures. Overall, our study shows that the aeration system in conventional nitrification processes could be replaced by a cleaner process based on microalgae, resulting in enhanced nutrient removal, increased carbon capture, reduced metabolite generation, and a decrease in excess sludge production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aactivated sludge 3aaeration 3aammonium nitrogen 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acoculture 3ametabolites 3amicroalgae 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrification 3aphotobioreactors 3aphotosynthesis 3awastewater treatment 0aCarbon capture 0aMetabolite 0aMicroalgae 0aNitrification 0aNutrient removal 0aPhotosynthesis 0aWastewater1 aSarrafzadeh, Mohammad-Hossein1 aAvateffazeli, Maryam0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 247 p.119164-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002900154245009600183300001600279520161700295592002801912650001401940650001301954650001101967650001301978650002001991650002002011653002402031653002002055653001302075653001702088653002202105700002802127700002402155773009502179856008902274852000902363655001202372IND60601232920221120221706.0190801e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060123292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.04.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLau, Leung Kwok Prudence10aQuality of life in a “high-rise lawless slum”: A study of the “Kowloon Walled City”  ap. 157-165.  aInformed by the ‘quality of life’ model with specific reference to Chinese culture, this article uses reliable and publicly available information seldom used in historical or heritage study to identify the designs of flats and builders of the “Kowloon Walled City” (hereafter the City) and reliable oral testimonies to refute some myths about the quality of life within it. This settlement has been notoriously misrepresented by some as a city of darkness that was razed from the face of the Earth before 1997 to fulfill a pre-war dream of the colonial government. This article confirms the view that this extremely short-lived concrete jungle, mystified as a horrifying, disorderly-built, and unplanned territory, was a product of un-organised small builders that had been hitherto unreported. The layout and designs of the housing units were different from that prescribed by the Buildings Ordinance, but were, in fact, developed within a consciously planned boundary that was a result of international politics. Although the City’s overall built environment was poor due to a lack of natural light penetration, the designs of its individual flats were comparable, if not better than, typical units in contemporary public rental housing blocks, many of which had to be demolished less than 20 years after their construction due to structural defects. This article uses the ‘quality of life’ model, which has hitherto been limited to medical and social, rather than historical or anthropological, studies, to evaluate how design and housing satisfaction affected City residents’ quality of life.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aconcrete 3amodels 3apolitics 3aquality of life 3asolar radiation 0aKowloon Walled City 0aQuality of life 0aBuilders 0aHousing unit 0aLife satisfaction1 aLai, Wai Chung Lawrence1 aHo, Chi Wing Daniel0 tLand use policy.g2018 July, v. 76 p.157-165dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.04.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013700166300001400303520105000317592002801367650003101395650001001426650002001436650002101456650001901477650001501496650001701511650001601528650001301544653003501557653001201592653000901604653001401613653001701627653000901644700001801653700002101671700002801692700002001720700001901740700002001759700002101779700002201800773011201822856008301934852000902017655001202026IND60534548320221119095855.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053454832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBezos, Javier10aEvaluation of the immunogenicity and diagnostic interference caused by M. tuberculosis SO2 vaccination against tuberculosis in goats  ap. 73-79.  aThe immunogenicity and diagnostic interference caused by M. tuberculosis SO2, a prototype vaccine first time tested in goats was evaluated. Tuberculosis-free goats were distributed in four groups: [1], non-vaccinated; [2], subcutaneously (SC) BCG vaccinated; [3], intranasally (IN) SO2 vaccinated and [4], SC SO2 vaccinated. Intradermal tuberculin and IFN-γ tests using PPDs and alternative antigenic cocktails containing mainly ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (E/C) were applied at different times post-vaccination. Results showed a significant (p<0.05) increase in the number of reactors detected using both PPD-based intradermal and IFN-γ tests at different times in all the vaccinated groups. No intradermal reactivity was detected in the vaccinated goats using a cocktail containing E/C, Rv3615c and Rv3020c. A higher overall reactivity was observed in the group [4] in comparison with the other vaccinated groups. Results showed that antigens used to differentiate BCG vaccinated animals could be potentially used to differentiate SO2 vaccinated ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3agoats 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3asulfur dioxide 3atuberculin 3atuberculosis 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aMycobacterium tuberculosis SO2 0aVaccine 0aGoat 0aDiagnosis 0aInterference 0aDIVA1 aCasal, Carmen1 aPuentes, Eugenia1 aDíez-Guerrier, Alberto1 aRomero, Beatriz1 aAguiló, Nacho1 ade Juan, Lucía1 aMartín, Carlos,1 aDomínguez, Lucas0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2015 Dec., v. 103 p.73-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009900164300001800263520144600281592002801727650001701755650002201772650001301794650001701807650001201824650002401836650002001860650001901880650002201899650001301921650001101934650001301945650001501958653002401973653000901997653001602006653001402022700005702036773013902093856007802232852000902310655001202319IND60683233320221117235515.0200207e20200116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068323332DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b214802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJannat, Mahbuba12aA Millifluidic Device with Embedded Cross-Linked Enzyme Aggregates for Degradation of H₂O₂  ap. 6768-6775.  aMillifluidic devices decorated with enzymes have been used for enzymatic reactions in continuous processes, but low enzymatic activity and enzyme leaching remain as challenges. Herein, we develop a strategy to embed cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) on the surfaces of millifluidic devices to achieve higher enzymatic activity and better stability. Catalase was chosen as a model enzyme to degrade H₂O₂ in wastewater samples. First, CLEA of catalase (153 ± 10 nm) was formed by simultaneous precipitation and cross-linking with 25.0 wt % acetonitrile containing 0.025 wt % glutaraldehyde in a millifluidic device. To immobilize CLEA, we first swell a piece of plastic tubing by using 5.0 wt % acetonitrile and then immerse it in an aqueous solution with 5.0 wt % (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and 5.0 wt % dextran polyaldehyde (DPA) subsequently. After CLEA is absorbed inside the expanded polymer network of the tubing, the tubing is tightened by using a vacuum to secure the immobilized CLEA. The millifluidic device decorated with CLEA of catalase has total activity of 660 U for degradation of H₂O₂, and it shows good stability under a flow rate of 200 μL/min. The tubing can be used to degrade 0.1 wt % H₂O₂ solution continuously for 3 h or remove 2 wt % residual H₂O₂ in wastewater for 2 h. The technique is general enough and can be applied to other types of enzymes for continuous enzymatic reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalase 3acrosslinking 3adextran 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme activity 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaching 3amodels 3apolymers 3awastewater 0amillifluidic device 0aCLEA 0areusability 0astability1 aYang, Kun-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7958-93340 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 16, v. 12, no. 5 p.6768-6775dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b214803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03942naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245011500203506007600318520191500394592002802309506003702337650002102374650002502395650002502420650001602445650001002461650001702471650001502488650003802503650001602541650001702557650002902574650002002603650001202623650001702635650003602652650001802688650000902706650003502715650002202750650004302772650002002815650002102835650002102856650005202877650003402929700001702963700001602980700001502996700001903011700001503030700001503045700001503060700001403075773011803089856007603207852000903283655001203292IND60648060020221207144321.0190626e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064806002DNAL7 a10.3390/foods80300862doi7 aPMC64631922pmcid7 a308322482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lianhong 10aPreventive Effects of Different Fermentation Times of Shuidouchi on Diphenoxylate-Induced Constipation in Mice  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study compares the prevention effects of Shuidouchi with different fermentation times on constipation in mice. Shuidouchi is a short-time fermented soybean product. By improving its processing technology, it can incur better biological activity and become a health food. The Shuidouchi-treated mice were evaluated using constipation-related kits, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Western blot assays. After the mice were fed 72-h-fermented Shuidouchi (72-SDC) for 9 d, the defecation time to excrete the first black stool was lower than that of the control and 24-SDC and 48-SDC groups, but was much higher than that of the normal group. The gastrointestinal (GI) transit of the small intestine of the 72-SDC group was higher than that of the control and the 24-SDC and 48-SDC groups, but lower that of the normal group. Meanwhile, 72-SDC could significantly increase the levels of ghrelin, endothelin-1 (ET-1), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) in the serum of constipated mice compared to the levels in mice in the control group. Moreover, 72-SDC could raise c-Kit, stem cell factor (SCF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GNDF), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels, and reduce transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels in small-intestinal tissue compared to the levels in the control group. Meanwhile, 72-SDC also raised ghrelin mRNA expression in gastric tissue and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) mRNA expression in colon tissue compared to the control group mice; these effects were stronger than those of 24-SDC and 48-SDC. Shuidouchi has good preventative effects on constipation and performs best when fermented for at least 72 h.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abioactive properties 3ablood serum 3acolon 3aconstipation 3adefecation 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aendothelins 3afermentation 3agastrointestinal transit 3agene expression 3aghrelin 3ahealth foods 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aneuronal nitric oxide synthase 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asmall intestine 3asoybean products 3astem cell factor 3atransient receptor potential vanilloid channels 3avasoactive intestinal peptide1 aZhang, Jing 1 aSuo, Huayi 1 aWang, Wei 1 aWang, Hongwei 1 aZhang, Yu 1 aHu, Qiang 1 aZhao, Xin 1 aLi, Jian 0 tFoods.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods80300863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245012800200300001800328520080900346592002801155650001701183650001101200650001401211650002301225650001301248650002201261650001801283650001401301650001301315653002601328653001801354653002801372700005801400700001901458700001801477700001901495700005901514700006001573700005601633773013901689856007801828852000901906655001201915IND60683233420221117235346.0200207e20200116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068323342DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b215582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Geun-Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8949-477710aTailored Palladium–Platinum Nanoconcave Cubes as High Performance Catalysts for the Direct Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide  ap. 6328-6335.  aTo obtain high catalytic properties, finely modulating the electronic structure and active sites of catalysts is important.

The degradation efficiency and mechanism of naproxen were determined using a series of single processes, including conventional TiO₂ photocatalyst reactors and a hybrid system that fuses them. Although the degradation efficiency tended to increase after changing the experimental condition of a single process, the optimal conditions existed for these experimental conditions. On the other hand, remarkable synergy was observed in the fused process, whose efficiency was significantly higher than that of the unit process. In particular, the optimal degradation ability was obtained by adding hydrogen peroxide together with microwave irradiation. The seven intermediates in the proposed photocatalytic degradation pathway were generated by the demethylation and hydroxylation by hydroxyl radicals. These results are expected to provide new data on the design of high efficiency photocatalytic systems at low cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademethylation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydroxylation 3amicrowave radiation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atitanium dioxide 3aunit process 0aPhotocatalyst 0aMicrowave 0aMicrowave discharge electrodeless lamp 0aNaproxen 0aDegradation mechanism1 aBang, Hye-Jin1 aLee, Heon1 aKim, Hangun1 aHa, Hyung-Ho1 aYu, Young Hyun1 aPark, Young-Kwon0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 708 p.135216-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1352163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011200161300001800273520143500291592002801726650001601754650002001770650003901790650002901829650001101858650001901869650002301888650001501911650001701926650001501943700002901958700002401987700002402011773012002035856007502155852000902230655001202239IND60558861420221122222704.0161118e20130516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055886142DNAL7 a10.1021/jp402469d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlioaia, Cristian10aChanges in the Energy Transfer Pathways within Photosystem II Antenna Induced by Xanthophyll Cycle Activity  ap. 5841-5847.  aEnergy transfer pathways between photosystem II (PSII) antenna complexes in intact thylakoid membranes have been studied using low-temperature (77 K) excitation fluorescence spectroscopy. The focus of this study was to see whether de-epoxidation of violaxanthin into zeaxanthin causes any alterations in the energetic couplings between the core antenna complexes CP43 and CP47 and the peripheral light-harvesting antenna (LHCII). It was discovered that the appearance of zeaxanthin caused characteristic alterations in the PSII excitation fluorescence spectra in the Soret-band region. While in the dark violaxanthin was found to be largely uncoupled from any emitting chlorophylls, its intensive de-epoxidation resulted in the appearance of two additional bands at 509 and 492 nm. The former was attributed to weak coupling of zeaxanthin to emitters in the CP43 and LHCII complexes and the latter to efficient coupling of violaxanthin of the CP29 complex to emitters in the CP43, CP47, and LHCII complexes. The role of CP29-bound violaxanthin is discussed in light of both its efficient energetic coupling and strong physical binding to this complex. The finding that zeaxanthin is energetically coupled to chlorophyll a emitters of the PSII antenna is discussed with respect to its suggested role as a quencher involved in photoprotective energy dissipation, or non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), in the photosynthetic membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alight harvesting complex 3alutein 3aphotosystem II 3aphysical chemistry 3athylakoids 3aviolaxanthin 3azeaxanthin1 aDuffy, Christopher

Catches are dominated by American lobster (Homarus americanus) landed entirely in Atlantic Canada and northeastern United States. In Atlantic Canada, lobster fishing and marine finfish aquaculture take place in the same coastal waters creating the potential for negative environmental, as well as social, interactions. We review the state of knowledge of environmental interactions between American lobster, their habitat and fishery, and marine finfish aquaculture. We first provide a brief overview of key biological, behavioural, and ecological processes and environmental stressors of American lobster at different life-history stages followed by an overview of the pathways of effects of marine finfish aquaculture on coastal ecosystems in general and on American lobster. Our review found that certain finfish aquaculture-lobster interactions have received considerable study (e.g., chemical use), whereas knowledge of other interactions are either limited (e.g., net pens, waste discharges) or lacking (e.g., disease, noise, lights, and odours). An ecosystem-based approach to aquaculture has been proposed for managing these interactions but implementing this approach has proven to be a challenge in part because of complex multi-sector, multi-stakeholder and multi-agency governance issues. While governance solutions await development, practical measures based on the results of scientific research identified in this review, such as better use of existing oceanographic and bathymetric data, habitat and human impact assessment tools, and toxicity information offer regulators ample information and management tools, at least at the farm- and bay-scale, to avoid negative finfish aquaculture-lobster interactions in Atlantic Canada. Bridging the governance gap will likely require new community-based management models that more effectively identify, generate, and integrate local community and fisher knowledge and concerns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomarus americanus 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoastal zone management 3afish culture 3agovernance 3ahabitats 3alife history 3alobsters 3amarine fish 3atoxicity 3aCanada 0aAmerican lobster 0aMarine finfish aquaculture 0aLife-history stages 0aEnvironmental impacts 0aManagement tools1 aSmith, Ruth E.1 aLotze, Heike K.0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 210 p.105664-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1056643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011800164520127900282592002801561650001501589650001901604650002101623650001501644650002101659650001201680650001301692650001301705650001301718653001201731653002101743653001201764653003101776700001701807700001501824700001201839700001501851700001901866773011301885856008601998852000902084655001202093IND60676229320221118190845.0210603e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067622932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Sen10aGreen recovery of lithium from geothermal water based on a novel lithium iron phosphate electrochemical technique  aWith the increasing demands for lithium, the recovery of lithium from liquid minerals has become a research focus worldwide. The green recovery of a low concentration of lithium from geothermal water was carried out in this work based on the LiFePO₄/FePO₄ technique. The composite LiFePO₄ electrode was prepared first and then electrochemically delithiated to obtain a FePO₄ electrode. When the LiFePO₄ and FePO₄ electrodes were used to construct an electrochemical system in an H-type electrolytic cell, it had high response to low concentrations of Li⁺ at 1.0 V. The electrochemical adsorption capacity was successfully increased by 57.02% which was 17.10 mg g⁻¹ in the geothermal water by using PEG-6000 as a poregen to obtain pore structures on the surface of electrode. The recovery rate of Li⁺ reached 90.65% after eight adsorption-desorption cycles. Subsequently, a novel electrochemical device was proposed for the recovery of low concentrations of Li⁺ by the LiFePO₄/FePO₄ technique. Only electrical energy was consumed and no organic solvents or other toxic reagents were used during the recovery process. All these properties make the developed method a green and promising candidate for the recovery of Li⁺ from geothermal water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aferric phosphate 3alithium 3aminerals 3asolvents 3atoxicity 0aLithium 0aGeothermal water 0aLiFePO4 0aElectrochemical adsorption1 aYu, Xiaoping1 aLi, Mingli1 aDuo, Ji1 aGuo, Yafei1 aDeng, Tianlong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 247 p.119178-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245016000202506007600362520133600438592002801774506003701802650000901839650001701848650001101865650002501876650002301901650001801924650001301942650001401955650001801969650002601987650002302013700002302036700002202059773011802081856007602199852000902275655001202284IND60648060320221207144336.0190626e20190313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064806032DNAL7 a10.3390/foods80300972doi7 aPMC64629992pmcid7 a308712122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aListrat, Anne 10aStudy of the Chronology of Expression of Ten Extracellular Matrix Molecules during the Myogenesis in Cattle to Better Understand Sensory Properties of Meat  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe sensory properties of beef are known to depend on muscle fiber and intramuscular connective tissue composition (IMCT). IMCT is composed of collagens, proteoglycans and glycoproteins. The differentiation of muscle fibers has been extensively studied but there is scarcity in the data concerning IMCT differentiation. In order to be able to control muscle differentiation to improve beef quality, it is essential to understand the ontogenesis of IMCT molecules. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the chronology of appearance of 10 IMCT molecules in bovine Semitendinosus muscle using immunohistology technique at five key stages of myogenesis. Since 60 days post-conception (dpc), the whole molecules were present, but did not have their final location. It seems that they reach it at around 210 dpc. Then, the findings emphasized that since 210 dpc, the stage at which the differentiation of muscle fibers is almost complete, the differentiation of IMCT is almost completed. These data suggested that for the best controlling of the muscular differentiation to improve beef sensory quality, it would be necessary to intervene very early (before the IMCT constituents have acquired their definitive localization and the muscle fibers have finished differentiating), i.e., at the beginning of the first third of gestation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeef 3abeef quality 3acattle 3aextracellular matrix 3amuscle development 3amuscle fibers 3aontogeny 3apregnancy 3aproteoglycans 3asemitendinosus muscle 3asensory properties1 aGagaoua, Mohammed 1 aPicard, Brigitte 0 tFoods.g2019 Mar. 13, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods80300973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010100168520151800269592002801787650001901815650001401834650002301848650001101871650004901882650001201931650002201943650001401965650001801979650001901997650001402016650001002030650000702040650001102047650002402058650002502082650001502107653002402122653001002146653002802156653002602184653002202210700002002232700001402252700001802266700001602284773011302300856008602413852000902499655001202508IND60676229420221118190834.0200712e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067622942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xingyue10aDegradation of phenol with heterogeneous catalytic ozonation enhanced by high gravity technology  aIn order to intensify the mass transfer of ozone and improve organic mineralization efficiency of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation, a rotating packed bed (RPB) reactor with heterogeneous catalytic ozonation was performed to mineralize phenol wastewater with the Fe–Mn–Cu/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst (Cat) as packing. The effects of the high gravity factor (β), liquid flow rate (QL), initial pH, inlet ozone concentration (CO₃), and phenol concentration (Cₚₕₑ) on the phenol mineralization were investigated. The experimental results determined the optimal process regime involving a high gravity factor of 40, a phenol concentration of 100 mg/L, an inlet ozone concentration of 60 mg/L, a gas flow rate of 60 L/h, an initial pH of 6 and liquid flow rate of 85 L/h. After the wastewater was treated for 30 min, the total organic carbon removal rate (ηTOC) reached 96.42%. Compared with the performance of the Cat/O₃-BR (bubbling reactor) and RPB-O₃ system, the high gravity technology could increase the ηTOC related with the phenol wastewater by 21% and 57.27%, respectively. Possible reaction mechanism of Cat/O₃-RPB system was proposed to be hydroxyl radical oriented by adding tert-butanol reagent and electron paramagnetic resonance technology, and a plausible degradation pathway of phenol was proposed and discussed. In conclusion, it can be observed that the coupling of RPB and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation technology to mineralize phenol wastewater is an effective method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3agravity 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amanganese 3amass transfer 3amineralization 3aozonation 3aozone 3apH 3aphenol 3areaction mechanisms 3atotal organic carbon 3awastewater 0aRotating packed bed 0aOzone 0aHeterogeneous catalysis 0aDegradation mechanism 0aPhenol wastewater1 aShao, Shengjuan1 aDing, Xin1 aJiao, Weizhou1 aLiu, Youzhi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 248 p.119179-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245015100182500001400333520146500347592002801812650001601840650002001856650001301876650002801889650002501917650002401942650001501966650001001981650002201991650000902013650002402022650000902046650001602055650001702071650001802088653007002106653002702176653002902203700002102232700003002253773010602283856008602389852000902475655001202484IND60700246920221122054911.0201202e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070024692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.1130342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbrahimi-Ghiri, Mohaddeseh10aCombined treatment of scopolamine and group III mGluR antagonist, CPPG, exerts antidepressant activity without affecting anxiety-related behaviors  aNAL-light  aClinical trials have revealed that the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine produces a fast and potent antidepressant response. However, the anticholinergic adverse effects and the risk of psychosis at higher doses limit the widespread clinical use of scopolamine. Combination therapy of scopolamine and other antidepressants in treating depression has been suggested. Our experimentswere designed to examine the effects of the combining ineffective doses of scopolamine and a group III metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist, CPPG, on depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in male NMRI mice. The forced swim test (FST) and the elevated plus maze (EPM) were selected to evaluate depression- and anxiety-related behaviors, respectively. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of scopolamine (0.01-0.5 mg/kg) exerted profound antidepressive and anxiogenic effects. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of CPPG (12.5-50 nmol/mouse) elicited significant antidepressive and anxiolytic effects. Moreover, the ineffective dose of CPPG (12.5 nmol/mouse) plus ineffective doses of scopolamine (0.01 or 0.05 mg/kg) showed antidepressant-like effect while these combinations had no effect anxiety-related behaviors. It should be noted that none of the compounds altered locomotor activity. Results identify the combined administration of scopolamine and CPPG as a possible hopeful target in the future treatment of the depressive disorder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aantidepressants 3abehavior 3aelevated plus-maze test 3aforced swimming test 3aglutamate receptors 3alocomotion 3amales 3amental depression 3amice 3amuscarine receptors 3arisk 3ascopolamine 3atherapeutics 3atranquilizers 0aGroup III metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist CPPG 0aForced swim test (FST) 0aElevated plus maze (EPM)1 aKhakpai, Fatemeh1 aZarrindast, Mohammad-Reza0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 224 p.113034-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.1130343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01732naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245007100172300002000243520056800263592002800831650001400859650002300873650002300896650002900919650001100948650001100959650002200970650000900992700003201001700005701033700006701090773013701157856007901294852000901373655001201382IND60615180820221118070339.0181009e20180904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061518082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b017632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichel, Nicholas W.

Alkene additives were found to inhibit catalysis, suggesting that avoiding β-hydride elimination side reactions is essential for productive catalysis. An enantioenriched allylic ester undergoes enantiospecific cross-coupling to produce an enantioenriched allylic nitrile. This method was applied to an efficient synthesis of (±)-naproxen from commercially available starting materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acatalytic activity 3achemical structure 3across-coupling reactions 3aesters 3anickel 3aorganic chemistry 3azinc1 aJeanneret, Alexandria D.

The N115-g-PSBMA membrane has shown higher hydrophilicity, lower vanadium permeability, higher coulombic efficiency and energy efficiency than that of commercial N115 membrane for VRB (vanadium redox flow battery) application. At the current density of 40–80 mA cm−2, the average energy efficiency of the VRB with N115-g-PSBMA membrane has reached up to 87.3%, which is 2.6% higher than that of the VRB with N115 membrane at the same current densities.

This study reveals an exceptional behavior of PG5 within the homologous series of g-generation PGg polymers. Three molecular configurations, which present a heterogeneous distribution of dendrons and an amount of backfolding lower than PG4 and PG6, have been obtained for PG5. The highest stability and closest agreement with available experimental data corresponds to a helical conformation characterized by a pitch of about 30 Å, thickness of 105 Å, and average density of 0.861 g/cm³. While small angle neutron scattering studies of PG5 in solution show a constant radial density distribution around the backbone, we here in our vacuum studies find a cylindrical volume element of sharply reduced density reminiscent of a pore. This neutral PG5 was compared with its charged deprotected analogue, dePG5 in water, to see in as much the positive charges in the periphery of this macromolecule would affect its conformational behavior. During deprotection of PG5, the tert-butyloxycarbonyl protected amine groups are converted into ammonium, mimicking the experimental situation during a divergent synthesis procedure. The repulsive interactions among the positively charged ammonium groups are responsible for a huge (∼30%) reduction of the average density and a small (∼1%) increase of elongation of the helical backbone, which results in a structure with a spongy appearance. Also here, we find a reduced dendron density near the backbone which is compensated for by the pore being filled with water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acomputer simulation 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers1 aZhang, Baozhong1 aSchlüter, A.-Dieter,1 aKröger, Martin,1 aAlemán, Carlos,0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 May 16, v. 117, no. 19 p.6007-6017dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp402695g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008400168520124400252592002801496650001201524650002301536650001901559650001101578650001001589650002301599650001501622650001301637650001401650650001401664650001401678650001001692650001501702653001201717653002201729653001501751653002801766653001601794700001201810700001901822700001701841700001901858700001701877700002001894700001301914773011301927856008602040852000902126655001202135IND60676229620221118190010.0200712e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067622962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Xuejun10aEnhancing microalgae growth and landfill leachate treatment through ozonization  aPhycoremediation of landfill leachate (LL) with microalgae is a promising approach but the performances are usually inhibited by complex macromolecular organics and high chromaticity of the LL. To realize high-efficiency LL remediation and microalgae biomass production, a technique integrating ozonization and microalgae bioremediation was proposed, in which the LL was first pretreated with ozone to degrade most macromolecular organics and reduce chromaticity. Then the oxidized LL was remediated with microalgae biofilm to reclaim nutrients and produce biomass. Results showed that chromaticity was sharply reduced from 1400 to 45 Pt–Co and macromolecular organics were significantly reduced from 93.3% in the untreated LL to 54.8% in the oxidized LL via ozonization under 45 mg O₃/L for 45 min. The oxidized LL effectively enhanced microalgae growth and nitrogen removal. Then a phosphorus-feeding strategy was adopted to obtain different nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) molar ratio of 33:1, 16:1; 7:1 and 3:1 for further enhancement of microalgae growth and nitrogen removal. As results, the maximum biofilm density of 28.0 g/m² and the highest nitrogen removal efficiency of 81.6% under N/P molar ratio of 16:1 were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3abiomass production 3abioremediation 3acobalt 3acolor 3alandfill leachates 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3aphosphorus 0aBiomass 0aLandfill leachate 0aMicroalgae 0aMacromolecular organics 0aOzonization1 aHu, Rui1 aChang, Haixing1 aTang, Xiaoyu1 aHuang, Xiaoxue1 aZheng, Zhen,1 aZhong, Nianbing1 aYang, Lu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 248 p.119182-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245010400178300001600282520107500298592002801373650002301401650002301424650002201447650001301469650001101482650001901493650002801512651001001540653002001550653001701570653002801587653002301615653001501638653002501653700002301678700002601701700002301727773009501750856008901845852000901934655001201943IND60601233420221120232539.0190801e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060123342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaviano, Marialuisa10aManaging protected areas as cultural landscapes: The case of the Alta Murgia National Park in Italy  ap. 290-299.  aThis paper proposes a managerial and policy view of land use based on the systems perspective. The focus is on protected areas as a significant example of a management approach to land use that suffers from a dominant reductionist view objectively focused on conservation and protection activities. Conversely, the need for a more holistic and open view has emerged over time, requiring a paradigm change in the approach to natural resource management. Starting from identifying the key values of protected areas to leverage in a wider enhancement policy, our findings suggest that, through the adoption of a systems view and an integrated management approach, the cultural value of protected areas as models for promoting sustainable development in the surrounding territory can provide leverage in an effective valorisation policy. The key elements of a systems-based management approach are highlighted through the analysis of Alta Murgia National Park in Italy, an example case in which the naturalistic value of the site is enhanced through its cultural dimensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3acultural landscape 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amodels 3anational parks 3asustainable development 3aItaly 0aProtected areas 0aSystems view 0aViable systems approach 0aCultural landscape 0aManagement 0aSustainable land use1 aDi Nauta, Primiano1 aMontella, Marta Maria1 aSciarelli, Fabiana0 tLand use policy.g2018 July, v. 76 p.290-299dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012000171506002800291520077200319592002801091506003701119650001801156650001201174650002301186650001301209650001701222773009601239856008301335852000901418655001201427IND60739667020221207052239.0201009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073966702DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202024000192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulnora, Denisova10aDevelopment pattern of the endemic of Baikal Siberia – Dracocephalum popovii T.V.

In magnitude, the global transfer of arable land use is estimated to be around 40% of the total direct exploitation. The connections as well as imbalances of major economies in intermediate and final trades of arable land use are discussed. Canada, Australia, Argentina, Pakistan and African regions turn out to have a massive deficit of arable land use in both intermediate and final trades. In contrast, the United States, Japan, Mainland China, the United Kingdom, Germany and France obtain a surplus of arable land use in both intermediate and final trades by land displacement in those net exporters. Indices in terms of arable land use self-sufficiency rate by source and that by sink are devised. For India as the biggest source region, around 20% of the arable land resources exploited locally are for final consumption abroad. For the United States as the largest sink region, around 40% of its arable land use originates from foreign regions led by Canada. For Japan as the biggest net importer in both intermediate and final trades, over 90% of its arable land use comes from foreign economies led by African and Asian regions. For sustained development, regions are suggested to be more adapted to the global supply chain based on their behaviors in both intermediate and final trades of arable land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3aland resources 3aland use 3asupply chain 3aArgentina 3aAustralia 3aCanada 3aChina 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aIndia 3aJapan 3aPakistan 3aUnited Kingdom 3aUnited States 0aArable land use 0aEmbodiment accounting 0aPrimary inputs 0aSource 0aSink 0aTrade imbalance1 aGuo, J.L.1 aHan, M.Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0123-55171 aChen, G.Q.0 tLand use policy.g2018 July, v. 76 p.201-214dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245010700203506007600310520116000386592002801546506003701574650001901611650001201630650002001642650002101662650002101683650001401704650001401718650001301732650000701745650002001752650001601772650001301788650001701801650001701818650002001835650002701855650001901882700002201901700001801923773011801941856007602059852000902135655001202144IND60648060620221207141600.0190626e20190317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064806062DNAL7 a10.3390/foods80301002doi7 aPMC64629232pmcid7 a308848872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstrada, Olaia 10aSalt Distribution in Raw Sheep Milk Cheese during Ripening and the Effect on Proteolysis and Lipolysis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe salt distribution process in artisanal sheep cheese with an innovative shape of eight lobes was investigated. The cheese was subjected to two brining conditions: 24 h with brine at 16&deg;Baum&eacute; and 12 h at 22&deg;Baum&eacute;. The chemical composition (pH, water activity, dry matter, fat, and protein content), proteolysis (nitrogen fractions and free amino acids), and lipolysis (free fatty acids) were evaluated in two sampling zones (internal and external) at 1, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 days of ripening. The whole cheese reached a homogeneous salt distribution at 180 days of ripening. Brining conditions did not have an influence on the rate of salt penetration, but on the final sodium chloride (NaCl) content. Cheese with higher salt content (3.0%) showed increased proteolysis and lipolysis as compared to cheese with lower salt content (2.2%). Proteolysis index and total free fatty acids did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between internal and external zones of cheese. It is suggested that producers start marketing this artisanal cheese at 6 months of ripening, when it has uniform composition and salt distribution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aartisan cheese 3abrining 3acheese ripening 3afree amino acids 3afree fatty acids 3alipolysis 3amarketing 3anitrogen 3apH 3aprotein content 3aproteolysis 3araw milk 3asalt content 3asheep cheese 3asodium chloride 3atraditional technology 3awater activity1 aAriño, Agustín 1 aJuan, Teresa 0 tFoods.g2019 Mar. 17, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods80301003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245013200201300001800333506007600351520135600427592002801783506003701811650002501848650001201873650001501885650003001900650001301930650002601943650003001969650002201999650001202021650001402033650002102047650002702068700001602095700001802111700001902129700001202148700001802160773011502178856007702293852000902370655001202379IND60171874320221207100640.0150602e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017187432DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.112.1971522doi7 aPMC34252182pmcid7 a227406152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yuanai14aThe Ankyrin-Repeat Transmembrane Protein BDA1 Functions Downstream of the Receptor-Like Protein SNC2 to Regulate Plant Immunity  ap. 1857-1865.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlants utilize a large number of immune receptors to recognize pathogens and activate defense responses. A small number of these receptors belong to the receptor-like protein family. Previously, we showed that a gain-of-function mutation in the receptor-like protein SNC2 (for Suppressor of NPR1, Constitutive2) leads to constitutive activation of defense responses in snc2-1D mutant plants. To identify defense signaling components downstream of SNC2, we carried out a suppressor screen in the snc2-1D mutant background of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Map-based cloning of one of the suppressor genes, BDA1 (for bian da ; “becoming big” in Chinese), showed that it encodes a protein with amino-terminal ankyrin repeats and carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domains. Loss-of-function mutations in BDA1 suppress the dwarf morphology and constitutive defense responses in snc2-1D npr1-1 (for nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes1,1) and also result in enhanced susceptibility to bacterial pathogens. In contrast, a gain-of-function allele of bda1 isolated from a separate genetic screen to search for mutants with enhanced pathogen resistance was found to constitutively activate cell death and defense responses. These data suggest that BDA1 is a critical signaling component that functions downstream of SNC2 to regulate plant immunity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aalleles 3acell death 3again-of-function mutation 3aimmunity 3aimmunologic receptors 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3apathogens 3asuppressor genes 3atransmembrane proteins1 aZhang, Yaxi1 aDing, Pingtao1 aJohnson, Kaeli1 aLi, Xin1 aZhang, Yuelin0 tPlant physiology.g2012 Aug., v. 159, no. 4 p.1857-1865dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.112.1971523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128245009600146300001600242500001900258520076400277536025901041592002801300596009501328650001501423650001201438650001501450650001201465650001501477653001901492653001301511653001101524653002601535653002301561700005801584700001301642773011901655856008001774852000901854655001201863IND60735930220221120213533.0210429e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073593022DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642219897702doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aDark Knowledge and Platform Governance: A Case of an Illicit E-Commerce Community in Reddit  ap. 779-799.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study examines the dark information commons in Reddit, a pseudonymous social news site, in the context of illicit e-commerce communities. Unlike market forums that are hosted in the dark web, Reddit is open to users of both the clear and dark web, unwittingly serving as a gateway for potential newcomers to learn and prepare their entrance into darknet market systems. To illustrate how information commons in Reddit bolster the resilience of illicit e-commerce communication ecology, this study presents information and knowledge flows in a subreddit community dedicated to a now-defunct market called AlphaBay. This study expands the discussion of the challenges that Reddit, as information commons, encounters in governing the flow of dark knowledge.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was sponsored by the Army Research Office and was accomplished under Grant Number W911NF-19-1-0066.  aPublisher supplied data  aW911NF-19-1-0066cArmy Research Officedhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100000183 3ae-commerce 3aecology 3agovernance 3amarkets 3ascientists 0adarknet market 0adark web 0aReddit 0aanonymous communities 0aillicit e-commerce1 aKwon, K.

These intracellular bacteria confer upon their hosts a phenomenon called the killer trait. It is the ability to kill symbiont-free competitors called sensitives. The R-body is the crucial element of this process, but despite many efforts, the actual role of R-bodies in killing sensitive paramecia is still not satisfactory clarified. The open question is whether the R-body acts as transmitter for a yet unidentified toxin or whether it directly kills sensitive paramecia having intrinsic cytotoxic effects. In the present study, this problem is addressed by heterologous expression of Caedibacter taeniospiralis R-body in Escherichia coli followed by a detailed analysis of its potential intrinsic toxic effect on feeding sensitive Paramecium tetraurelia. Using this approach, we can exclude any eventual effects of additional, unidentified factors produced by C. taeniospiralis and thus observe the impact of the recombinant R-body itself. No cytotoxic effects of recombinant R-bodies were detected following this approach, strengthening the hypothesis that R-bodies act as releasing system for an unidentified C. taeniospiralis toxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aParamecium tetraurelia 3abacteria 3acytotoxicity 3aendosymbionts 3ahosts1 aGalati, Stefano1 aAltenbuchner, Josef1 aSchweikert, Michael1 aGörtz, Hans-Dieter1 aPetroni, Giulio0 tEuropean journal of protistology.g2012 Nov., v. 48, no. 4 p.290-296dElsevier GmbHx0932-47397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejop.2012.01.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013000157300001800287520145600305592002801761650002301789650001501812650001301827650001501840650001001855650001701865650002001882650002101902650001101923650001201934653003701946653002101983653002802004653001602032700001902048700002102067700001902088773012302107856007502230852000902305655001202314IND60527601720221119082430.0160715e20130424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052760172DNAL7 a10.1021/am40041232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jem-Kun10aTwo-Dimensional Periodic Relief Grating as a Versatile Platform for Selective Immunosorbent Assay and Visualizing of Antigens  ap. 3348-3355.  aIn this study, we fabricated a nanopillar array of silicon oxide, involving very-large-scale integration (VLSI) and reactive ion etching (RIE), as two-dimensional periodic relief gratings (2DPRGs) on Si surfaces. Antihuman ALB was successively oriented on the pillar surface of 2DPRG modified protein G as an optical detector that is specific for targeted antigen. The antibody modified 2DPRG alone produces insignificant structure change, but upon immunocapture of antigens, the antigen filling in the 2DPRG leads to a dramatic change of the pillar scale. Binding of the antibodies to the 2DPRG occurs in a way that still allows them to function and selectively bind antigen. The performance of the sensor was evaluated by capturing HRP-human ALB on the antibody-modified 2DPRG and measuring the effective refractive index (nₑff) resulting from the attachment of antigens. The nₑff values of the 2DPRG are found to relate with the pillar scale of the 2DPRG, generated by antigen coupling, resulting in color change from pure green to orange, observed by the naked eye along an incident angle of 10–20°. Moreover, we calculated the filling factors inside the 2DPRG with effective-medium theory to verify the pillar structure changes. This technique eliminates much of the surface modifications and the secondary immunochemical or enzyme-linked steps that are common in immunoassays. Such films have potential applications as optical biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangle of incidence 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiosensors 3acolor 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunochemistry 3arefractive index 3asilica 3asilicon 0atwo-dimensional periodic grating 0arefractive index 0aeffective medium theory 0aimmunoassay1 aZhou, Gang-Yan1 aHuang, Chih-Feng1 aChang, Jia-Yaw0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Apr. 24, v. 5, no. 8 p.3348-3355dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40041233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245013900205300001100344506007600355520132200431592002801753596007501781596005901856596005901915506003701974650002702011650002502038650001102063650002202074650001402096650001202110650002002122650002102142650002102163650002102184650001902205650001802224650002202242650000902264650001802273650002502291650002102316650001402337650000902351650002502360650001402385650002302399650001002422650001602432650002402448650002402472650001302496700001702509700001202526700001702538700001302555700001702568700001602585700001402601700002202615700002102637700001402658773011102672856008202783852000902865655001202874IND60612737520221207105224.0190919e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061273752DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-018-0582-22doi7 aPMC61279042pmcid7 a301898942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jie Feng10aProtective immunity against Trichinella spiralis in mice elicited by oral vaccination with attenuated Salmonella-delivered TsSP1.2 DNA  ap. 87.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTrichinellosis is a worldwide important food-borne zoonosis caused mainly by ingesting raw or undercooked pork infected with Trichinella spiralis larvae. The development of vaccine is needed for preventing swine from Trichinella infection to ensure pork safety. Previous studies showed that T. spiralis serine protease 1.2 (TsSP1.2) is a vaccine candidate against Trichinella infection. In this study, the complete TsSP1.2 cDNA sequences were cloned into pcDNA3.1, and the rTsSP1.2 DNA was transformed into attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain ΔcyaSL1344. Oral vaccination of mice with Salmonella-delivered rTsSP1.2 DNA vaccine induced an obvious intestinal mucosal IgA response and a systemic Th1/Th2 immune response; the vaccinated mice showed a 33.45% reduction of intestinal adult worms and 71.84% reduction of muscle larvae after T. spiralis larval challenge. The protection might be due to the rTsSP1.2-induced production of specific anti-TsSP1.2 sIgA, IgG, IgG1/IgG2a, and secretion of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10, which protected intestinal mucosa from the parasite invasion, inhibited worm development and reduced female fecundity. The results indicate that the attenuated Salmonella-delivered rTsSP1.2 DNA vaccine offers a prospective strategy for the prevention and control of animal Trichinella infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0501302cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aU1704284cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81471981cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aadults 3acomplementary DNA 3afecundity 3afemales 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-4 3aintestinal mucosa 3amice 3amuscle larvae 3anucleotide sequences 3aoral vaccination 3aparasites 3apork 3arecombinant vaccines 3asecretion 3aserine proteinases 3aswine 3atrichinosis 3avaccine development 3aveterinary medicine 3azoonoses1 aGuo, Kai Xia1 aQi, Xin1 aLei, Jun Jun1 aHan, Yue1 aYan, Shu Wei1 aJiang, Peng1 aYu, Chuan1 aCheng, Xiang Chao1 aWang, Zhong Quan1 aCui, Jing0 tVeterinary research.g2018 Dec., v. 49, no. 1 p.87-87dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4142873x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-018-0582-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011400164300001600278520108200294592002801376650001101404650001401415650002001429650003301449650001001482653002801492653002501520653004201545653002501587653002201612700001201634700001801646700002001664700001501684700002101699773013501720856008201855852000901937655001201946IND60742005820221121065838.0210806e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074200582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wse.2021.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Ming-jie10aEstimation of unloading relaxation depth of Baihetan Arch Dam foundation using long-short term memory network  ap. 149-158.  aThe unloading relaxation caused by excavation for construction of high arch dams is an important factor influencing the foundation's integrity and strength. To evaluate the degree of unloading relaxation, the long-short term memory (LSTM) network was used to estimate the depth of unloading relaxation zones on the left bank foundation of the Baihetan Arch Dam. Principal component analysis indicates that rock characteristics, the structural plane, the protection layer, lithology, and time are the main factors. The LSTM network results demonstrate the unloading relaxation characteristics of the left bank, and the relationships with the factors were also analyzed. The structural plane has the most significant influence on the distribution of unloading relaxation zones. Compared with massive basalt, the columnar jointed basalt experiences a more significant unloading relaxation phenomenon with a clear time effect, with the average unloading relaxation period being 50 d. The protection layer can effectively reduce the unloading relaxation depth by approximately 20%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3alithology 3aneural networks 3aprincipal component analysis 3awater 0aColumnar jointed basalt 0aUnloading relaxation 0aLong-short term memory (LSTM) network 0aStability assessment 0aBaihetan Arch Dam1 aLi, Hao1 aXu, Jian-rong1 aWang, Huan-ling1 aXu, Wei-ya1 aChen, Shi-zhuang0 tWater Science and Engineering.g2021 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.149-158dElsevier B.V.aHohai UniversitywJournal:23243x1674-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wse.2021.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245006600154300001600220520147400236592002801710650002501738650002401763650001401787650001301801650001801814650001101832650001301843650001301856650002201869650001701891650001501908651001201923700001501935700001601950700001601966700001401982773011401996856003902110852000902149655001202158IND4485914720221119221740.0120907e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448591472DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.15002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouton, A. M.10aEvaluation of riparian habitat restoration in a lowland river  ap. 845-857.  aFor many years, navigable lowland rivers have been embanked artificially or suffered from substantial shipping wave action, leading to habitat degradation. Recently, riparian habitats were restored by creating foreshores and spawning grounds in the river Yser, a lowland river in Flanders, Belgium. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the role of these restored habitats for spawning and nursery of juvenile fish. To cover a wide range of anthropogenic disruption, four riparian mesohabitat types were selected and compared, ranging from semi‐natural over artificial spawning grounds and foreshores to artificial embankments. Juvenile fish were subjected to sampling by using electrofishing between June and September 2009 at different microhabitats located in five sites of each riparian mesohabitat type. Juvenile fish strongly preferred natural riparian habitats, whereas artificial embankments showed the lowest species richness, abundance and functional organization of juvenile fish species. Restored riparian habitats appeared to be an appropriate alternative for artificial embankments in navigable lowland rivers but still score significantly less than natural habitats. Juvenile fish avoided bare microhabitats but did not prefer any other microhabitat type (reed, woody or grassy vegetation), emphasizing the importance of microhabitat diversity. This paper provides valuable insights into riparian habitat restoration to river managers and stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitat destruction 3ajuveniles 3amanagers 3amicrohabitats 3arivers 3ashipping 3aspawning 3aspecies diversity 3astakeholders 3avegetation 3aBelgium1 aBuysse, D.1 aStevens, M.1 aNeucker, T.1 aCoeck, J.0 tRiver research and applications.g2012 Sept., v. 28, no. 7 p.845-857dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.1500  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016800172300001600340520168200356592002802038650002202066650001102088650002102099650002002120650001202140650001202152650002202164650001502186650002002201650002002221650002502241653002002266653001102286653001102297653001202308653001102320653001802331700003002349700002002379700001902399773009002418856008502508852000902593655001202602IND60617972020221122051331.0190214e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061797202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzadbakht, Mohsen10aApplication of artificial neural network method for prediction of osmotic pretreatment based on the energy and exergy analyses in microwave drying of orange slices  ap. 836-845.  aIn the present study, artificial neural network (ANN) method was applied for predicting osmotic pretreatment based on the energy and exergy analyses in microwave drying of orange slices. For this purpose, the oranges were cut into slices with a thickness of 4 mm and treated with salt (NaCl) and distilled water solution (7% by weight) for 30, 60, and 90 min as osmosis pre-treatment. Then, they were dried in three replicates using a microwave dryer and at three powers of 90, 360, and 900 W. The statistical analysis results showed that the osmosis time is significant for the energy efficiency and exergy efficiency and specific exergy loss at 1% level. The highest energy and exergy efficiency was observed at 900 W and in the osmosis time of 90 min. The highest energy and exergy efficiency was observed at 42.1% and 31.08%, respectively. The maximum exergy loss was seen at 360 W and osmosis time of 60 min. The osmosis time did not affect the specific energy loss. The microwave power was statistically significant for all the parameters (energy and exergy) such that with increasing the microwave power, the energy and exergy efficiency increased, while the specific exergy and energy loss decreased. Overall, with increasing osmosis time and microwave power, the energy and exergy levels of the microwave dryer increased. The maximum coefficient of determination (R2) in a network containing 6 neurons in the hidden layer was 0.999 for energy efficiency, R2 = 0.871 for specific energy loss, R2 = 0.999 for specific exergy loss, and R2 = 0.972 for exergy efficiency. This amount was seen in a network containing 4 neurons in the hidden layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3amicrowave drying 3aneural networks 3aoranges 3aosmosis 3aosmotic treatment 3aprediction 3asodium chloride 3aspecific energy 3astatistical analysis 0aMicrowave dryer 0aEnergy 0aExergy 0aOsmosis 0aOrange 0aPre-treatment1 aTorshizi, Mohammad Vahedi1 aNoshad, Fatemeh1 aRokhbin, Arash0 tEnergy.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.836-845dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010700153300001800260520093500278592002801213650001701241650001501258650002501273650001101298650001301309650001901322650001101341650002201352650001701374653002601391653001701417653002201434653003001456700001401486773012301500856007501623852000901698655001201707IND60527601820221119082617.0160715e20130424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052760182DNAL7 a10.1021/am400415t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yong10aGraphene Quantum Dot Hybrids as Efficient Metal-Free Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction  ap. 3362-3369.  aThe doping of heteroatoms into graphene quantum dot nanostructures provides an efficient way to tune the electronic structures and make more active sites for electro-catalysis, photovoltaic, or light emitting applications. Other than the modification of chemical composition, novel architecture is very desirable to enrich the research area and provides a wide range of choices for the diverse applications. Herein, we show a novel lotus seedpod surface-like pattern of zero-dimension (0D) seed-like N-GODs of ca.3 nm embedded on the surface of a two-dimension (2D) N-GQD sheet of ca.35 nm. It is demonstrated that different photoluminescence (PL) could be tuned easily, and the novel multidimensional structure displays excellent performance toward oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solutions. Thus, the fabricated N-GQD hybrids show bright perspective in biomedical imaging, biosensors, and conversion and storage of energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abiosensors 3achemical composition 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aimage analysis 3aoxygen 3aphotoluminescence 3aquantum dots 0agraphene quantum dots 0aarchitecture 0aphotoluminescence 0aoxygen reduction reaction1 aWu, Peiyi0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Apr. 24, v. 5, no. 8 p.3362-3369dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam400415t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01316naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013500166300001100301500002200312520028200334592002800616650001800644650001800662650001000680700006200690700002800752700001700780773012600797856008200923852000901005655001201014IND60612737620221122081251.0191003e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061273762DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-018-0531-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViguier, Loïc10aCorrection to: Yield gap analysis extended to marketable grain reveals the profitability of organic lentil-spring wheat intercrops  ap. 46.  aPublished Erratum  aDue to an unfortunate turn of events, the names of the authors appeared incorrectly in the original publication as given names and family names have been reversed.

Despite citizens’ poor knowledge, several types of stormwater infrastructure can be implemented to mitigate the impact of future events. This paper focuses on the implementation of green and grey stormwater interventions (i.e., with or without vegetation) on private properties. Framed by the Protection Motivation Theory, a survey-based case study analysis, carried out in a pluvial flooding-prone area of the Veneto Region (Italy), highlights the main factors driving people’s willingness to implement these interventions. The analysis shows that the implementation of grey stormwater infrastructures is driven by the perceived threat and the amount of past pluvial flooding damage (i.e., the direct experience as a proxy of prior knowledge) while the implementation of green stormwater infrastructures is driven also by additional factors (awareness of these interventions, age and education level of the citizens). Based on these results, lack of knowledge on innovative stormwater interventions represents a critical barrier to their implementation on private properties, and it confirms the need for specific dissemination and information activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aeducational status 3ainfrastructure 3amotivation 3apeople 3astormwater 3avegetation 3aItaly1 aDefrancesco, Edi 1 aBettella, Francesco 1 aD’Agostino, Vincenzo 0 tWater.g2020 Nov. 02, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121130693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245007600208520121200284592002801496650001201524650001601536650001301552650001501565650001901580653002001599653001101619653001201630653001901642700002501661700002001686700002301706700002501729773011401754856008401868852000901952655001201961IND60747985220221120175837.0211009e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074798522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.1016712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacroix, Karine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4930-176610aDifferent names for “natural gas” influence public perception of it  aIn many countries, natural gas is perceived more favorably than other fossil fuels. Here, we experimentally test (N = 2931) how perceptions of natural gas vary depending on what it is called. We find that Americans have stronger positive feelings for the term “natural gas” than “natural methane gas” (d = 0.59), “fossil gas” (d = 0.80), “fracked gas” (d = 0.81), “methane” (d = 0.94), and “methane gas” (d = 0.96). Democrats and Republicans both reported more positive views of “natural gas” than “natural methane gas” or “methane [gas].” But the patterns for the two political parties differed for perceptions of “fossil gas” and “fracked gas,” which were both viewed relatively positively by Republicans but negatively by Democrats. Analyses of open-ended word associations found that many participants associated methane with words like “pollution” and “global warming,” whereas they associated natural gas with words like “clean.” The results suggest that the terms used for this fossil fuel have very different meanings among the public, which may affect people's risk perceptions, consumer choices, and support for related policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3amethane 3anatural gas 3apolitics 3apsychology 3apublic opinion 0aRisk perception 0aAffect 0aImagery 0aClimate change1 aGoldberg, Matthew H.1 aGustafson, Abel1 aRosenthal, Seth A.1 aLeiserowitz, Anthony0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2021 Oct., v. 77 p.101671-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.1016713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245015200173300001300325520127800338592002801616650001701644650002801661650001901689650001201708650002401720650001201744650001901756650001101775650002201786700001801808773010201826856008201928990002302010852000902033655001202042IND60097986220221119143500.0141104e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009798622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejop.2012.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamschick, Stephanie10aColonization of termite hindgut walls by oxymonad flagellates and prokaryotes in Incisitermes tabogae, I. marginipennis and Reticulitermes flavipes  ap. 1-14.  aWe studied the colonization of the paunch wall of three lower termites, Reticulitermes flavipes, Incisitermes tabogae, and Incisitermes marginipennis, by light and electron microscopy. In addition to various prokaryotes, oxymonad flagellates were attached to the wall of the paunch in all three species. The prokaryotic layer found in R. flavipes is relatively thin, since most organisms are attached laterally. Large members of the flagellate genus Pyrsonympha protrude into the gut lumen. The prokaryotes are very abundant on the gut wall in I. tabogae and I. marginipennis, forming a thick carpet of mostly vertically attached rods and wavy spirochetes. The adhering oxymonads are relatively small and almost hidden in the thick bacterial biofilm. Three small morphotypes were seen in I. tabogae; two possessing a short rostellum and one amoeboid. The only oxymonad found in I. tabogae so far, Oxymonas clevelandi, is not identical to any of the present oxymonads. I. marginipennis contains a mid-sized oxymonad with ectobiotic spirochetes, probably identical to Oxymonas hubbardi, and a tiny unknown morphotype. The spatial organization of the pro- and eukaryotic microorganisms on the gut wall of the three termites is described and discussed concerning oxygen stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIncisitermes 3aReticulitermes flavipes 3aSpirochaetales 3abiofilm 3aelectron microscopy 3ahindgut 3amicroorganisms 3aoxygen 3aprokaryotic cells1 aRadek, Renate0 tEuropean journal of protistology.g2013 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.1-14dElsevier GmbHx0932-47397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejop.2012.06.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245018900179520201700368592002802385650001602413650001802429650002102447650001902468650001902487650001602506650001702522650001602539650001602555650001302571650002902584650001002613653003902623653001602662653001802678653003102696700001702727700002102744700006702765700005902832700005602891700002202947700005902969773011403028856008503142852000903227655001203236IND60686401120221120143520.0200509e20200607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068640112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4610212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLosacco, Gioacchino Luca10aApplicability of Supercritical fluid chromatography–Mass spectrometry to metabolomics. II–Assessment of a comprehensive library of metabolites and evaluation of biological matrices  aIn this work, the impact of biological matrices, such as plasma and urine, was evaluated under SFCHRMS in the field of metabolomics. For this purpose, a representative set of 49 metabolites were selected. The assessment of the matrix effects (ME), the impact of biological fluids on the quality of MS/MS spectra and the robustness of the SFCHRMS method were each taken into consideration. The results have highlighted a limited presence of ME in both plasma and urine, with 30% of the metabolites suffering from ME in plasma and 25% in urine, demonstrating a limited sensitivity loss in the presence of matrices. Subsequently, the MS/MS spectra evaluation was performed for further peak annotation. Their analyses have highlighted three different scenarios: 63% of the tested metabolites did not suffer from any interference regardless of the matrix; 21% were negatively impacted in only one matrix and the remaining 16% showed the presence of matrix-belonging compounds interfering in both urine and plasma. Finally, the assessment of retention times stability in the biological samples, has brought into evidence a remarkable robustness of the SFCHRMS method. Average RSD (%) values of retention times for spiked metabolites were equal or below 0.5%, in the two biological fluids over a period of three weeks.In the second part of the work, the evaluation of the Sigma Mass Spectrometry Metabolite Library of Standards containing 597 metabolites, under SFCHRMS conditions was performed. A total detectability of the commercial library up to 66% was reached. Among the families of detected metabolites, large percentages were met for some of them. Highly polar metabolites such as amino acids (87%), nucleosides (85%) and carbohydrates (71%) have demonstrated important success rates, equally for hydrophobic analytes such as steroids (78%) and lipids (71%). On the negative side, very poor performance was found for phosphorylated metabolites, namely phosphate-containing compounds (14%) and nucleotides (31%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrates 3achemical species 3achromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anucleosides 3anucleotides 3asteroids 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 0aSupercritical fluid chromatography 0aUHPSFC-HRMS 0aMatrix effect 0aRetention time variability1 aIsmail Omar,1 aPezzatti, Julian1 aGonzález-Ruiz, Víctor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7204-23631 aBoccard, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5913-95661 aRudaz, Serge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4180-54171 aVeuthey, Jean-Luc1 aGuillarme, Davy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7883-58230 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 June 07, v. 1620 p.461021-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4610213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012500157300001800282520132400300592002801624650002201652650001401674650001301688650001701701650000901718650000901727650001201736650001801748650000701766650001401773653001701787653002601804653001801830653003101848653002801879653002401907700001501931700001601946700001501962773012301977856007502100852000902175655001202184IND60527602020221119082616.0160715e20130424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052760202DNAL7 a10.1021/am40043962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinshan10aFluorescent Organic Nanoparticles Based on Branched Small Molecule: Preparation and Ion Detection in Lithium-Ion Battery  ap. 3392-3400.  aFluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) as a new class of nanomaterials can provide more advantages than molecule based probes. However, their applications in specific metal ion detection have rarely been exploited. We design and synthesize a branched small-molecule compound with triazole as a core and benzothiadiazole derivative as branches. By a facile reprecipitation method, nanoparticles (NPs) of this compound can be prepared in aqueous solutions, which can show high selectivity and sensitivity to Fe(III) ions based on fluorescence quenching. In addition, the fluorescence intensity of these NPs is resistant to pH changes in solutions. Such characters of this kind of NPs can be utilized in Fe³⁺ impurity detection in a promising cathode material (LiFePO₄) for lithium ion batteries. When exposed to Fe³⁺, both the triazole and benzothiadiazole groups contribute to the fluorescence quenching of NPs, but the former one plays a more important role in Fe³⁺ impurity detection. The sensing mechanism has also been investigated which indicates that a Fe-organic complex formation may be responsible for such sensing behavior. Our findings demonstrate that specific metal ion detection can be realized by FONs and have extended the application field of FONs for chemical sensing in aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abatteries 3acathodes 3afluorescence 3aions 3airon 3alithium 3ananoparticles 3apH 3atriazoles 0afluorescence 0aorganic nanoparticles 0aion detection 0alithium iron(II) phosphate 0abranched small molecule 0alithium-ion battery1 aXu, Xinjun1 aShi, Leilei1 aLi, Lidong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Apr. 24, v. 5, no. 8 p.3392-3400dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40043963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012000173300001600293520120300309592002801512650001501540650001901555650002101574650001101595653001901606653003201625653002401657653003301681653007701714653001001791653001001801700003101811700002601842700002701868700002501895773009001920856008502010852000902095655001202104IND60617972420221120192356.0190214e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061797242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinares-Flores, J.10aAngular speed control of an induction motor via a solar powered boost converter-voltage source inverter combination  ap. 326-334.  aThis paper proposes a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm for the development of a three-phase induction motor angular speed drive. A Dc-to-Dc boost power converter, powered by photovoltaic (PV) panels, feeds the three-phase power inverter. The MPPT algorithm is based on the Exact Static Error Dynamics Passive Output Feedback Controller (ESEDPOF) technique together with an Algebraic Estimator of the impedance. The estimated value is the equivalent impedance that exists between the boost converter and the three-phase inverter, and then this value is used in real-time to generate the desired reference variables of the MPPT algorithm. The angular speed-tracking controller for the induction motor is based on the well-known Field-Oriented Control (FOC) technique. An Experimental set-up was developed using an array of two PV panels. Then, a realistic scenario is carried out, and real-time results at low-speed, with and without load, are presented in order to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MPPT scheme. Under this scenario, the boost converter achieves an electric power efficiency of 80%, when a nominal load torque is applied to the induction motor shaft.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectric power 3asolar collectors 3atorque 0aMPPT algorithm 0aSpeed drive induction motor 0aAlgebraic estimator 0aField oriented control (FOC) 0aExact Static Error Dynamics Passive Output Feedback Controller (ESEDPOF) 0a00-01 0a99-001 aGuerrero-Castellanos, J.F.1 aLescas-Hernández, R.1 aHernández-Méndez, A.1 aVázquez-Perales, R.0 tEnergy.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 166 p.326-334dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245018700210520189900397592002802296650001702324650002002341650001802361650004302379650001102422650001002433650001602443650002502459653002002484653003302504653002502537653001002562653001802572700001502590700006002605700001702665773011402682856008502796852000902881655001202890IND60686401220221120133352.0200509e20200607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068640122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4610222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeridder, Sander1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8159-100612aA multiscale modelling study on the sense and nonsense of thermal conductivity enhancement of liquid chromatography packings and other potential solutions for viscous heating effects  aWe report on a numerical study of the thermal conductivity and temperature distribution in analytical packed bed and monolithic HPLC columns to assess the feasibility of a number of potential solutions to the viscous heating problem that would normally impede high efficiency separations when moving to extreme operating pressures (e.g., 2500 bar). Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were employed to study heat transfer on three hierarchical levels of the column: meso‑pore level, through-pore level and column level. At the first level, realistic values were determined for the conductivity of the porous zone (kₚz), depending on the internal structure of the porous zone and the mobile phase used (acetonitrile, water or a mixture of both). These kₚz-values were in turn used at the second level to determine realistic values for the effective conductivity of the bed (kₑff). It was shown that the presence of a solid core only has a minor effect on the packed bed conductivity. Using highly conducting materials as core material can be expected to maximally lead to a 60% increase in bed conductivity. Contrarily, in monolithic beds, the presence of a core material would form one continuous phase of highly conducting material, thus greatly enhancing the conductivity of the bed. At the third level, the temperature field in the entire column (bed and column housing) was resolved for three typical boundary conditions: isothermal, adiabatic and still-air oven. The effect of different physical properties (inlet pressure, mobile phase composition, bed conductivity, wall conductivity and column ID) on these temperature fields was investigated. It was shown that, theoretically, besides 1 mm ID columns also “core-shell monoliths” can provide a solution to viscous heating (by increasing the bed conductivity). Other possible solutions are proposed and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3afluid mechanics 3aheat transfer 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3aovens 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 0aViscous heating 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aCore-shell particles 0aUHPLC 0aHigh pressure1 aSmits, Wim1 aBroeckhoven, Ken1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0524-78301 aDesmet, Gert0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 June 07, v. 1620 p.461022-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4610223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013500161300001600296520122600312592002801538650001501566650001101581650001001592650002501602650001401627650001901641650001801660650001101678651001001689700001501699700001701714700001601731773010501747856008201852990002301934852000901957655001201966IND60097986420221119143247.0141104e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009798642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejop.2012.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yuan10aRedescription of Parasonderia vestita () comb. nov.

(basionym: Plagiopyla vestitaKahl, 1928) was found and investigated using silver staining methods. These revealed that its oral ciliature is rather unique and composed of polykinetids comprising four parts: prebuccal polykineties, postbuccal polykineties, parabuccal polykineties, and intrabuccal polykineties. Both the pre- and the postbuccal polykineties are, as extensions of the somatic kineties, spiraling and extending from cell surface into buccal cavity. The somatic kineties are composed mainly of dikinetids with some monokinetids and trikinetids inserted. They are separated into two types: four circle kineties and 24–28 bipolar kineties. The circle kineties start from the side of oral region and connect with the opposite section at the end of the body. Phylogenetic analysis based on SSU rRNA gene sequence data indicates that P. vestita falls into the core part of the order Plagiopylida and groups with an environmental sequence with high support and forms a sister clade with Lechriopyla mystax, Plagiopyla frontata and P. nasuta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3acoasts 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aredescriptions 3aribosomal RNA 3asilver 3aChina1 aShao, Chen1 aXie, Feifei,1 aSong, Weibo0 tEuropean journal of protistology.g2013 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.106-113dElsevier GmbHx0932-47397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejop.2012.03.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012300160520137400283592002801657650001601685650001801701650001301719650002101732650001201753650001001765650001601775650002401791650001401815650001501829650001201844650001601856650001501872650001901887650001401906650001001920650001401930650001701944650002801961700003001989700002202019700003002041700002002071700002102091700002902112700002602141700002902167700002002196700002002216700002602236700002002262773012202282856007402404852000902478655001202487IND60748663320221119125719.0210827e20210821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074866332DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130828762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkowron, Kamil 10aIs the Activity-Based Anorexia Model a Reliable Method of Presenting Peripheral Clinical Features of Anorexia Nervosa?  aAnorexia nervosa (AN) causes the highest number of deaths among all psychiatric disorders. Reduction in food intake and hyperactivity/increased anxiety observed in AN are also the core features of the activity-based anorexia animal model (ABA). Our aim was to assess how the acute ABA protocol mimics common AN complications, including gonadal and cardiovascular dysfunctions, depending on gender, age, and initial body weight, to form a comprehensive description of ABA as a reliable research tool. Wheel running, body weight, and food intake of adolescent female and male rats were monitored. Electrocardiography, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements were performed. Immediately after euthanasia, tissue fragments and blood were collected for further analysis. Uterine weight was 2 times lower in ABA female rats, and ovarian tissue exhibited a reduced number of antral follicles and decreased expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors. Cardiovascular measurements revealed autonomic decompensation with prolongation of QRS complex and QT interval. The ABA model is a reliable research tool for presenting the breakdown of adaptation mechanisms observed in severe AN. Cardiac and hormonal features of ABA with underlying altered neuroendocrine pathways create a valid phenotype of a human disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aanimal models 3aanorexia 3aanorexia nervosa 3aanxiety 3ablood 3abody weight 3aelectrocardiography 3aestrogens 3aeuthanasia 3afemales 3afood intake 3aheart rate 3ahuman diseases 3amagnetism 3amales 3aphenotype 3aprogesterone 3asystolic blood pressure1 aKurnik-Łucka, Magdalena 1 aJurczyk, Michał 1 aAleksandrovych, Veronika 1 aStach, Paulina 1 aDadański, Emil 1 aKuśnierz-Cabala, Beata 1 aJasiński, Krzysztof 1 aWęglarz, Władysław P.1 aMazur, Paulina 1 aPodlasz, Piotr 1 aWąsowicz, Krzysztof 1 aGil, Krzysztof 0 tNutrients.g2021 Aug. 21, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130828763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009600160300001200256520143000268592002801698650001701726650001201743650002101755650001401776650002401790650001601814650000901830650001301839650001401852650001101866650001901877650002401896650001601920650000901936650001201945650002301957650001301980650000901993651001002002700001502012700001602027700001602043700001902059700001802078773013402096856008102230852000902311655001202320IND60449303120221122074821.0151123e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044930312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4935-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Chao10aEffect of coated urea on cadmium accumulation in Oryza sativa L. grown in contaminated soil  ap. 716.  aExperiments were conducted to determine the effects of three types of coated urea on the accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown in contaminated soil. Pot-culture experiments were conducted in a greenhouse from July to November 2012 on the rice cultivar “Hua Hang Si Miao” in Guangzhou (China). The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments and three replications. The treatments were control (CK) (N 0 mg/kg), prilled urea (PU) (N 200 mg/kg), polymer-coated urea (PCU) (N 200 mg/kg), and sulfur-coated urea (SCU) (N 200 mg/kg). Our results indicated that applications of PCU and SCU slightly increased the dry weight of rice grains. The application of SCU significantly decreased the CaCl₂ and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP)-extractable Cd concentrations by 15.4 and 56.1 %, respectively. Sequential extractions showed that PCU and SCU applications led to a significant decrease in Cd in the exchangeable fraction and an increase in the bound iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) oxides fractions. Cd concentrations in grains treated with PCU were reduced by 11.7 %, whereas SCU significantly reduced Cd concentrations by 29.1 %. SCU reduced Cd transfer from the straws to the grain. Our results demonstrated that PCU and SCU may be effective in mitigating Cd accumulation in rice grown in acidic Cd-contaminated soil, especially in plants receiving SCU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acadmium 3acalcium chloride 3acultivars 3aexperimental design 3agreenhouses 3airon 3aleaching 3amanganese 3aoxides 3apolluted soils 3apolymer-coated urea 3apot culture 3arice 3asilicon 3asulfur-coated urea 3atoxicity 3aurea 3aChina1 aWu, Zisong1 aZhu, Qihong1 aZhu, Hanhua1 aZhang, Yangzhu1 aHuang, Daoyou0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Nov., v. 187, no. 11 p.716-716dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4935-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009500170300001400265520199000279592002802269650000802297650001802305650001802323650002702341650001402368650001802382650001302400650001902413650001202432650001702444650002602461650001002487650002002497650001802517650002002535650002002555650001102575650001702586650001402603650000702617650001502624650001402639650002202653653001302675653001302688653001302701653002402714700005702738700002202795700001702817700003102834700002502865773011202890856008503002852000903087655001203096IND60600129520221119194849.0180703e20140628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060012952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyabe, Hiroko12aA new adjuvant delivery system ‘cyclic di-GMP/YSK05 liposome’ for cancer immunotherapy  ap. 20-27.  aCyclic dinucleotides are of importance in the field of microbiology and immunology. They function as second messengers and are thought to participate in the signal transduction of cytosolic DNA immune responses. One such dinucleotide, cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), stimulates the immune system. It is thought that c-di-GMP is recognized by ATP dependent RNA helicase (DDX41) in the cytosol, forms a complex with the Stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), triggers a signal via the tank binding kinase 1-interferon regulatory factor 3 (TBK1-IRF3) pathway and induces the production of type I interferons. Therefore c-di-GMP can be thought of as a new class of adjuvant. However, because c-di-GMP contains two phosphate groups, this prevents its use as an adjuvant because it cannot pass through the cell membrane, even though the target molecule of c-di-GMP is located in the cytoplasm.Our group has been developing a series of liposomal drug delivery systems and recently investigated YSK05 which is a synthetic, pH sensitive lipid that has a high fusogenicity. We utilized this lipid as a carrier to transport c-di-GMP into the cytosol to then use c-di-GMP as an adjuvant. Based on screening experiments, YSK05/POPE/cholesterol=40/25/35 was found to induce IFN-β in Raw264.7 cells. The induction of IFN-β from c-di-GMP liposomes was inhibited by adding BX795, a TBK1 inhibitor, indicating that the production of IFN-β caused the activation of the STING-TBK1 pathway. C-di-GMP liposomes also showed significantly higher levels of expression of CD80, CD86 and MHC class I. The c-di-GMP/YSK05 liposome facilitated antigen specific cytotoxic T cell activity and the inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse model. These findings indicate that c-di-GMP/YSK05 liposomes could be used, not only to transfer c-di-GMP to the cytosol and induce an innate immune system but also as a platform for investigating the mechanism of immune sensing with cyclic dinucleotides in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA helicases 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadjuvants 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3acell membranes 3acytosol 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferon-beta 3alipids 3amicrobiology 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aphosphates 3ascreening 3asecond messengers 0aC-di-GMP 0aLiposome 0aAdjuvant 0aAnti-tumor activity1 aHyodo, Mamoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1766-39491 aNakamura, Takashi1 aSato, Yusuke1 aHayakawa, Y.q(Yoshihiro),1 aHarashima, Hideyoshi0 tJournal of controlled release.g2014 June 28, v. 184 p.20-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011000165300001600275520135800291592002801649650002801677650001301705650001401718650001201732650001201744650001001756650001201766650001801778650001001796650001501806651001001821700002201831773008801853856008401941852000902025655001202034IND60122589120221123040631.0150325e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012258912DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2014.9278192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanda, Eva10aStrict mate fidelity and reduced breeding dispersal of widowed Red-billed Choughs Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax  ap. 371-377.  aCapsule Red-billed Choughs showed strict mate and high nest-site fidelity. Changes of mate or nesting site were recorded only in cases of widowhood or collapse of the nesting sites (buildings). Aims To evaluate the relationships between mate fidelity, nest-site fidelity, breeding dispersal and widowhood in a population of Red-billed Choughs. Methods We recorded the rates of mate and nest site fidelity in a ringed population Red-billed Choughs breeding in the Ebro Valley, NE Spain, from 1987–2006. Results We found strict mate fidelity, because no case of divorce was recorded over variable periods of mate pairing, ranging from 2 to 15 years. A proportion of widowed individuals changed nesting sites when re-paired, always establishing nests in places close to their previous nesting sites. We did not find sexual differences in the decision to change nesting site in newly paired widowed individuals, although widowed males tend to show higher site fidelity and lower breeding dispersal distances than females. Conclusions The results support the hypothesis that site fidelity primarily depends on mate fidelity, rather than the contrary. Mate and nest-site fidelity may be species-specific traits that enhance fitness through the shared knowledge of the characteristics and limitations of the mate and the territory in this long-lived species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax 3abreeding 3abuildings 3adivorce 3afemales 3amales 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3aphilopatry 3aSpain1 aBlanco, Guillermo0 tBird study.g2014 July 3, v. 61, no. 3 p.371-377dTaylor & Francisx1944-67057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2014.9278193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04005naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016100167520227600328592002802604650001902632650001802651650001602669650001502685650001302700650001602713650001602729650002602745650002402771650001502795650000902810650001602819650001502835650001202850650002302862650001002885650001002895650001602905650003002921650001502951650002002966650001702986650001303003653001603016653001503032653001903047653001503066653001803081700001703099700001603116700001703132700001403149700001603163700001903179773009903198856008503297852000903382655001203391IND60742006420221120130255.0210723e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074200642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDankwa, A.S.10aBacterial communities in the rumen and feces of lactating Holstein dairy cows are not affected when fed reduced-fat dried distillers’ grains with solubles  aReduced-fat dried distillers’ grains with solubles (RF-DDGSs) are co-products of ethanol production and contain less fat than traditional distillers’ grains. The fat in corn is ~91% unsaturated, and it is toxic to rumen microorganisms so it could influence the composition of the rumen microbiome. It has been demonstrated that RF-DDGS is a suitable ration ingredient to support the high-producing dairy cow, and this feedstuff is a promising alternative protein source for lactating dairy cows. The current study aims to better understand the effect of RF-DDGS on the rumen and fecal bacterial composition in lactating dairy cows. Thirty-six multiparous (two or three), mid-lactation Holstein cows (BW = 680 ± 11 kg; 106 ± 27 DIM) were randomly assigned to two groups which were fed a control diet made up of corn, corn silage, and alfalfa hay supplemented with expeller soybean meal or with added RF-DDGS (20% of the DM) containing approximately 6.0% fat. Whole rumen contents (rumen fluid and digesta; esophageal tubing method) and feces (free-catch method) were collected on day 35 of the experimental period, after the 14-d acclimation period. Rumen contents and feces from each cow were used for DNA extraction. The bacterial community composition in rumen and fecal samples was assessed via the 16S rRNA gene by using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla in rumen contents. The fecal microbiota was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, as well as Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi. RF-DGGS increased bacterial richness, evenness, and Shannon diversity in both rumen and fecal samples and was associated with several taxa that had different abundance in treatment versus control comparisons. The RF-DGGS, however, did not significantly alter the bacterial community in the rumen or feces. In general, these findings demonstrated that dietary inclusion of RF-DDGS did not impose any serious short-term (within 30 days) health or production consequences, as would be expected. With this study, we present further evidence that inclusion of 20% (DM basis) RF-DDGS in the diet of lactating dairy cows can be done without consequence on the microbiome of the rumen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aChloroflexi 3aFirmicutes 3aHolstein 3aacclimation 3aalfalfa hay 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3acoproducts 3acorn 3acorn silage 3adairy cows 3adigesta 3aethanol production 3afeces 3agenes 3aingredients 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amicrobiome 3aprotein sources 3asoybean meal 3atoxicity 0aAnimal feed 0aBos taurus 0aGut microbiome 0aMicrobiota 0a16S rRNA gene1 aHumagain, U.1 aIshaq, S.L.1 aYeoman, C.J.1 aClark, S.1 aBeitz, D.C.1 aTestroet, E.D.0 tAnimal.g2021 July, v. 15, no. 7 p.100281-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013300163300001800296520156400314592002801878596005701906596008901963650001602052650001402068650001802082650001002100650003402110650001402144650000902158650002102167650001602188650001502204650001302219651001002232700001602242700001902258700001802277700001702295700001702312700001302329700001602342700001402358700005602372773013702428856008302565852000902648655001202657IND60735931020221122012509.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073593102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-021-03774-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aComparative selective signature analysis and high-resolution GWAS reveal a new candidate gene controlling seed weight in soybean  ap. 1329-1341.  aKEY MESSAGE: We detected a QTL qHSW-16 undergone strong selection associated with seed weight and identified a novel candidate gene controlling seed weight candidate gene for this major QTL by qRT-PCT.

In this work, we resequenced 283 soybean accessions from China and obtained a large number of high-quality SNPs for investigation of the population genetics that underpin variation in seed weight and other agronomic traits. Selective signature analysis detected 78 (~ 25.0 Mb) and 39 (~ 22.60 Mb) novel putative selective signals that were selected during soybean domestication and improvement, respectively. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified five loci associated with seed weight. Among these QTLs, qHSW-16, overlapped with the improvement-selective region on chromosome 16, suggesting that this QTL may be underwent strong selection during soybean improvement. Of the 18 candidate genes in qHSW-16, only SoyZH13_16G122400 showed higher expression levels in a large seed variety compared to a small seed variety during seed development. These results identify SoyZH13_16G122400 as a novel candidate gene controlling seed weight and provide foundational insights into the molecular targets for breeding improvement of seed weight and potential seed yield in soybean.  aPublisher supplied data  aBE2019376cJiangsu Science and Technology Department  a2018YFE0112200cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China 3aGlycine max 3acultivars 3adomestication 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agermplasm 3aoils 3aseed development 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3asoybeans 3aChina1 aXu, Wenjing1 aZhang, Hongmei1 aLiu, Xiaoqing1 aCui, Xiaoyan1 aLi, Songsong1 aSong, Li1 aZhu, Yuelin1 aChen, Xin1 aChen, Huatao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5468-99990 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2021 May, v. 134, no. 5 p.1329-1341dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-03774-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011400153300001800267520111700285592002801402650002201430650001801452650002401470650001701494650002201511650001301533650003301546650001601579650002401595653003301619653001501652653001801667653002801685653001401713653002401727700002401751700002201775700002001797700002001817700001801837773012601855856007301981852000902054655001202063IND60527602320221119082549.0160715e20130424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052760232DNAL7 a10.1021/am400460p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoji, Yu10aThermal Diffusivity of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Composites Based on Cross-Linked Liquid Crystalline Polyimides  ap. 3417-3423.  aHexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) composites with the oriented cross-linked liquid crystalline (LC) polyimide have been developed as high thermally conductive materials. Well-dispersed h-BN composite films were obtained, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. The morphology of the composite films was further investigated in detail by the wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The obtained composite films based on the cross-linked LC polyimide showed that the polymer chains vertically aligned in the direction parallel to the films, while those based on the amorphous polyimide showed an isotropic nature. Moreover, the alignment of the cross-linked LC polyimides was maintained, even after increasing the volume fraction of h-BN. This alignment plays an important role in the effective phonon conduction between h-BN and the matrices. Indeed, the thermal diffusivity in the thickness direction of the composite films based on the LC polyimide measured by a temperature wave analysis method was increased to 0.679 mm² s–¹ at a 30 vol % h-BN loading, which was higher than that based on the amorphous polyimide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aboron nitride 3acomposite materials 3acrosslinking 3afilms (materials) 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermal diffusivity 0aliquid crystalline polyimide 0across-link 0asiloxane unit 0ahexagonal boron nitride 0acomposite 0athermal diffusivity1 aHigashihara, Tomoya1 aTokita, Masatoshi1 aMorikawa, Junko1 aWatanabe, Junji1 aUeda, Mitsuru0 tACS applied materials .g2013 Apr. 24, v. 5, no. 8 p.3417-3423dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am400460p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245010900180300001400289520187700303592002802180650002502208650001202233650001402245650001102259650002102270650000902291650001902300650001502319650004002334653000902374653001602383653002702399653002002426653001602446653002602462700006102488700002402549700002402573700002002597700002502617700002302642700002302665773011202688856008502800852000902885655001202894IND60600129820221119194911.0180703e20140628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060012982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoldervaart, Michelle T.10aProlonged presence of VEGF promotes vascularization in 3D bioprinted scaffolds with defined architecture  ap. 58-66.  aTimely vascularization is essential for optimal performance of bone regenerative constructs. Vascularization is efficiently stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance with a short half-life time. This study investigates the controlled release of VEGF from gelatin microparticles (GMPs) as a means to prolong VEGF activity at the preferred location within 3D bioprinted scaffolds, and the effects on subsequent vascularization. The release of VEGF from GMPs was continuous for 3weeks during in vitro studies, and bioactivity was confirmed using human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in migration assays. Traditional and real-time migration assays showed immediate and efficient EPC migration in the presence of GMP-released VEGF, indistinguishable from VEGF-solution that was added to the medium. Matrigel scaffolds containing EPCs and VEGF, which was released either in a fast or sustained fashion by application of GMPs, were investigated for their in vivo vasculogenic capacity. Implantation in subcutaneous pockets in nude mice for one week demonstrated that vessel formation was significantly higher in the VEGF sustained-release group compared to the fast release group. In addition, regional differences with respect to VEGF release were introduced in 3D bioprinted EPC-laden scaffolds and their influence on vasculogenesis was investigated in vivo. The different regions were retained and vessel formation occurred analogous with the results seen in the Matrigel plugs.We conclude that GMPs are suitable to generate sustained release profiles of bioactive VEGF, and that they can be used to create defined differentiation regions in 3D bioprinted heterogeneous constructs, allowing a new generation of smart scaffold design. The prolonged presence of VEGF led to a significant increase in scaffold vascularization when applied in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3agelatin 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amice 3amicroparticles 3astem cells 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aVEGF 0aBioprinting 0aGelatin microparticles 0aVascularization 0a3D printing 0aRegenerative medicine1 aGremmels, Hendrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7818-620X1 avan Deventer, Kelly1 aFledderus, Joost O.1 aÖner, F.Cumhur1 aVerhaar, Marianne C.1 aDhert, Wouter J.A.1 aAlblas, Jacqueline0 tJournal of controlled release.g2014 June 28, v. 184 p.58-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245011000163300001600273520075100289592002801040650001501068650001001083650001601093651001501109651001201124651001701136651001301153651001001166653001701176653001201193653001501205653001301220653001701233653002301250653001601273700003001289773009801319856007701417852000901494655001201503IND60612738320221122081234.0151025s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061273832DNAL7 a10.5733/afin.054.02132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiekerk, P. van12aA Revision of the Crab Spider Genus Heriaeus Simon, 1875 (Araneae: Thomisidae) in the Afrotropical Region  ap. 11-2013.  aThe genus Heriaeus Simon, 1875 is revised in the Afrotropical Region.

Resistance to thrips is an important trait for pepper growers. These insects can cause extensive damage to fruits, flowers and leaves on field and greenhouse grown plants worldwide. Two independent studies in Capsicum identified diterpene glycosides as metabolites that are correlated with thrips resistance. In this study, we fine-mapped a previously defined thrips resistance QTL on chromosome 6, to a region of 0.4 Mbp harbouring 15 genes. Two of these 15 candidate genes showed differences in gene expression upon thrips induction, when comparing plants carrying the resistance allele in homozygous state to plants with the susceptibility allele in homozygous state for the QTL region. Three genes, including the two genes that showed difference in gene expression, contained a SNP that was predicted to lead to changes in protein structure. Therefore, these three genes, i.e. an acid phosphatase 1 (APS1), an organic cation/carnitine transporter 7 (OCT7) and an uncharacterized locus LOC107874801, are the most likely candidates for playing a role in thrips resistance and are a first step in elucidating the genetic basis of thrips resistance in Capsicum. In addition, we show that the diterpene glycoside profiles did not differ between plants with the resistance and susceptibility allele for the chromosome 6 QTL, suggesting that these compounds do not play a role in the resistance conferred by the genes located in the major thrips resistance QTL studied.  aPublisher supplied data  aTKI-1409-045cMinisterie van landbouw (NL)  aTKI-1409-045cBASF Vegetable Seeds  aTKI-1409-045cBejo Zaden B.V.. 3aCapsicum 3aacid phosphatase 3aalleles 3acarnitine 3acations 3aditerpenoids 3agene expression 3aglycosides 3agreenhouses 3ahomozygosity 3aloci 3ametabolites 3apepper 3aprotein structure1 aVoorrips, Roeland E.1 avan Kaauwen, Martijn1 avan Eekelen, Henriëtte D.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 3 day titration diet, providing known quantities of iodized salt, is reflected in 24 h urinary iodine concentration (UIC), serum iodine, and thyroglobulin (Tg). Methods: A total of 10 participants (31.3 ± 4.0 years, 76.1 ± 6.3 kg) completed three, 3 day iodine titration diets (minimal iodine, US RDA, (United States Recommended Daily Allowance), and 3× RDA). The 24 h UIC, serum iodine, and Tg were measured following each diet. The 24 h UIC and an iodine-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were completed at baseline. Results: UIC increased an average of 19.3 μg/L for every gram of iodized salt consumed and was different from minimal to RDA (p = 0.001) and RDA to 3× RDA diets (p = 0.04). Serum iodine was different from RDA to 3× RDA (p = 0.006) whereas Tg was not responsive to diet. Baseline UIC was associated with iodine intake from milk (r = 0.688, p = 0.028) and fish/seafood (r = 0.646, p = 0.043). Conclusion: These results suggest that 24 h UIC and serum iodine may be reflective of individual iodine status and may serve as biomarkers of iodine status.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3afish 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aiodine 3aiodine deficiency 3aiodized salt 3amilk 3arisk 3aseafoods 3athyroglobulin 3atitration1 aAlexander, Brenda M.1 aGerow, Ken 1 aLarson-Meyer, D.

Using these sensors, w/o complementary pattern recognition methods, we study the ability of PAH-FET(s) to: (i) discriminate between aromatic and non-aromatic VOCs; (ii) distinguish polar and non-polar non-aromatic compounds; and to (iii) identify specific VOCs within the subgroups (i.e., aromatic compounds, polar non-aromatic compounds, non-polar non-aromatic compounds). We further study the effect of water vapor on the sensor array’s discriminative ability and derive patterns that are stable when exposed to different constant values of background humidity. Patterns based on different independent electronic features from an array of PAH-FETs may bring us one step closer to creating a unique fingerprint for individual VOCs in real-world applications in atmospheres with varying levels of humidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumidity 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3avolatile organic compounds 3awater vapor 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 0asensor 0avolatile organic compound 0ahumidity 0afield effect transistor 0adetection1 aFeng, Xinliang1 aMüllen, K.q(Klaus),1 aHaick, Hossam0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Apr. 24, v. 5, no. 8 p.3431-3440dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40051443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012100167300001600288520234000304592002802644650001902672650002602691650002002717650001802737650001802755650001102773650002402784650001402808650001502822650002402837650002002861650001402881650001202895650002402907700001902931700003002950773011202980856004803092852000903140655001203149IND50067858620221122032950.0130716e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006785862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-013-0711-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoleón, Marcos10aInferring ecological mechanisms from hunting bag data in wildlife management: a reply to Blanco-Aguiar et al. (2012)  ap. 599-608.  aIn a previous study, we suggested that hyperpredation by shared predators on red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), once a parasite (rabbit haemorrhagic disease, RHD) had decimated populations of rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), the primary prey for most of the Mediterranean predators, was a major force driving partridge population dynamics in Spain years ago (Moleón et al., PLoS One 3:e2307, 2008). Recently, however, Blanco-Aguiar et al. (Eur J Wildl Res 58:433–439, 2012) have asserted that this conclusion is poorly evidence-based and can subsequently promote raptor persecution by hunters. In response to Blanco-Aguiar and colleagues, here we provide complementary insights that favour our earlier hypothesis. After explaining several key concepts of the hyperpredation process, we use additional data and analyses to show that (1) a synchronised regime shift (i.e. a step, abrupt change in population size) to significantly lower population levels in both the rabbit and partridge populations took place coinciding with the RHD outbreak; (2) rabbit and partridge population dynamics were highly synchronised after the RHD outbreak, but not before; (3) an enhanced spatial autocorrelation at all the spatial scales emerged after RHD for partridge populations; and (4) the main shared predators’ diet patterns were consistent with the hypothesis of enhanced predation pressure as a plausible mechanism behind the observed partridge dynamics. We support the idea that hunting bag data may be useful to infer realistic population dynamics and the ecological mechanisms explaining them, provided that (1) they are corrected by the number of hunting licenses; (2) appropriate statistical tools are employed; and (3) methodological constraints are adequately taken into account. Finally, we argue that the opinion of Blanco-Aguiar and colleagues that our original results can lead to raptor persecution is a misinterpretation of our study. In this sense, we make an appeal for the importance of accurately differentiating between the ultimate (e.g. infectious diseases favoured by humans) and the proximate (e.g. enhanced predation pressure) causes of the decline in prey of economic interest (e.g. game species) in order to avoid unnecessary, unfounded or presumed conflicts with lobbies of conservation concern (e.g. hunters).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlectoris rufa 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aautocorrelation 3abirds of prey 3aeating habits 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3aparasites 3apartridges 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3apredation 3arabbits 3awildlife management1 aAlmaraz, Pablo1 aSánchez-Zapata, José A.0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2013 Aug., v. 59, no. 4 p.599-608dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-013-0711-1  aDNAL 7aarticle04055naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245014100174300001800315520222800333592002802561596007102589650001902660650001202679650001502691650002802706650002302734650002602757650001302783650001502796650001702811650001202828650003002840650001102870650001402881650001702895650001502912650001602927650001602943650001502959700007202974700002203046700006203068700006203130700002103192700002303213700006003236773013703296856008303433852000903516655001203525IND60735931320221122000430.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073593132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-021-03779-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalán, Rodrigo José10aEarly prediction of biomass in hybrid rye based on hyperspectral data surpasses genomic predictability in less-related breeding material  ap. 1409-1422.  aKEY MESSAGE: Hyperspectral data is a promising complement to genomic data to predict biomass under scenarios of low genetic relatedness. Sufficient environmental connectivity between data used for model training and validation is required. The demand for sustainable sources of biomass is increasing worldwide. The early prediction of biomass via indirect selection of dry matter yield (DMY) based on hyperspectral and/or genomic prediction is crucial to affordably untap the potential of winter rye (Secale cereale L.) as a dual-purpose crop. However, this estimation involves multiple genetic backgrounds and genetic relatedness is a crucial factor in genomic selection (GS). To assess the prospect of prediction using reflectance data as a suitable complement to GS for biomass breeding, the influence of trait heritability ([Formula: see text]) and genetic relatedness were compared. Models were based on genomic (GBLUP) and hyperspectral reflectance-derived (HBLUP) relationship matrices to predict DMY and other biomass-related traits such as dry matter content (DMC) and fresh matter yield (FMY). For this, 270 elite rye lines from nine interconnected bi-parental families were genotyped using a 10 k-SNP array and phenotyped as testcrosses at four locations in two years (eight environments). From 400 discrete narrow bands (410 nm–993 nm) collected by an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) on two dates in each environment, 32 hyperspectral bands previously selected by Lasso were incorporated into a prediction model. HBLUP showed higher prediction abilities (0.41 – 0.61) than GBLUP (0.14 – 0.28) under a decreased genetic relationship, especially for mid-heritable traits (FMY and DMY), suggesting that HBLUP is much less affected by relatedness and [Formula: see text]. However, the predictive power of both models was largely affected by environmental variances. Prediction abilities for DMY were further enhanced (up to 20%) by integrating both matrices and plant height into a bivariate model. Thus, data derived from high-throughput phenotyping emerges as a suitable strategy to efficiently leverage selection gains in biomass rye breeding; however, sufficient environmental connectivity is needed.  aPublisher supplied data  aFKZ 22019716cBundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft 3aSecale cereale 3abiomass 3acomplement 3adry matter accumulation 3adry matter content 3agenetic relationships 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3aheritability 3ahybrids 3amarker-assisted selection 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3aprediction 3areflectance 3atestcrosses 3awinter rye1 aBernal-Vasquez, Angela-Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0415-83181 aJebsen, Christian1 aPiepho, Hans-Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7813-29921 aThorwarth, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4456-23581 aSteffan, Philipp1 aGordillo, Andrés,1 aMiedaner, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9541-37260 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2021 May, v. 134, no. 5 p.1409-1422dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-03779-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009100164300001600255500001500271520201600286592002802302650001402330650001402344650001302358650001102371650002702382650001402409650002002423650001802443650001302461650001702474650001302491650001302504650001202517650002202529650001902551653001002570700001802580700001902598700002102617700001702638700001302655700002002668773009002688856004802778852000902826655001202835IND4467895920221119062104.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446789592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-011-9197-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhisson, S. C.10aExploiting Knowledge of Pathogen Effectors to Enhance Late Blight Resistance in Potato  ap. 325-340.  a2019-12-06  aLate blight disease of potato, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is the most serious disease of this crop on a global scale and is thus a threat to food security. Use of resistant potato cultivars to prevent late blight does not have a very successful history, as P. infestans genotypes have overcome the deployed resistances. Thus, there is a need to identify more durable resistances, or identify and develop novel forms of resistance that exploit vulnerabilities in the biology of P. infestans. Application of molecular biology tools in P. infestans research has recently culminated in the identification of several avirulence effectors matching specific resistances in potato, the sequencing of the P. infestans genome and identification of hundreds of candidate translocated pathogen âRXLRâ effector proteins that may promote disease progression. Strategies for prioritising these effectors for further research are revealing those that are highly expressed during infection, difficult for the pathogen to alter rapidly, essential for P. infestans pathogenesis and recognized by resistant accessions of Solanum spp. These effector characteristics are being used to identify and characterise resistances from Solanum germplasm that may prove more durable. In addition to RXLR effectors, P. infestans also produces a broad spectrum of additional secreted proteins. These are exposed to plant cells and may potentially act to trigger resistance, either as broad spectrum pathogen-associated molecular patterns or as specific effectors of resistance. Alternatively, conserved secreted proteins may be attractive targets for novel agrichemical development. We have silenced a diverse selection of these candidate secreted proteins in P. infestans and demonstrated their effects on late blight disease development. Results from these studies are aiding a deeper understanding of P. infestans disease development and identifying potential pathogen weaknesses for exploitation in future control measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm 3acultivars 3aproteins 3agenome 3aPhytophthora infestans 3apathogens 3acontrol methods 3afood security 3agenotype 3apathogenesis 3aplanting 3apotatoes 3aSolanum 3amolecular biology 3adisease course 0acrops1 aAvrova, A.

Methanol (MeOH) is a promising candidate but is still produced with conventional natural gas to syngas technology. The need for fossil-free and less costly syngas routes to MeOH has been the focus of immense academic effort. Towards this end, this study details a version 1.0 tool for investigating prospective photochemical and thermal heterogeneous MeOH synthesis catalysts and present thermal benchmarking data with a commercial copper–zinc oxide-alumina (CZA) catalyst. The testing conditions use a 3 : 1 H₂ : CO₂ syngas ratio, temperatures from <448–533 K (<175–260 °C), and pressure up to 0.78 MPa. These conditions allow for more efficient CO₂ utilization by improving low-temperature MeOH yield and reducing capital and operating costs of process equipment. The reactor performance is validated with respect to the literature and also a rate model based on a Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) mechanism with good agreement. This verifies that the system behaves isothermally and predictably. This unique system can be configured to screen catalysts both thermally and with light, and expanded to commercial test conditions and scales. At aspirational low-temperature and low-pressure conditions, 398 K (125 °C) and 1.0 MPa (comparable P to this study), the MeOH equilibrium per-pass yield is a respectable 8.8 mol% with comparable high-P equipment costs to current commercial operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aequipment 3afeedstocks 3agreen chemistry 3amethanol 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aphotochemistry 3asynthesis gas1 aOzin, Geoffrey A.1 aSain, Mohini M.0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 Jan. 18, v. 23, no. 1 p.340-353dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc03115a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010500164300001200269520124400281592002801525650002501553650001101578650002501589650002001614650001501634650001601649650003101665650003301696650001301729650001501742650001801757651001401775651002101789773013401810856008101944852000902025655001202034IND60449304120221119143113.0151123e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044930412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4904-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilgin, Ayla13aAn assessment of water quality in the Coruh Basin (Turkey) using multivariate statistical techniques  ap. 721.  aThe purpose of this study was to assess the impact of 24 water parameters, measured semi-annually between 2011 and 2013 in Coruh Basin (Turkey), based on the quality of the water. The study utilised analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA) methods. The water-quality data was obtained from a total of four sites by the 26th Regional Directorate of the State Hydraulic Works (DSI). ANOVA was carried out to identify the differences between the parameters at the different measuring sites. The variables were classified using factor analysis, and at the end of the ANOVA test, it was established that there was a statistically significant difference between the downstream and upstream waste waters released by the Black Sea copper companies and between the Murgul and Borcka Dams, in terms of water quality, while no statistically significant difference was observed between the Murgul and Borcka Dams. It was determined through factor analysis that five factors explained 81.3 % of the total variance. It was concluded that domestic, industrial and agricultural activities, in combination with physicochemical properties, were factors affecting the quality of the water in the Coruh Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abasins 3abusiness enterprises 3afactor analysis 3agovernance 3amethodology 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprincipal component analysis 3avariance 3awastewater 3awater quality 3aBlack Sea 3aTurkey (country)0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Nov., v. 187, no. 11 p.721-721dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4904-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245005600160300001600216500002000232520138000252592002801632650001901660650002001679650001101699650002501710650002301735700001701758773011701775856007401892852000901966655001201975IND60788335620221119122259.0220813e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078833562DNAL7 a10.1136/inp.m39202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDennison, Ngaire10aLegislative framework for animal research in the UK  ap. 488-496.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: In 1986, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA) replaced the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, which had up until then protected animals used for ‘vivisection’ in the UK. ASPA itself was amended in 2013 to ensure the full implementation of EU Directive 2010/63/EU, the European Union legislation ‘on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes’, which is considered to be one of the most stringent ethical and welfare standards worldwide. ASPA allows (and controls) legitimate studies using animals in a framework designed to ensure that the potential harms to the animals are justified by the likely benefits of the research. While most veterinary surgeons working in clinical situations do not set out to perform ASPA‐regulated research, a desire to improve clinical outcomes for their patients or for the wider population means that, at times, they may approach or even cross the line from recognised veterinary practice into procedures or activities that require regulation under ASPA, the Veterinary Medicines Regulations (VMR) or other legislation. AIM OF THE ARTICLE: This article provides information on the legislation that exists to protect animals in research and explains how ASPA can affect all veterinary surgeons, and not just those working in research, due to its intersection with the Veterinary Surgeons Act and VMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanimal research 3aethics 3alaws and regulations 3aveterinary clinics1 aPetrie, Anja0 tIn practice.g2020 Nov., v. 42, no. 9 p.488-496dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl42967x0263-841X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/inp.m39203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006800160300001600228520120400244592002801448650001101476650001401487650001801501650001801519650001101537650001001548650002001558650001001578650001901588650001101607700001401618773013501632856007501767852000901842655001201851IND60765160620221119092541.0220419e20111212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076516062DNAL7 a10.17221/4302-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZ Saricicek, B.13aAn investigation on determining the nutritive value of oak nuts  ap. 211-219.  aThis study was conducted to determine the nutritive values of shelled, unshelled oak nuts and their shells. For the estimation of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP), degradability characteristics, digestibilities, energy values and tannin contents of these feedstuffs the nylon bag technique, cellulose feed system and enzyme methods were used. In spite of the fact that in situ dry matter, organic matter and crude protein degradabilities of shelled and unshelled oak nuts were high, the degradabilities of shells were found lower. Degradability characteristics (a, b, a + b) and effective degradabilities were high in unshelled and shelled oak nuts and low in shells. The differences between the oak nut shells and the other two groups were significant for DM and OM degradabilities (P &lt; 0.01). Pepsin digestible N contents were lower in shelled and unshelled oak nuts and high in shells. Unshelled and shelled oak nuts were significantly different from the oak nut shells for digestibility of DM and OM. Energy values were highest in unshelled oak nuts and lowest in shells. Oak nuts can be used as a forage source in regions with their high natural production. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aacorns 3acellulose 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3afeeds 3anutritive value 3anylon 3aorganic matter 3apepsin1 aKilic, U.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 49, no. 5 p.211-219dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4302-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00925naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008300167300001600250520007800266592002800344650001700372650001800389650002200407650001600429700002000445700001900465773009400484856004800578852000900626655001200635IND50070426220221120135458.0131107e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007042622DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738130700382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShobanov, N.

Aims We investigated bird use and vegetation in relation to Agri-Environment Scheme over-winter stubble type and preceding crop. Methods We surveyed 15–17 fields each of: ‘standard’ Agri-Environment Scheme stubble on Entry Level Stewardship farms (EF6); ‘standard’ Agri-Environment Scheme stubble on Higher Level Stewardship farms (HF6); stubble preceded by low-input cereal (HF15); extended over-winter stubble (EF22) and non-Agri-Environment Scheme stubble in November/December 2011 and January/February 2012. Stubbles were preceded by spring barley or winter wheat crops. Results Previous cropping and time of year were the main factors influencing bird densities: bunting densities declined in winter wheat stubbles between surveys, but not in spring barley stubbles. Conclusion The main factor limiting the ability of over-winter stubbles to reverse national population trends of farmland birds is likely to be scale of provision. However, this study suggests that selecting spring barley crops to leave as over-winter stubbles may benefit granivorous farmland birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abirds 3acrops 3afarms 3aspring barley 3astubble 3asurveys 3avegetation 3awinter wheat 3aEngland1 aField, Rob H.1 aMorris, Antony J.1 aCooke, Andrew I.1 aFern, Jeremy1 aGrice, P.

Their activities, similar to other CYPs, can be altered in tumor tissues. Here, we examined a possible role of proliferative/survival pathways signaling, which is often deregulated in tumor cells, and possible links with p300 histone acetyltransferase (a transcriptional co-activator) in the control of CYP1 expression, focusing particularly on CYP1A1. Using cell models derived from human liver, we observed that the induction of CYP1A1 expression, as well as other CYP1 enzymes, was reduced in exponentially growing cells, as compared with their non-dividing counterparts. The siRNA-mediated inhibition of proliferation/pro-survival signaling pathway effectors (such as β-catenin and/or Hippo pathway effectors YAP/TAZ) increased the AhR ligand-induced CYP1A1 mRNA levels in liver HepaRG cells, and/or in colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells. The activation of proliferative Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCT-116 cells reduced both the induction of CYP1 enzymes and the binding of p300 to the promoter of CYP1A1 or CYP1B1 genes. These results seem to indicate that aberrant proliferative signaling in tumor cells could suppress induction of CYP1A1 (or other CYP1 enzymes) via competition for p300 binding. This mechanism could be involved in modulation of the metabolism of both endogenous and exogenous substrates of CYP1A1 (and other CYP1 enzymes), with possible further consequences for alterations of the AhR signaling in tumor cells, or additional functional roles of CYP1 enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaryl hydrocarbon receptors 3acell viability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytochrome P-450 3ahistone acetyltransferase 3ahumans 3aligands 3aliver 3ametabolism 3atoxicology 3atranscription (genetics) 3axenobiotics 0aCell proliferation 0aAhR 0ap300 0aCYP1 enzymes 0aβ-Catenin signaling 0aCancer cells1 aSvobodová, Jana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3994-348X1 aKabátková, Markéta1 aZapletal, Ondřej1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4259-83331 aHyršlová Vaculová, Alena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0445-88071 aNekvindová, Jana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2861-54831 aVondráček, Jan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4071-19690 tToxicology.g2021 Sept., v. 461 p.152897-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.1528973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245013500164300001800299500002000317520133900337592002801676650003101704650001201735650001101747650001001758650001801768650001501786650001201801650002201813650001301835650001701848650001301865650002201878650002901900650002101929650002401950650001001974650002201984650002902006650001702035650001002052700002402062700002802086700002902114700003102143700002502174700002202199700002202221700002202243700001902265700001702284773011102301856007902412852000902491655001202500IND60548438820221122042748.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054843882DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.134222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonato, Paloma10aRNA‐seq analyses reveal insights into the function of respiratory nitrate reductase of the diazotroph Herbaspirillum seropedicae  ap. 2677-2688.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHerbaspirillum seropedicae is a nitrogen‐fixing β‐proteobacterium that associates with roots of gramineous plants. In silico analyses revealed that H. seropedicae genome has genes encoding a putative respiratory (NAR) and an assimilatory nitrate reductase (NAS). To date, little is known about nitrate metabolism in H. seropedicae, and, as this bacterium cannot respire nitrate, the function of NAR remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the function of NAR in H. seropedicae and how it metabolizes nitrate in a low aerated‐condition. RNA‐seq transcriptional profiling in the presence of nitrate allowed us to pinpoint genes important for nitrate metabolism in H. seropedicae, including nitrate transporters and regulatory proteins. Additionally, both RNA‐seq data and physiological characterization of a mutant in the catalytic subunit of NAR (narG mutant) showed that NAR is not required for nitrate assimilation but is required for: (i) production of high levels of nitrite, (ii) production of NO and (iii) dissipation of redox power, which in turn lead to an increase in carbon consumption. In addition, wheat plants showed an increase in shoot dry weight only when inoculated with H. seropedicae wild type, but not with the narG mutant, suggesting that NAR is important to H. seropedicae‐wheat interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHerbaspirillum seropedicae 3aPoaceae 3acarbon 3agenes 3alung function 3ametabolism 3amutants 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aprotein subunits 3aregulatory proteins 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransporters 3awheat1 aBatista, Marcelo B.1 aCamilios‐Neto, Doumit1 aPankievicz, Vânia C.

The microchannel method proposed by us can exquisitely program the molecular arrangement. Based on the mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between graphene oxide (GO) and the azobenzene doped liquid crystal network (ALCN), bilayer actuators can exhibit reversible, rapid, and complex deformations under the control of heat, UV and NIR light. Furthermore, in addition to microchannels, various deformation behaviors of bilayer actuators can also be programmed by directionally arranging GO layers. Smart bilayer membranes can be customized into a range of delicate biomimetic devices, such as bionic butterfly, bionic leaf, and foot robot, promising their numerous applications in biomimetic and intelligent soft robotics fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3abiomimetic materials 3abiomimetics 3abutterflies 3adeformation 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aheat 3aleaves 3aliquid crystals 3anear infrared radiation 3arobots 3athermal expansion 0aliquid crystal network 0abionic actuator 0aazobenzene 0alight-driven1 aPan, Jingkai1 aLiu, Yinghao1 aXu, Yu1 aZhang, Aimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6518-200X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 09, v. 12, no. 5 p.6727-6735dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b206723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007200160300001800232520058900250592002800839650001400867650002300881650002300904650002100927650001800948650002200966650002200988650001001010700002601020773011901046856007501165852000901240655001201249IND60549878720221121215413.0160909e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054987872DNAL7 a10.1021/jo300737u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGauchot, Vincent10aAsymmetric Aldol Reaction Catalyzed by the Anion of an Ionic Liquid  ap. 4917-4923.  aHerein we report the synthesis of a chiral imidazolium salt derived from trans-l-hydroxyproline and its applications as a catalyst for the asymmetric aldol reaction.

The subcellular localization suggested that AlTMP2 is a plasma membrane protein. In A. littoralis exposed to salt and osmotic stresses, the AlTMP2 gene was induced early and at a high rate, but was upregulated relatively later in response to abscisic acid and cold treatments. Expression of AlTMP2 in tobacco conferred improved tolerance against salinity, osmotic, H₂O₂, heat, and freezing stresses at the germination and seedling stages. Under control conditions, no growth or yield penalty were mentioned in transgenic plants due to the constitutive expression of AlTMP2. Interestingly, under greenhouse conditions, the seed yield of transgenic plants was significantly higher than that of non-transgenic (NT) plants grown under salt or drought stress. Furthermore, AlTMP2 plants had less electrolyte leakage, higher membrane stability, and lower Na⁺ and higher K⁺ accumulation than NT plants. Finally, six stress-related genes were shown to be deregulated in AlTMP2 plants relative to NT plants under both control and stress conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that AlTMP2 confers abiotic stress tolerance by improving ion homeostasis and membrane integrity, and by deregulating certain stress-related genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeluropus 3aC4 plants 3aabscisic acid 3acold stress 3acold treatment 3aelectrolytes 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agermination 3agrasses 3agreenhouse production 3ahalophytes 3aheat 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amembrane proteins 3aosmotic stress 3aplasma membrane 3apotassium 3asalinity 3aseed yield 3aseedlings 3asodium 3astress tolerance 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress1 aBen-Saad, Rania1 aMeynard, Donaldo1 aZouari, Nabil1 aMahjoub, Ali1 aFki, Lotfi1 aGuiderdoni, Emmanuel1 aAl-Doss, Abdullah1 aHassairi, Afif1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6292-97530 tProtoplasma.g2018 July, v. 255, no. 4 p.1161-1177dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl44608x0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-018-1223-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006500145245008100210300002000291520122400311592002801535650001501563650001401578650001601592650002301608650000901631650001701640650001501657650002301672650002201695650002201717700002101739700002601760700002201786700006001808773013701868856007902005852000902084655001202093IND60615178220190313000000.0181009e20180904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061517822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b016152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadowski, Bartłomiej1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1323-282610aElectron-Rich Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones: Synthesis and Optical Properties  ap. 11645-11653.  aThis article describes the design rationale for highly electron-rich dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione (DPND) derivatives bearing substituted amino groups at the 3 and 9 positions, which exhibit absorption in the red and emission in the red/NIR region of the spectrum. These novel dyes are easily synthesized through a two-step protocol consisting of bromination of the DPND molecule followed by Buchwald–Hartwig amination. We demonstrated that the diamino-dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones have high ionization energies (∼4.7 eV) and that the spectroelectrochemical properties can be rationally tuned by altering the nature of the peripheral substituted amino groups. All amino-DPNDs exhibit solvatofluorochromism, which has not been previously reported for dyes possessing this core. Theoretical calculations reveal that in all cases, the strongest absorption is exhibited by the S₁ states which clearly correlate with the HOMO–LUMO orbital transition. As all higher states have lower oscillator strengths, it is clear that fluorescence is completely dominated by the excitation/deexcitation sequence S₀ → S₁, S₁ → S₀ and that there are no contributions to the fluorescence from excitations to higher states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aamination 3abromination 3achemical structure 3adyes 3afluorescence 3aionization 3aoptical properties 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds1 aLoebnitz, Marcel1 aDombrowski, Dennis R.1 aFriese, Daniel H.1 aGryko, Daniel T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2146-12820 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2018 Sept. 04, v. 83, no. 19 p.11645-11653dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b016153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245011600205300001800321506007600339520189100415592002802306506003702334650002502371650001502396650002302411650002002434650001002454650002002464650001102484650002602495650001202521650001402533650001702547650001902564650001402583650002302597650002902620650002602649650003102675650001402706650002902720700002302749700002202772700002002794700002202814700002502836700002402861700002102885700001802906700001702924773011502941856007703056852000903133655001203142IND60171870220221207100423.0150602e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017187022DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.112.1962202doi7 aPMC34251922pmcid7 a227064482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogelmann, Katja10aEarly Senescence and Cell Death in Arabidopsis saul1 Mutants Involves the PAD4-Dependent Salicylic Acid Pathway  ap. 1477-1487.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAge-dependent leaf senescence and cell death in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) requires activation of the transcription factor ORESARA1 (ORE1) and is not initiated prior to a leaf age of 28 d. Here, we investigate the conditional execution of events that regulate early senescence and cell death in senescence-associated ubiquitin ligase1 (saul1) mutants, deficient in the PLANT U-BOX-ARMADILLO E3 ubiquitin ligase SAUL1. In saul1 mutants challenged with low light, the switch of age-dependent cell death was turned on prematurely, as indicated by the accumulation of ORE1 transcripts, induction of the senescence marker gene SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE12 , and cell death. However, ORE1 accumulation by itself was not sufficient to cause saul1 phenotypes, as demonstrated by double mutant analysis. Exposure of saul1 mutants to low light for only 24 h did not result in visible symptoms of senescence; however, the senescence-promoting transcription factor genes WRKY53 , WRKY6 , and NAC-LIKE ACTIVATED BY AP3/PI were up-regulated, indicating that senescence in saul1 seedlings was already initiated. To resolve the time course of gene expression, microarray experiments were performed at narrow intervals. Differential expression of the genes involved in salicylic acid and defense mechanisms were the earliest events detected, suggesting a central role for salicylic acid in saul1 senescence and cell death. The salicylic acid content increased in low-light-treated saul1 mutants, and application of exogenous salicylic acid was indeed sufficient to trigger saul1 senescence in permissive light conditions. Double mutant analyses showed that PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4) but not NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES1 (NPR1) is essential for saul1 phenotypes.

These challenges also depend on plant community composition and diversity. Over time, biodiversity effects have been shown to be strengthened via increasing species complementarity in mixtures. Little is known, however, whether differences in community diversity and composition induce rapid transgenerational phenotypic adaptive differentiation during community assembly. We expect altered plant–plant and other biotic interactions (mutualists or antagonists) in high vs. low diverse communities to affect immediate within‐ and between‐species trait differentiations due to competition for light and nutrients. Three years after the initiation of a large‐scale, long‐term biodiversity experiment in Jena, Germany, we tested for effects of varying experimental plant community diversity (1–60 plant species; one to four plant functional groups) and composition (with or without legumes and/or grasses) on phenotypic differentiation and variation of the tall herb Knautia arvensis. We measured reproduction at different diversity levels in the Jena Experiment (residents hereafter) and, in an additional common garden experiment without competition, recorded subsequent offspring performance (i.e. growth, reproductive success and susceptibility to powdery mildew) to test for differentiation in phenotypic expression and variability. We observed phenotypic differences among diversity levels with reduced fecundity of K. arvensis residents in more diverse communities. In the next generation grown under common garden conditions, offspring from high‐diversity plots showed reduced growth (i.e. height) and lower reproduction (i.e. fewer infructescences), but increased phenotypic trait variability (e.g. in leaf width and powdery mildew presence) and also tended to be less susceptible to powdery mildew infection. Community composition also affected Knautia parents and offspring. In the presence of legumes, resident plants produced more seeds (increased fecundity); however, germination rate of those seeds was reduced at an early seedling stage (reduced fertility). Synthesis. We conclude that rapid transgenerational effects of community diversity and composition on both mean and variation of phenotypic traits among offspring exist. In addition to heritable variation, environmentally induced epigenetic and/or maternal processes matter for early plant community assembly and may also determine future species coexistence and community stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKnautia arvensis 3aantagonists 3abotanical composition 3acommunity structure 3aepigenetics 3afecundity 3agermination 3agrasses 3aleaves 3alegumes 3amutualism 3anutrients 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aplant communities 3apowdery mildew 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aGermany1 aKummer, Volker1 aFischer, Markus1 aJoshi, Jasmin0 tjournal of ecology.g2017 May, v. 105, no. 3 p.714-725dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.126893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009800169300001600267520089200283592002801175650002001203650001401223650001001237650002401247650001601271650001201287650001001299650001601309650001601325650001001341650000901351650002401360650001801384650001101402650001701413650001801430650001201448653001401460653001601474653002001490653000901510700002501519700002001544700002201564700002401586773011401610856008301724852000901807655001201816IND60534546120221119100613.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053454612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAupanun, Sawinee10aOral exposure of fusarenon-X induced apoptosis in Peyer's patches, thymus, and spleen of mice  ap. 217-222.  aICR male mice were orally administered once daily with Fusarenon-X (FX) at 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5mg/kg body weight for 14days, and examined at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48h after last treatment (HAT) on Day 14. FX did not affect body and organ weight, however, at the higher doses FX caused nuclear condensation and fragmentation of lymphocytes in the cortical thymus and germinal center of Peyer's patches. Such effects were not observed in the liver, kidney and brain. Apoptotic lymphocytes evaluated by modified TUNEL method showed dose-dependency and peaked at 12 HAT in the Peyer's patches and thymus of 0.3 and 0.5mg/kg FX-treated mice, whereas apoptotic bodies engulfed by macrophage were clearly seen by electron microscopy in 0.5mg/kg FX-treated mice.

However, a cohesive synthesis–structure–electrochemistry relationship is still lacking for these materials, which impedes progress in the field. This work investigates how and why different synthesis routes, specifically solid-state and modified Pechini sol–gel methods, affect the properties of Li₂MnO₃, a compositionally simple member of this material system. Through a comprehensive investigation of the synthesis mechanism along with crystallographic, morphological, and electrochemical characterization, the effects of different synthesis routes were found to predominantly influence the degree of stacking faults and particle morphology. That is, the modified Pechini method produced isotropic spherical particles with approximately 57% faulting and the solid-state samples possessed heterogeneous morphology with approximately 43% faulting probability. Inevitably, these differences lead to variations in electrochemical performance. This study accentuates the importance of understanding how synthesis affects the electrochemistry of these materials, which is critical considering the crystallographic and electrochemical complexities of the class of materials more generally. The methodology employed here is extendable to studying synthesis–property relationships of other compositionally complex Li-rich layered oxide systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acrystallography 3aelectrochemistry 3aisotropy 3alithium batteries 3aoxides 3aprobability 3asol-gel processing 0aLi-rich layered oxides 0asynthesis−property relationship 0aLi2MnO3 0astacking faults 0acathode materials1 aOjwang, Dickson O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9304-89751 aWillhammar, Tom1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6120-12181 aPeterson, Vanessa K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5442-05911 aEdström, Kristina,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4440-29521 aGomez, Cesar Pay1 aBrant, William R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8658-89380 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 08, v. 12, no. 5 p.5939-5950dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b207543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008900160300001800249520117300267592002801440650001301468650001601481650002101497650001801518650000901536650002301545650002001568650001601588650001601604700001701620700001801637700002101655700002701676773012001703856007501823852000901898655001201907IND60558858820170926000000.0161118e20130509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055885882DNAL7 a10.1021/jp401701u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaumann, Philipp10aSoret Coefficient in Nonionic Microemulsions: Concentration and Structure Dependence  ap. 5614-5622.  aHere we investigate the thermal diffusion behavior of the nonionic microemulsion water/n-decane/pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C₁₂E₅). We study the dependence of the Soret coefficient on the structure and composition by infrared thermal diffusion Rayleigh scattering. The form and size of the microemulsion structure is characterized by dynamic light scattering and small angle neutron scattering. The system was examined in the one-phase region between the emulsification failure boundary and the near critical boundary, where oil swollen nanostructures stabilized by an amphiphilic surfactant film are dispersed in a continuous water phase. The size and shape of these structures as well as the interfacial properties of microemulsions can be varied by changing temperature and composition, which allows a systematic study of their influence on the thermal diffusion properties. In addition, we analyze the relationship between the Soret coefficient and the temperature dependence of the interfacial tension as proposed by A. Parola and R. Piazza (Eur. Phys. J. E2004, 15, 255–263) and find reasonable agreement for spherical microemulsion droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aemulsifying 3alight scattering 3ananomaterials 3aoils 3aphysical chemistry 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3atemperature1 aBecker, Nils1 aDatta, Sascha1 aSottmann, Thomas1 aWiegand, S.q(Simone),0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 May 09, v. 117, no. 18 p.5614-5622dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp401701u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008900169300001600258500001900274520136300293592002801656650001001684650002901694650001701723650001601740651001401756653002501770653002601795653001901821653002001840653002101860700001701881700001801898700001701916700002101933773009701954856008502051852000902136655001202145IND60737781420221120182633.0210708e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073778142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.05.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarbun, B.T.H.10aReview of directional drilling design and operation of geothermal wells in Indonesia  ap. 135-152.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGenerally, geothermal fields in Indonesia are situated in the mountains, forests, and remote area. The surface area, access, environment, license, and permit are limited, so that from a permitted well pad many wells are designed directionally to reach the reservoir.Directional drilling in geothermal wells is challenging due to hard volcanic rocks, the presence of vugs or cavern, and high temperatures leading to massive lost circulation, drilling break, and the difficulty to turn and control the direction stably during drilling. These cause a critical condition reducing the wellbore quality: high Dogleg Severity (DLS), tight hole, and stuck pipe occurrence. Besides, this leads to higher stress and strain experienced by the casing or liner and causes yield strength reduction and failure.Thus, it is essential that the directional drilling design and operation, particularly trajectory, be optimized. This research summarized methods to evaluate the actual drilling operation and wellbore condition of wells in Dieng Field. The result is useful to identify the critical conditions caused by drilling and formation problems setting the maximum load limitations of the design and subsequent operation.

Integrated land use modeling frameworks increasingly acknowledge their role when analyzing economic and environmental impacts of agricultural production systems. However, insufficient data on crop rotations often challenge their consideration. In this article, we present the crop rotation model CropRota, which integrates agronomic criteria and observed land use data to generate typical crop rotations for farms and regions. The article describes the model and data requirements as well as an application of CropRota to 579 farms in the Austrian Mostviertel region. Model validation and sensitivity analysis are conducted to reveal robustness and accuracy of model outputs as well as its appropriateness for supporting integrated land use analyses. Comparisons between modeled and observed crop sequences from seven years of field observations show that the average area-weighted deviations range between 11% and 105% depending on the procedure of comparison and model specifications. The results indicate that CropRota is a suitable tool for the estimation of typical crop rotations from observed land use data. In addition, the model is sufficiently flexible to spatial scales and research contexts as frequently required in integrated land use analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop models 3acrop rotation 3acropping sequence 3aeconomic impact 3afarms 3aland use 3amodel validation 3aproduction technology 3asustainable agriculture1 aSchmid, Erwin1 aSchneider, Uwe A.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2011 May, v. 34, no. 4 p.263-277dElsevier B.V.x1161-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2011.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013300168520168900301592002801990650001502018650002302033650002402056650002202080650001402102650001302116650001802129650002402147650003002171650001902201653002002220653003202240653002202272653002602294700001302320700001702333700001802350700001602368700001402384773011302398856008602511852000902597655001202606IND60676226220221118190204.0200405e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067622622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1190712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhifeng14aThe mixed production mode considering continuous and intermittent processing for an energy-efficient hybrid flow shop scheduling  aEnergy-saving scheduling in forging production has attracted increasing attention because of the advances in sustainable manufacturing technologies. The unit energy consumption of forging production equipment is significantly higher than that of other general manufacturing equipment. Employing efficient and energy-saving scheduling methods can significantly reduce the energy consumption in forging production. However, the relationship between heating furnace and other equipment in forging production is complicated, resulting in few studies on energy-saving scheduling problem for forging production line. Thus, the energy-efficient hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with forging operations (EHFSP-FO) was investigated in this research. First, the production mode considering multiple time factors and mixed production was established. The mixed production mode consisted of continuous processing with variable parameters and intermittent processing. Then, a novel mathematical model considering makespan and energy consumption was constructed based on the mixed production mode for the proposed problem, and a new rule to identify the optimum transportation sequence and time was formulated. Furthermore, the population and major operators were designed and applied to an evolutionary algorithm by weighted sum approach. The scheduling results were achieved based on the real-world process data for different types of ring forgings to verify the feasibility of the established mathematical model. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed mathematical model can be used to identify the optimal schedule considering makespan and energy consumption simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acontinuous systems 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aequipment 3afurnaces 3amanufacturing 3amathematical models 3asustainable manufacturing 3atransportation 0aProduction mode 0aHybrid flow shop scheduling 0aForging operation 0aMultiple time factors1 aYan, Jun1 aCheng, Qiang1 aYang, Congbin1 aSun, Shuwen1 aXue, Deyi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 246 p.119071-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1190713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245012100153300001800274500001500292520119400307592002801501650001401529650002701543650001101570650001301581650000901594650001501603650002201618650004701640650002601687650002301713650001001736650002301746650001901769650001801788650001801806650002001824650001001844653003001854653003501884653001301919653000901932653000901941653002701950653003501977700002002012700001902032700001802051700002302069700002002092700001702112773009602129856003802225852000902263655001202272IND50061993220221122150610.0130321s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006199322DNAL7 a10.1071/CP122552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaman, Rosy10aMolecular mapping and validation of Rlm1 gene for resistance to Leptosphaeria maculans in canola (Brassica napus L.)  ap. 1007-1017.  a2019-12-06  aEuropean winter canola (Brassica napus L.) cultivars harbour genes for durable resistance to the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans, which causes blackleg disease under Australian environmental conditions. Previous studies have shown that resistance in winter-type cultivars Maxol and Columbus is controlled by two genes, Rlm1 and Rlm3, which have been mapped using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers onto chromosome A7. We mapped a doubled-haploid population that consisted of 101 lines from a cross between Maxol*1 and Westar-10 using diversity arrays technology and simple sequence repeat (SSR)-based markers. Two SSR marker loci, Xol12-e03 and Xra2-a05b, flanked the Rlm1 locus at an interval of 6.7cM, which corresponds to ~3.2Mb of the Brassica rapa genomic sequence; this region contains several genes encoding putative kinase and leucine-rich repeat-type disease-resistance proteins. SSR markers were further tested for their linkage with the Rlm1 locus in an independent population derived from Columbus*3/Westar-10. Our results showed that SSR markers linked to Rlm1 can be useful for monitoring Rlm1 gene introgression in breeding populations derived from Maxol and Columbus.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3amicrosatellite repeats 3acanola 3aproteins 3aloci 3amonitoring 3aPlenodomus lingam 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aenvironmental factors 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica rapa 3aintrogression 3agenetic markers 3afungi 0amarker-assisted selection 0arace specific resistance genes 0ablackleg 0aRlm3 0aRlm1 0aLeptosphaeria maculans 0asimple sequence repeat markers1 aTaylor, Belinda1 aLindbeck, Kurt1 aCoombes, Neil1 aBarbulescu, Denise1 aSalisbury, Phil1 aRaman, Harsh0 tCrop & pasture science.g2012, v. 63, no. 10 p.1007-1017dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP12255  aDNAL 7aarticle01581naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010200158300001800260520073500278592002801013650001201041650002201053650001901075700001801094773011901112856007501231852000901306655001201315IND60549879020221120055518.0160909e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054987902DNAL7 a10.1021/jo30078962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErver, Florian10aCobalt- versus Ruthenium-Catalyzed Alder–Ene Reaction for the Synthesis of Credneramide A and B  ap. 5215-5219.  aThe first synthesis of the natural products credneramide A and B was accomplished by utilizing Alder–ene reactions between a terminal alkene and an internal alkyne to generate the rather uncommon 1,4-diene substructure of these compounds.

Twenty-two dairy cows were randomly assigned to either GPG (Day 0: 100μg GnRH, Day 7: 500μg PGF2α, Day 9: 100μg GnRH, Day 0–7: Day 10) or GPG with a progesterone device from Day 0 to 7 (GPG+P4). Ovarian follicular dynamics and ovulation synchronisation were studied using transrectal ultrasonography. Compared to the GPG+P4, GPG alone resulted in a relatively larger mean dominant follicle size and a higher mean peripheral oestradiol concentration (74.9pg∗day vs. 60.6pg∗day; P=0.002); however, there was much greater variation in follicle diameter in the group treated with GPG (7.8–22mm vs. 10.8–17.5mm in GPG+P4) and this may, at least partly explain why only 7/11 cows in this group ovulated within 48h of the Day 9 GnRH injection compared to 10/10 of the cows in the GPG+P4 group. These results suggest that differences in follicular dynamics between GPG and GPG+P4 programmes are not a key driver of the difference in conception rate, but further studies are required to better assess the role of ovulation synchronisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanestrus 3aanimal ovaries 3aanovulation 3aconception rate 3adairy cows 3aestradiol 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aprogesterone 3aultrasonography 0aAnovulatory anoestrus 0aGPG 0aProgesterone 0aSynchronisation 0aOvulation1 aCockrem, J.F.1 aParkinson, T.J.1 aLaven, R.A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2015 Oct., v. 102 p.200-205dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245014100171300001600312520111900328592002801447650001701475650002501492650001501517650001301532650001701545651001001562653001501572653003601587653002801623653002101651653002501672653001001697700001601707700001701723773010901740856008901849852000901938655001201947IND60601230920221122041256.0201202e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060123092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsman, Taher10aExamining the extent to which stakeholder collaboration during ecotourism planning processes could be applied within an Egyptian context  ap. 126-137.  aIn Egypt, as in most developing countries, the relationship between the environment and development remains very unbalanced because of tensions between, and among, all relevant stakeholder groups. These unbalanced relationships are circular and are unlikely to be resolved without more effective collaboration between the relevant stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is examine the extent to which greater stakeholder collaboration during ecotourism planning processes could be applied in practice. Based on two Egyptian ecotourism case studies our analysis suggests that any stakeholder involvement has tended towards a consultative rather than collaborative approach. Developing any mutual understanding, by listening to stakeholder views and interests, in order to build a consensus between the stakeholder groups was not achieved. Nevertheless, more, effective stakeholder participation during the process could be enabled, and a move towards greater collaboration between and among the stakeholder groups, could be realised if the identified gaps in operationalising stakeholder engagement were mitigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeveloping countries 3aecotourism 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3aEgypt 0aEcotourism 0aCollaborative planning approach 0aStakeholders engagement 0aPlanning process 0aDeveloping countries 0aEgypt1 aShaw, David1 aKenawy, Emad0 tLand use policy.g2018 Nov., v. 78 p.126-137dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013900157300002000296520141700316592002801733650001301761650002501774650001601799650001901815650001001834650002101844650001201865650002101877650001901898650002601917650001901943650001501962650001801977650001601995650001302011650001402024650002302038650001402061700002002075700001602095700001702111700001802128700001702146700001802163700002002181773012402201856007402325852000902399655001202408IND60667623820221122064108.0190919e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066762382DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra07806g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hualin10aSynthesis and bioactivity of gelatin/multiwalled carbon nanotubes/hydroxyapatite nanofibrous scaffolds towards bone tissue engineering  ap. 53550-53558.  aThe objective of this study was to develop a novel three-dimensional biomimetic gelatin/multiwalled carbon nanotubes/hydroxyapatite (gelatin/MWNTs/HA) nanofibrous scaffold via electrospinning technique for bone tissue engineering. The mechanical properties, structure, morphology and the bioactivity of nanofibrous scaffolds in vitro were investigated. Attentions were focused on the adhesion, mineralization, viability and proliferation of human fetal osteoblastic cells (hFOBs) on scaffold. Resulting scaffolds provided relative good mechanical support (7.9 ± 0.32 MPa) and high porosity (91.2%) to mimic a favorable environment for hFOBs. The hydrogen bonds between gelatin molecules and MWNTs/HA units were confirmed, and the incorporation of HA or MWNTs/HA nanoparticles caused an increase in porosity and strength of scaffolds, meanwhile the surface of nanofibers tended to be rough. HA nanoparticles showed a chelating effect to promote osteogenesis and mineralization of bone, and MWNTs had a synergetic effect with HA to induce the apatite formation. As compared to gelatin and gelatin/HA scaffolds, gelatin/MWNTs/HA scaffold exhibited the best viability hFOB cells cultured in vitro, most excellent morphology of hFOB cells seeded into scaffold and a significantly increasing in proliferation. The nanofibrous scaffold will have great potential as an excellent scaffold for in bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abioactive properties 3abiomimetics 3abone formation 3abones 3acarbon nanotubes 3agelatin 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydroxyapatite 3amechanical properties 3amineralization 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3aosteoblasts 3aporosity 3asynergism 3atissue engineering 3aviability1 aChu, Chengjiang1 aCai, Ruizhi1 aJiang, Suwei1 aZhai, Linfeng1 aLu, Jianfeng1 aLi, Xingjiang1 aJiang, Shaotong0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 17, v. 5, no. 66 p.53550-53558dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra07806g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245012600183300001800309520141200327592002801739650001301767650002101780650001901801650001501820650001501835650002001850650001301870650002501883650001701908650004901925650003501974650002302009700002002032700001802052700001702070700002002087773013602107856004802243852000902291655001202300IND50068078520221121234325.0140228e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006807852DNAL7 a237160772pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1824-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, J. C.10aQuantitative image analysis for the characterization of microbial aggregates in biological wastewater treatment: a review  ap. 5887-5912.  aQuantitative image analysis techniques have gained an undeniable role in several fields of research during the last decade. In the field of biological wastewater treatment (WWT) processes, several computer applications have been developed for monitoring microbial entities, either as individual cells or in different types of aggregates. New descriptors have been defined that are more reliable, objective, and useful than the subjective and time-consuming parameters classically used to monitor biological WWT processes. Examples of this application include the objective prediction of filamentous bulking, known to be one of the most problematic phenomena occurring in activated sludge technology. It also demonstrated its usefulness in classifying protozoa and metazoa populations. In high-rate anaerobic processes, based on granular sludge, aggregation times and fragmentation phenomena could be detected during critical events, e.g., toxic and organic overloads. Currently, the major efforts and needs are in the development of quantitative image analysis techniques focusing on its application coupled with stained samples, either by classical or fluorescent-based techniques. The use of quantitative morphological parameters in process control and online applications is also being investigated. This work reviews the major advances of quantitative image analysis applied to biological WWT processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aactivated sludge 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aprocess control 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 2aFlocculation 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assistedxmethods 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Microbiology1 aMesquita, D.

The poor stereoselectivities of 4,6-di-O-acetyl-2,3-O-carbonate protected thioglycoside donors in glycosyl coupling reactions were greatly improved, and excellent α-stereoselectivities were achieved by the addition of 0.2 equiv of BF₃·OEt₂. On the other hand, the β-selectivities of 4,6-di-O-benzyl-2,3-O-carbonate-protected thioglucoside donor toward glycosylations were reversed completely to the α-selectivities by the use of 1 equiv of SnCl₄, making the stereoselectivity controllable. Furthermore, the poor stereoselectivities of 4,6-di-O-benzyl-2,3-O-carbonate-protected thiogalactoside donor in glycosylations were also improved by using SnCl₄ as additive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aadditives 3achemical structure 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aglycosylation 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3astereoselectivity1 aQin, Qi1 aYe, Xin-Shan0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 June 15, v. 77, no. 12 p.5255-5270dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo30020843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002100165245009700186300001600283520082500299592002801124650002901152650001801181650001601199650003801215650002001253650002001273650001101293650001601304650001601320700002601336700001601362700001901378773010101397856008201498852000901580655001201589IND4475976420221118221408.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447597642DNAL7 a216165532pmid7 a10.1016/j.tree.2011.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolasky, Stephen10aDecision-making under great uncertainty: environmental management in an era of global change  ap. 398-404.  aGlobal change issues are complex and the consequences of decisions are often highly uncertain. The large spatial and temporal scales and stakes involved make it important to take account of present and potential consequences in decision-making. Standard approaches to decision-making under uncertainty require information about the likelihood of alternative states, how states and actions combine to form outcomes and the net benefits of different outcomes. For global change issues, however, the set of potential states is often unknown, much less the probabilities, effect of actions or their net benefits. Decision theory, thresholds, scenarios and resilience thinking can expand awareness of the potential states and outcomes, as well as of the probabilities and consequences of outcomes under alternative decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental management 3aglobal change 3auncertainty 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDecision Making 2aDecision Theory 2aHumans 2aProbability 2aUncertainty1 aCarpenter, Stephen R.1 aFolke, Carl1 aKeeler, Bonnie0 tTrends in ecology & evolution.g2011 Aug., v. 26, no. 8 p.398-404dElsevier Ltdx0169-53477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245019700179520174000376592002802116650001502144650002102159650001102180650001102191650001502202650001802217650001102235650002802246650001202274651002302286653002702309653001902336653001602355653002102371700002202392700002202414773011302436856008602549852000902635655001202644IND60676226420221118190232.0200405e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067622642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1190792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez-Santin, Lorna12aA review of revegetation at mine sites in the Alligator Rivers Region, Northern Territory, and the development of a state and transition model for ecological restoration at Ranger uranium mine  aSociety’s expectations for mining operations are that they are undertaken using the principles of sustainable development. Numerous mines have been ‘rehabilitated’ in past decades without clear closure criteria or regulatory oversight and are characterised by less than desirable environmental outcomes. These sites provide us with information and data (in some instances) to inform future mine site restoration efforts and the sustainable development of mining resources. However, this information and data are often contained in inaccessible grey literature or have been lost over time. We used records and data on revegetation efforts and outcomes at mine sites in and around the Alligator Rivers Region (ARR) of the Northern Territory, Australia, to demonstrate the extent and currency of rehabilitation knowledge. There have been 20 mines in the region since 1950 and we found that these sites are in various deviated ecological states and that data for these mines were generally unavailable or unable to be located. A number of studies have been conducted at the largest operation, Ranger uranium mine, and there is also information from Nabarlek and South Alligator River Valley mines. We furthered the understanding of the system using available information to develop a preliminary state and transition model for eucalypt-dominated ecosystems in the region. The identification of likely desired and undesired ecological states and management requirements developed in this model could be used to actively guide future restoration and research efforts, particularly at Ranger uranium mine. Based on the lessons learned from the mine sites in the ARR, we provide recommendations for monitoring revegetation in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aland restoration 3amining 3amodels 3amonitoring 3ariver valleys 3arivers 3asustainable development 3auranium 3aNorthern Territory 0aEcological restoration 0aRehabilitation 0aDisturbance 0aMineral deposits1 aErskine, Peter D.1 aBartolo, Renee E.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 246 p.119079-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1190793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04033naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245016500202300001800367506007600385520197400461592002802435506003702463650002402500650002602524650001702550650001502567650003502582650001002617650001702627650002002644650004102664650001002705650001602715650002002731650001302751650001502764650001802779650001102797650001902808650004402827650001402871650002102885650001702906650001302923650002002936650001202956650002002968650001002988650001102998650002603009650000903035650001003044700001803054700002103072700001603093700001703109700002003126773011503146856007703261852000903338655001203347IND60171871020221207111417.0150602e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017187102DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.112.1967172doi7 aPMC34251962pmcid7 a226450692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Harleen10aEnvironmental Stresses of Field Growth Allow Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase-Deficient Nicotiana attenuata Plants to Compensate for their Structural Deficiencies  ap. 1545-1570.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe organized lignocellulosic assemblies of cell walls provide the structural integrity required for the large statures of terrestrial plants. Silencing two CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE (CAD) genes in Nicotiana attenuata produced plants (ir-CAD) with thin, red-pigmented stems, low CAD and sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity, low lignin contents, and rubbery, structurally unstable stems when grown in the glasshouse (GH). However, when planted into their native desert habitat, ir-CAD plants produced robust stems that survived wind storms as well as the wild-type plants. Despite efficient silencing of NaCAD transcripts and enzymatic activity, field-grown ir-CAD plants had delayed and restricted spread of red stem pigmentation, a color change reflecting blocked lignification by CAD silencing, and attained wild-type-comparable total lignin contents. The rubbery GH phenotype was largely restored when field-grown ir-CAD plants were protected from wind, herbivore attack, and ultraviolet B exposure and grown in restricted rooting volumes; conversely, it was lost when ir-CAD plants were experimentally exposed to wind, ultraviolet B, and grown in large pots in growth chambers. Transcript and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-time-of-flight analysis revealed that these environmental stresses enhanced the accumulation of various phenylpropanoids in stems of field-grown plants; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that the lignin of field-grown ir-CAD plants had GH-grown comparable levels of sinapaldehyde and syringaldehyde cross-linked into their lignins. Additionally, field-grown ir-CAD plants had short, thick stems with normal xylem element traits, which collectively enabled field-grown ir-CAD plants to compensate for the structural deficiencies associated with CAD silencing. Environmental stresses play an essential role in regulating lignin biosynthesis in lignin-deficient plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana attenuata 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 3acolor 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme activity 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3agrowth chambers 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3alignification 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenotype 3aphenylpropanoids 3apigmentation 3aplanting 3aplants (botany) 3arooting 3asinapyl alcohol 3astems 3astorms 3aultraviolet radiation 3awind 3axylem1 aShaker, Kamel1 aHeinzel, Nicolas1 aRalph, John1 aGális, Ivan1 aBaldwin, Ian T.0 tPlant physiology.g2012 Aug., v. 159, no. 4 p.1545-1570dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.112.1967173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010700167300001600274520115800290592002801448650002401476650000901500650001701509650001701526650002001543650001401563653001901577653004301596653002001639653001601659653001001675700001701685700005301702700001401755700001601769700001601785773009001801856008501891852000901976655001201985IND60593119220221118025751.0200607e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059311922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.03.1672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhong10aDevelopment of multi-component surrogates of diesel from indirect coal liquefaction for spray analysis  ap. 341-347.  aThe aim of this work is to develop surrogates for the diesel from indirect coal liquefaction (DICL) using a model-based surrogate formulation methodology to emulate the fuel chemical and physical properties affecting the spray process and the ignition delay period. The detail compositions and the temperature-dependent physical properties (density, viscosity and surface tension) of DICL were firstly measured in this work to provide required data for the surrogate formulation method. Three surrogates were developed, which consist of six, four and two components (S1, S2 and S3). Surrogates S1 and S2 can well emulate all the temperature-independent and the temperature-dependent properties, while the S3 can only represent a part of these properties, especially the cetane number (CN) and distillation curve of S3 seriously deviate from the experimental data with deviations of −11.1% and 6.24% respectively. The three newly developed surrogates were used to predict the spray characteristics of the real DICL in the conditions with room temperature. Results show that the three surrogates can well reproduce the spray behaviors of the real DICL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acoal 3adistillation 3aliquefaction 3asurface tension 3aviscosity 0aSurrogate fuel 0aDiesel from indirect coal liquefaction 0aFuel properties 0aAtomization 0aSpray1 aXu, Xiaochen1 aJu, Dehao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7270-40451 aHan, Dong1 aQiao, Xinqi1 aHuang, Zhen0 tEnergy.g2018 June 01, v. 152 p.341-347dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.03.1673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011000161300001800271500001900289520103900308592002801347650001601375650002301391650001701414650001501431650002101446700003101467700001701498700002401515700002601539773013401565856007401699852000901773655001201782IND60707173720221120160206.0200814e20200813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070717372DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc02660c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatador, Esteban10aFormaldehyde tert-butyl hydrazone as a formyl anion equivalent: asymmetric addition to carbonyl compounds  ap. 9256-9267.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe asymmetric 1,2-addition of formyl anion equivalents to carbonyl compounds is a powerful synthetic tool that ideally provide access to highly functionalizable α-hydroxy aldehydes in an enantioselective fashion. In this context, the nucleophilic character of formaldehyde hydrazones, together with their remarkable stability as monomeric species, has been exploited for the functionalization of diverse carbonyl compounds, using initially auxiliary-based methodologies and, more recently, catalytic enantioselective versions. This feature article highlights our research progress employing formaldehyde tert-butyl hydrazone as a versatile formyl anion equivalent, in combination with bifunctional H-bonding organocatalysis. The design and optimization of different catalytic systems, focusing on a dual activation of both reagents, is reviewed, as well as the racemization free unmasking of the formyl group and representative product transformations for the construction of valuable, densely functionalyzed chiral building blocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aenantioselectivity 3aformaldehyde 3ahydrazones 3ahydrogen bonding1 ade Gracia Retamosa, María1 aMonge, David1 aFernández, Rosario1 aLassaletta, José M.,0 tChemical communications.g2020 Aug. 13, v. 56, no. 65 p.9256-9267dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cc02660c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100005900192245015900251300001800410506007600428520150000504592002802004506003702032650002402069650001502093650001302108653006902121653001902190653004002209653001302249653001302262653005602275653001302331700005502344700006102399700005502460773013402515856008502649852000902734655001202743IND60677892420221207083627.0191213e20191004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b005372doi7 aPMC69009862pmcid7 a315817752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chengxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7290-132410aBlinded Testing of Function Annotation for uPE1 Proteins by I-TASSER/COFACTOR Pipeline Using the 2018–2019 Additions to neXtProt and the CAFA3 Challenge  ap. 4154-4166.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn 2018, we reported a hybrid pipeline that predicts protein structures with I-TASSER and function with COFACTOR. I-TASSER/COFACTOR achieved Gene Ontology (GO) high prediction accuracies of Fmax = 0.69 and 0.57 for molecular function (MF) and biological process (BP), respectively, on 100 comprehensively annotated proteins. Now we report blinded analyses of newly annotated proteins in the critical assessment of function annotation (CAFA) three function prediction challenge and in neXtProt. For CAFA3 results released in May 2019, our predictions on 267 and 912 human proteins with newly annotated MF and BP terms achieved Fmax = 0.50 and 0.42, respectively, on “No Knowledge” proteins, and 0.51 and 0.74, respectively, on “Limited Knowledge” proteins. While COFACTOR consistently outperforms simple homology-based analysis, its accuracy still depends on template availability. Meanwhile, in neXtProt 2019–01, 25 proteins acquired new function annotation through literature curation at UniProt/Swiss-Prot. Before the release of these curated results, we submitted to neXtProt blinded predictions of free-text function annotation based on predicted GO terms. For 10 of the 25, a good match of free-text or GO term annotation was obtained. These blind tests represent rigorous assessments of I-TASSER/COFACTOR. neXtProt now provides links to precomputed I-TASSER/COFACTOR predictions for proteins without function annotation to facilitate experimental planning on “dark proteins”.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aexperimental design 3aprediction 3aproteins 0auncharacterized human proteins validated at protein level (uPE1) 0aCP50 challenge 0astructure-based function annotation 0aI-TASSER 0aCOFACTOR 0acritical assessment of function annotation (CAFA) 3 0aneXtProt1 aLane, Lydie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9818-30301 aOmenn, Gilbert S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8976-60741 aZhang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2739-19160 tJournal of proteome research.g2019 Oct. 04, v. 18, no. 12 p.4154-4166dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b005373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245005400198300001500252520134000267592002801607650001401635650001601649650001501665650001401680650001701694650001201711650001701723650000901740650001101749650001301760650003001773650001101803650001901814650001601833650001401849700002001863700001901883700001901902700002101921700002001942700001901962700002101981773015202002856006902154856008602223990002302309852000902332655001202341IND60643868620221118022852.0190514e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064386862DNAL7 a10.3791/536452doi7 aPMC47817392pmcid7 a268911472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlone, William L.10aModeling chemotherapy resistant leukemia In Vitro  ap. e53645.  aIt is well established that the bone marrow microenvironment provides a unique site of sanctuary for hematopoietic diseases that both initiate and progress in this site. The model presented in the current report utilizes human primary bone marrow stromal cells and osteoblasts as two representative cell types from the marrow niche that influence tumor cell phenotype. The in vitro co-culture conditions described for human leukemic cells with these primary niche components support the generation of a chemoresistant subpopulation of tumor cells that can be efficiently recovered from culture for analysis by diverse techniques. A strict feeding schedule to prevent nutrient fluxes followed by gel type 10 cross-linked dextran (G10) particles recovery of the population of tumor cells that have migrated beneath the adherent bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) or osteoblasts (OB) generating a "phase dim" (PD) population of tumor cells, provides a consistent source of purified therapy resistant leukemic cells. This clinically relevant population of tumor cells can be evaluated by standard methods to investigate apoptotic, metabolic, and cell cycle regulatory pathways as well as providing a more rigorous target in which to test novel therapeutic strategies prior to pre-clinical investigations targeted at minimal residual disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abone marrow 3acell cycle 3acoculture 3acrosslinking 3adextran 3adrug therapy 3agels 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aosteoblasts 3aphenotype1 aMoses, Blake S.1 aEvans, Rebecca1 aPiktel, Debbie1 aMartin, Karen H.1 aPetros, William1 aCraig, Michael1 aGibson, Laura F.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Feb. 09, , no. 108 p.e53645-e53645dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/536453Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53645/modeling-chemotherapy-resistant-leukemia-in-vitro  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014500173300001600318520133500334592002801669650002401697650002501721650003501746650001601781650001901797650001101816650002001827650001001847650001001857650001301867650002101880650002201901650002101923650002501944650001901969650002501988650001602013650000902029651002102038653002002059653001702079653002002096653002802116653002802144700002002172700002602192700002302218700002102241700002102262700002102283700002502304700002202329700002002351773013702371856008502508852000902593655001202602IND60527903120221122002206.0190416e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052790312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrashev, Radoslav10aProduction, purification, and characterization of a novel cold-active superoxide dismutase from the Antarctic strain Aspergillus glaucus 363  ap. 679-689.  aThe Antarctic fungal strain Aspergillus glaucus 363 produces cold-active (CA) Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD). The strain contains at least one gene encoding Cu/Zn-SOD that exhibited high homology with the corresponding gene of other Aspergillus species. To our knowledge, this is the first nucleotide sequence of a CA Cu/Zn-SOD gene in fungi. An effective laboratory technology for A. glaucus SOD production in 3 L bioreactors was developed on the basis of transient cold-shock treatment. The temperature downshift to 10 °C caused 1.4-fold increase of specific SOD activity compared to unstressed culture. Maximum enzyme productivity was 64 × 103 U kg−1 h−1. Two SOD isoenzymes (Cu/Zn-SODI and Cu/Zn-SODII) were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The specific activity of the major isoenzyme, Cu/Zn-SODII, after Q-Sepharose chromatography was 4000 U mg−1. The molecular mass of SODI (38 159 Da) and of SODII (15 835 Da) was determined by electrospray quadropole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) mass spectrometry and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The presence of Cu and Zn were confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Cu/Zn-SODII revealed a high degree of structural homology with Cu/Zn-SOD from other fungi, including Aspergillus species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus glaucus 3aamino acid sequences 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioreactors 3achromatography 3acopper 3aelectrophoresis 3afungi 3agenes 3aisozymes 3alight scattering 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3anucleotide sequences 3asod production 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3azinc 3aAntarctic region 0aAntarctic fungi 0aBiosynthesis 0aCold-active SOD 0aCu/Zn-SOD gene sequence 0aEnzyme characterization1 aFeller, Georges1 aKostadinova, Nedelina1 aKrumova, Ekaterina1 aAlexieva, Zlatka1 aGerginova, Maria1 aSpasova, Boryana1 aMiteva-Staleva, Jeni1 aVassilev, Spassen1 aAngelova, Maria0 tFungal biology.g2016 May, v. 120, no. 5 p.679-689dElsevier LtdaThe British Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015500157300002000312520146900332592002801801650000801829650001801837650001501855650001801870650001601888650001701904650001701921700001601938700002001954700002601974700002302000700001802023700002202041773014202063856007402205852000902279655001202288IND60617244520221118052748.0181024e20181023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061724452DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta07368f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkin, Seckin10aHydrothermally processed CuCrO₂ nanoparticles as an inorganic hole transporting material for low-cost perovskite solar cells with superior stability  ap. 20327-20337.  aDespite the impressive photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond 22%, intensive studies are still required to overcome ongoing issues such as cost, stability, and hysteresis. Here, for the first time, we report a cesium-containing triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite solar cell (n–i–p structure) by using hydrothermally synthesized inorganic CuCrO₂ (CCO) delafossite nanoparticles as a hole transporting material (HTM). After optimization of the concentration, a fully homogeneous and completely covered CCO layer that facilitates fast carrier extraction and collection was obtained on the surface of the perovskite. Our CCO-based cells achieved the best PCE of 16.7% (average 16.04 ± 0.40) with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, it was found that our cells showed a significant improvement in stability in ambient air compared with Spiro-OMeTAD HTM-based cells. After 60 days of storage in air without encapsulation, PCE remained at ∼83% of the initial value with the CCO-based cells, whereas it decreased to ∼24% of the initial value with devices based on the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM. Furthermore, cost estimation results indicated that the current prospect of CCO has an affordable cost/device ratio (∼180-fold cheaper than Spiro-OMeTAD). This work not only reveals the importance of air-stable inorganic HTMs, but also provides a low-cost HTM for highly efficient and stable PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aencapsulation 3ahysteresis 3ananoparticles 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3astorage time1 aLiu, Yuhang1 aDar, M.

This phenomenon termed quorum sensing enables the bacteria to monitor the environment for other bacteria and to alter behavior on a population-wide scale in response to cell density. Serratia marcescens JG, a quorum sensing bacterium, can secrete a furanosyl borate diester autoinducer (AI-2) in the exponential phase of growth. In this study, to further investigate the regulation of AI-2 production in S. marcescens JG, the pfs and luxS promoter fusions to an operon luxCDABE reporter were constructed in a low-copy-number vector pBR322K, which allows an examination of transcription of the genes in the pathway for signal synthesis. The results show that the luxS expression is constitutive, and the transcription of luxS is tightly correlated with AI-2 production in S. marcescens JG because the peaks of AI-2 production and transcriptional level of luxS appear at the same time point. The close relation of the profiles of luxS transcription and AI-2 production was also confirmed with real-time PCR technology. These results support the hypothesis that the quorum sensing in S. marcescens JG is luxS dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSerratia marcescens 3abacteria 3agene expression 3aoperon 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquorum sensing 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLiu, Yuzhen,1 aSun, Jiao1 aZhu, Hu0 tArchives of microbiology.g2015 June, v. 197, no. 5 p.715-721dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-015-1099-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009200165300001600257520147700273592002801750650002701778650002201805650001201827650002201839650001901861650001501880650001901895650001701914650000901931650001401940650000901954650001001963700002001973700002701993700002202020700003402042700001902076700002602095700002102121773012202142856007502264852000902339655001202348IND60534693920221118032745.0160803e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053469392DNAL7 a10.1021/es301294q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Adrienne J.10aPotential CO2 Leakage Reduction through Biofilm-Induced Calcium Carbonate Precipitation  ap. 142-149.  aMitigation strategies for sealing high permeability regions in cap rocks, such as fractures or improperly abandoned wells, are important considerations in the long term security of geologically stored carbon dioxide (CO₂). Sealing technologies using low-viscosity fluids are advantageous in this context since they potentially reduce the necessary injection pressures and increase the radius of influence around injection wells. Using aqueous solutions and suspensions that can effectively promote microbially induced mineral precipitation is one such technology. Here we describe a strategy to homogenously distribute biofilm-induced calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) precipitates in a 61 cm long sand-filled column and to seal a hydraulically fractured, 74 cm diameter Boyles Sandstone core. Sporosarcina pasteurii biofilms were established and an injection strategy developed to optimize CaCO₃ precipitation induced via microbial urea hydrolysis. Over the duration of the experiments, permeability decreased between 2 and 4 orders of magnitude in sand column and fractured core experiments, respectively. Additionally, after fracture sealing, the sandstone core withstood three times higher well bore pressure than during the initial fracturing event, which occurred prior to biofilm-induced CaCO₃ mineralization. These studies suggest biofilm-induced CaCO₃ precipitation technologies may potentially seal and strengthen fractures to mitigate CO₂ leakage potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSporosarcina pasteurii 3aaqueous solutions 3abiofilm 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon dioxide 3ahydrolysis 3amineralization 3apermeability 3asand 3asandstone 3aurea 3awells1 aLauchnor, Ellen1 aEldring, Joachim (Joe)1 aEsposito, Richard1 aMitchell, A.

Here, the contact angle (θ) at the CO₂–brine–mineral interface is studied for several representative solids including quartz, microcline, calcite, kaolinite, phlogopite, and illite under a range of GCS conditions. All were found to be water wetting (θ < 30°) with subtle but important differences in contact angles observed between the surfaces. Temperature and pressure conditions affected the results but did not produce discernible trends common to all surfaces. Brine composition, in terms of pH and ionic strength, was a better predictor of interfacial behavior. For the nonclays, the wettability is impacted by the pH at the point of zero charge of the solid. For the clays, the response was more complex. Under nonequilibrium conditions, hysteretic effects were observed when CO₂ was dissolving into the bulk fluid and this effect varied between minerals. Contact angle was found to decrease during the CO₂ phase transition from supercritical or liquid phase to gas phase. These results are useful for developing a more complete understanding of leakage through caprocks and capillary trapping in GCS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acontact angle 3agases 3aillite 3aionic strength 3akaolinite 3apH 3aphase transition 3aquartz 3atemperature 3awettability1 aEdwards, Ian M.1 aClarens, Andres F.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Jan. 02, v. 47, no. 1 p.234-241dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes301297z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011100167300001600278520135500294592002801649650001501677650001301692650002101705650002701726650001801753650001601771650001001787650001901797650001801816650001101834650002101845650001301866650001401879650001401893700001901907700001701926773011601943856008102059852000902140655001202149IND60119140620221122145513.0141203e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011914062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12257-013-0432-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Sang Taek10aEngineering an aglycosylated Fc variant for enhanced FcγRI engagement and pH-dependent human FcRn binding  ap. 780-789.  aThe clinical use of therapeutic antibodies has increased sharply because of their many advantages over conventional small molecule drugs, particularly with respect to their affinity, specificity, and serum stability. Tumor or infected cells are removed by the binding of antibody Fc regions to Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs), which stimulate the activation of immune effector cells. Aglycosylated full-length IgG antibodies expressed in bacteria have different Fc conformations compared to their glycosylated counterparts produced in mammalian cells. As a result, they are unable to bind FcγRs, resulting in little to no activation of immune effector cells. In this study, we created a combinatorial library randomized at the upper CH2 loops of an aglycosylated Fc variant (Fc5: E382V/M428) and used a high-throughput flow cytometry library screening method, combined with bacterial display of homodimeric Fc domains for enhanced FcγR binding affinity. The trastuzumab Fc variant containing the identified mutations (Q295R, L328W, A330V, P331A, I332Y, E382V, M428I) not only exhibited over 120 fold higher affinity of specific binding to FcγRI than wild type aglycosylated Fc, but also retained pH-dependent FcRn binding. These results show that an aglycosylated antibody expressed in bacteria can be evolved for novel FcγR affinity and specificity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3abinding capacity 3abioprocess engineering 3abiotechnology 3ablood serum 3adrugs 3aflow cytometry 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amutation 3areceptors 3ascreening1 aKang, Tae Hyun1 aKim, Dong-il0 tBiotechnology and bioprocess engineering.g2014 Sept., v. 19, no. 5 p.780-789dSpringer-Verlagx1226-83727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12257-013-0432-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245010200213300001600315506007600331520108800407592002801495506003701523650001701560650001201577650002401589650002501613650001601638650001501654650001301669650001801682650002501700650002001725651001101745773008801756856008101844852000901925655001201934IND60119633520221207081911.0150216e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011963352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-014-9691-32doi7 aPMC42664562pmcid7 a255252882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorkildsen, Kjersti10aSocial-Ecological Changes in a Quilombola Community in the Atlantic Forest of Southeastern Brazil  ap. 913-927.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThrough a combined adaptive cycle and political ecology approach, this article explores how the Afro-Brazilian Quilombolas of Bombas, living inside the protected area of PETAR, respond to and shape social-ecological changes in the Atlantic Forest. Field data reveal that both environmental restrictions and social policies of state transfer payments and food packages have contributed to decreased engagement in agricultural practices, loss of traditional knowledge, and reduced agro-biodiversity. The claim to land rights based on a Quilombola identity and recent negotiations with forest authorities insinuate a shift of this trend. Contrary to dominant conservation narratives, the findings indicate that small-scale shifting cultivation practices by the Quilombolas have the potential to increase structural ecological complexity of the Atlantic Forest. The article therefore argues that legalization of settlement and subsistence activities is important not only for livelihood security and social cohesion of Bombas inhabitants, but also possibly for biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3aforests 3agovernment payments 3aindigenous knowledge 3aland rights 3alivelihood 3apolitics 3apublic policy 3ashifting cultivation 3asocial cohesion 3aBrazil0 tHuman ecology.g2014 Dec., v. 42, no. 6 p.913-927dSpringer-Verlagx0300-78397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-014-9691-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245015900211520172400370592002802094650001602122650001902138650001202157650001702169650002302186650001702209650003002226650001202256650002302268650002502291650002902316650002502345650002102370650001502391650002002406650002202426650002202448650001502470651001102485653001402496653001202510653002502522653002902547653002302576700002202599700002002621700006202641773011902703856008602822852000902908655001202917IND60776638220221119055609.0220929e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077663822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1151802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Raphaël1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4800-518010aSpatially structured freshwater fish population dynamics at the River Basin District scale: Implication for environmental management and fish conservation  aEuropean Union environmental policy has created a unique regulatory framework to favour aquatic ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation across European countries. Identifying the spatial structure of freshwater fish population dynamics is crucial to define region-specific management and conservation planning. To implement evidence-driven management and conservation decisions at a regional scale we assessed spatial heterogeneity in common freshwater fish population dynamics in France with a focus on trends in River Basin Districts (RBDs). The abundance and biomass growth rates of 18 common European freshwater fish species were estimated with state-space models on 546 sites distributed across the 5 main RBDs sampled in France between 1990 and 2011. Anguilla anguilla, Rutilus rutilus, Salmo trutta fario and Esox spp. exhibited large scale decline in abundance and/or biomass in several RBDs. The other species showed spatial heterogeneity in population growth rates. The main declines were observed in the Adour-Garonne and Loire-Bretagne RBDs, where management and conservation measures are urgently needed to halt the erosion of freshwater fish populations. In each of the 5 investigated RBDs, our results highlight areas where most of the common species we studied exhibited negative population growth rates. Freshwater fish surveys provide the fundamental information necessary to inform the European environmental policies and local environmental management needed to restore freshwater biodiversity. The next steps are to identify the main drivers of freshwater biodiversity erosion in the areas where we demonstrated major declines and to define the most cost-effective restoration measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEsox lucius 3aEuropean Union 3aRutilus 3aSalmo trutta 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiomass 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystem management 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental policy 3afish communities 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3apopulation growth 3aspatial variation 3awatersheds 3aFrance 0aAbundance 0aBiomass 0aEnvironmental policy 0aFish population dynamics 0aPopulation decline1 aAstruc, Guillelme1 aPoulet, Nicolas1 aBesnard, Aurélien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2289-97610 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 317 p.115180-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1151803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245008600213300001800299506007600317520105000393592002801443506003701471650003101508650001901539650003301558650002901591650001701620650001201637700001801649773012601667856008401793852000901877655001201886IND60099632120221207140730.0141105e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009963212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2012.05.0032doi7 aPMC33801512pmcid7 a225952812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElahi, Shokrollah10aAssociation of HLA-alleles with the immune regulation of chronic viral infections  ap. 1361-1365.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes (CTLs) have an astonishing ability to eliminate pathogen-infected cells. However, if uncontrolled, these CTLs could cause devastating pathology to host tissues. CD8⁺ effector T cells, therefore, interact with antigen-presenting cells and other immune cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), to regulate further on-site expansion and differentiation of the effector cells. This ensures protection of the host with minimal bystander pathological consequences. During prolonged chronic infections CTLs, however, often lose effector function. Induction of multiple inhibitory pathways is emerging as a major regulator converting effector CTLs into exhausted CTLs during chronic viral infections such as HIV, HCV and HBV. The mechanisms involved in induction of exhaustion during chronic viral infections are the focus of this article. Blockade of inhibitory pathways could potentially restore functional capabilities to exhausted CTLs and represents a potential immune-based intervention in chronic viral infections.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantigen-presenting cells 3acytotoxicity 3atissues1 aHorton, Helen0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2012 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.1361-1365dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012400169300001600293520092400309592002801233650001301261650001501274650002301289650000901312650001101321650000901332650002001341650002201361651001301383700001401396773008801410856008101498852000901579655001201588IND60119633620221121235828.0150216e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011963362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-014-9693-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanssen, Marco A.10aBenefits of Grouping and Cooperative Hunting Among Ache Hunter–Gatherers: Insights from an Agent-Based Foraging Model  ap. 823-835.  aWe develop an agent-based model of foraging behavior based on ecological parameters of the environment and prey characteristics measured in the Mbaracayu Reserve Paraguay. We then compare estimated foraging behavior from our model to the ethnographically observed behavior of Ache hunter–gatherers who inhabit the region and show a close match for daily harvest rates, time allocation, and species composition of prey. The model allows us to explore the implications of social living, cooperative hunting, variation in group size and mobility, under Ache-like ecological conditions. Simulations show that social living decreases daily risk of no food, but cooperative hunting has only a modest effect on mean harvest rates. Analysis demonstrates that bands should contain 7–8 hunters who move nearly every day in order to achieve the best combination of average harvest rates and low probability of no meat in camp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforaging 3agroup size 3aindigenous peoples 3ameat 3amodels 3arisk 3asocial behavior 3aspecies diversity 3aParaguay1 aHill, Kim0 tHuman ecology.g2014 Dec., v. 42, no. 6 p.823-835dSpringer-Verlagx0300-78397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-014-9693-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245029600163300001800459520086800477592002801345650001601373650002101389650001301410650001201423650003001435700002101465700002301486700002001509700002001529773015301549856007801702852000901780655001201789IND60521921820221118061640.0190219e19921101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052192182DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-11052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBitterer, Frank10aSynthese von Phosphaalkenclustern durch reduktive Phosphinidenfragmentierung zweizähniger Halogenphosphane RXP— CH₂ — PXR mit Fe₂(CO)₉ / Synthesis of Phosphaalkene Clusters by Reductive Phosphinidene Fragmentation of Bidentate Halogenphosphines RXP—CH₂—PXR with Fe₂(CO)₉  ap. 1529-1540.  aReaction of halogen functional methylenebisphosphines 1 XRP–CH₂–PRX (X = Cl, Br) with excess Fe₂(CO)₉ affords μ₃-phosphinidene clusters (5) containing phosphaalkene ligands R–P=CH₂.

We collected data from individual milk samples taken from 1,158 Brown Swiss cows farmed in 85 traditional or modern herds in Trento Province (Italy). Factor analysis was carried out on 47 individual fatty acids, milk yield, and 5 compositional milk traits (fat, protein, casein, and lactose contents, somatic cell score). According to a previous study on multivariate factor analysis, a variable was considered to be associated with a specific factor if the absolute value of its correlation with the factor was ≥0.60. The extracted factors were representative of the following 12 groups of fatty acids or functions: de novo fatty acids, branched fatty acid-milk yield, biohydrogenation, long-chain fatty acids, desaturation, short-chain fatty acids, milk protein and fat contents, odd fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acids, linoleic acid, udder health, and vaccelenic acid. Only 5 fatty acids showed small correlations with these groups. Factor analysis suggested the existence of differences in the metabolic pathways for de novo short- and medium-chain fatty acids and Δ9-desaturase products. An ANOVA of factor scores highlighted significant effects of the dairy farming system (traditional or modern), season, herd/date, parity, and days in milk. Factor behavior across levels of fixed factors was consistent with current knowledge. For example, compared with cows farmed in modern herds, those in traditional herds had higher scores for branched fatty acids, which were inversely associated with milk yield; primiparous cows had lower scores than older cows for de novo fatty acids, probably due to a larger contribution of lipids mobilized from body depots on milk fat yield. The statistical approach allowed us to reduce a large number of variables to a few latent factors with biological meaning and able to represent groups of fatty acids with a common origin and function. Multivariate factor analysis would therefore be a valuable tool for studying the influence of different production environments and individual animal factors on milk fatty acid composition, and for developing nutritional strategies able to manipulate the milk fatty acid profile according to consumer demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle feeding 3afatty acid composition 3amanagement systems 3ashort chain fatty acids 3amilk 3acows 3amilk fat yield 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3amedium chain fatty acids 3aparity (reproduction) 3amilk quality 3amilk fatty acids 3adairy farming 3amultivariate analysis 3adairy industry 3alactose 3aherds 3aBrown Swiss 3afactor analysis 3afarming systems 3aconsumer demand 3asomatic cells 3acasein 3audders 3alactation 3abiochemical pathways 3adata analysis 3abiohydrogenation 3aItaly 0afatty acids 0adairy protein 0amilk fat1 aMacciotta, N.P.P.1 aCecchinato, A.1 aConte, G.1 aSchiavon, S.1 aBittante, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Dec., v. 99, no. 12 p.9820-9833dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-114513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011100166300001600277520102700293592002801320650001101348650001101359650001301370650001201383650001601395650001901411653001801430653001601448653001301464653001601477653001101493700001701504700002501521700002201546700002201568773022001590856008301810852000901893655001201902IND60543944820221123005208.0190415e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054394482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jher.2015.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmamou, Amani10aNumerical study of turbulent round jet in a uniform counterflow using a second order Reynolds Stress Model  ap. 482-495.  aA turbulent round jet issuing into a uniform counterflow stream is computationally investigated together with comparison with earlier experiments data, including velocity component along the jet axis and the radial direction. The simulation is carried out using the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM). Numerical results agree well with experimental results and the penetration and spreading of the jet are studied. The turbulence feature of the counterflowing jet indicates that the root-mean-square (rms) of axial velocity fluctuation (u′2¯) has two distinct peaks whose the second is a specificity of the jet into a counterflow, located within the region near the stagnation point. As the centerline velocity, the centerline temperature is found to decay more rapid when the jet-to-current velocity ratio is smaller. The spreading of the jet is also interpreted by the growth of both momentum width and temperature width of the counterflowing jet leading to that the presence of a counterflow enhances the mixing of the jet.  aPublisher supplied data 3amixing 3amodels 3amomentum 3astreams 3atemperature 3aturbulent flow 0aTurbulent jet 0aCounterflow 0aVelocity 0aTemperature 0aMixing1 aHabli, Sabra1 aSaïd, Nejla Mahjoub1 aBournot, Philippe1 aLe Palec, Georges0 tJournal of hydro-environment research.g2015 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.482-495dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific DivisionwJournal:2188x1570-64437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2015.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009200163300001600255520100600271592002801277650000901305650001101314650001501325650002001340650001201360650002001372650001601392650001601408650001501424650001501439650001201454650002601466651000901492700002101501773008801522856008101610852000901691655001201700IND60119633720221122012614.0150216e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011963372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-014-9694-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaris, Paul10aCotton as Catalyst? The Role of Shifting Fertilizer in Mali’s Silent Maize Revolution  ap. 857-872.  aNo crop poses more of a conundrum in terms of its impacts on African societies and environments than cotton. Cotton has been dubbed “white gold” by some scholars and the “mother of poverty” by others. A shortcoming of most studies is that cotton is examined in isolation rather than as part of a broader agricultural system. This paper traces the linkages between cotton farming and the development of intensive maize production in Mali using a multi-scale, mixed-method approach. Quantitative analysis of a 15 year data set for over 100 households documents changes in area, production and yields for cotton and grain crops. Semi-formal interviews are used to understand farmer strategies for managing agricultural systems. Results show that cotton yields declined during the study period while maize yields and production increased significantly. We conclude that cotton has been a catalyst in developing intensive agricultural systems as farmers shifted key resources from cotton to maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acotton 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afertilizers 3agrain crops 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3apoverty 3aquantitative analysis 3aMali1 aFoltz, Jeremy D.0 tHuman ecology.g2014 Dec., v. 42, no. 6 p.857-872dSpringer-Verlagx0300-78397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-014-9694-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010600174520122800280592002801508650001601536650002201552650001301574650002101587650003001608650001701638650001801655650001201673650001401685650001101699650001801710650002201728650002001750650001501770650001301785653004201798653002801840653003501868653002401903700001601927700001701943700001901960700001701979700001501996700001902011700001802030773009202048856009002140852000902230655001202239IND60733315620221121193217.0211227e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073331562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1304302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruiming10aInsights into the metabolic mechanism of PBDEs catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4: A QM/MM study  aElucidating the metabolic mechanism and the derivatives of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is significant to risk assessment. This study delineated the metabolic mechanism of 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) catalyzed by P450 enzymes using a combination of molecular dynamic (MD), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and density functional theory (DFT). The calculation results reveal that the electrophilic addition is the main pathway for the biotransformation of BDE-47 catalyzed by P450 enzymes. 6-hydroxy-2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (6-OH-BDE-47) is a more kinetically preferable product than 5-hydroxy-2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (5-OH-BDE-47). Electrophilic addition reaction can lead to the formation of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). The ecotoxicity assessment indicates that the final products of BDE-47 are still toxic to aquatic organisms, but the solubility increase of the hydroxylated products can accelerate their excretion from the body. We expect that the established metabolic mechanism and the derivatives will be used to predict the biotransformation of other PBDE congeners catalyzed by P450 enzymes in human livers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3abiotransformation 3abiphenyl 3acytochrome P-450 3adensity functional theory 3adibenzofuran 3aecotoxicology 3aenzymes 3aexcretion 3ahumans 3ahydroxylation 3aquantum mechanics 3arisk assessment 3asolubility 3atoxicity 0aQuantum mechanics/molecular mechanics 0aCytochrome P450 enzymes 0aPolybrominated diphenyl ethers 0aMetabolic mechanism1 aLi, Pengfei1 aShi, Xiangli1 aZhang, Ruiying1 aWang, Junjie1 aLi, Yanwei1 aZhang, Qingzhu1 aWang, Wenxing0 tChemosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 278 p.130430-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1304303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245010900128300001600237520096500253592002801218650001301246650002101259650001501280650001501295650001501310650001601325650002001341650001301361650002001374650002501394650001301419650000901432650001401441653002201455653000901477653001601486653002001502700002101522700001801543773015901561852000901720655001201729IND60721250220221121134205.0201224e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072125022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, S.K.10aHaematological, serobiochemical and immunological studies in diclofenac fed experimental Japanese quails  ap. 153-155.  aThe present work was conducted on Japanese quails which were fed diclofenac sodium for a period of 60 days.

DLC showed gradual increase in heterophil and lymphocyte counts. The values of creatinine, uric acid, urea and BUN showed significant increases with significant decreases in the mean values of albumin and total protein. Differences were not observed in the mean values of ALT and AST at all the intervals. Immune response was measured by DNCB test. Significant decrease in the thickness of skin at all the intervals of DNCB post challenge was observed in toxicity group.

The effects of physical cleaning, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses, and foulant distributions were systematically investigated to control irreversible organic foulants on the membrane surface. It was observed that specific foulants in the secondary wastewater effluent impeded the long-term performance of FO fouling reversibility and final flux. A strong correlation between irreversible foulant concentrations, especially that of protein-like biopolymer, and physical fouling reversibility was observed, which caused continual irreversible fouling in the FO process. Multiple modified fouling indexes (MFIs) were measured to evaluate the fouling potential of the feed water with size fractionation. It was confirmed that the MFI-UF employing a 300 kDa ultrafiltration (UF) membrane is an appropriate water quality index for studying irreversible membrane fouling. It is expected that the application of MFI in predicting the fouling potential of FO intake water will significantly contribute toward the development of operational guidelines for FO plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aartificial membranes 3abiopolymers 3acleaning 3afouling 3afractionation 3aguidelines 3aosmosis 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater 3awater quality 3awater reuse 0aForward osmosis (FO) 0aIrreversible fouling 0aQuantitative analysis 0aFouling reversibility (FR) 0aModified fouling index (MFI)1 aGwak, Gimun1 aKim, David Inhyuk1 aPark, Kiho1 aHong, Seungkwan0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 597 p.117757-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.1177573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245009800206300001400304520111200318592002801430650002601458650001601484650002201500650002401522650001701546650001401563650001701577700006101594700006701655700006001722773010901782856008201891852000901973655001201982IND60753085620221122041354.0211123e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075308562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2021.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Kathleen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3034-216210aLeveraging laboratory and clinical studies to design effective antibiotic combination therapy  ap. 68-75.  aInterest in antibiotic combination therapy is increasing due to antimicrobial resistance and a slowing antibiotic pipeline. However, aside from specific indications, combination therapy in the clinic is often not administered systematically; instead, it is used at the physician’s discretion as a bet-hedging mechanism to increase the chances of appropriately targeting a pathogen(s) with an unknown antibiotic resistance profile. Some recent clinical trials have been unable to demonstrate superior efficacy of combination therapy over monotherapy. Other trials have shown a benefit of combination therapy in defined circumstances consistent with recent studies indicating that factors including species, strain, resistance profile, and microenvironment affect drug combination efficacy and drug interactions. In this review, we discuss how a careful study design that takes these factors into account, along with the different drug interaction and potency metrics for assessing combination performance, may provide the necessary insight to understand the best clinical use-cases for combination therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3adrug interactions 3aexperimental design 3amicrobiology 3apathogens 3atherapeutics1 aGreenstein, Talia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2710-602X1 aViau Colindres, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4982-47081 aAldridge, Bree B1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2236-14240 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2021 Dec., v. 64 p.68-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012100166300001600287520133300303592002801636650001401664650002001678650002401698650001701722650001201739653002301751653001901774653001701793653001101810653001301821700001501834700005901849700001901908700001901927773022001946856008302166852000902249655001202258IND60543944920221122195938.0190415e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054394492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jher.2015.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Su-Hyun12aA numerical study on optimal rotation ratio and bottom shear stress in the counter-rotation mode of an annular flume  ap. 473-481.  aIn this study, the optimal rotation ratio that minimize both the secondary flow and the variation of the bottom shear stress in the radial direction in the annular flume was found from flow analysis using a computational fluid dynamics technique. The numerical model was verified from the measured data given in the literature. Forty-eight numerical calculations were carried out for the flow fields given with various rotation speed ratios of the top ring to the flume body. Some cases showed quite fluctuating non-uniform bottom shear stress profiles in the radial direction without any effective reduction of the secondary flow so that they were excluded in determining the optimal rotation ratio. It was found that the rotation ratio became optimal when both the maximum velocity ratio and the difference between the largest and smallest values of the stream function were minimal. Characteristically, in the range of relatively small top ring rotation speed (<10) the optimal rotation ratio increased rapidly with it, but it converged to a fixed value as it became larger. The relationship between the optimal rotation ratio and the rotation speed of the top ring is presented. An equation for the averaged bottom shear stress under the optimal rotation ratios is also proposed as a function of the top ring rotation speed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3afluid mechanics 3amathematical models 3ashear stress 3astreams 0aNumerical analysis 0aFluid dynamics 0aShear stress 0aFlumes 0aRotation1 aIm, Ik-Tae1 aHwang, Kyu-nam,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5045-03821 aCho, Yong-sik,1 aRyu, Hong-Ryul0 tJournal of hydro-environment research.g2015 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.473-481dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific DivisionwJournal:2188x1570-64437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2015.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245014300160300001600303520186200319592002802181650001302209650001902222650001602241650001402257650001702271650002102288650001702309650000702326650001902333650002302352650001202375650001602387653002202403653002202425653001602447653002102463700001602484700001702500700001502517700001602532773015202548856007902700852000902779655001202788IND60558363720221122010035.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055836372DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-108922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCummins, C.14aThe effect of colostrum storage conditions on dairy heifer calf serum immunoglobulin G concentration and preweaning health and growth rate  ap. 525-535.  aThe objective of the present study was to compare serum IgG concentration, weight gain, and health characteristics in Irish spring-born dairy calves fed colostrum stored using a range of conditions. Immediately after birth, 75 dairy heifer calves were assigned to 1 of 5 experimental colostrum treatments: (1) fresh pasteurized colostrum, fed immediately after pasteurization; (2) fresh colostrum, fed immediately after collection but not pasteurized; (3) colostrum stored unpasteurized at 4°C in a temperature-controlled unit for 2d before being fed to calves; (4) colostrum stored unpasteurized at 13°C in a temperature-controlled unit for 2d before being fed to calves; and (5) colostrum stored unpasteurized at 22°C in a temperature-controlled unit for 2d before being fed to calves. All colostrum had IgG concentrations >50g/L and was fed to calves promptly after birth. Blood samples were obtained from calves via the jugular vein at 0h (before colostrum feeding) and at 24h of age to determine the rate of passive transfer of IgG; individual calf live-weights were recorded to monitor weight gain (kg/d) from birth to weaning. Colostrum stored in warmer conditions (i.e., 22°C) had >42 times more bacteria present and a pH that was 0.85 units lower and resulted in a serum IgG concentration that was almost 2 times lower compared with colostrum that was pasteurized, untreated, or stored at 4°C for 2d. Colostrum stored at 4°C for 2d had more bacteria present than pasteurized and fresh colostrum but did not result in reduced calf serum IgG concentrations. Average daily weight gain from birth to weaning did not differ among treatments. Even if colostrum has sufficient IgG (>50g/L) but cannot be fed to calves when freshly collected, storage at ≤4°C for 2d is advisable to ensure adequate passive transfer when it is consumed by the calf.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acolostrum 3adairy calves 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ajugular vein 3apH 3apasteurization 3astorage conditions 3aweaning 3aweight gain 0acolostrum storage 0acolostrum feeding 0acalf health 0aimmunoglobulin G1 aBerry, D.P.1 aMurphy, J.P.1 aLorenz, I.1 aKennedy, E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.525-535dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-108923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011700172520148400289592002801773650002601801650001201827650002301839650001601862650001901878650001901897650001201916650001101928650001501939653002701954653002501981653002402006653003202030653004102062653001702103700005802120700001502178700001702193700001702210773011302227856008202340852000902422655001202431IND60753085720221122032327.0211206e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075308572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2021.1082242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaschke, Rüdiger W.10aDetermination of culture design spaces in shaken disposable cultivation systems for CHO suspension cell cultures  aProcesses involving mammalian cell cultures - especially CHO suspension cells - dominate biopharmaceutical manufacturing. These processes are usually developed in small scale orbitally shaken cultivation systems, and thoroughly characterizing these cultivation systems is crucial to their application in research and the subsequent scale-up to production processes. With the knowledge of process engineering parameters such as oxygen transfer rate, mixing time, and power input, in combination with the demands set by the biological production system, biomass growth and product yields can be anticipated and even increased. However, the available data sources for orbitally shaken cultivation systems are often incomplete and thus not sufficient enough to generate suitable cultivation requirements. Furthermore, process engineering knowledge is inapplicable if it is not linked to the physiological demands of the cells.In the current study, a simple yet comprehensive approach for the characterization and design space prediction of orbitally shaken single-use cultivation systems is presented, including the “classical” Erlenmeyer shake flask, the cylindrical TubeSpin bioreactor and the alternately designed Optimum Growth flask. Cultivations were performed inside and outside the design space to validate the defined culture conditions, so that cultivation success (desired specific growth rates and viable cell densities) could be achieved for each cultivation system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological production 3abiomass 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abioreactors 3acell viability 3aculture flasks 3amammals 3aoxygen 3aprediction 0aErlenmeyer shake flask 0aOptimum Growth flask 0aTubeSpin bioreactor 0aCHO suspension cell culture 0aProcess engineering characterization 0aDesign space1 aSeidel, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5244-08551 aBley, Th.,1 aEibl, Regine1 aEibl, Dieter0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2022 Jan., v. 177 p.108224-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2021.1082243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245048200164300001800646520041500664592002801079650001601107650002001123650001301143650000901156650001201165650001401177650001701191650001101208700002101219700001601240700001901256773015301275856007801428852000901506655001201515IND60521922020221118061604.0190219e19921101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052192202DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-11072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSellmann, Dieter10aÜbergangsmetallkomplexe mit Schwefelliganden, XCII.

This unique feature provides an opportunity to tailor the structure on toplayer and sublayer separately or synchronously by adjusting the membrane formation. In the current work, poly(ethylene glycol)s with molecular weights (MWs) ranging from 550 to 20,000 g/mol were blended with polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) and their effects on pore formation were carefully investigated. It was firstly inspected that the loading amount of PEGs that preserved isoporous structure should be lower than 40 wt%, which was found to depend slightly on their MWs. However, the surface morphologies indicated that PEGs of higher MWs had endowed membranes with larger pore size. Solutions for membrane fabrication were thus in-situ analyzed by small angel X-ray scattering (SAXS), which indicated that PEGs of higher MWs led to stronger microphase separation for the block copolymer. The flow resistances of the isoporous top layer and porous sublayer were finally calculated through a combination of Darcy and Hagen-Poiseuille equation. Typically, the smallest flow resistance and largest permeability were obtained for the PEG10K which had achieved the optimal balance of pore opening in toplayer and sublayer. The result found herein will help us to learn how PEGs modify the membrane formation from the surface to internal when they are used as additives for the SNIPS process.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIsoporous membranes 0aSNIPS 0aPore size 0aBlock copolymers 0aPEG1 aZhu, Guo-dong1 aYi, Zhuan1 aQiu, Ya-yu1 aLiu, Li-fen1 aGao, Cong-jie0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 598 p.117755-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.1177553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245006600133300001600199520093200215592002801147650002001175650002101195650001801216650001301234650001501247650001901262650001201281650001301293650003101306650002401337650002401361650001501385653001401400653000901414653000901423653001301432700002001445700001601465700001801481700001601499773015901515852000901674655001201683IND60721250520221121134158.0201224e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072125052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwasthy, Vijeyta10aPathological changes induced by Jatropha seeds in Wistar rats  ap. 168-170.  aShort-term toxicity study was conducted in rats by daily feeding the basal diet (Group I), and the diet where the crude protein requirement was supplemented at 25 % (Group II) and 50 % (Group III) levels through locally grown Jatropha curcas seed powder.

Addition of liposomal CLA or free oil did not modify the fermentation process. CLA isomers could be added before and after the thermal treatment and high CLA recoveries were found in all products. Addition of antioxidants did not influence CLA content and high oxidation stability was found. When compared with free oil addition, liposomal CLA shows a clear advantage in syneresis and improvement in the atherogenic index.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3aheat treatment 3ahomogenization 3aingredients 3amanufacturing 3aoils 3aoxidative stability 3atocopherols 3ayogurt1 aZeiter, Agustín1 aCapra, María Luján1 aPozza, Leila1 aHynes, Erica Rut1 aPerotti, María Cristina0 tInternational dairy journal.g2021 May, v. 116 p.104956-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2020.1049563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016300169300001600332520111400348592002801462650002401490650000901514650000901523650001101532650001501543650001201558650001101570650001701581650001201598650001201610651001101622700002301633700002501656700002501681700003301706773008801739856008101827852000901908655001201917IND60119634020221122043325.0150216e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011963402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-014-9698-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Josivan S.10aTraditional Ecological Knowledge About Dietary and Reproductive Characteristics of Tupinambis merianae and Hoplias malabaricus in Semiarid Northeastern Brazil  ap. 901-911.  aStudies have demonstrated the importance of local ecological knowledge (LEK) in informing our scientific knowledge about how species behave in their environment, and such knowledge can help to guide ecological management decisions. The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between LEK and conventional ecological knowledge based on ethnoecological and ecological information about the diet and reproduction of the tegu lizard (Tupinambis merianae) and the tiger fish (Hoplias malabaricus) in two communities in semiarid northeastern Brazil. Information on the diets of the animals was collected via surveys, and information about reproductive characteristics was obtained from semi-structured interviews with people from two communities. In addition, we analyzed the stomach contents of the animals and performed macroscopic analysis on their gonads. The informants did not report different items for the different ontogenetic stages of the two species under study. However, the information they provided about the diets of the animals did largely match the results of our biological analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHoplias malabaricus 3adiet 3afish 3agonads 3ainterviews 3alizards 3apeople 3areproduction 3astomach 3asurveys 3aBrazil1 aEl-Deir, Ana C.

In the present work, pearl powder incorporated polylactic (PLA) nanofibrous scaffold fabricated via electrospinning process to improve the weak biocompatibility and mineralization ability of PLA, was used as support for deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) and supporting cell culture. Then, the as-prepared scaffolds were well characterized by several assays. Morphology observations showed that pearl powder can homogeneously distribute on the surfaces of nanofibers, and appreciably better hydrophilicity was obtained on a PLA/pearl scaffold than PLA. After a mineralization process, HA particles successfully deposited on the nanofiber, which fully covered the surfaces of PLA/pearl nanofibers, whereas coverage seemed only partial on pristine PLA. An in vitro test illustrated higher cell proliferation and better adhesion morphology of MC3T3s that appeared on the PLA/pearl nanofibrous scaffold. Therefore, electrospinning a PLA/pearl nanofibrous scaffold has superior properties to pristine PLA, and shows potential application in bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abones 3acalcium carbonate 3acell culture 3acell proliferation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydroxyapatite 3ain vitro studies 3amineralization 3ananofibers 3aorganic matter 3atissue engineering1 aYang, Shenglin1 aJin, Junhong1 aLi, Guang0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 09, v. 6, no. 108 p.106798-106805dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21796f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245010800211300001100319520153400330592002801864650001801892650003501910650001901945650001501964650001401979650001101993650001102004650001802015650001602033650001502049650001802064650001502082651001202097700002502109700002002134700001702154700002302171700001702194700001902211700002002230773014902250856008302399852000902482655001202491IND60760455720221119111913.0220414e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076045572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09636-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Hmaidi, Abdellah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-949210aAssessment of the physicochemical water quality of the Moulouya River, Morocco, using the SEQ-Eau index  ap. 37.  aSurface water is subject to strong anthropogenic pressures caused by the development and extension of agricultural activities and also by industrial and domestic activities. As a result, rational and sustainable management of water resources is necessary in order to protect them. The objective of this work is the use of geographic information system GIS and the application of the weighted index of the water quality evaluation system SEQ-Eau for the overall assessment of the physicochemical quality of surface waters of the Moulouya River. First, a cartographic representation of the study area was produced with the development of quality maps for the various alterations relating to acidification, temperature, mineralization, phosphorus materials, and organic and oxidizable materials. The overall quality map is generated from the lowest index of all the alterations considered. The results generally show surface water of excellent quality in the Upper Moulouya and of average to poor quality in the Middle and Lower Moulouya. The alteration of water, linked mainly to mineralization and phosphorus nutrients, organic and oxidizable matter, reveals a domestic type pollution in relation to urban wastewater and agricultural discharges in addition to the impact of the geological substratum of the watershed. The seasonal impact is influenced by the increase in the degree of deterioration of water quality due to the increase in the concentration of pollutants and the decrease in precipitation during the summer season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3ageographic information systems 3amineralization 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3arivers 3asummer 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aMorocco1 aTalhaoui, Abdelghani1 aManssouri, Imad1 aJaddi, Hajar1 aBen-Daoud, Mohamed1 aKasse, Zahra1 aEl Ouali, Anas1 aEssahlaoui, Ali0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Jan., v. 194, no. 1 p.37-37dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09636-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245006700129300001600196520127200212592002801484650002901512650001101541650002101552650001101573650000901584650001501593650001401608650001501622650001601637650001101653650001401664650001401678650001301692653001201705653001501717653000801732653001201740700001501752700001701767700001801784773015901802852000901961655001201970IND60721250820221121134157.0201224e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072125082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurade, N.P.10aOak (Quercus leucotrichophora) foliage toxicity in guinea pigs  ap. 180-184.  aThe toxicity due to experimental feeding of oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) foliage at 5, 10, 20 and 40 % levels was studied in guinea pigs for 30 days. The animals in 5 and 10 % groups did not show any significant changes in body weight and feed consumption, haematological and plasma biochemical parameters. The feeding of oak foliage (OF) at 20 and 40 % levels resulted in mortality of 33.3 and 50 % animals, respectively. There was a significant reduction in body weight of 40 % OF fed group, as compared to body weight of pre-fed and control guinea pigs. The animals died from the 20 and 40% OF fed groups had reduced feed consumption from second day onwards and developed anaemia, emaciation, severe enteritis, gastric dilatation, severe hepatic congestion, and tubular epithelial sloughing and dilatation in kidneys. The other animals from these groups also developed variable degree of above described lesions. Based on clinical, haematological, plasma biochemical and pathological findings, OF feeding at 10 % level was found safe, with minimum untoward effects on guinea pigs. The pathological changes in guinea pigs consuming a considerable amount of diet containing 20 and 40 % OF were comparable to those reported in cattle that died due to oak toxicosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus leucotrichophora 3aanemia 3aanimal pathology 3acattle 3adiet 3aemaciation 3aenteritis 3aepithelium 3afeed intake 3aleaves 3amortality 3apoisoning 3atoxicity 0aFoliage 0aGuinea pig 0aOak 0aTannins1 aBhat, T.K.1 aSharma, O.P.1 aSingh, Birbal0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 34, no. 2 p.180-184dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007700165300001600242520180900258592002802067650002302095650002002118650001702138650001802155650001102173650001102184650001802195650001602213650002502229650002202254651001002276653001802286653003902304653001602343700001902359700001402378700002102392700001502413773022002428856008302648852000902731655001202740IND60543945320221122195939.0190415e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054394532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jher.2015.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yanlai10aRisk analysis for seasonal flood-limited water level under uncertainties  ap. 569-581.  aFor floodwater utilization, seasonal flood-limited water level (FLWL) plays a more and more role in compromising between flood control and beneficial use in reservoir operation during flood season. The prerequisite of determining a seasonal FLWL is that flood control risks should not be increased in reservoir operation as compared with the original operating rule using a fixed FLWL. In this paper, a risk analysis model for deriving seasonal FLWL that considers uncertainties of hydrology, hydraulic condition and reservoir volume is proposed and developed. The risk analysis model consists of three modules: the first is a hydrological uncertainty analysis module, the second is a hydraulic uncertainty analysis module, as well as the third is a reservoir volume uncertainty analysis module. The acceptable risk constraints are given, and the upper limitation of seasonal FLWL is estimated by using Monte Carlo simulation. The China’ Wanjiazhai reservoir (WR) is selected as a case study. The application results show that (1) the hydrological uncertainty and the reservoir volume uncertainty are major contribution factors to seasonal FLWL while the discharge capacity uncertainty is inapparent influence of seasonal FLWL, (2) the most reasonable upper limitations of seasonal FLWL in WR during main-flood and post-flood seasons are 972.3 and 974.1 m, respectively, which considers hydrological uncertainty, minimum hydraulic capability and minimum reservoir volume. The relative magnitudes of seasonal FLWL and the flood water utilization rates during main-flood and post-flood seasons are 0.65% and 61.05%, as well as 0.84% and 81.60%, respectively. Seasonal FLWL can effectively enhance flood water utilization rate without lowering the annual flood control standard compared with annual FLWL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aacceptable risk 3acase studies 3aflood control 3afloods 3amodels 3arisk analysis 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3awater utilization 3aChina 0aRisk analysis 0aSeasonal flood-limited water level 0aUncertainty1 aGuo, Shenglian1 aXu, Jijun1 aZhao, Xiaofeng.,1 aZhai, Lini0 tJournal of hydro-environment research.g2015 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.569-581dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific DivisionwJournal:2188x1570-64437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2015.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013300166300001600299520127100315592002801586650002401614650001101638650001601649650001001665650002201675650001301697650001001710650001201720650001101732650001401743650002301757650002001780650001301800650001601813650001401829650001001843653001201853653001301865653001001878653001901888653002001907700001901927700001801946773012801964856008102092852000902173655001202182IND60113639520221120035640.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011363952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarak, Sheweta10aRelationship of gliadin and glutenin proteins with dough rheology, flour pasting and bread making performance of wheat varieties  ap. 211-217.  aFour wheat varieties were selected to study the contribution of gliadins and glutenins to the dough rheological parameters, pasting profile and bread quality. The results showed that gliadins, glutenins and Gli/Glu ratio had appreciable effects on the dough stability, dough development time, peak viscosity, breakdown viscosity, bread specific volume and crumb firmness. Glutenins observed a strong negative relation with peak viscosity, breakdown viscosity and pasting temperature while gliadins showed positive association with breakdown viscosity, setback and final viscosity. Gli/Glu ratio was negatively correlated with dough development time (r = −0.988), dough stability (r = −0.940), gluten index (r = −0.975) and protein content (r = −0.837). Protein (r = 0.826), gluten index (r = 0.557), gliadins (r = 0.546) and glutenins (r = 0.939) exhibited positive correlations with bread specific volume. However, higher Gli/Glu ratio was found to be adversely affecting the bread volume and crumb firmness suggesting the importance of a balance of both the gluten subfractions for enhanced bread quality. The results suggested that gliadins are equally important as glutenins in asserting the bread making performance of wheat varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3acorrelation 3adough 3adough development 3afirmness 3aflour 3agliadin 3agluten 3aglutenins 3apasting properties 3aprotein content 3arheology 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awheat 0aGliadin 0aGlutenin 0aBread 0aCrumb firmness 0aSpecific volume1 aMudgil, Deepak1 aKhatkar, B.S.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 Apr., v. 51, no. 1 p.211-217dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012600169520132700295592002801622650001201650650001401662650000901676650002901685650002701714650001901741650001401760650001701774650001101791650001401802653002801816653001901844653002701863653002201890653001901912700001901931700001901950700005601969700001602025773011802041856008602159852000902245655001202254IND60776639020221119055803.0220921e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077663902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1152082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yuling,10aHydraulic conductivity of novel geosynthetic clay liner to bauxite liquor from China: Modified fluid loss test evaluation  aA modified sodium bentonite geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) designed for acid-and-alkaline resistance was evaluated for its potential application in the containment of bauxite residue leachate. A modified fluid loss test was employed to quickly evaluate the hydraulic conductivity (k) of the GCL using distilled water, tap water, and four bauxite liquors (BLs, leachate from bauxite residue reservoirs). The effects of swelling capacity of bentonite, prehydration, hydraulic gradient (i), ionic strength (I), and relative abundance of monovalent and multivalent cations (RMD) on the hydraulic conductivity of the GCL were analyzed. The results indicated that the BLs significantly decreased free swell index of the bentonite. As compared to increasing i, prehydration obviously enhanced hydraulic performance of the GCL. The four BLs increased k of the GCL by a factor of 4–12 relative to the tap water permeation condition, and the resultant k exceeded upper limit of 5.0 × 10⁻¹¹ m/s for GCLs. The increase in k was attributed to compression in diffuse double layer of the bentonite and dissolution in clay minerals in ion-rich and hyperalkaline BLs, manifesting that further modification on the GCL is needed. The I was found a better indicator than the RMD on correlation with chemical compatibility of the GCL.  aPublisher supplied data 3abauxite 3abentonite 3aclay 3aenvironmental management 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aionic strength 3aleachates 3apermeability 3asodium 3atap water 0aGeosynthetic clay liner 0aBauxite liquor 0aHydraulic conductivity 0aSwelling capacity 0aIonic strength1 aYou, Xing-Yuan1 aChen, Jian-Nan1 aFu, Xian-Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9668-79211 aDu, Yan-Jun0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 316 p.115208-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1152083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014100174500001900315520101500334592002801349650001701377650001301394650001401407650001501421650001401436650001701450650001501467650001601482653002401498653001901522653002801541653002201569700002201591700001901613700001901632700002101651700001601672700001601688700001701704773010601721856008701827852000901914655001201923IND60723900520221122001156.0210201e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072390052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1245942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Rameshwari10aCatalytic pyrolysis of ulva lactuca macroalgae: Effects of mono and bimetallic catalysts and reaction parameters on bio-oil up-gradation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCatalytic pyrolysis of ulva lactuca (UL) macroalgae was studied over a series of ZrO₂ supported metal such as Co, Ni and Co-Ni metal catalysts at temperature range of 300–500 °C. Highest bio-oil yield (47.8 wt%) was found with Co-Ni/ZrO₂ (10 wt%) catalyst while non-catalytic yielded 42.5 wt% bio-oil. Moreover with increases the metal amount to 15 wt%, the bio-oil yield slightly increased (49.2 wt%). The bio-oil quality significantly improved with using the catalysts compared to the non-catalytic pyrolysis. Catalytic pyrolysis also revealed that introducing Co-Ni into the ZrO₂ could result in higher surface area and which increased active sites. Catalytic bio-oils were consisted of mainly long chain hydrocarbon in the range of C₆-C₁₆. Moreover, the catalytic bio-oils were showed the higher ‘high heating value’ (HHV) 38.1 MJ/kg as compare to non-catalytic bio-oils (29.4 MJ/kg).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of protein phosphorylation in the acidosis-induced translocation of vacuolar-type H⁺-ATPase (V-ATPase) in salivary ducts and to identify molecular targets. Therefore, the human submandibular gland cell line HSG was exposed to acidosis and V-ATPase trafficking was investigated in the presence or absence of inhibitors and activators of sAC/PKA and Src/ERK signaling pathways. Putative target genes have been identified by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, and validated by loss-of-function experiments. Acidosis caused activation of cAMP/PKA and Src signaling and inhibition of either pathway significantly impaired acidosis-induced V-ATPase redistribution and incorporation into the plasma membrane. Activation of ERK1/2 was Src-independent, whereas activation of PKA caused phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding (CREB) and activation to regulate Rab11b transcription. Loss-of-function of CREB down-regulated Rab11b transcript and protein and significantly impaired acidosis-induced V-ATPase translocation in HSG cells. These data demonstrate that the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway initiates acidosis-induced V-ATPase trafficking in salivary ducts via regulation of Rab11b expression and provide first evidence for a molecular mechanism underlying cAMP/PKA-dependent transporter trafficking that could account for accumulation and activity of transporters in other cellular systems as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aacidosis 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acyclic AMP 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein phosphorylation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalivary ducts 3asignal transduction 3atransporters1 aSchlosshardt, Cornelius1 aFeuerstein, Melanie1 aRoussa, Eleni0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2012 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.1254-1265dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04081naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245062500164300001800789520243400807592002803241650001103269650001203280650002103292650002203313650000903335650001203344650001403356650001403370650001003384650001303394700002103407700001903428700002003447773015303467856007803620852000903698655001203707IND60521922620221118061615.0190219e19921101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052192262DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-11132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBierbach, Ulrich10aTetramethylthioharnstoff als Ligand in Übergangsmetallkomplexen: Redoxsubstitutionen mit dem Dithiobis(1,1,3,3-tetramethylformamidinium)-Kation Synthese und Kristallstrukturen von [Fe(SR)L₃]⁺BPh₄⁻, [FeL₄]²⁺BPh₄⁻)₂ und [RuCₗ₂(CO)₂L2] (R = 2,4,6-i-Pr₃C₆H₂; L = SC(NMe₂)₂) / Tetramethylthiourea as Ligand in Transition Metal Complexes:.

In the course of the reaction ruthenium is oxidized and CO ligands are partially replaced by L and Cl⁻.

The neutral complex cis, cis, trans-6 exhibits a distorted octahedral coordination of Ru(II) with thiourea ligands in trans position. 6 possesses C₂ symmetry. The S–Ru–Sᵃ angle was found to be 165.0°. The deviation from linearity is probably caused by the sterically hindered tetramethylthiourea ligands. The Ru–S bond length is 241.6(1) pm. Structural studies of geometrical parameters in tmtu complexes that are related to the nature of the M–Sₜₕᵢₒᵤᵣₑₐ bond suggest, that 1,1,3,3-tetramethylthiourea (L) does not only function as a σ-donor but possibly also exhibits weak π-donor and π-acceptor properties, respectively. The exact type of bonding is determined by the nature and oxidation state of the metal centre.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3airon 3aligands 3aoxidation 3aruthenium 3asalts 3athiourea1 aBarklage, Walter1 aSaak, Wolfgang1 aPohl, Siegfried0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g1992 Nov. 1, v. 47, no. 11 p.1593-1601dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x1865-71177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1992-11133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245012900159300001400288520133200302592002801634650001901662650001101681650001101692650001601703650001001719700001401729700002201743700001401765700001501779773011501794856007801909852000901987655001201996IND60765095120221120091742.0220422e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076509512DNAL7 a10.17221/3794-hortsci2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLachman, J.10aContent of polyphenolic antioxidants and trans-resveratrol in grapes of different varieties of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.)  ap. 63-69.  aContents of polyphenolic antioxidants as total polyphenols and trans-resveratrol in grape musts, grape skins and seeds of twelve vine varieties from the harvests 2001 and 2002 were determined.

The average annual trans-resveratrol values in the years 2001 and 2002 reached 0.817.10<sup>&ndash;2</sup> mg/kg DM and 4.97.10<sup>&ndash;2</sup> mg/kg DM in grape skins and 52.7.10<sup>&ndash;2</sup> mg/kg DM and 4.63.10<sup>&ndash;2</sup> mg/kg DM in the seeds and there was hardly any trans-resveratrol presence in the must. The results were evaluated statistically by Statgraphic and Anova programmes. Statistically significant differences in total polyphenols were found between analysed vintages, varieties and contents in seeds and grape skins. Regarding the trans-resveratrol content, statistically significant differences between vintages were found. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3agrapes 3aphenol 3apolyphenols 3avines1 aŠulc, M.1 aHejtmánková, A.1 aPivec, V.1 aOrsák, M.0 tZahradnictví.g, v. 31, no. 2 p.63-69dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21417x0862-867X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3794-hortsci3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013500157300002200292520161500314592002801929650001401957650001201971650001601983650001301999650001502012650001802027650002102045650001702066650000902083650002402092650001502116650002602131650001602157650001502173650001102188650001402199650002102213650001302234650001902247700001402266700001302280700001402293700001402307700001302321700001402334773012702348856007402475852000902549655001202558IND60641294420221118160233.0190505e20161125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064129442DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21804k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Haifeng10aFabrication of flame retardant coating on cotton fabric by alternate assembly of exfoliated layered double hydroxides and alginate  ap. 111950-111958.  aIn our current work, a layer-by-layer flame retardant coating, assembled from MgAl layered double hydroxides (MgAl-LDH) and alginate, was firstly fabricated onto the surface of cotton fabric for the purpose of reducing its flammability. First, the MgAl–NO₃ LDH was prepared by the hydrothermal method, then it was exfoliated into the positively charged nanosheet in the presence of formamide. Second, the coating deposition on cotton fabrics was carried out by alternately immersing the fabrics into MgAl-LDH suspension and alginate solution. In the vertical flame test, the cotton fabric coated with 20 bilayers could preserve almost 70% of the weave structure after the burning, while pure cotton fabric was completely burned out. The test by microscale combustion calorimetry revealed that the cotton fabrics only with 3.52 wt% coating could obtain 34.6% reduction in peak heat release rate and 25.6% reduction in total heat release compared with those of the pure one. In addition, as evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results, the decreased amount of volatilized pyrolysis products and toxic volatiles (CO) during the degradation of coated cotton fabrics was another important factor to improve the flame retardancy. The notable improved flame retardancy of coated cotton fabrics is attributed to the fact that the MgAl-LDH filled coating can form an inorganic protective layer, which can act as a barrier to retard the transfer of heat, oxygen, and the diffusion of volatilized pyrolysis products between the combustion zone and underlying cotton fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3aburning 3acalorimetry 3acoatings 3acombustion 3acotton fabric 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aheat 3ahot water treatment 3ahydroxides 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alint cotton 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3apyrolysis 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity 3avolatilization1 aWang, Wei1 aShen, Qi1 aPan, Ying1 aSong, Lei1 aHu, Yuan1 aLu, Yushi0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 25, v. 6, no. 113 p.111950-111958dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21804k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013200169520133400301592002801635650002301663650001001686650001401696650002401710650001001734650001301744650001401757650002301771650002301794650001701817650001401834650001901848651001101867651001801878653001801896653001901914653001401933653001801947653002401965700002201989773010702011856008502118852000902203655001202212IND60753086320221120163057.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075308632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2021.1024752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonno, Tomoaki10aCrayfish co-introduced symbiotic ostracod found on native crab in Japan: The first record of epibiont ostracod found a new host  aAnkylocythere sinuosa (Rioja, 1942), a symbiotic ostracod native to North America, was found from the Japanese mitten crab Eriocheir japonica (De Haan, 1835), a species native to Japan, collected from a pond in Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan. Introduced North American crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852), which is a host of A. sinuosa in their native range, inhabits ponds sympatrically with Japanese mitten crabs, and it is thought that the ostracods transferred from the exotic crayfish to the native crabs. In recent years, along with the artificial transportation of crayfish around the world, their symbiotic ostracods also have been found on the body surfaces of exotic crayfish in Europe and Japan. However, no studies have confirmed the infestation of exotic ostracods on native crustaceans in the field. A wide range of developmental stages of A. sinuosa from juveniles to adults were found in Japanese mitten crabs, and mating individuals were also found. This strongly suggests that they can reproduce on the body surface of Japanese mitten crabs. In the future, it will be necessary to strengthen measures against alien species to prevent these exotic symbionts from infestating native ecosystems, and we also need to investigate the exact impact of this symbiont on Japanese mitten crabs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEriocheir japonica 3aJapan 3aOstracoda 3aProcambarus clarkii 3acrabs 3acrayfish 3aepibionts 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aparasitology 3asymbionts 3atransportation 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aAnkylocythere 0aEntocytheridae 0aSpillover 0aAlien species 0aBiological invasion1 aTsukagoshi, Akira0 tParasitology international.g2022 Feb., v. 86 p.102475-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2021.1024753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245050700159300001800666520050700684592002801191650001601219650001701235650002201252650002001274650001301294650001501307650001201322650001301334700001901347700001801366700002401384773015301408856007801561852000901639655001201648IND60521922820221118061606.0190219e19921101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052192282DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-11152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlms, Petra10aSynthese und Charakterisierung achtgliedriger Cyclometallaphosphazene von Niob(V) und Titan(IV) sowie cyclischer und acyclischer Verbindungen von Molybdän(VI) mit Perfluoralkyl-Gruppen – Kristallstruktur von [Ph₂PNONbCl₃]₂ · 4 MeCN / Synthesis and Characterization of Eight-Membered Dimetallacyclophosphazenes with Niobium(V) and Titanium(IV) and Cyclic as well as Acyclic Compounds of Molybdenum(VI) Containing Perfluoroalkyl-Groups – X-Ray Crystal Structure of [Ph₂PNONbCl₃]₂·4MeCN  ap. 1609-1613.  aMe₃SiOPPh₂NSiMe₃ (1) reacts with NbCl₅ and CpTiCl₃ to form the eight-membered ring compounds [Ph₂PNONbCl₃]₂ (2) and [Ph₂PNOTiClCp]₂ (3).

In this study, we selected 18 oilseed rape Brassica napus genotypes with contrasting nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE) to unravel the main factors responsible for different EON and determine the critical period of EON formation under both a field and a pot experiments from 2016–2018. The high NUtE genotypes displayed significantly higher NUtE by 14.3%, along with greater yield per plant (29.4%) and SPS (21.1%) than the low NUtE genotypes. The greater productivity of the high NUtE genotypes was associated with 44.1% higher pollen grain number, 23.5% greater pollen viability, and 39.3% lower ovule abortion rate, compared to the low NUtE genotypes. In addition, the heart stage was the critical ovule development period for delineating the variability of EON among contrasting NUtE oilseed rape Brassica napus genotypes, when the high NUtE genotypes displayed higher silique net photosynthetic rate, surface area, biomass, and RNA expression levels. Taken together, this study indicated the pollen grain number, pollen viability and ovule abortion rate contributed to the final variation in EON and the heart stage was the critical period of determining the EON differences among contrasting NUtE genotypes. Increasing pollen grain number and pollen viability, and decreasing ovule abortion rate before heart stage should be the prerequisite for breeders to improve yield and NUtE of oilseed rape Brassica napus genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0200907cthe grants from the National Key R&D Program of China  a201503124cthe Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest 3aBrassica napus 3aRNA 3abiomass 3anutrient use efficiency 3aovules 3aphotosynthesis 3apollen 3apollen viability 3asiliques 3asurface area1 aMa, Bao-Luo1 aMcLaughlin, Neil B.1 aGao, Yajun1 aWu, Xiaoming1 aChen, Biyun0 tEuphytica.g2022 Jan., v. 218, no. 1 p.9-9dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-021-02954-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008900157300002000246520048700266592002800753650002300781650002000804650001300824650001900837650001100856650001700867650000900884650001600893700001500909700001600924700001800940773012400958856007401082852000901156655001201165IND60641294620221118160714.0190505e20161003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064129462DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21809a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Peixue10aConverting urea into high value-added 2-oxazolidinones under solvent-free conditions  ap. 94382-94386.  aZn-modified mesoporous Mg–Al nanoplates oxides were prepared by co-precipitation and further characterized and used in the synthesis of 2-oxazolidinones from urea and epoxides under solvent-free conditions.

Inspired by nature's spiky topological features of pollen grains, we developed silver-decorated biomimetic silica nanopollens (SNPs) to modify a polyvinylidene fluoride microfiltration membrane. The modified membrane demonstrated compelling antibiofouling performance compared to the pristine membrane, which was attributed to the synergetic effects of SNPs and loaded silver nanoparticles. The surface spikes of SNPs could act as multiple ‘entry claws’ to bind to the cell membrane upon contact, inducing physical deformation and metabolic disturbance of cells. More importantly, the SNPs could serve as a delivery vector for silver ions that were released from silver nanoparticles loaded in SNPs, further leading to cell damage due to the generation of reactive oxygen species and respiratory inhibition. These synergetic effects of SNPs and loaded silver nanoparticles imparted the modified membrane with potent antibiofouling behavior both in batch and continuous flow tests using model bacteria, Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), respectively. Our strategy provides a novel pathway using biomimetic materials to fabricate antibiofouling membranes for water and wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aartificial membranes 3abacteria 3abiofouling 3abiomimetics 3acell membranes 3adeformation 3aions 3amicrofiltration 3amodels 3ananosilver 3apollen 3areactive oxygen species 3asilica 3asilver 3athermoplastics 3awastewater treatment 0aMembrane biofouling 0aSilica nanopollens 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aPolyvinylidene fluoride membrane 0aWastewater treatment1 aPing, Meng1 aWu, Zhichao1 aTang, Chuyang Y.1 aWang, Zhiwei0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 597 p.117773-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.1177733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245009000161300001800251520144100269592002801710650001501738650001401753650001301767650001101780650002001791650001301811650001101824650001301835700002001848773015301868856007802021852000902099655001202108IND60521922920221118061605.0190219e19921101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052192292DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-11162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLissner, Falk10aÜber Sulfide und Oxidsulfide des Samariums / On Sulfides and Oxysulfides of Samarium  ap. 1614-1620.  aStoichiometric oxidation of SmCl₂ with sulfur in the presence of NaCl (evacuated silica vessel, 850 °C, 7 d) results in the formation of A—Sm₂S₃ (orthorhombic, Pnma (no. 62), a = 737.64(5), b = 397.44(3), c = 1536.26(9) pm, Z = 4, Rw = 0.017).

In particular, histone post-translational modifications set up a major component of this process dictating chromatin status and recruiting non-histone proteins in complexes formed to “handle DNA”. In CRC, histone marks of aberrant acetylation and methylation levels on specific residues have been revealed, along with a plethora of deregulated enzymes that catalyze these reactions. Mutations, deletions or altered expression patterns transform the function of several histone-modifying proteins, further supporting the crucial role of epigenetic effectors in CRC oncogenesis, being closely associated to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Elucidation of the biochemical basis of these new tumorigenic mechanisms allows novel potential prognostic factors to come into play. Moreover, the detection of these changes even in early stages of the multistep CRC process, along with the reversible nature of these mechanisms and the technical capability to detect such alterations in cancer cells, places this group of covalent modifications as a further potential asset for clinical diagnosis or treatment of CRC. This review underlines the biochemistry of histone modifications and the potential regulatory role of histone-modifying proteins in CRC pathogenesis, to date. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of the emerging epigenetic interplay along with the chemical compounds that are candidates for clinical use are discussed, offering new insights for further investigation of key histone enzymes and new therapeutic targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aacetylation 3aassets 3acarcinogenesis 3achemical compounds 3achromatin 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aenzymes 3aepigenetics 3agene expression regulation 3ahistones 3amethylation 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3apost-translational modification 3atumor suppressor genes1 aPiperi, Christina1 aAdamopoulos, Christos1 aPapavassiliou, Athanasios G.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2012 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.1276-1289dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245011900159300001400278520145500292592002801747650002801775650001101803650001401814650001701828650001201845650001401857650001901871650001401890700002001904700002001924773011501944856007802059852000902137655001202146IND60765095420221120091818.0220419e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076509542DNAL7 a10.17221/3797-hortsci2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlazek, J.,10aSegregation of powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha [Ell. et Ev. /Salm./]) resistance within 54 apple progenies  ap. 81-87.  aThe occurrence of powdery mildew after heavy spontaneous infections was evaluated on 2,500 apple seedlings of 54 progenies that were derived from crosses made in 1993 and 1994. At the same time, the response to mildew was also assessed on 47 cultivars or selections that were used as parents for the crosses. Scores of the strongest infestation were used for final ranking of every seedling or parent. The highest proportions (33 and 28%) of seedlings with complete resistance to mildew were attained in 2 progenies involving parents transmitting monogenic resistance to the pathogen. A few seedlings with this resistance were also found in other 7 progenies. Seedlings with partial resistance to mildew were distributed in the highest proportions (about 30%) among 7 progenies. In 6 out of these progenies, always one parent was derived from partially resistant selections that were selected in the first generation from the cross Sp&auml;tbl&uuml;hender Taffetapfel &times; Court Pendu Plat. A very close relationship was found between mid-scores of parents and mean response to powdery mildew infection in progenies. Seedlings on average were significantly more infested than their parents. Progenies determined to have a columnar growth habit were somewhat less infested than progenies possessing a standard growth pattern only. This study revealed considerable improvement of some donors transmitting partial resistance to powdery mildew. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodosphaera leucotricha 3aapples 3acultivars 3agrowth habit 3amildews 3apathogens 3apowdery mildew 3aseedlings1 aKřelinová, J.1 aDrahošová, H.0 tZahradnictví.g, v. 31, no. 3 p.81-87dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21417x0862-867X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3797-hortsci3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01311naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245009300132300001600225520022800241592002800469650002000497650002100517650000900538650001900547650002500566650001900591650001000610650002000620653002200640653002100662653001400683700001500697700001900712700001700731700002100748773015900769852000900928655001200937IND60721251520221121134146.0201224e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072125152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPillai, Usha N.10aImmuno-histochemical diagnosis of primary leiomyosarcoma of the right ventricle in a dog  ap. 196-197.  aA case of leiomyosarcoma of right ventricle in a 9 year old male German shepherd dog was recorded.

In these challenge tests three L. monocytogenes strains (Scott A, CA and IS951) were used for inoculating samples of processed cheese at three different inoculation levels. Although the results of this previous work have shown that the product did not support the growth of L. monocytogenes at either storage temperature, there were noticeable differences in the inactivation rates of the different L. monocytogenes strains at the different storage temperatures. Therefore, in the present study, the data from the early experiments were used to describe the kinetics of L. monocytogenes cell reduction in processed cheese during storage. A Weibull-type model was initially employed to describe the reduction of L. monocytogenes viable cells as a function of storage time, while the Arrhenius relationship was used to express the effect of temperature on the rate of cell reduction. For each strain, cell reduction data at all temperatures and all inoculum levels were treated as a single data set for the simultaneous determination, through non-linear fitting, of the cell reduction kinetic parameters and their temperature dependence. The proposed approach gave satisfactory results, in terms of agreement between measured and predicted cell reduction, as far as the effect of initial inoculum level and storage time and temperature is concerned. Strain variability was noticeable at the lower temperatures tested, with Scott A being the most resistant among the L. monocytogenes strains examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3ainoculum 3amodels 3apH 3aprocessed cheeses 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3astrain differences 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aProcessed cheese 0aMicrobial reduction 0aWeibull distribution 0aTemperature effects 0aArrhenius equation1 aPapageorgiou, Demetrios K.1 aTyrovouzis, Nikolaos A.1 aStoforos, Nikolaos G.0 tFood control.g2013 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.18-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.05.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245015800196300002000354520141800374592002801792650001401820650002301834650001401857650001601871650000901887650001301896650002201909650001101931650002601942650002001968653001901988653000902007653002102016653002902037653002202066700005402088700005102142773014202193856007902335852000902414655001202423IND60614662320221120053528.0181020e20180827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061466232DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b070072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2724-581210aEngineering Stable Surface Oxygen Vacancies on ZrO₂ by Hydrogen-Etching Technology: An Efficient Support of Gold Catalysts for Water-Gas Shift Reaction  ap. 31249-31259.  aThe surface structure of supports is crucial to fabricate efficient supported catalysts for water-gas shift (WGS). Here, hardly reducible ZrO₂ was etched with hydrogen (H), aiming to modify surface structures with sufficient stable oxygen vacancies. After deposition of gold species, the obtained khaki ZrO₂–H notably improved WGS catalytic activities and stabilities in comparison to the traditional white ZrO₂. The characterization results and quantitative analysis indicate that sufficient surface oxygen vacancies of ZrO₂–H support give rise to more metallic Au⁰ species and higher microstrain, which all boost WGS catalytic activities. Furthermore, optoelectronic properties were successfully used to correlate with their WGS thermocatalytic activities, and then a modified electron flow process was proposed to understand the WGS pathway. For one thing, the introduction of surface oxygen vacancies narrowed the band gap of ZrO₂ and decreased the Ohmic barrier, which facilitated the flow of “hot-electron”. For another thing, the conduction band electrons can be easily trapped by oxygen vacancies of ZrO₂ supports, and then these trapped electrons immediately take part in reduction of H₂O to H₂. Thus, the electron recombination was suppressed and the WGS catalytic activity was improved. It is worth extending H₂-etching technology to improve other thermocatalytic reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrons 3aengineering 3agold 3ahydrogen 3amaterials science 3aoxygen 3aquantitative analysis 3azirconium oxide 0agold catalysts 0aZrO2 0aoxygen vacancies 0awater-gas shift reaction 0ahot-electron flow1 aCao, Xuebo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0698-23351 aLi, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4949-64840 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Aug. 27, v. 10, no. 37 p.31249-31259dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b070073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100001700185245012300202300001400325520134900339592002801688650001701716650001601733650001901749650001801768650001701786650002601803650002001829650001401849650002701863650000701890650001601897650002001913650001601933653002201949653002801971653003301999653001602032653002602048653001902074700001802093700001702111773012602128856008102254852000902335655001202344IND60113639920221120035626.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011363992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.10.0122doi7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.10.0122chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Minfeng10aStrengthening soy protein hydrogels filled with protein-coated montmorillonite nanoclay by glutaraldehyde crosslinking  ap. 23-29.  aTo strengthen interactions in bio-nanocomposite systems, montmorillonite (MMT) was intercalated by surface-coating with soy protein before being incorporated within soy protein dispersions for cross-linking by glutaraldehyde (GA). Dynamic small strain tests were utilized as a non-destructive method to reveal the improvement of network structure in the bio-nanocomposite system. The storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) gradually increased with increasing GA concentration during isothermal treatment at 23, 60 and 90 °C. The incorporation of intercalated MMT resulted in an order of magnitude increase in the moduli. The moduli were higher at pH 5.5 than those at pH 6.5 and 10.0. At a GA concentration equal to 10 g/100 g mass of soy protein, G′ and G″ in the absence of MMT increased with an increase in temperature, while those in the presence of intercalated MMT showed the opposite trend due to restructuring of aggregated MMT. The present results confirmed that the mechanical strength of bio-nanocomposite systems can be significantly improved by first intercalating MMT with protein and subsequently cross-linking with the continuous phase protein molecules. The established chemical cross-linking method and conditions can be beneficial for preparing bio-nanocomposite materials with enhanced mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adispersions 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrocolloids 3aloss modulus 3amechanical properties 3amontmorillonite 3ananoclays 3anondestructive methods 3apH 3asoy protein 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 0aBio-nanocomposite 0aDynamic viscoelasticity 0aIntercalated montmorillonite 0aSoy protein 0aChemical crosslinking 0aGlutaraldehyde1 aIkeda, Shinya1 aZhong, Qixin0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 Apr., v. 51, no. 1 p.23-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245009100131300001600222520104000238592002801278650001901306650001201325650002101337650001201358650001701370650001201387650001901399650001901418650003101437653001101468653001901479700001701498700002001515700002101535773015901556852000901715655001201724IND60721251620221121134152.0201224e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072125162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivaseelan, S.10aCanine mammary tumour: Histopathological evaluation at different depths of tumour mass  ap. 198-199.  aThe present study reports the histopathological evaluation of a well matured long standing case of a massive mammary tumour at different depths of tumour mass in a nine years old non-descript bitch.

Transformation of myoepithelium into chondrocytes resulting in chondroma could be observed in the middle layer. It is concluded that in well matured mammary tumour, degree of malignancy increases from the outer area to the centre of the tumour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aadenoma 3aanimal pathology 3abitches 3achondrocytes 3afibroma 3ahistopathology 3amammary glands 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 0aCanine 0aMammary tumour1 aPoomathi, K.1 aVijayakumar, S.1 aBalachandran, P.0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 34, no. 2 p.198-199dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024002500170024004100195024002300236040001800259100005900277245011100336300001000447520153600457592002801993596006502021650000802086650001202094650001602106650001602122650001702138650001602155650001502171650002102186650001502207650001902222650001802241650001902259650001602278650001102294650001002305650001902315650001502334700001902349700002902368700002502397700001602422773013702438856011402575856008302689961001302772852000902785655001202794IND60760456320221214223820.0220130e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076045632DNAL7 a3873892aris7 a10113/76045632hdl7 a10.1007/s11270-021-05468-72doi7 a4383402aris_accn_no7 a5082-21000-001-000D2aris_project_no7 a3873892seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoudyal, Shital1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7791-540710aEffect of Residual Pesticides in Recycled Nursery Runoff on Growth and Physiology of Six Ornamental Shrubs  ap. 3.  aNursery runoff may contain pesticide residues, which, if released off-site, could impair surrounding ecosystems. As a solution, nursery growers can retain runoff water on-site and recycle retained water to irrigate plants. However, concerns related to potential phytotoxicity caused by residual pesticides in recycled water can discourage growers from recycling water. To evaluate plants irrigated with recycled water, we conducted a 3-year field study simulating a commercial nursery growing practice. Irrigation treatments were applied to six ornamental taxa grown in a nursery production bed. Irrigation treatments were raw groundwater from the on-site well (control), water recycled from a separate nursery bed containing plants that were treated with nine pesticides regularly over the growing seasons, and recycled water from the nursery bed that had been remediated using heat-expanded shale aggregates and woodchip bioreactors. Plants receiving recycled water (runoff water with and without remediation) did not produce pesticide-related visual injury. However, result for growth index, chlorophyll SPAD index, dark-adapted fluorescence, and shoot biomass were irregular among raw groundwater and recycled water; for most instances, pesticides in recycled water did not reduce any of those parameters. Net photosynthesis and light-adapted fluorescence were similar for raw groundwater and recycled water. Results from this study demonstrate the possibility of using recycled water for irrigation of woody ornamental shrubs.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014-51181-22372cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aair 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3apesticides 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3arecycled water 3aremediation 3arunoff 3ashale 3asoil pollution 3awood chips1 aAbdi, Damon E.1 aOwen, James S., Jr.cJr.1 aFernandez, R.

The idea was investigated by examining the impact of cellulase on degradation of PLA and PLA-jute (64/36) composite in an aqueous medium. The obtained results demonstrated 55% and 61% thickness reduction in PLA and PLA-jute specimens after four months of treatment, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) showed significant decline in the number average molecular weight (Mₙ) approximately equal to 85% and 80% for PLA and PLA-jute in comparison with their control. The poly dispersity index (PDI) of PLA and PLA-jute declined 41% and 49% that disclosed more homogenous distribution in molecular weight of the polymer after treatment with cellulase. The cellulase promiscuity effect on PLA degradation was further revealed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis where substantial decrease in the peak intensities of the polymer related functional groups were observed. In addition, PLA biodegradation was studied in more detail by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of control and cellulase treated specimens. The obtained results confirmed the promiscuous function of cellulase in the presence or the absence of jute as the specific substrate of cellulase. This can be considered as a major breakthrough to develop effective biodegradation processes for PLA products at the end of their life cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiodegradation 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agel chromatography 3ajute 3amolecular weight 3apolylactic acid 3athermogravimetry 0aBiodegradation 0aCellulase 0aComposite 0aJute 0aPolylactic acid (PLA) 0aPromiscuous activity1 aBazooyar, Faranak1 aBiria, Davoud1 aZamani, Akram1 aSkrifvars, Mikael0 tChemosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 278 p.130443-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1304433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002100147040001800168072000900186072000900195100001600204245009300220300001600313500002400329500001500353520118300368650002001551650002301571650001301594650001001607650002301617650002301640650001801663650002501681650002001706650002001726650002801746650001201774650002501786650002301811650003101834650001601865650001201881650003601893650001701929651001101946651001101957653001401968653001601982653001801998700001702016773012402033852000902157856008602166856011202252930003302364945002502397946001302422961001302435655001202448IND4386225920221119054105.0061219e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438622592DNAL7 a128526432pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-96.3.9692doi7 a10113/113632hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aX1001 aUmble, J.R.10aSampling considerations for garden symphylans (Order: Cephalostigmata) in western Oregon  ap. 969-974.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aSampling recommendations were developed for a potato bait sampling method used to estimate garden symphylan (Scutigerella immaculata Newport) densities in western Oregon. Sample size requirements were developed using Taylor's power law to describe the relationship between sample means and variances. Developed sampling recommendations performed well at sample sizes of 30 and greater, when validated by resampling a cohort of 40 independent data sets. Sample size requirements for the bait sampling method were 1.5 times greater than the requirements for the soil sampling method over densities from 1 to 20 S. immaculata per sample unit. As S. immaculata densities increased from April to May, sample size requirements decreased by 36% for fixed precision levels. For sampling in April, decreasing the damage threshold from 20, to 10 and five S. immaculata per sample unit, required a 1.6 and 2.5 times greater sample size requirement, respectively, for a fixed precision level (c) appropriate for pest management (c = 0.25). The bait sampling method provides an efficient reliable alternative to the standard soil sampling method used to monitor garden symphylan populations. 3asoil arthropods 3atemporal variation 3asampling 3abaits 3aeconomic threshold 3apopulation density 3asoil sampling 3astatistical analysis 3apest monitoring 3aarthropod pests 3aScutigerella immaculata 2aAnimals 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aPopulation Density 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSample Size 2aSeasons 2aSolanum tuberosumxparasitology 2aTime Factors 3aOregon 0aOregon 0aMyriapoda 0asample size 0abait sampling1 aFisher, J.R.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2003 June, v.  96, no.  3 p.969-974dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-96.3.9693Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/113633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aINDdCMMe2007/02/13  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03275naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001300154245013500167300001400302520188900316592002802205650001202233650001602245650001802261650001202279650001502291650001102306650001202317650001902329650001102348650001302359650002602372650001402398650002002412650001902432650002002451650002202471650001002493650001902503700001802522700001902540700001502559700001102574773011102585856008802696852000902784655001202793IND50060222720221120220319.0150812e20121122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006022272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYari, M.10aModeling nutrient availability of alfalfa hay harvested at three stages of maturity and in the afternoon and morning in dairy cows  ap. 12-19.  aNutritive value of alfalfa hay is influenced by stage of maturity and cutting time which affects the potential nutrient supply in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of stage of maturity and cutting time of alfalfa hay grown under semi-arid climate condition on in situ ruminal degradation characteristics and predicted protein availability in dairy cows using two protein models based on different principles (DVE/OEB 1994 and NRC, 2001). Alfalfa was cut at early bud (June 15/16), late bud (June 26/27) and early flower (July 18/19) in the afternoon (18:00h) and the following morning (06:00h). Alfalfa hay at early bud and late bud contained higher in situ effective degradable nitrogen (EDN) to effective degradable energy (ED organic matter (EDOM) and ED carbohydrates (EDCHO)) ratios compared with alfalfa at early flower (P<0.05) and highest EDN to EDOM and EDCHO ratios were reached in the first hours of ruminal incubation for all alfalfa hays. Rumen degraded protein balance decreased with advancing maturity (P<0.05). There was a trend towards reduction in metabolizable protein (NRC model; 78, 72 and 66g/kg dry matter (DM), P=0.06) and truly absorbed protein (DVE value; 57, 51 and 39g/kg DM, P=0.08) with advancing maturity. Cutting alfalfa in the afternoon increased EDCHO (450 vs. 431g/kg CHO; P=0.08), ruminal microbial protein synthesis based on total digestible nutrients (NRC model; MCPE ᴺᴿC; 62 vs. 59g/kg DM; P=0.03) and intestinally absorbable MCPE ᴺᴿC (40 vs. 38g/kg DM; P=0.03) compared with cutting alfalfa in the morning. In conclusion, cutting alfalfa hay at early bud stage tended to have the highest metabolizable protein content, but also the highest imbalance between rumen available protein and energy and cutting alfalfa in the afternoon increased potential ruminal microbial protein synthesis in dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa 3aalfalfa hay 3acarbohydrates 3acutting 3adairy cows 3aenergy 3aflowers 3amaturity stage 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aorganic matter 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3arumen 3asemiarid zones1 aValizadeh, R.1 aNaserian, A.A.1 aJonker, A.1 aYu, P.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2012 Nov. 22, v. 178, no. 1-2 p.12-19dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015700155300002000312520116900332592002801501650003001529650001101559650001601570650002201586700001601608700001801624700001501642700001601657700001501673700001501688700001401703773012501717856007401842852000901916655001201925IND60641294920221118160722.0190505e20161020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064129492DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21814h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hua10aSynthesis and characterization of two novel second-order nonlinear optical chromophores based on julolidine donors with excellent electro-optic activity  ap. 99743-99751.  aJulolidine and its derivatives are excellent electron-rich structures thus two novel second order nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores based on julolidine donors and tricyanofuran (TCF) acceptors linked via isophorone bridge (zh-1) and modified isophorone bridge (zh-2) have been synthesized. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to optimize the geometrical structures, calculate the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps and first-order hyperpolarizability (β) of these chromophores. Besides, to determine the redox properties of these chromophores, cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed. The optimized structures suggest that chromophore zh-1 possesses better planarity which increases the ability of electron delocalization. These chromophores showed good thermal stability with their decomposition temperatures all above 210 °C. The electro-optic coefficients (r₃₃) of poled films containing 25 wt% of these chromophores doped in amorphous polycarbonate (APC) afforded values of 170 and 101 pm V⁻¹ at 1310 nm for chromophores zh-1 and zh-2, respectively. These properties show the potential use of the new chromophores as advanced material devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aHuo, Fuyang1 aLiu, Fenggang1 aChen, Zhuo1 aLiu, Jialei1 aBo, Shuhui1 aZhen, Zhen1 aQiu, Ling0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 20, v. 6, no. 102 p.99743-99751dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21814h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245006300200300002000263520125900283592002801542650002901570650001101599650001601610650000901626650002601635650002201661650001101683650002301694650002201717650001601739650001101755653001501766653002601781653001201807653002201819653002201841700001701863700001301880700001501893700002101908700001601929700001101945700001701956700001801973700001801991700001802009700001602027773014302043856007802186852000902264655001202273IND60614662520221120053621.0181002e20180905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061466252DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b070482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Zhifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9416-394810aHole-Injection Layer-Free Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes  ap. 32289-32297.  aIn this study, a dual-source vapor evaporation method was employed to fabricate the high-quality CsPbBr₃ thin films with a good crystalline and high surface coverage. Temperature-dependent and excitation power-dependent photoluminescence measurements were performed to study the optical properties of the CsPbBr₃ material. Further, based on the experimental data, the temperature sensitivity coefficient of band gap and exciton binding energy were estimated. More importantly, for the first time, we designed and prepared a hole-injection layer-free perovskite light-emitting diode (LED) based on the Au/MgO/CsPbBr₃/n-MgZnO/n⁺-GaN structure, producing an intense green emission (∼538 nm) with a high purity. Besides, the device demonstrated a high luminance of 5025 cd/m², an external quantum efficiency of 1.46%, a current efficiency of 1.92 cd/A, and a power efficiency of 1.76 lm/W. We studied in detail the current–voltage and electroluminescence properties of the prepared device and proposed the hole generation models and the carrier transport/recombination mechanisms to make these interesting characteristics certain. The results obtained would provide a new and effective strategy for the design and preparation of perovskite LEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3agold 3alight emitting diodes 3amaterials science 3amodels 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 3atemperature 3avapors 0aperovskite 0alight-emitting diodes 0aCsPbBr3 0avapor evaporation 0aimpact ionization1 aLei, Lingzhi1 aLi, Ying1 aZhang, Fei1 aMa, Zhuangzhuang1 aLi, Xinjian1 aWu, Di1 aXu, Tingting1 aTian, Yongtao1 aZhang, Baolin1 aYao, Zhiqiang1 aDu, Guotong0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Sept. 05, v. 10, no. 38 p.32289-32297dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b070483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04062naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002900154245014700183520235900330592002802689650002602717650001102743650000902754650001802763650000902781650002202790650002302812650001102835650002402846650002002870650001202890650000902902650001702911650001402928650002302942650001602965650001002981650002902991650001203020650001303032650001503045653001903060653001703079653002003096653001903116700003503135700003603170700002903206700002603235700001903261773011803280856008903398852000903487655001203496IND60679685220221120034223.0200320e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067968522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2019.1143792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarneiro, William Franco10aEffect of the digestible protein-energy relationship on the growth performance of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fed fishmeal-free diets  aThis study aimed to determine the best digestible protein: digestible energy (DP:DE) ratio for adult Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fed diets formulated with vegetable ingredients (soybean and corn), and without fishmeal. Four hundred and twenty male Nile tilapia (GIFT strain) (initial mean weight 193 ± 12.6 g) were allocated to 60 plastic tanks (1000 L) connected to a water recirculation system, and there were 7 fish in each tank. The experimental design was a 5 × 4 factorial with three replicates for each diet treatment. The fish were fed one of 20 diets containing a combination of five digestible protein levels (140, 190, 240, 290 and 340 g/kg DP) and four digestible energy levels (10.89, 11.72, 12.56 and 13.40 MJ/kg DE) for 96 days. The fish were given three meals each day (8 AM, 1 PM and 6 PM) and feeding was to apparent satiation. At the end of the experimental period, diets presented an interactive effect (P < 0.05) in relation to the productive performance. Final weight (FW = 448.82 g), fillet yield (FY = 32.60 %) and specific growth ratio (SGR = 2.65 %) were increased and a decrease in feed conversion ratio (FCR = 1.20) was observed in diet containing 240 g/kg DP and 12.56 MJ/kg DE. Otherwise, the highest protein efficiency ratio (P < 0.05) was found in diet containing 140 g/kg DP and 12.56 MJ/kg DE. FW, WG, FY and SGR were increased significantly (P < 0.05) up to the 12.56 MJ/kg DE level, independent of digestible protein levels. A quadratic effect was observed for FW, WG and SGR, independent of energy levels. An increase in these variables was observed up to 250.78, 240.70 and 216.70 g/kg DP respectively, and the lowest FCR was 260.58 g/kg DP. A linear increase was observed for FY (P < 0.05) in diets containing higher DP levels. No interaction (P > 0.05) was observed in any treatment for fillet centesimal composition and whole body. However, an increase (P < 0.05) in crude protein of fillet and body moisture was observed in diets containing levels above 240 g/kg DP, independent of DE. The present findings indicate that the optimal DP:DE level was 240 g/kg DP and 12.56 MJ/kg DE in the fishmeal-free diets for males Nile tilapia, promoting adequate growth performance without affecting the proximal tissue composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aadults 3acorn 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestible energy 3adigestible protein 3aenergy 3aexperimental design 3afeed conversion 3afillets 3afish 3afish feeding 3afish meal 3agrowth performance 3aingredients 3amales 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3asatiety 3asoybeans 3avegetables 0aFish nutrition 0aFillet yield 0aFeed efficiency 0aGrowth metrics1 aColpini, Leda Maria Saragiotto1 ade Souza, Rodrigo Clemente Thom1 aBombardelli, Robie Allan1 aBalen, Rafael Ernesto1 aMeurer, Fábio0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2020 Apr., v. 262 p.114379-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2019.1143793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012100162300001600283520135900299592002801658650001201686650001701698650002001715650001801735650001201753650001601765650002101781650001601802653002901818653001701847653005401864653002601918653004701944700001201991700001402003700001202017700001402029773012802043856008102171852000902252655001202261IND60113640120221118002010.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011364012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, K.K.10aSelective enrichment of symmetric monounsaturated triacylglycerols from palm stearin by double solvent fractionation  ap. 242-252.  aThe aim of this study was to produce a fractionated palm stearin enriched in symmetric monounsaturated triacylglycerols (SMUT), such as 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol (POP), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoyl-rac-glycerol (POS), and 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol (SOS) using two-stage acetone fractionation. Palm stearin, containing 27.2 g/100 g total SMUT and 33.8 g/100 g tripalmitin was used as the starting material for the fractionation. A liquid fraction produced from palm stearin under the best conditions (temperature, 17 °C; volume-to-weight ratio of acetone to palm stearin, 8; crystallization time, 8 h) established in this study was free of tripalmitin (<0.5 g/100 g) and contained 44.5 g/100 g total SMUT (∼37.3 g/100 g POP, ∼6.4 g/100 g POS, and ∼0.8 g/100 g SOS). The yield of the liquid fraction was 61.3 g/100 g of the initial palm stearin weight. The liquid fraction was crystallized to further increase SMUT concentration. After fractionation at 4 °C for 24 h, a solid fraction with total SMUT content of 63.2 g/100 g (∼53.0 g/100 g POP, ∼9.1 g/100 g POS, and ∼1.1 g/100 g SOS) was obtained and its yield was 30.8 g/100 g of initial palm stearin weight. The resulting fractionated palm stearin would be suitable for use in preparing cocoa butter equivalents due to the high SMUT content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3acocoa butter 3acrystallization 3afractionation 3astearin 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 3atripalmitin 0aCocoa butter equivalents 0aPalm stearin 0aSilver-ion high performance liquid chromatography 0aSolvent fractionation 0aSymmetric monounsaturated triacylglycerols1 aKim, S.1 aKim, I.H.1 aLee, C.1 aKim, B.H.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 Apr., v. 51, no. 1 p.242-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245020300167300001400370520179700384592002802181650001702209650002202226650001202248650002102260650001902281650001802300650001602318650002102334650003202355650001202387650002902399650001202428650001102440650001502451650002102466650001302487650002602500650000902526650001302535650002902548651001002577653001502587653003602602653002102638653002102659653003302680700001402713700001502727700001702742700001802759700001702777700001502794773011402809856008602923852000903009655001203018IND60628700320221118101408.0190325e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062870032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jinwei10aEstablished UPLC-MS/MS procedure for multicomponent quantitative analysis in rat plasma: A contrastive pharmacokinetics study of Qiangshen tablet in normal and kidney yang deficiency syndrome models  ap. 35-42.  aQiangshen tablet, an important prescription consisting of 14 kinds of Chinese herbal medicines, has been used for decades to treat kidney yang deficiency syndrome (KYDS) in China. Qiangshen tablet has been recorded in ChP (2015 edition) and possesses the effect of strengthening yang, invigorating qi and tonifying kidneys. In this research, a simple, reliable and specific method was established for simultaneous determination of stachydrine, psoralen, isopsoralen, morroniside, paeoniflorin and loganin in normal and KYDS rat plasma after intragastric administration of a Qiangshen tablet suspension by UPLC-MS/MS. Protein precipitation (PP) by acetonitrile and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) by ethyl acetate - n-butanol (1: 1, v/v) were used for pretreatment of plasma samples. Chromatographic separation of two IS (Internal Standard) and six analytes was achieved using an ACQUITY UPLC® BEH C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) with a gradient scheme. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with positive and negative ion source switching was applied to perform the mass spectrometric analyses. This method has been validated with good linearity (r ≥ 0.9942) and acceptable precision and accuracy (RSD ≤ 11%, RE from −4.8% to 7.7%). The mean recovery values of the analytes and IS were all ≥68.28%, and the matrix effects ranged from 94.4% to 101.7%. The stability of the IS and analytes was measured throughout the experiment. The results showed significant differences between the pharmacokinetic traits of the analytes in the normal and KYDS groups, suggesting that pharmacokinetic procedures involving these analytes could be modified in cases of KYDS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aaqueous solutions 3abutanol 3achemical species 3achromatography 3aethyl acetate 3aformic acid 3aherbal medicines 3aintragastric administration 3akidneys 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3aloganin 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3apsoralen 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aChina 0aUPLC-MS/MS 0aKidney yang deficiency syndrome 0aPharmacokinetics 0aQiangshen tablet 0aTraditional Chinese medicine1 aYu, Jinbo1 aXu, Panpan1 aChen, Jinmei1 aGao, Guanghui1 aLi, Binglong1 aSun, Lixin0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 1106-1107 p.35-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011900157300001800276520132000294592002801614650001301642650002501655650001301680650001701693650001901710650002101729650001701750650002201767650002001789650000901809650001301818650002401831650001901855650001601874650001301890650001301903650002301916650001101939700002201950700001701972700002001989773012302009856007502132852000902207655001202216IND60534691020221118032704.0160803e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053469102DNAL7 a10.1021/es300228m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Joo-Youn10aHydrogen Generation in Microbial Reverse-Electrodialysis Electrolysis Cells Using a Heat-Regenerated Salt Solution  ap. 5240-5246.  aHydrogen gas can be electrochemically produced in microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cells (MRECs) using current derived from organic matter and salinity-gradient energy such as river water and seawater solutions. Here, it is shown that ammonium bicarbonate salts, which can be regenerated using low-temperature waste heat, can also produce sufficient voltage for hydrogen gas generation in an MREC. The maximum hydrogen production rate was 1.6 m³ H₂/m³·d, with a hydrogen yield of 3.4 mol H₂/mol acetate at a salinity ratio of infinite. Energy recovery was 10% based on total energy applied with an energy efficiency of 22% based on the consumed energy in the reactor. The cathode overpotential was dependent on the catholyte (sodium bicarbonate) concentration, but not the salinity ratio, indicating high catholyte conductivity was essential for maximizing hydrogen production rates. The direction of the HC and LC flows (co- or counter-current) did not affect performance in terms of hydrogen gas volume, production rates, or stack voltages. These results show that the MREC can be successfully operated using ammonium bicarbonate salts that can be regenerated using conventional distillation technologies and waste heat making the MREC a useful method for hydrogen gas production from wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aammonium bicarbonate 3acathodes 3adistillation 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy recovery 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aorganic matter 3ariver water 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asodium bicarbonate 3awastes1 aCusick, Roland D.1 aKim, Younggy1 aLogan, Bruce E.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 May 01, v. 46, no. 9 p.5240-5246dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes300228m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009300166300001600259520174300275592002802018650003102046650001102077650001302088650002002101650002102121650003202142650002002174650001902194650003202213700001902245700001702264700001702281773008102298856004802379852000902427655001202436IND50064198920221119212528.0130327e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006419892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11745-013-3758-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Jae-Myung10aInhibitory Effect of N-Acyl Dopamines on IgE-Mediated Allergic Response in RBL-2H3 Cells  ap. 383-393.  aRecently, endogenous N-acyl dopamines have been found to show anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities.

When RBL-2H3 cells were exposed to palmitoyl dopamine (NP-DA), oleoyl dopamine (NO-DA) or arachidonoyl dopamine (NA-DA) at micromolar levels, all these compounds significantly inhibited the release of β-hexosaminidase, a marker of degranulation, as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In comparison, NP-DA, potently suppressing the release of β-hexosaminidase (IC₅₀, 3.5 μM) and TNF-α (IC₅₀, 2.2 μM), was more potent than NO-DA or NA-DA. Additionally, NP-DA markedly suppressed the formation of prostaglandin E₂, prostaglandin D₂ and leukotriene C₄, corresponding to pro-inflammatory lipid mediators in asthma. In the mechanistic analyses, where the effect of NP-DA on the FcεRI cascade was examined, NP-DA significantly inhibited the phosphorylation and expression of Syk, but not Lyn. And, NP-DA also suppressed phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Further, NP-DA decreased the phosphorylation of cPLA₂ and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), but not cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Based on these results, it is suggested that NP-DA exert anti-allergic effect on allergic response through suppressing the activation of Syk, ERK1/2, Akt, cPLA₂ and 5-LO. Besides, a strong inhibition of COX-2 activity by NP-DA may be additional mechanism for its anti-allergic action. Such an anti-allergic action of N-acyl dopamines may contribute to further information about biological functions of N-acyl dopamines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aasthma 3adopamine 3aimmunoglobulins 3aimmunomodulation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aphosphorylation 3aprostaglandins 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aPark, Eun Seok1 aKim, Mee Ree1 aSok, Dai-Eun0 tLipids.g2013 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.383-393dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-013-3758-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01659naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300001800268520070700286592002800993650001601021650001801037650002301055650002201078650001501100700001701115700001901132773011601151856008101267852000901348655001201357IND60119137420221123035135.0141203e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011913742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-014-1143-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Qianqian14aThe Cost-Efficiency Realization in the Escherichia coli-Based Cell-Free Protein Synthesis Systems  ap. 2351-2367.  aA reliable and cost-efficient protein synthesis system is the prerequisite for both structural and functional proteomic studies.

In this study, we investigated the impact of vitamin D deficiency on PI in a sample of community dwelling older subjects. Our objective was to determine the potential association between vitamin D deficiency and PI in older fallers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Falls and Fractures Clinic, Department of Geriatric Medicine, Nepean Hospital, Penrith, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty-five adults aged 65 years and older who have had at least one episode of a fall within the six months prior to assessment at the Falls and Fractures Clinic. MEASUREMENTS: Serum 25(OH) vitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] and parathyroid hormone concentrations were determined at baseline. Subjects were separated into 3 groups based on serum 25(OH)D3 levels with the following cut-off values: < 30 nmol/L (deficient), 30â50 nmol/L (insufficient) and > 50 nmol/L (normal). Other baseline measurements included body mass index, mini-nutritional assessment, grip strength, serum calcium concentration and creatinine clearance, which were used as covariables. PI was assessed using a computerized virtual reality system (Medicaa, Uruguay). Measured parameters included limits of stability (LOS) and centre of pressure (COP) under eyes closed on foam (ECF) and visio-vestibular stimulation. The estimated swaying area, computed from the ellipse of confidence under eyes closed standing on foam (ECF), was also used as a PI parameter. Gait velocity (GV) was measured using a GaitRITE walkway system. RESULTS: Posture was impaired in vitamin D deficiency (<30 nmol/L) as indicated by lower LOS (90 +/â 18), higher ECF (25 +/â 10) and slower GV (55 +/â 7) as compared with the insufficient and normal groups. After adjustment for demographic, biochemical and anthropometric variables, vitamin D deficiency significantly correlated with low LOS and high COP under ECF. CONCLUSION: Low levels of vitamin D were associated with PI. This association could also have an effect on slow GV and increased risk of falls. In conclusion, using an objective method to measure balance in older fallers we have identified a novel role of vitamin D in balance control. Prospective studies are required to confirm the effect of vitamin D on PI and elucidate the mechanisms of this association.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelderly 3aprospective studies 3ablood serum 3aeyes 3amedicine 3avitamin D deficiency 3acalcium 3aphysical activity 3arisk factors 3aparathyroid hormone 3avitamin status 3acreatinine 3aposture 3agait 3abody mass index 3acholecalciferol 3across-sectional studies 3aAustralia 3aUruguay 0arisk1 aDemontiero, O.1 aAmiri, Z.

The method is based on the spectrophotometric measurement of DPPH·concentration that changes resulting from the DPPH radical reaction with an antioxidant. The amount of remaining DPPH·in the examined system is a measure of the antioxidant activity of compounds. Our study aims at exploring the antioxidant properties of Justicia adhatoda leaf extract and comparing the results in terms of effective concentration which scavenges 50 % radical (EC₅₀). The correlation of the activities for both cold and Soxhlet methanolic extracts is reported with DPPH assay. The antioxidant capacity of the methanolic extract derived by two different methods is positively correlated. Correlation between antioxidant capacity and phenolic content of methanolic extract in both the cases indicates the efficiency of the extraction procedure. Positive correlation and p value <0.05 validate the efficiency of the procedures and results.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aJusticia adhatoda 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiotechnology 3acold 3acorrelation 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3asolvents1 aPanda, Likun1 aRamaiah, Sudha1 aAnbarasu, Anand0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2014 Dec., v. 174, no. 7 p.2413-2425dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-014-1164-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245007800176300001800254500001100272520155900283592002801842650001901870650002401889650001701913650002001930650001201950650002001962650001901982650001702001650002802018650001302046650002102059650002802080650001602108700001802124700002302142700002702165700002202192700002202214700002402236700002702260700001502287700002202302700006302324773012402387856008302511852000902594655001202603IND60746956520221120232952.0211001e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074695652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-021-02690-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhaman, Mohammad Saidur10a5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated plant adaptive responses to abiotic stress  ap. 1451-1469.  aReview  aKEY MESSAGE: 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) modulates various defense systems in plants and confers abiotic stress tolerance. Enhancement of crop production is a challenge due to numerous abiotic stresses such as, salinity, drought, temperature, heavy metals, and UV. Plants often face one or more abiotic stresses in their life cycle because of the challenging growing environment which results in reduction of growth and yield. Diverse studies have been conducted to discern suitable mitigation strategies to enhance crop production by minimizing abiotic stress. Exogenous application of different plant growth regulators is a well-renowned approach to ameliorate adverse effects of abiotic stresses on crop plants. Among the numerous plant growth regulators, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a novel plant growth regulator, also well-known to alleviate the injurious effects of abiotic stresses in plants. ALA enhances abiotic stress tolerance as well as growth and yield by regulating photosynthetic and antioxidant machineries and nutrient uptake in plants. However, the regulatory roles of ALA in plants under different stresses have not been studied and assembled systematically. Also, ALA-mediated abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms have not been fully elucidated yet. Therefore, this review discusses the role of ALA in crop growth enhancement as well as its ameliorative role in abiotic stress mitigation and also discusses the ALA-mediated abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms and its limitation and future promises for sustainable crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aaminolevulinic acid 3aantioxidants 3acrop production 3adrought 3anutrient uptake 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aplant growth substances 3asalinity 3astress tolerance 3asustainable agriculture 3atemperature1 aImran, Shahin1 aKarim, Md.

Methyl bromide (MeBr) fumigation is an internationally accepted treatment for such wood-boring beetles, but the use of MeBr is scheduled for reduction or elimination as alternatives become available. The use of MeBr can be reduced by more efficient and technically sound fumigation techniques, including good circulation and proper loading. Concentration x time products (CxT) reported for A. glabripennis in solid wood timbers were used to test estimated doses in container fumigations conducted in Tianjin and Shanghai, China, during years 2002-2003. We found that CxT products observed were generally adequate and would support reduced doses of MeBr at temperatures intermediate (10.0 and 15.6°C) to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service schedule of 80 g and 48 g/m3 at > or = 4.4 and or > =21.1°C, respectively. The use of fans is recommended, and loading of the containers should never reach 100% to allow for better circulation and desorption. Proper use of fans will allow for better aeration and increase safety to inspectors and consignees of containerized fumigated commodities. 3aAnoplophora glabripennis 3ainsect control 3awood 3apackaging materials 3acontainers 3afumigation 3afumigant insecticides 3amethyl bromide 3achemical concentration 3aduration 3atemperature 3aquarantine 3apesticide law 2aAnimals 2aColeoptera. 2aFumigationxmethods 2aHydrocarbons, Brominated 2aInsecticides 2aProduct Packaging 2aTime Factors 2aWood1 aWang, X.1 aYuan, P.1 aJin, X.1 aLiu, Y.1 aLou, S.1 aHamilton, B.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2006 June, v.  99, no.  3 p.664-670dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-99.3.6643Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/13753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://puck.esa.catchword.org/vl=4081177/cl=17/nw=1/rpsv/journal/journal3_home.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/26  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02859naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245015000202300002000352520148700372592002801859650002301887650001401910650001101924650001701935650001901952650001001971650000901981650002101990650002002011650001102031650002202042650000702064650002302071650001902094650001902113650002002132700005802152773013802210856008002348852000902428655001202437IND60677890120221122042119.0191213e20191110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b103082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEom, C.

However, very little is known about the structure of the amorphous oxide catalyst during OER, especially the structural detail of the low-atomic number groups (e.g., O, P-containing species). Herein, we report in situ stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SRS) of an amorphous cobalt oxide deposited in phosphate electrolyte (CoPi), one of the most active OER catalysts in neutral pH. In situ SRS reveals the presence of orthophosphates (PO₄³–) in CoPi, despite the species being unstable at the studied pH. ¹⁸O labeling of water during the CoPi electrodeposition substantially shifts the vibrational spectra of the phosphate bands, even though the phosphate groups were not labeled. The new vibrational positions match best to the phosphate network, for example, pyrophosphates (P₂O₇⁴–), implying that the phosphates polymerize like a phosphate glass. We propose that the CoPi formation starts by electro-generating high-valence Co that subsequently react with water and phosphate to form CoPi. In ¹⁸O water, the kinetic isotope effect slows down the Co reactivity toward water. As a result, the high-valence Co reacts preferably with phosphates, polymerizing them into a phosphate network. Our finding provides a mechanistic view of how the buffer ions affect the structure of an amorphous oxide, which may explain why the activity is sensitive to the deposition procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3aelectroplating 3aglass 3aions 3aisotope labeling 3aorthophosphates 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3apH 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymerization 3apyrophosphates 3astable isotopes1 aSuntivich, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3427-43630 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 10, v. 123, no. 48 p.29284-29290dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b103083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245011300200300001300313520169500326592002802021650001202049650001302061650001102074650001302085650001002098650001402108650001402122650001902136650000902155650002002164650001302184650002202197651002102219653001202240653001702252653001202269653001902281653001302300700001902313700005302332700001702385700001602402700001602418700001902434773010802453856008102561852000902642655001202651IND60593344820221116141549.0180426e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059334482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2016.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6075-856412aA regional-scale assessment of Himalayan glacial lake changes using satellite observations from 1990 to 2015  ap. 1-13.  aThe Himalaya, the world's highest mountain ranges, are home to a large group of glaciers and glacial lakes. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in this region have resulted in catastrophic damages and fatalities in the past decades. The recent warming has caused dramatic glacial lake changes and increased potential GLOF risk in the Himalaya. However, our knowledge on the current state and change of glacial lakes in the entire Himalaya is limited. This study maps the current (2015) distribution of glacial lakes across the entire Himalaya and monitors the spatially-explicit evolution of glacial lakes over five time periods from 1990 to 2015 using a total of 348 Landsat images at 30m resolution. The results show that 4950 glacial lakes in 2015 cover a total area of 455.3±72.7km², mainly located between 4000m and 5700m above sea level. Himalayan glacial lakes expanded by approximately 14.1% from 1990 to 2015. The changing patterns of supraglacial lakes and proglacial lakes are rather complex, involving both lake disappearance and emergence. Many emergent glacial lakes are found at higher elevations, especially the new proglacial lakes, which have formed as a result of glacier retreat. Spatially heterogeneous changes of Himalayan glacial lakes are observed, with the most significant expansion occurring in the southern slopes of the central Himalaya. Increasing glacier meltwater induced by the Himalayan atmospheric warming is a primary cause for the observed lake expansion. This study provides primary data for future GLOF risk assessments. A total of 118 rapidly expanded glacial lakes are identified as potential vulnerable lakes for the priority of risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aaltitude 3afloods 3aglaciers 3alakes 3amortality 3amountains 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asnowmelt 3atopographic slope 3aHimalayan region 0aLandsat 0aGlacial lake 0aGlacier 0aClimate change 0aHimalaya1 aSheng, Yongwei1 aLiu, Qiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7285-54251 aLiu, Linshan1 aLiu, Shiyin1 aZhang, Yili1 aSong, Chunqiao0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2017 Feb., v. 189 p.1-13dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245013300207300001800340506007600358520173800434592002802172506003702200650001802237650001402255650001902269650001002288650002502298650002302323650001102346653001902357653002502376700001902401700002202420700002302442773017402465856007902639852000902718655001202727IND60173647320221207072114.0150603e20130430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017364732DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12195821102doi7 aPMC36455942pmcid7 a235898902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDittmar, John C.10aPhysical and genetic-interaction density reveals functional organization and informs significance cutoffs in genome-wide screens  ap. 7389-7394.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenome-wide experiments often measure quantitative differences between treated and untreated cells to identify affected strains. For these studies, statistical models are typically used to determine significance cutoffs. We developed a method termed “CLIK” (Cutoff Linked to Interaction Knowledge) that overlays biological knowledge from the interactome on screen results to derive a cutoff. The method takes advantage of the fact that groups of functionally related interacting genes often respond similarly to experimental conditions and, thus, cluster in a ranked list of screen results. We applied CLIK analysis to five screens of the yeast gene disruption library and found that it defined a significance cutoff that differed from traditional statistics. Importantly, verification experiments revealed that the CLIK cutoff correlated with the position in the rank order where the rate of true positives drops off significantly. In addition, the gene sets defined by CLIK analysis often provide further biological perspectives. For example, applying CLIK analysis retrospectively to a screen for cisplatin sensitivity allowed us to identify the importance of the Hrq1 helicase in DNA crosslink repair. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of CLIK to determine optimal treatment conditions by analyzing genome-wide screens at multiple rapamycin concentrations. We show that CLIK is an extremely useful tool for evaluating screen quality, determining screen cutoffs, and comparing results between screens. Furthermore, because CLIK uses previously annotated interaction data to determine biologically informed cutoffs, it provides additional insights into screen results, which supplement traditional statistical approaches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA helicases 3acisplatin 3agene targeting 3agenes 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3ayeasts 0abioinformatics 0afalse discovery rate1 aPierce, Steven1 aRothstein, Rodney1 aReid, Robert J.

Stomata arise from a median longitudinal division of sporophyte epidermal cells morphologically indistinguishable from their neighbours apart from the retention of a single chloroplast whilst those in the other epidermal cells fragment. Chloroplast division and side-by-side repositioning of the two daughter chloroplasts determines the division plane in the stomatal mother cell. The nascent guard cells contain giant, starch-filled chloroplasts which subsequently divide and, post aperture opening, regain their spherical shape. Accumulation of wall material over the guard cells and of wax rodlets lining the pores follows opening. While the majority of stomata are bilaterally symmetrical those lining the dehiscence furrows display dextral and sinistral asymmetry due to differential expansion of the adjacent epidermal cells. The ubiquity of open stomata suggests that these never close with the maturational wall changes rendering movement extremely unlikely. These structural limitations, a liquid-filled stage in the ontogeny of the intercellular spaces, and spores already at the tetrad stage when stomata open, suggest that their primary role is facilitating sporophyte desiccation leading to dehiscence and spore dispersal rather than gaseous exchange. Stomata ontogeny and very low densities, like those in Devonian fossils, suggest either ancient origins at a time when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were much greater than today or a function other than gaseous exchange regulation. We found no evidence for stomatal homology between hornworts, mosses and tracheophytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDevonian period 3aTracheophyta 3aasymmetry 3abryology 3acarbon dioxide 3achloroplasts 3adehiscence 3agas exchange 3aontogeny 3aspore dispersal 3asporophytes 0aAnthocerotophyta 0aCapsule dehiscence 0aDesiccation biology 0aGuard cells 0aStomatal evolution1 aGoral, Tomasz1 aDuckett, Jeffrey G.0 tJournal of bryology.g2014 June 1, v. 36, no. 2 p.87-103dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2030x1743-28207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1743282014Y.00000001033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245015400162300002000316520170100336592002802037650002302065650001502088650002002103650001602123650001102139650001302150650000902163650001902172650001802191650002102209650001702230650003302247650002502280650002502305653001302330653001702343653001502360653001802375653002302393653002502416653003502441700002202476773012602498856007502624852000902699655001202708IND60527688320221121111715.0160715e20140813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052768832DNAL7 a10.1021/am502819q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarzoha, Ronald
J.10aEffect of Graphene Layer Thickness and Mechanical Compliance on Interfacial Heat Flow and Thermal Conduction in Solid–Liquid Phase Change Materials  ap. 12868-12876.  aSolid–liquid phase change materials (PCMs) are attractive candidates for thermal energy storage and electronics cooling applications but have limited applicability in state-of-the-art technologies due to their low intrinsic thermal conductivities. Recent efforts to incorporate graphene and multilayer graphene into PCMs have led to the development of thermal energy storage materials with remarkable values of bulk thermal conductivity. However, the full potential of graphene as a filler material for the thermal enhancement of PCMs remains unrealized, largely due to an incomplete understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern thermal transport within graphene-based nanocomposites. In this work, we show that the number of graphene layers (n) within an individual graphene nanoparticle has a significant effect on the bulk thermal conductivity of an organic PCM. Results indicate that the bulk thermal conductivity of PCMs can be tuned by over an order of magnitude simply by adjusting the number of graphene layers (n) from n = 3 to 44. Using scanning electron microscopy in tandem with nanoscale analytical techniques, the physical mechanisms that govern heat flow within a graphene nanocomposite PCM are found to be nearly independent of the intrinsic thermal conductivity of the graphene nanoparticle itself and are instead found to be dependent on the mechanical compliance of the graphene nanoparticles. These findings are critical for the design and development of PCMs that are capable of cooling next-generation electronics and storing heat effectively in medium-to-large-scale energy systems, including solar–thermal power plants and building heating and cooling systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acompliance 3acooling systems 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aheat 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3apower plants 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolar thermal energy 3athermal conductivity 0agraphene 0alayer number 0acompliance 0ananocomposite 0athermal conduction 0athermal conductivity 0ainterfacial thermal resistance1 aFleischer, Amy S.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Aug. 13, v. 6, no. 15 p.12868-12876dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam502819q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014000167300001600307520105400323592002801377650002301405650002601428650002701454650002501481650001101506650001001517650002001527650001301547650002401560650002601584650001701610650001801627650001401645650001301659653001401672653001701686653002601703653003101729700002001760700001401780700001301794700001201807700001301819700001701832700001801849700001701867773013801884856008502022852000902107655001202116IND60527900920221120162909.0190416e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052790092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2016.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rongbo10aPsAAT3, an oomycete-specific aspartate aminotransferase, is required for full pathogenicity of the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae  ap. 620-630.  aPathogen nutrient acquisition and metabolism are critical for successful infection and colonization. However, the nutrient requirements and metabolic pathways related to pathogenesis in oomycete pathogens are unknown. In this study, we bioinformatically identified Phytophthora sojae aspartate aminotransferases (AATs), which are key enzymes that coordinate carbon and nitrogen metabolism. We demonstrated that P. sojae encodes more AATs than the analysed fungi. Some of the AATs contained additional prephenate dehydratase and/or prephenate dehydrogenase domains in their N-termini, which are unique to oomycetes. Silencing of PsAAT3, an infection-inducible expression gene, reduced P. sojae pathogenicity on soybean plants and affected the growth under N-starving condition, suggesting that PsAAT3 is involved in pathogen pathogenicity and nitrogen utilisation during infection. Our results suggest that P. sojae and other oomycete pathogens may have distinct amino acid metabolism pathways and that PsAAT3 is important for its full pathogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora sojae 3aamino acid metabolism 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3afungi 3agene expression 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3anutrient requirements 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3asoybeans 0aOomycetes 0aPhytophthora 0aAmino acid metabolism 0aAspartate aminotransferase1 aZhang, Meixiang1 aLiu, Hong1 aXu, Jing1 aYu, Jia1 aHe, Feng1 aZhang, Xiong1 aDong, Suomeng1 aDou, Daolong0 tFungal biology.g2016 Apr., v. 120, no. 4 p.620-630dElsevier LtdaThe British Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2016.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245013700206300001800343506007600361520162400437592002802061506003702089650002602126650001302152650001202165650002102177650002702198650001002225650001702235650002202252650002502274653001802299653001302317653002402330700002002354700001802374700002602392700001702418700001602435700002202451700001702473773017402490856007902664852000902743655001202752IND60173647420221207072113.0150603e20130430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017364742DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12195901102doi7 aPMC36455562pmcid7 a235898682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNývltová, Eva10aNIF-type iron-sulfur cluster assembly system is duplicated and distributed in the mitochondria and cytosol of Mastigamoeba balamuthi  ap. 7371-7376.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn most eukaryotes, the mitochondrion is the main organelle for the formation of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters. This function is mediated through the iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery, which was inherited from the α-proteobacterial ancestor of mitochondria. In Archamoebae, including pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica and free-living Mastigamoeba balamuthi , the complex iron-sulfur cluster machinery has been replaced by an ε-proteobacterial nitrogen fixation (NIF) system consisting of two components: NifS (cysteine desulfurase) and NifU (scaffold protein). However, the cellular localization of the NIF system and the involvement of mitochondria in archamoebal FeS assembly are controversial. Here, we show that the genes for both NIF components are duplicated within the M. balamuthi genome. One paralog of each protein contains an amino-terminal extension that targets proteins to mitochondria (NifS-M and NifU-M), and the second paralog lacks a targeting signal, thereby reflecting the cytosolic form of the NIF machinery (NifS-C and NifU-C). The dual localization of the NIF system corresponds to the presence of FeS proteins in both cellular compartments, including detectable hydrogenase activity in Mastigamoeba cytosol and mitochondria. In contrast, E. histolytica possesses only single genes encoding NifS and NifU, respectively, and there is no evidence for the presence of the NIF machinery in its reduced mitochondria. Thus, M. balamuthi is unique among eukaryotes in that its FeS cluster formation is mediated through two most likely independent NIF machineries present in two cellular compartments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3acysteine 3acytosol 3aeukaryotic cells 3aferredoxin hydrogenase 3agenes 3amitochondria 3anitrogen fixation 3ascaffolding proteins 0ahydrogenosome 0amitosome 0afree-living protist1 aŠuták, Robert1 aHarant, Karel1 aŠedinová, Miroslava1 aHrdý, Ivan,1 aPačes, Jan1 aVlček, Čestmír1 aTachezy, Jan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 30, v. 110, no. 18 p.7371-7376dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12195901103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011400157300002000271520138300291592002801674650001601702650003701718650001501755650001101770650001301781650001301794650000901807650001401816650001501830650001501845650001601860653001301876653001301889653001501902653002001917653002601937700001701963700002001980700001502000700001602015700001602031700001602047700001802063700001702081773012602098856007502224852000902299655001202308IND60527688520221122044236.0160715e20140813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052768852DNAL7 a10.1021/am502821d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuchao10aGradient FeOx(PO4)y Layer on Hematite Photoanodes: Novel Structure for Efficient Light-Driven Water Oxidation  ap. 12844-12851.  aHematite has been receiving increasing attention for its application in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation but usually exhibits poor efficiency. We fabricated a stable gradient-structured FeOₓ(PO₄)y layer on hematite by diffusively incorporating phosphate onto the surface layer of hematite films at a low temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profile and Fe K-edge grazing-incidence X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis demonstrated the formation of a ∼50 nm overlayer with a gradient phosphorus distribution and structural evolution from the outer surface to the depth. The as-prepared photoanodes showed highly improved PEC water oxidation performance. Up to 8.5-fold enhancement in the photocurrent density at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode was achieved relative to the pristine anode. This strategy is applicable for hematite photoanodes prepared by different methods and with different morphologies and structures. The improvement in the water oxidation activity is mainly attributed to the enhanced separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which is derived from the increased hole diffusion length in the gradient-structured overlayer. This work develops a simple and universal method to boost the PEC water oxidation efficiency with versatile hematite photoanodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aanodes 3ahematite 3ahydrogen 3airon 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3atemperature 0ahematite 0agradient 0aFeOx(PO4)y 0awater oxidation 0ahole diffusion length1 aZhou, Zichao1 aChen, Chuncheng1 aChe, Yanke1 aJi, Hongwei1 aMa, Wanhong1 aZhang, Jing1 aSong, Dongyan1 aZhao, Jincai0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Aug. 13, v. 6, no. 15 p.12844-12851dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam502821d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014700170300001200317520188900329592002802218650001502246650001502261650002102276650001002297650002002307650003302327650003402360650001202394650001402406650001702420653004602437653002002483653001802503653002302521653002502544653001802569653002702587653002802614700002002642700001802662700002902680773011202709856008602821852000902907655001202916IND60628701320221118101729.0200217e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062870132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZadehkafi, Ali10aSimple geometrical modifications for substantial color intensity and detection limit enhancements in lateral-flow immunochromatographic assays  ap. 1-8.  aOne of the ongoing challenges in lateral flow Immunochromatographic assays (LFIA), is lowering the limit of detection and enhancing their signal quality, i.e. the color intensity. There are a number of rather costly and complicated processes for this aim, such as the use of functionalized materials/membranes and additional spectroscopic readout units. Nonetheless, there are simple and easy to practice alternatives, to be uncovered by analyzing the essential parameters of immunological reactions. The color intensity of the test line is a function of analytes flow velocity and their reaction rate. Detection pad width and test line position impact the flow velocity and reaction rate kinetics, examined in this paper for the limit of detection (LOD) and test-line color intensity. Firstly, the impact of width on the LOD was examined for human chorionic gonadotropin (pregnancy biomarker). Test line color intensity was measured using five different widths of the detection pad (trapezoidal) and four different test line positions, and the trends observed were explained according to the measured evolution of the velocity along the chromatography paper. With a constant width absorbent pad, LOD was cut by half to 5 mIU/ml by using a narrowing width detection pad, which keeps the wicking velocity higher than normal strips, and compared to them, color intensity increase between 55 and 150%, depending on the concentration. Nevertheless, a widening detection pad might cut the color intensity up to 150%, compared to normal strips, due to a profound decline of the analyte to ligand ratio at the test line. In addition, adequately sending the test line away from the conjugate pad yields the highest possible color intensity, for up to 400% of increase, in lower concentrations and narrowing test pads. However, further distancing the test line downfalls the color intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3abiomarkers 3achemical species 3acolor 3adetection limit 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aligands 3apregnancy 3aspectroscopy 0aLateral flow immunochromatographic assays 0aColor intensity 0aPorous medium 0aLimit of detection 0aTrapezoidal geometry 0aDetection pad 0aTest line displacement 0aCapillary flow velocity1 aSiavashi, Majid1 aAsiaei, Sasan1 aBidgoli, Mostafa Rabbani0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 1110-1111 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014700171300001800318520143100336592002801767650002901795650003201824650002401856650002101880650001801901650001101919650001401930650002301944650002801967650002601995650003302021650001202054650002402066650001702090650001502107650002002122650002902142650001502171650002902186650001402215700003102229700002302260700002402283700001702307700002502324700001602349773011602365856008102481852000902562655001202571IND60119138420221122232422.0141203e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011913842DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-014-1227-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaratale, Ganesh D.10aCellulolytic Enzymes Production by Utilizing Agricultural Wastes Under Solid State Fermentation and its Application for Biohydrogen Production  ap. 2801-2817.  aPhanerochaete chrysosporium was evaluated for cellulase and hemicellulase production using various agricultural wastes under solid state fermentation. Optimization of various environmental factors, type of substrate, and medium composition was systematically investigated to maximize the production of enzyme complex. Using grass powder as a carbon substrate, maximum activities of endoglucanase (188.66 U/gds), exoglucanase (24.22 U/gds), cellobiase (244.60 U/gds), filter paperase (FPU) (30.22 U/gds), glucoamylase (505.0 U/gds), and xylanase (427.0 U/gds) were produced under optimized conditions. The produced crude enzyme complex was employed for hydrolysis of untreated and mild acid pretreated rice husk. The maximum amount of reducing sugar released from enzyme treated rice husk was 485 mg/g of the substrate. Finally, the hydrolysates of rice husk were used for hydrogen production by Clostridium beijerinckii. The maximum cumulative H₂production and H₂yield were 237.97 mL and 2.93 mmoL H₂/g of reducing sugar, (or 2.63 mmoL H₂/g of cellulose), respectively. Biohydrogen production performance obtained from this work is better than most of the reported results from relevant studies. The present study revealed the cost-effective process combining cellulolytic enzymes production under solid state fermentation (SSF) and the conversion of agro-industrial residues into renewable energy resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium beijerinckii 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aagricultural wastes 3abeta-glucosidase 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3acellulose 3acost effectiveness 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenvironmental factors 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3agrasses 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3areducing sugars 3arenewable energy sources 3arice hulls 3asolid state fermentation 3axylanases1 aKshirsagar, Siddheshwar D.1 aSampange, Vilas T.1 aSaratale, Rijuta G.1 aOh, Sang-Eun1 aGovindwar, Sanjay P.1 aOh, Min-Kyu0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2014 Dec., v. 174, no. 8 p.2801-2817dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-014-1227-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006700147245011800214300001600332520117700348592002801525650001301553650001901566650001501585650002001600650001101620650002501631651002801656651001101684653002801695653002201723653002301745653002901768653002001797653001601817653001101833700002701844700001701871700002201888700003101910700003201941700002101973700002101994773011102015856008102126852000902207655001202216IND60593345520221116141342.0180426e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059334552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2016.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez-Lorenzo, Arturo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7830-926810aTrends in downward surface solar radiation from satellites and ground observations over Europe during 1983–2010  ap. 108-117.  aTrends of all-sky downward surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite-derived data over Europe (1983–2010) are first presented. The results show a widespread (i.e., non-local dimension) increase in the major part of Europe, especially since the mid-1990s in the central and northern areas and in springtime. There is a mean increase of SSR of at least 2Wm⁻² per decade from 1983 to 2010 over the whole Europe, which, taking into account that the satellite-derived product lacks of aerosol variations, can be mostly related to a decrease in the cloud radiative effects over Europe. Secondly, residual series have been derived as the result of the difference between ground-based and satellite-derived all-sky SSR data. The residual mean series points to a significant increase during the period 1983–2010, with higher rates of around 2Wm⁻² per decade over central and eastern Europe. The spatial variation of these residual time series, which are in line with clear-sky SSR trends over Europe reported in the literature, seem to suggest that these differences in the residual series are not just explained by calibration issues in the satellite-derived product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3atime series analysis 3aEastern European region 3aEurope 0aSurface solar radiation 0aSatellite-derived 0aAll-sky irradiance 0aTemporal inhomogeneities 0aDecadal changes 0aBrightening 0aEurope1 aEnriquez-Alonso, Aaron1 aWild, Martin1 aTrentmann, Jörg,1 aVicente-Serrano, Sergio M.1 aSánchez Romero, Alejandro,1 aPosselt, Rebekka1 aHakuba, Maria Z.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2017 Feb., v. 189 p.108-117dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012600167300001600293500001900309520141100328592002801739650003601767650001501803650001701818650001501835650001801850650001201868650001401880650002601894650001901920650001101939650001501950650001601965650001301981650002401994650002202018650001802040650001002058650002902068653002902097653001702126653001802143653002702161653002802188700002902216700002302245700002102268700002402289773012602313856007802439852000902517655001202526IND60711938820221117224653.0200928s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071193882DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2019-04522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchweiger, Anna K.10aFoliar sampling with an unmanned aerial system (UAS) reveals spectral and functional trait differences within tree crowns  ap. 966-974.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImaging spectroscopy is currently the best approach for continuously mapping forest canopy traits, which is important for ecosystem and biodiversity assessments. Ideally, models are trained with trait data from fully sunlit leaves from the top of the canopy. However, sampling leaves at the top of the canopy is often difficult, and sunlit foliage from the crown periphery is collected instead, assuming minimal within-crown trait variation among sunlit leaves. We tested the degree to which crown position affects foliar traits and spectra using mixed-effects models comparing sun leaves from the crown centre of mature sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) trees collected with DeLeaves, a novel twig-sampling unmanned aerial system device, with sun leaves from the crown periphery collected with a pole pruner. Sun leaves from the crown centre differed from sun leaves from the crown periphery in absorption, reflectance, transmittance, and a series of foliar traits, including leaf thickness, leaf mass, and leaf nitrogen content per unit area, demonstrating differences in resource allocation depending on sun exposure. Our study highlights the importance of accurately matching the location of foliar samples and spectral data and of sampling across gradients of intra-individual variation for the accurate prediction of foliar trait distributions across and within canopies using imaging spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3aabsorption 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3aleaf mass 3aleaf nitrogen content 3aleaf thickness 3aleaves 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aresearch 3aresource allocation 3aspectral analysis 3atransmittance 3atrees 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0afunctional trait mapping 0aspectroscopy 0atwig sampling 0aunmanned aerial system 0aunmanned aerial vehicle1 aLussier Desbiens, Alexis1 aCharron, Guillaume1 aLa Vigne, Hughes1 aLaliberté, Etienne0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2020, v. 50, no. 10 p.966-974dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2019-04523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04037naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008900167300001800256520191400274592002802188650001302216650002102229650001402250650001202264650001402276650001002290650001302300650001602313650001502329650002402344650003002368650002502398650001302423650001002436700001602446700002002462700002202482700001802504700001702522700001602539700001902555700001702574700001502591700001902606700001802625700002002643700002302663700002202686700001602708700001602724700001902740700002102759700001902780700001902799700002302818700002502841700001802866700001702884700002902901700002302930700002602953700002702979700006703006773013903073856008203212852000903294655001203303IND60746957320221120084842.0211027e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074695732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-021-01796-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Kalpana10aWheatQTLdb: a QTL database for wheat [Erratum: November 2021, v.296(6), p.1359-1360]  ap. 1051-1056.  aDuring the last three decades, QTL analysis in wheat has been conducted for a variety of individual traits, so that thousands of QTL along with the linked markers, their genetic positions and contribution to phenotypic variation (PV) for concerned traits are now known. However, no exhaustive database for wheat QTL is currently available at a single platform. Therefore, the present database was prepared which is an exhaustive information resource for wheat QTL data from the published literature till May, 2020. QTL data from both interval mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been included for the following classes of traits: (i) morphological traits, (ii) N and P use efficiency, (iii) traits for biofortification (Fe, K, Se, and Zn contents), (iv) tolerance to abiotic stresses including drought, water logging, heat stress, pre-harvest sprouting and salinity, (v) resistance to biotic stresses including those due to bacterial, fungal, nematode and insects, (vi) quality traits, and (vii) a variety of physiological traits, (viii) developmental traits, and (ix) yield and its related traits. For the preparation of the database, literature was searched for data on QTL/marker-trait associations (MTAs), curated and then assembled in the form of WheatQTLdb. The available information on metaQTL, epistatic QTL and candidate genes, wherever available, is also included in the database. Information on QTL in this WheatQTLdb includes QTL names, traits, associated markers, parental genotypes, crosses/mapping populations, association mapping panels and other useful information. To our knowledge, WheatQTLdb prepared by us is the largest collection of QTL (11,552), epistatic QTL (107) and metaQTL (330) data for hexaploid wheat to be used by geneticists and plant breeders for further studies involving fine mapping, cloning, and marker-assisted selection (MAS) during wheat breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3abiofortification 3adatabases 3adrought 3aepistasis 3afungi 3agenomics 3aheat stress 3ahexaploidy 3ainformation sources 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotypic variation 3asalinity 3awheat1 aBatra, Ritu1 aSharma, Shiveta1 aSaripalli, Gautam1 aGautam, Tinku1 aSingh, Rakhi1 aPal, Sunita1 aMalik, Parveen1 aKumar, Manoj1 aJan, Irfat1 aSingh, Sahadev1 aKumar, Deepak1 aPundir, Saksham1 aChaturvedi, Deepti1 aVarmā, Añjalī,1 aRani, Anshu1 aKumar, Anuj1 aSharma, Hemant1 aChaudhary, Jyoti1 aKumar, Kuldeep1 aKumar, Sourabh1 aSingh, Vikas Kumar1 aSingh, Vivudh Pratap1 aKumar, Sachin1 aRahul Kumar,1 aGaurav, Shailendra Singh1 aSharma, Shailendra1 aSharma, Pradeep Kumar1 aBalyan, Harindra Singh1 aGupta, Pushpendra Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7638-61710 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2021 Sept., v. 296, no. 5 p.1051-1056dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl69781x1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-021-01796-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245007500194300001500269520111800284592002801402650001901430650002901449650002401478650001401502650002201516650002101538650001801559650002801577650002301605650001901628650001301647650001701660650002101677650001801698700002001716700002001736700001901756700001901775700001601794700002101810700001901831700002201850700002001872773015201892856006902044856010702113990002302220852000902243655001202252IND60643867620221118022657.0190514e20160108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064386762DNAL7 a10.3791/536312doi7 aPMC47813202pmcid7 a267802442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCantu, Travis10aElectroactive polymer nanoparticles exhibiting photothermal properties  ap. e53631.  aA method for the synthesis of electroactive polymers is demonstrated, starting with the synthesis of extended conjugation monomers using a three-step process that finishes with Negishi coupling. Negishi coupling is a cross-coupling process in which a chemical precursor is first lithiated, followed by transmetallation with ZnCl2. The resultant organozinc compound can be coupled to a dibrominated aromatic precursor to give the conjugated monomer. Polymer films can be prepared via electropolymerization of the monomer and characterized using cyclic voltammetry and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. Nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared via emulsion polymerization of the monomer using a two-surfactant system to yield an aqueous dispersion of the polymer NPs. The NPs are characterized using dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and UV-Vis-NIR-spectroscopy. Cytocompatibility of NPs is investigated using the cell viability assay. Finally, the NP suspensions are irradiated with a NIR laser to determine their effectiveness as potential materials for photothermal therapy (PTT).  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3across-coupling reactions 3aelectron microscopy 3aemulsions 3afilms (materials) 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles 3anear infrared radiation 3aphotothermotherapy 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aspectroscopy 3aviability assays 3azinc chloride1 aRodier, Bradley1 aIszard, Zachary1 aKilian, Alissa1 aPattani, Varun1 aWalsh, Kyle1 aWeber, Katharina1 aTunnell, James1 aBetancourt, Tania1 aIrvin, Jennifer0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Jan. 08, , no. 107 p.e53631-e53631dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/536313Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53631/electroactive-polymer-nanoparticles-exhibiting-photothermal-properties  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04262naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011700184300001600301520245700317592002802774650001302802650001102815650000902826650002602835650001102861650002602872650002002898650001302918650000902931650001002940650001402950650002202964650002102986650000903007650002503016650001203041650002103053650003703074650003703111650003403148650004203182650001503224650002403239650001903263651001203282651002203294651001203316700002003328700001603348700001803364700002103382700002403403773013003427856008203557852000903639655001203648IND4486937420221118152145.0201220e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448693742DNAL7 a214557062pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-011-9032-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeyrem, Hamouda10aLaboratory Study on Individual and Combined Effects of Cobalt- and Zinc-Spiked Sediment on Meiobenthic Nematodes  ap. 790-803.  aFree-living nematodes are the most abundant taxa among the meiobenthos and the predominant prey for bottom-feeding fishes. They are able to accumulate toxicants from sediments which explain their use in this study as possible tools in nutritional quality assessment of fishes. Nematodes from sediments of Ghar El Melh lagoon (Tunisia) were subjected to cobalt and/or zinc enrichment in a microcosm experiment for 30 days. Three levels (low, medium, and high) of each treatment were used. Nematode abundance and diversity significantly decreased, and the taxonomic structure was altered. Results from multivariate analyses of the species abundance data revealed that all treatments were significantly different from the control. Both univariate and multivariate analyses of the data showed that the differential response occurred in all treatments, but the assemblages from microcosms contaminated with zinc alone were much more negatively affected compared with those exposed to cobalt alone. The presence of cobalt simultaneously with zinc seems to reduce its impact on nematode species composition. Such a result is suggestive of antagonistic interactions between these two metals. The responses of nematode species to the cobalt and zinc treatments were varied. Oncholaimellus mediterraneus, Oncholaimus campylocercoides, and Neochromadora trichophora were significantly affected with cobalt contamination but, they were not eliminated. Exposed to zinc, Hypodontolaimus colesi was eliminated and seemed to be an intolerant species versus this metal. Some of these species, “cobalt-sensitive” or “zinc-sensitive”, were also affected by the metal combination even at low dose: O. mediterraneus, N. trichophora, and H. colesi. Differential sensitivity to cobalt and/or zinc may result in a subsequent competitive release of more tolerant species. A list of this kind of species was established to be used as a possible preventive tool versus contaminated fish. This was most evidently the case in Marylynnia stekhoveni and O. campylocercoides which increased at all doses of cobalt and zinc, respectively. These two resistant species have also the opportunity to dominate the nematode assemblage when the studied metals were added together. The level of health risk is probably higher for humans assimilating additional amount of cobalt and zinc, especially heavy smokers and/or patients using some medications including salts of these metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3acobalt 3afish 3afree-living nematodes 3ahumans 3amultivariate analysis 3anutritive value 3apatients 3arisk 3asalts 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3atoxic substances 3azinc 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCobaltxtoxicity 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aNematodaxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aPopulation 2aSpecies Specificity 2aZincxtoxicity 3aTunisia 0aMediterranean Sea 0aTunisia1 aBoufahja, Fehmi1 aHedfi, Amor1 aEssid, Naceur1 aAïssa, Patricia1 aMahmoudi, Ezzeddine0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 Dec., v. 144, no. 1-3 p.790-803dHumana Press IncwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-011-9032-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012400165300001800289520145900307592002801766596006301794596006301857650001201920650000901932650001501941650001001956650001301966650001701979650001701996650000902013650002002022650001402042650002502056650001902081650002102100650002402121650001402145700001402159700001402173700002102187700001802208700002502226700001902251700001702270700005402287773013902341856008302480852000902563655001202572IND60746957420221120095527.0211027e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074695742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-021-01800-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Fengxia10aGenetic dissection of maize seedling traits in an IBM Syn10 DH population under the combined stress of lead and cadmium  ap. 1057-1070.  aThe heavy metals lead and cadmium have become important pollutants in the environment, which exert negative effects on plant morphology, growth and photosynthesis. It is particularly significant to uncover the genetic loci and the causal genes for lead and cadmium tolerance in plants. This study used an IBM Syn10 DH population to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling maize seedling tolerance to lead and cadmium by linkage mapping. The broad-sense heritability of these seedling traits ranged from 65.8–97.3% and 32.0–98.8% under control (CK) and treatment (T) conditions, respectively. A total of 53 and 64 QTL were detected under CK and T conditions, respectively. Moreover, 42 QTL were identified using lead and cadmium tolerance coefficient (LCTC). Among these QTL, five and two major QTL that explained > 10% of phenotypic variation were identified under T condition and using LCTC, respectively. Furthermore, eight QTL were simultaneously identified by T and LCTC, explaining 5.23% to 9.21% of the phenotypic variations. Within these major and common QTL responsible for the combined heavy metal tolerance, four candidate genes (Zm00001d048759, Zm00001d004689, Zm00001d004843, Zm00001d033527) were previously reported to correlate with heavy metal transport and tolerance. These findings will contribute to functional gene identification and molecular marker-assisted breeding for improving heavy metal tolerance in maize.  aPublisher supplied data  a31871637cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a32001500cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3acadmium 3acorn 3adissection 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheavy metals 3aheritability 3alead 3ametal tolerance 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant morphology 3aquantitative traits 3aseedlings1 aZhou, Xun1 aLiu, Peng1 aYuan, Guangsheng1 aZou, Chaoying1 aLübberstedt, Thomas1 aPan, Guangtang1 aMa, Langlang1 aShen, Yaou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7603-01080 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2021 Sept., v. 296, no. 5 p.1057-1070dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl69781x1617-46157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-021-01800-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005700167300001800224500001500242520122200257592002801479650001401507650001301521650001601534650001701550650001301567650001801580650002701598650001201625650001501637650001301652650001501665653001001680700002701690700001901717773011601736856008101852852000901933655001201942IND60119138620221122092751.0141203e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011913862DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-014-1229-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshok, Vaishali10aNutrient Removal Using Algal-Bacterial Mixed Culture  ap. 2827-2838.  a2019-12-04  aSimultaneous nitrate (N), phosphate (P), and COD removal was investigated in photobioreactors containing both algae and bacteria. The reactors were operated in the semi-batch mode with a hydraulic retention time of 2 days. Reactors were operated in two phases, (1) with 33 % biomass recycle and (2) with no biomass recycle. In both phases, more than 90 % of N and P and 80 % of COD present in synthetic wastewaters with initial N and P concentrations of up to 110 and 25 mg/L, respectively, and initial COD of 45 mg/L could be removed. Biomass growth in reactors did not increase with the increase in initial N and P concentration in either phase. However, biomass growth was slightly more in reactors operated with no biomass recycle. In both phases, N and P uptake was greater in reactors with greater initial N and P concentrations. Also in all cases, N and P uptake in the reactors was far in excess of the stoichiometric requirements for the observed biomass growth. This “luxury uptake” of nitrogen and phosphorus by biomass was responsible for excellent nitrogen and phosphorus removal as observed. However, based on the results of this study, no advantage of biomass recycling could be demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3arecycling 3anitrogen 3abioreactors 3abiochemistry 3anitrates 3amixed culture 3achemical oxygen demand 3abiomass 3awastewater 3abacteria 3aphosphorus 0aAlgae1 aShriwastav, Amritanshu1 aBose, Purnendu0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2014 Dec., v. 174, no. 8 p.2827-2838dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-014-1229-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011300164300001600277520128900293592002801582650002201610650001901632650001601651650002601667650001401693650002401707650001101731650002001742650001601762700002401778700002001802700002001822700001901842700002001861773012201881856007502003852000902078655001202087IND60534692220221118032431.0160803e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053469222DNAL7 a10.1021/es301126f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTodd Schaef, Herbert10aForsterite [Mg2SiO4)] Carbonation in Wet Supercritical CO2: An in Situ High-Pressure X-ray Diffraction Study  ap. 174-181.  aMechanisms controlling mineral stabilities in contact with injected supercritical fluids containing water are relatively unknown. In this paper, we discuss carbonation reactions occurring with forsterite (Mg₂SiO₄) exposed to variably wet supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂). Transformation reactions were tracked by in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction in the presence of scCO₂ containing dissolved water. Under modest pressures (90 bar) and temperatures (50 °C), scCO₂ saturated with water converted >70 wt % forsterite to a hydrated magnesium carbonate, nesquehonite (MgCO₃·3H₂O), and magnesite (MgCO₃) after 72 h. However, comparable tests with scCO₂ at only partial water saturation showed a faster carbonation rate but significantly less nesquehonite formation and no evidence of the anhydrous form (MgCO₃). The presence and properties of a thin water film, observed by in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and with isotopically labeled oxygen (¹⁸O), appears to be critical for this silicate mineral to carbonate in low water environments. The carbonation products formed demonstrated by temperature and water-content dependence highlights the importance of these kinds of studies to enable better predictions of the long-term fate of geologically stored CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amagnesite 3amagnesium carbonate 3aoxygen 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aMcGrail, Bernard P.1 aLoring, John L.1 aBowden, Mark E.1 aArey, Bruce W.1 aRosso, Kevin M.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Jan. 02, v. 47, no. 1 p.174-181dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes301126f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03911naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245016700185300001600352520183500368592002802203650001902231650002902250650001302279650001402292650001202306650001102318650001002329650001302339650003902352650002002391650002002411650001202431650001202443650001902455650001002474650002502484650001702509650002602526650001302552650001802565650002802583650002902611650002402640650001702664650003302681650001802714650002502732650005802757650004602815650002002861650002402881650007402905650003802979700001803017700002203035700002203057773011303079856004803192852000903240655001203249IND4473893320221118002014.0121003e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447389332DNAL7 a217208232pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3431-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Vishist K.10aEffect of alternative NAD+-regenerating pathways on the formation of primary and secondary aroma compounds in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycerol-defective mutant  ap. 131-141.  aSaccharomyces cerevisiae maintains a redox balance under fermentative growth conditions by re-oxidizing NADH formed during glycolysis through ethanol formation. Excess NADH stimulates the synthesis of mainly glycerol, but also of other compounds. Here, we investigated the production of primary and secondary metabolites in S. cerevisiae strains where the glycerol production pathway was inactivated through deletion of the two glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases genes (GPD1/GPD2) and replaced with alternative NAD+-generating pathways. While these modifications decreased fermentative ability compared to the wild-type strain, all improved growth and/or fermentative ability of the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain in self-generated anaerobic high sugar medium. The partial NAD+ regeneration ability of the mutants resulted in significant amounts of alternative products, but at lower yields than glycerol. Compared to the wild-type strain, pyruvate production increased in most genetically manipulated strains, whereas acetate and succinate production decreased in all strains. Malate production was similar in all strains. Isobutanol production increased substantially in all genetically manipulated strains compared to the wild-type strain, whereas only mutant strains expressing the sorbitol producing SOR1 and srlD genes showed increases in isoamyl alcohol and 2-phenyl alcohol. A marked reduction in ethyl acetate concentration was observed in the genetically manipulated strains, while isobutyric acid increased. The synthesis of some primary and secondary metabolites appears more readily influenced by the NAD+/NADH availability. The data provide an initial assessment of the impact of redox balance on the production of primary and secondary metabolites which play an essential role in the flavour and aroma character of beverages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetates 3abeverages 3aethanol 3aflavor 3agenes 3aglycerol 3aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aisoamyl alcohol 3aisobutyric acid 3amalates 3amutants 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aprimary productivity 3apyruvic acid 3asecondary metabolites 3asorbitol 3asuccinic acid 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aFlavoring Agentsxmetabolism 2aGene Deletion 2aGlycerolxmetabolism 2aGlycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (NAD+)xdeficiency 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathwaysxgenetics 2aNADxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins1 aDivol, Benoit1 aPrior, Bernard A.1 aBauer, Florian F.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.131-141dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3431-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011000167300001600277520109900293592002801392650001101420650003001431650002701461650001501488650001501503650001801518650001801536650001601554650002001570653002201590653001401612653002101626653001801647653001901665700002001684773011301704856008301817852000901900655001201909IND60547059120221120060956.0170607e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054705912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Min-Kyu10aImprovement of residuals treatment efficiency from water treatment plant by auto supernatant drain system  ap. 202-208.  aRecently, a novel system with high efficiency has been developed to drain only supernatant of residuals effectively from water treatment plant, which results in high removal efficiency in water treatment by enhancing the quality of residuals and recycling water. The system could positively cope with the variation of water quality by a monitoring device. It was also operated automatically by an auto-control program. The purpose of the present investigation is to evaluate the treatment efficiency of an auto supernatant drain system (ASDS) in treating the residuals from water treatment plant by operating pilot tests as well as column tests. The ASDS improved BOD of the water flowing into the residuals basin by 40.6% and that of the water flowing into the thickener by 90.8%. The improvement effect of COD by the system were 26.7% and 83.9% for the recycled water and the effluent, respectively. The system also improved 1.62 mgL−1 and 0.17 mgL−1 in terms of the mean TN and TP, respectively. The ASDS improved 4.56% of the mean moisture content and 87.3% of the mean recovery rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3amonitoring 3athickeners 3awater content 3awater quality 3awater reuse 3awater treatment 0aSupernatant drain 0aResiduals 0aMoisture content 0aRecovery rate 0aDewatered cake1 aKwon, Dae-Young0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2015 Aug., v. 102 p.202-208dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009800174300001400272500001900286520096100305592002801266650001301294650001401307650001501321653000901336653001101345653001201356653001401368653001501382700002301397773011001420856008601530852000901616655001201625IND60695824620221120024151.0200519e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069582462DNAL7 a10.1179/1743282014Y.00000001162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Leonard T.10aReview of the type specimens of species described by J.

The design of the photomicroreactor, the choice of photocatalysts and the techniques for assembling the catalysts in such confined spaces are crucial elements. Lignin, a predominant industrial byproduct and pollutant, has been recognized today as a rich reservoir for aromatic chemicals and a prominent resource. The conventional batch photocatalytic studies on lignin, often using dissolved lignin under alkaline conditions, often generates a wide range of valuable organic chemicals which find applications in the pharmaceutical, food processing, cosmetic and fine chemical industries. The role of photocatalysis in such lignin depolymerizations is questionable as the dissolution procedure initiates fragmentation of lignin prior to light exposure. The complexity of the lignin structure also impedes necessary and decisive information to understand the reaction mechanism during such reactions in batch photoreactors. Considering these facts, photocatalysis studies on lignin entail a thoughtful reevaluation and focus on understanding the role of photocatalysis in the product generation and authenticating the implicated reaction mechanisms. The development of a photocatalytic system for lignin depolymerization in a continuous microreactor is a superior approach for the generation of valuable products emanating from lignin depolymerization and the successful execution of such strategies can pave the way for the commercialization of bio-based chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical industry 3acommercialization 3adepolymerization 3afood processing 3aindustrial byproducts 3alignin 3ananomaterials 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3areaction mechanisms 3avalue added1 aVarma, Rajender S.1 aNair, Vaishakh0 tChemical Society reviews.g2017 Nov. 13, v. 46, no. 22 p.6675-6686dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7cs00257b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245006900196300001500265520082300280592002801103650001401131650002801145650002501173650002901198650001201227650002601239773015201265856006901417856010101486990002301587852000901610655001201619IND60643867720221118022820.0190514e20160214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064386772DNAL7 a10.3791/536322doi7 aPMC48281592pmcid7 a269667862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Clement M.10aIdentification of kinesin-1 cargos using fluorescence microscopy  ap. e53632.  aFluorescence microscopy is employed to identify Kinesin-1 cargos. Recently, the heavy chain of Kinesin-1 (KIF5B) was shown to transport the nuclear transcription factor c-MYC for proteosomal degradation in the cytoplasm. The method described here involves the study of a motorless KIF5B mutant for fluorescence microscopy. The wild-type and motorless KIF5B proteins are tagged with the fluorescent protein tdTomato. The wild-type tdTomato-KIF5B appears homogenously in the cytoplasm, while the motorless tdTomato-KIF5B mutant forms aggregates in the cytoplasm. Aggregation of the motorless KIF5B mutant induces aggregation of its cargo c-MYC in the cytoplasm. Hence, this method provides a visual means to identify the cargos of Kinesin-1. A similar strategy can be utilized to identify cargos of other motor proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasm 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent proteins 3amolecular motor proteins 3amutants 3atranscription factors0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Feb. 14, , no. 108 p.e53632-e53632dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/536323Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53632/identification-of-kinesin-1-cargos-using-fluorescence-microscopy  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245018500215300001600400506007600416520183100492592002802323506003702351650002402388650001302412650001602425650001902441650002002460650001502480650001502495650002002510650001502530650002002545650001802565650002902583650004402612700002102656700002002677700002002697700002602717700002002743700001902763773011102782856008602893852000902979655001202988IND60628701720221207140547.0190202e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062870172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.12.0092doi7 aPMC63584172pmcid7 a306110782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKartavenka, Kostya10aQuantification of malondialdehyde in exhaled breath condensate using pseudo two-dimensional ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with single quadrupole mass spectrometry  ap. 210-216.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe developed a robust analytical method for quantification of malondialdehyde (MDA) in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) via derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). The target MDA-DNPH hydrazone was separated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography using two reversed-phase analytical columns (C18 and phenyl-hexyl) inter-connected via a two-position, six-port switching valve to a single-quadrupole mass spectrometer. The target derivative was analyzed under positive electrospray ionization using single ion monitoring mode (m/z = 235 for the target derivative, and m/z = 237 for its labeled isotopic analog). This pseudo two-dimensional chromatographic separation provided optimum separation conditions for the target derivative resulting in the limit of detection of 0.58 nM in EBC sample (or 36.2 pmol on-column amount), which is comparable to those reported previously using different techniques, including tandem mass spectrometry. Based on the calibration solutions, the method had a linear quantification range of 1.0–200 nM (r2 = 0.998). The method showed good relative recoveries (92.2–102.0%) and acceptable precisions (3.6–12.2% for inter-day precision, and 4.3–12.4% for intra-day precision for two quality control levels, prepared from 5 nM and 25 nM solutions). The derivative was found to be stable at room temperature for 48 h or during analysis. The method was used to analyze 205 exhaled breath condensate samples collected from individuals from a healthy population of student athletes. MDA was detected in approximately 95% of these samples, with concentrations ranging from 1.16 to 149.63 nM. The median concentration was 6.82 nM, (IQR 4.08–9.88). These data demonstrate that our method can be successfully used to measure MDA in population studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aambient temperature 3aathletes 3acondensates 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3ahydrazones 3aionization 3amalondialdehyde 3amonitoring 3aquality control 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aPanuwet, Parinya1 aGreenwald, Roby1 aEhret, Karen M.1 aD'Souza, Priya Esilda1 aBarr, Dana Boyd1 aRyan, P.

PCBs were present in the cell culture medium (60.7–88.8%), cells (8.0–14.6%), and dishes (2.3–7.8%) and displayed atropisomeric enrichment in the cells (enantiomeric fraction [EF] = 0.55–0.77) and dishes (EF = 0.53–0.68). Polyparameter linear free energy relationships coupled with a composition-based model provided a good estimate of the PCB levels in the cells and cell culture medium. The free concentration was subsequently used to extrapolate from the nominal cell culture concentration to PCB tissue levels and vice versa. This approach can be used for in vitro–in vivo extrapolations for all 209 PCB congeners. However, this model (and modified models based on descriptors incorporating atropselective interactions, i.e., relative retention times on chiral columns) did not predict the atropselective partitioning in the cell culture system. Improved chemical descriptors that account for the atropselective binding of PCBs to biological macromolecules are, therefore, needed to predict the atropselective partitioning of PCBs in biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acell culture 3aculture media 3aenvironmental science 3ahuman cell lines 3amodels 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3atechnology 3atoxicity1 aFlor, Susanne1 aLudewig, Gabriele1 aLehmler, Hans-Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9163-927X0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 54, no. 21 p.13817-13827dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c025083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011100160300001800271500001900289520173500308592002802043650002202071650001502093650001802108650001402126650001502140650002302155650001502178650001702193650001402210650001502224650001602239650001302255651001702268653001302285653001302298700002302311700002502334700002002359773013902379856007402518852000902592655001202601IND60730622320221120113928.0210311e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073062232DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/nvaa1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoco, Angela M.10aParasitoids, Nematodes, and Protists in Populations of Striped Cucumber Beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)  ap. 1316-1326.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum (Fabricius), is an important pest of cucurbit production in the eastern United States, where most commercial producers rely on insecticides to control this pest species. Biological control provides an alternative to insecticide use, but for A. vittatum, top-down control has not been well developed. In the northeastern United States, two parasitoid species, Celatoria setosa (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tachinidae) and Centistes diabroticae (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) have been reported from A. vittatum, but their distribution is poorly known. To determine whether these parasitoid species are attacking A. vittatum in Pennsylvania and the amount of mortality they provide, we characterized the parasitoid dynamics in two distinct efforts. First, we reared parasitoids from beetles captured at two research farms. Second, we focused on one of these farms and dissected beetles to quantify both parasitoid and parasite species attacking A. vittatum. Both efforts confirmed Cl. setosa and Cn. diabroticae, and parasitism rates varied widely between locations and among years (4–60%). Unexpectedly, our dissections revealed that a potentially undescribed nematode species (Howardula sp.) as the most common parasite in the community. We also discovered gregarine protists. Despite being smaller than females, males were more commonly attacked by parasitic species, but we detected no relationship between the size of beetles and abundance of parasitic species in A. vittatum. This work provides a baseline understanding of the parasitoid and parasite community attacking A. vittatum and advances opportunities for conservation biological control using these natural-enemy species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcalymma vittatum 3aBraconidae 3aCucurbitaceae 3aHowardula 3aTachinidae 3abiological control 3aentomology 3ainsecticides 3amortality 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aprotists 3aPennsylvania 0acucurbit 0aparasite1 aLewis, Margaret T.1 aFleischer, Shelby J.1 aTooker, John F.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2020 Sept. 29, v. 49, no. 6 p.1316-1326dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3243x0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaa1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245016300203300002000366520162200386592002802008650003002036650001302066650002002079650001202099650001602111650003002127650001402157650002302171650001802194650001902212650001102231650001802242651001502260651001102275700005802286700005702344700006102401700002402462700006402486700005702550700006102607773014302668856008002811852000902891655001202900IND60715772420210927000000.0210927e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071577242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c025672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulin, Chloé1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7514-585110aWhat Environmental Factors Influence the Concentration of Fecal Indicator Bacteria in Groundwater? Insights from Explanatory Modeling in Uganda and Bangladesh  ap. 13566-13578.  aInformation about microbial water quality is critical for managing water safety and protecting public health. In low-income countries, monitoring all drinking water supplies is impractical because financial resources and capacity are insufficient. Data sets derived from satellite imagery, census, and hydrological models provide an opportunity to examine relationships between a suite of environmental risk factors and microbial water quality over large geographical scales. We investigated the relationships between groundwater fecal contamination and different environmental parameters in Uganda and Bangladesh. In Uganda, groundwater contamination was associated with high population density (p < 0.001; OR = 1.27), high cropland coverage (p < 0.001; OR = 1.47), high average monthly precipitation (p < 0.001; OR = 1.14), and high surface runoff (p < 0.001; OR = 1.37), while low groundwater contamination was more likely in areas further from cities (p < 0.001; OR = 0.66) and with higher forest coverage (p < 0.001; OR = 0.70). In Bangladesh, contamination was associated with higher weekly precipitation (p < 0.001; OR = 1.44) and higher livestock density (p = 0.05; OR = 1.11), while low contamination was associated with low forest coverage (p < 0.001; OR = 1.23) and high cropland coverage (p < 0.001; OR = 0.80). We developed a groundwater contamination index for each country to help decision-makers identify areas where groundwater is most prone to fecal contamination and prioritize monitoring activities. Our approach demonstrates how to harness satellite-derived data to guide water safety management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acropland 3adecision making 3aforests 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3alivestock 3apopulation density 3apublic health 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3awater quality 3aBangladesh 3aUganda1 aPeletz, Rachel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9256-08001 aErcumen, Ayse1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6002-15141 aPickering, Amy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6193-22211 aMarshall, Katherine1 aBoehm, Alexandria B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8162-50901 aKhush, Ranjiv1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2474-11911 aDelaire, Caroline1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8359-68470 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Sept. 25, v. 54, no. 21 p.13566-13578dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c025673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245014400171300002200315520179500337592002802132650002602160650001502186650002802201650001202229650001702241650001402258650003202272650002102304650001902325650001402344650001902358650001202377650001202389650001202401700001702413700003302430700001802463700003002481700002702511700003202538773012702570856007402697852000902771655001202780IND60641291620221121050920.0190505e20161021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064129162DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21730c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTacias-Pascacio, Veymar G.10aEvaluation of different commercial hydrophobic supports for the immobilization of lipases: tuning their stability, activity and specificity  ap. 100281-100294.  aFive different commercial supports (Lifetech™ ECR1061M (styrene/methacrylic polymer), Lifetech™ ECR8804M (octadecyl methacrylate), Lifetech™ ECR8806M (octadecyl methacylate), Lifetech™ ECR1090M (styrene) and Lifetech™ ECR1030M (DVB/methacrylic polymer)) were compared to octyl agarose in their performance in the immobilization of four different lipases (from Rhizomucor miehie (RML), from Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) and the forms A and B from Candida antarctica, (CALA and CALB)) and of the phospholipase Lecitase Ultra™ (LU). The new enzymatic derivatives were evaluated and compared with the commercial biocatalyst (Novozym 435 (CALB), Lipozyme RM IM and Lipozyme TL IM). Textural properties, loading capacity, enzyme stability under different conditions, and activity versus different substrates were analyzed. Although all of the supports reversibly immobilized lipases via interfacial activation of lipases versus the hydrophobic surface of the support, some of them permitted a significant improvement in the final biocatalyst compared to the reference support or the commercial preparations. Enzyme specificity depended strongly on the used support (e.g., the new ones gave almost null activity versus p-nitrophenyl butyrate). However, there is not a universal optimal support; the “best” support depends on the enzyme, the parameter studied and the substrate utilized. Nevertheless, under the conditions utilized, the preparations showed a very good performance in a diversity of reactions and permitted their reuse (both the biocatalyst and the supports after eliminating the enzyme by washing the enzyme with triton X-100). These supports will permit enlarging the library of immobilized lipase biocatalyst, being supports useful for aqueous or organic medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aRhizomucor 3aThermomyces lanuginosus 3aagarose 3abiocatalysts 3abutyrates 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aenzyme stability 3ahydrophobicity 3aoctoxynol 3aphospholipases 3astyrene 3atexture 3awashing1 aPeirce, Sara1 aTorrestiana-Sanchez, Beatriz1 aYates, Malcon1 aRosales-Quintero, Arnulfo1 aVirgen-Ortíz, Jose J.1 aFernandez-Lafuente, Roberto0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 21, v. 6, no. 102 p.100281-100294dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21730c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011200160300002000272520122000292592002801512650001101540650001401551650002601565650001201591650001301603650001401616650001401630650001301644650001401657653003101671653002101702653001101723653001301734653003201747700001701779700001401796700001801810700001901828700005501847773014201902856007902044852000902123655001202132IND60759326720221117222013.0211208e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075932672DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c178082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xingyu10aStrategies for Perfect Confinement of POM@MOF and Its Applications in Producing Defect-Rich Electrocatalyst  ap. 57803-57813.  aPolyoxometalate encapsulated by metal–organic framework (POM@MOF) hybrid is an ideal precursor for electrocatalysts because it provides a homogeneous catalyst system with a flexible synergistic effect. However, controlling its fine structures to activate the derived catalyst after pyrolysis remains a challenge. The uniformly distributed carbon-defect tungsten oxides on the 3D carbon matrix were synthesized by using phospho-tungstic acid confined in HKUST-1 (PA@HKUST-1) as the precursor. By choosing ethanol as the solvent, the framework of PA@HKUST-1 was retained integrally and each pore of HKUST-1 kept intact even with holding the PA molecule inside. The well-organized structure of PA@HKUST-1 facilitated to offer a highly distributed metal source, and further transform into defect-rich catalyst. The average size of the resulting WOₓCy/C catalysts was 1.5 nm, which was similar to a single molecule of PA. The WOₓCy/C catalysts exhibited superior activity in the methanol oxidation reaction after being platinized due to the enhanced resistance to CO poisoning, which is also confirmed by DFT. This finding suggests a new route to design and achieve the defect-rich catalyst with controllable size.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acoordination polymers 3aethanol 3amethanol 3aoxidation 3apyrolysis 3asolvents 3asynergism 0ametal−organic frameworks 0aelectrochemistry 0adefect 0atungsten 0amethanol oxidation reaction1 aLi, Fengjiao1 aPeng, Fei1 aHuang, Lizhen1 aLang, Xiaoling1 aShi, Meiqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5954-66470 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 13, no. 48 p.57803-57813dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c178083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245008300156300001600239500002000255520111200275592002801387650002701415650002101442650001601463650001101479650002201490650001201512650001101524650001101535650002101546650002901567650002401596650002601620650001901646651002401665651001801689700001901707700002001726773014301746856007101889852000901960655001201969IND60680220020221120151247.0200104e196808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022002DNAL7 a10.2307/12382582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Harry H.10aQuadratic Programming Solution of Competitive Equilibrium for U.S. Agriculture  ap. 536-555.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA quadratic programming model is applied to the solution of a competitive equilibrium for the field‐crops sectors of U.S. agriculture. The analysis is based on nine spatially separated markets, with separate demand functions for six commodities in each. The objective of the programming model is to maximize net profits (total revenue minus production costs, land rents, and transportation costs) derived from satisfying the endogenously determined demand in the various markets. This objective is subject to the constraints on land availability, demand functions, and the competitive equilibrium condition that product price not exceed marginal cost. The empirical results are consistent in the sense that programmed equilibrium prices are considerably lower than actual prices in the base year, 1965. Even under equilibrium at relatively low prices, surplus land is indicated in the Southeastern and Great Plains states. The results suggest the potential for various policy applications, including the analysis of potential short‐run prices in the presence or absence of “free market” equilibrium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3ademand functions 3afield crops 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3aproduction costs 3aproducts and commodities 3aprofits and margins 3aquadratic programming 3atransportation 3aGreat Plains region 3aUnited States1 aHeady, Earl O.1 aPlessner, Yakir0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1968 Aug., v. 50, no. 3 p.536-555dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12382583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013300166300001400299520126100313592002801574650003701602650004401639650001801683650002101701650002201722650001401744650001401758650001301772650002201785650001901807650002001826650001401846650005201860650002201912650001201934650001001946651000901956651001701965700001601982700002001998700002202018700001502040700002102055700001702076773013202093856008202225852000902307655001202316IND60588733220221123033104.0191113e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1250-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakeel, M.

For this reason, RT-PCR was conducted for detection of two criniviruses, Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) and Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) which are implicated in cucurbit yellows disease. Results showed the presence of CCYV and CYSDV in cucumber samples in 61.1% and 19.4%, respectively, whereas 9% of the plants were contained mixed infection. In addition, four weed species were identified, for the first time, as alternative hosts of CCYV; whereas CYSDV was reported only in Malva parviflora plants. Partial nucleotide sequencing analysis was conducted using 13 CCYV and five of CYSDV isolates originated from cucumber and wild hosts. Both viruses exhibited low genetic diversity; however, phylogenetic analysis clustered the obtained CYSDV isolates in a separated group, named the “Eastern subpopulation”, while CCYV isolates were classified into subgroups IIa and IIb, among other published sequences, forming a different evolutionary lineage from group I, which contained an isolate from Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbit chlorotic yellows virus 3aCucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus 3aCucurbitaceae 3aMalva parviflora 3aalternative hosts 3achlorosis 3acucumbers 3aetiology 3agenetic variation 3agrowing season 3amixed infection 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aviruses 3aweeds 3aIran 3aSaudi Arabia1 aAmer, M.

To this end, a study was conducted to determine which soil type and mixing ratio that can produce the highest thermal shock resistance when used as grates. The grates made of clay, red and anthill soils each mixed with shale rock in ratios of 1:0; 1:1; and 3:1 were compared. The grates were fired and then heated in a furnace set at 400 °C for 1 h and subjected to two cooling treatments; rapid cooling by quenching in water and cooling at ambient temperatures, for seven subsequent cycles after being heated. The shock resistance for all the grates made from different soil types and different mix ratios was measured based on crack initiation and propagation according to ASTM C1525-04 standards. The results showed that clay soil mixed with shale rock in the ratio of 3:1 had the highest thermal shock resistance with no crack initiation throughout the heating and cooling cycles, followed by anthill soil mixed with shale rock in the ratio of 1:1. Therefore, charcoal stove users and manufacturers can expect a better quality product with high durability if shale rock is used to temper the cook-stoves in comparison to burnt bricks that are currently commonly used in Uganda. The method used in this work can be applied in other regions to come up with more material ratios that are resistant to thermal shock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aant nests 3acharcoal 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acooling 3adurability 3aenergy 3afurnaces 3aheat 3ashale 3asustainable development 3aUganda 0aCook-stoves 0aGrate-making materials 0aThermal shock resistance 0aCrack propagation 0aStove durability1 aMuwanguzi, Simon1 aAyaa, Fildah1 aKizito, Simon1 aWanyama, Joshua0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2021 Oct., v. 64 p.59-64dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2021.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002100172245009400193300001800287520122200305592002801527650001401555650001901569650001201588650001301600650001701613650002401630650001401654650001501668650001501683650001501698650001701713650002601730650002001756650001301776650001201789650002701801650003001828650003301858650002001891650000901911650002401920700001801944700002701962700002001989773008502009856008902094852000902183655001202192IND4466467620221122031207.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446646762DNAL7 a218400312pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaam, Michiel A.10aComparing the sensitivity of soil invertebrates to pesticides with that of Eisenia fetida  ap. 1040-1047.  aThe sole routine testing of the standard earthworm Eisenia fetida for the terrestrial risk assessment of pesticides has been under much debate since other soil invertebrates may be more sensitive than this standard test species. However, the very low availability of laboratory toxicity data for taxa other than E. fetida has greatly hampered sensitivity comparisons. In the present study, the relative tolerance (Tᵣₑₗ) approach was used to enable comparing toxicity thresholds obtained from the US-EPA ECOTOX database, for main terrestrial taxonomic groups and pesticidal types of action (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and other) separately. Analyses confirmed previously reported lower and higher sensitivity of collembolans to fungicides and insecticides, respectively. However, various other discrepancies in susceptibility relative to E. fetida were encountered as indicated by species sensitivity distributions and/or calculated 95% confidence intervals of Tᵣₑₗ values. Arachnids and isopods were found to be more sensitive to insecticides, and nematodes to fungicides, as compared to E. fetida. Implications of study findings for the terrestrial risk assessment of pesticides are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachnida 3aEisenia fetida 3aIsopoda 3aNematoda 3abiogeography 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3aearthworms 3afungicides 3aherbicides 3ainsecticides 3apesticidal properties 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aEcotoxicologyxmethods 2aOligochaetaxdrug effects 2aPesticide Residuesxtoxicity 2aRisk Assessment 2aSoil 2aSpecies Specificity1 aLeitão, Sara1 aCerejeira, Maria José1 aPaulo Sousa, J.0 tChemosphere.g2011 Oct., v. 85, no. 6 p.1040-1047dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011900172520166400291592002801955650002301983650001302006650001902019650001702038650002002055650001402075650001302089650002402102650002302126650001502149650002602164650001202190650002002202650001202222651001302234653001502247653002302262653001302285653001502298653002102313653003102334653004102365700002202406700002102428700001802449700002402467700001502491700001702506700002002523773009602543856008502639852000902724655001202733IND60679757620221120182259.0200221e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067975762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2019.1013612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriauzde, Dina H.14aThe influence of social media on child feeding practices and beliefs among Hispanic mothers: A mixed methods study  a(1) To identify factors that influence child feeding practices and beliefs among Hispanic mothers in a low-income community; (2) to describe the use of social media, other internet websites, and text messaging among Hispanic mothers; and (3) to explore mothers' perceptions of social media and/or text messaging interventions to prevent childhood obesity.Mixed methods descriptive study with a sequential explanatory design. Hispanic mothers (N = 66) from Detroit, Michigan with children between 6 and 36 months of age completed surveys regarding their child feeding practices, the source (s) influencing these practices, and their use of social media, internet, and text messaging.

One-third of mothers breastfed their child for >6 months; 68% did not introduce solids until their child was older than 6 months. The majority (96%) owned a cellphone; 75% used social media at least once daily. Few mothers indicated that social media and other internet websites influenced their child feeding decisions. During qualitative interviews (N = 19), almost all mothers expressed interest in social media and/or text messaging as a tool to communicate information regarding child health and feeding.Hispanic mothers had high rates of social media use and most desired social media/internet/text messaging interventions to promote child health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHispanic Americans 3aInternet 3abreast feeding 3achild health 3achild nutrition 3achildhood 3achildren 3adescriptive studies 3ahealth information 3ainterviews 3alow income households 3amothers 3asocial networks 3asurveys 3aMichigan 0aPediatrics 0aObesity prevention 0aHispanic 0aLow-income 0aSocial media use 0aWomen Infants and Children 0aCommunity Health and Social Services1 aKieffer, Edith C.1 aDomoff, Sarah E.1 aHess, Kristen1 aFeinstein, Susannah1 aFrank, Amy1 aPike, Denise1 aPesch, Megan H.0 tEating behaviors.g2020 Jan., v. 36 p.101361-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2019.1013613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03742naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014800168520229900316592002802615650001102643650002002654650001502674650001602689650003202705650001602737650001102753650002002764650001202784650001702796650002202813650004302835650002402878650001602902700001702918700002002935700001102955700001902966700002102985700002903006700002103035773013403056856008503190852000903275655001203284IND60672767820221122115836.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067276782DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz037.FS11-04-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopp, Collin10aAdherence to Self-monitoring of Dietary Intake During a Weight Loss Intervention: Does a Personalized Approach Maintain Adherence? (FS11-04-19)  aWe compared self-monitoring adherence in participants randomized to two weight loss programs: a STANDARDIZED, one-size-fits-all, low-fat diet, or a diet PERSONALIZED to minimize the postprandial glycemic response. Participants were adults with pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes, and a BMI >27 k/m². Both groups were instructed to restrict total calories, monitor dietary intake with the Personal Nutrition Program (PNP) smartphone app, and attend videoconference behavioral counseling sessions on the same intervention schedule. STANDARDIZED (n = 12) received app feedback about intake of total calories and dietary fat. PERSONALIZED (n = 20) received app feedback about intake of total calories plus a meal-specific predicted glycemic score. Total meal entries were measured at 1, 2 and 3 months. Self-monitoring adherence was defined as logging >50% of expected meals each month into the PNP app, assuming 3 meals/day. Session attendance was also measured. Repeated measures binomial logistic regression analysis was used to assess change in adherence due to treatment group, time (i.e., months), and the interaction between treatment and time, adjusting for age, gender and BMI. Proportion adherent was 75.0%, 41.7% and 8.3% in the STANDARDIZED group and 85.0%, 80.0% and 75.0% in the PERSONALIZED group during months 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The repeated measures model demonstrated a significant effect of month (P < 0.001) and a treatment*month interaction (P = 0.011). After adjusting for covariates, these effects remained significant, showing a significant reduction in odds of adherence by month (OR [95%CI]: 0.13 [0.05, 0.37]; P < 0.001). Moreover, compared to the STANDARDIZED, PERSONALIZED participants had greater odds of adherence over time (OR [95%CI]: 5.12 [1.49, 17.6]; P = 0.009). Higher BMI was significantly associated with lower adherence (OR [95%CI]: 0.92 [0.87, 0.98]; P = 0.006). The proportion of attendance at videoconference sessions was similar between groups (STANDARDIZED: 77.1%; PERSONALIZED: 77.5%). Two weight loss programs having similar calorie targets, behavioral approach, and contact schedule resulted in similar session attendance. However, adherence to self-monitoring was better when feedback was personalized.

Rats were fed HFD throughout the study of 45 days and received STZ (40 mg/kg, i.p) on the 15th day of the study. Rats with more than 250 mg/dl of fasting blood glucose level (FBGL) were considered diabetic and selected for administration of EmbliQur (500 mg and 1000 mg/kg) or the standard drug metformin (120 mg/kg, p.o) from the 18th day of the study for the next 27 days. FBGL and insulin levels of all rats were measured weekly and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was done at the end of the study. The values of FBGL and insulin were used to calculate IR by the HOMA-IR, QUICKI and Matsuda methods.Rats treated with STZ/HFD had significantly higher than normal FBGL and insulin levels throughout the study and exhibited skewed IR indices in the above three methods of IR assessment. EmbliQur treatment successfully lowered the HFD/STZ-elevated BGL and insulin levels, and ameliorated IR in all models of IR evaluation.EmbliQur 1000 mg/kg was noted to be more effective than EmbliQur 500 mg/kg in alleviating IR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aCurcuma longa 3aPhyllanthus emblica 3ablood glucose 3agallic acid 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ametformin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apolyphenols 3astreptozotocin 0aDiabetes 0aHigh-fat diet 0aEmblica officinalis1 aDeshmukh, Amol1 aSingh, Sneha1 aShah, Taasin1 aHingorani, Lal0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2021 July,  Sept., v. 12, no. 3 p.506-513dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012000157300002000277520103500297592002801332650001401360650001501374650002201389650001601411650002101427700001801448700001901466700001901485700001901504773014401523856007401667852000901741655001201750IND60642578520221119044229.0190507e20170627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064257852DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta03521g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wu-Qiang10aRecent advances in hierarchical three-dimensional titanium dioxide nanotree arrays for high-performance solar cells  ap. 12699-12717.  aHierarchical metal oxide nanotree array architectures with tunable three-dimensional (3D) morphologies and homo-/heterogeneous junctions, consisting of 1D/2D nanobranches grown epitaxially on the sidewalls of vertical 1D nanostructured trunks (resembling a tree), have been widely explored to demonstrate their huge potential in the development of high-performance photovoltaic devices. In this review, the growth of a wide variety of TiO₂ nanotree array architectures will be discussed, with an emphasis on solution-phase and vapor-phase syntheses. The evolution of electrode materials and recent progress in 3D TiO₂ nanotree array architectures for solar cells are reviewed. Furthermore, to highlight the obvious benefits of 3D TiO₂ nanotree arrays, the limitations and challenges of these hierarchical array architectures when used in solar cells are addressed. Finally, insight into future directions and opportunities for these fascinating electrode materials in creating a new energy conversion epoch is also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy conversion 3asolar cells 3atitanium dioxide1 aFeng, Hao-Lin1 aChen, Hong-Yan1 aKuang, Dai-Bin1 aSu, Cheng-Yong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 June 27, v. 5, no. 25 p.12699-12717dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta03521g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245007000157300001600227500002000243520073900263592002801002650002701030650002301057650001701080650002201097650002101119650001601140651001701156700002001173773014301193856007101336852000901407655001201416IND60680220220221120151324.0200104e196808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022022DNAL7 a10.2307/12382602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchutjer, W.

Estimates of the impact of one such investment on the structure of the land market and on property values were made for a rural area in Pennsylvania. The findings of the study support the general hypothesis that investment in water‐based recreation facilities does significantly influence the value of rural property and the structure of the rural land market. Property characteristics and subdivision activity on surrounding properties had to be considered in addition to distance from the recreational development to measure the impact of this public investment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aeconomic resources 3aland markets 3apublic investment 3arecreation areas 3arural areas 3aPennsylvania1 aHallberg, M.

Thirty participants with absolute lymphocyte counts of 1000–4000 cells/mm³ were enrolled and were instructed to ingest 200 mg of SAPE daily for 30 days. The participants visited the clinic at baseline, and days 3, 7, and 30. Immune cells such as NK cell (CD3-CD16+CD56+), T cells (CD3+), T helper cells (CD3+CD4+), T cytotoxic cells (CD3+CD8+) were measured using flow cytometry. Serum cytokines that include interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were measured using ELISA. The SAPE used in this study was a standardized proprietary extract (AP-Bio®/KalmCold®) developed from the leaf extracts of A. paniculata.SAPE increased T cells, T helper cells and significantly increased IFN-γ, IL-4, and decreased IL-2 at day 30. A subgroup analysis of participants with absolute lymphocyte counts of 1000–3000 cells/mm³ indicated that there is a significant increase in the T cells, T helper cells at day 7 and 30 and significant increase in IFN-γ, IL-4 and decrease in IL-2 at day 30. There was no treatment related adverse effects following SAPE intake for 30 days.Supplementation of SAPE resulted in immunomodulatory effects evidenced by its effects on immune cells and cytokines and it was found to be safe and tolerable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrographis paniculata 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3ablood serum 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3aleaves 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aInterferon gamma 0aImmunity 0aT cells 0aT helper cells1 aBharathi, B.1 aShivakumar, B.R.1 aDeepak, M.1 aPrashanth, D'Souza1 aPrabakaran, D.1 aVijayabhaskar, T.1 aArun, B.0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2021 July,  Sept., v. 12, no. 3 p.529-534dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245004300158300002000201520124600221592002801467650001401495650001401509650001301523650000901536650001301545650001401558650001501572650003401587650002301621650001901644650000801663650001401671650000901685650001001694650001001704700001801714700001801732700001201750700001201762700001301774700001201787700002301799700001301822700002001835773014401855856007401999852000902073655001202082IND60642578620221119044143.0190507e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064257862DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta03526h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jinlong10aSuper-robust superhydrophobic concrete  ap. 14542-14550.  aSteel reinforced concrete is often used in buildings, roads and bridges, however, freeze–thaw damage and steel corrosion pose threats to the strength of concrete. Furthermore, ice formation on concrete road-surfaces greatly increases injury and fatality rates. Superhydrophobic materials are promising candidates to alleviate these problems due to their anti-corrosion and anti-icing properties. However, the weak mechanical robustness of superhydrophobic surfaces makes them difficult to apply to concrete surfaces. Here we report a facile route to fabricate superhydrophobic concrete (S-concrete) via metal mesh covering and fluoroalkylsilane modification. Comparative robustness tests, including sandpaper abrasion, knife scratch and hammer beat, were performed on commercial superhydrophobic paint + adhesive coatings and our S-concrete, which indicated that our S-concrete had far superior surface mechanical durability. To illustrate the practical prospects, we performed further tests on the S-concrete, including artificial cold rain, freeze–thaw, and corrosion under applied voltage in corrosive solution. The S-concrete showed remarkable anti-icing, anti-freeze–thaw, and anti-corrosion properties, and mechanical robustness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabrasives 3abuildings 3acoatings 3acold 3aconcrete 3acorrosion 3adurability 3aelectric potential difference 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ahydrophobicity 3aice 3amortality 3arain 3aroads 3asteel1 aZhao, Danyang1 aHan, Zhengjin1 aXu, Wei1 aLu, Yao1 aLiu, Xin1 aLiu, Bo1 aCarmalt, Claire J.1 aDeng, Xu1 aParkin, Ivan P.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 July 18, v. 5, no. 28 p.14542-14550dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta03526h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011700165300001400282500001500296520137900311592002801690650003601718650001101754650002001765650000901785650002501794650001201819650002001831650001401851650002001865650002501885650001001910650001401920653000701934653002301941653000801964653001001972653001901982653001002001653000802011653000902019653000802028653001602036653000802052653000802060653001202068653001202080653001102092653000802103653000802111653002002119653001002139653000802149653000802157653000802165653000802173653001002181653000802191653001302199700002202212700002402234700002302258700002502281700002002306700002502326773011102351856008202462852000902544655001202553IND60528522120221118103432.0190411e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052852212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2016.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFink, Inge R.10aMolecular and functional characterization of Toll-like receptor (Tlr)1 and Tlr2 in common carp (Cyprinus carpio)  ap. 70-83.  a2019-12-06  aToll-like receptors (TLRs) are fundamental components of innate immunity that play significant roles in the defence against pathogen invasion. In this study, we present the molecular characterization of the full-length coding sequence of tlr1, tlr2a and tlr2b from common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Each is encoded within a single exon and contains a conserved number of leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane region and an intracellular TIR domain for signalling. Indeed, sequence, phylogenetic and synteny analysis of carp tlr1, tlr2a and tlr2b support that these genes are orthologues of mammalian TLR1 and TLR2. The tlr genes are expressed in various immune organs and cell types. Furthermore, the carp sequences exhibited a good three-dimensional fit with the heterodimer structure of human TLR1-TLR2, including the potential to bind to the ligand Pam3CSK4. This supports the possible formation of carp Tlr1-Tlr2 heterodimers. However, we were unable to demonstrate Tlr1/Tlr2-mediated ligand binding in transfected cell lines through NF-κB activation, despite showing the expression and co-localization of Tlr1 and Tlr2. We discuss possible limitations when studying ligand-specific activation of NF-κB after expression of Tlr1 and/or Tlr2 in human but also fish cell lines and we propose alternative future strategies for studying ligand-binding properties of fish Tlrs.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3acarp 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aligands 3aCyprinus carpio 3aphylogeny 3agene expression 3aToll-like receptor 1 3aexons 3apathogens 0aPE 0aToll-like receptor 0aGFP 0agenes 0aTLR signalling 0aMYD88 0aPGN 0aPAMP 0aPBS 0aHeterodimer 0aTLR 0aPBL 0aRT-qPCR 0aTeleost 0aNF-κB 0aWGD 0aTIR 0aInnate immunity 0aTRAF6 0aUTR 0aLTA 0aBSA 0aRLU 0aIRAK1 0aLRR 0aPam3CSK41 aPietretti, Danilo1 aVoogdt, Carlos G.P.1 aWestphal, Adrie H.1 aSavelkoul, Huub F.J.1 aForlenza, Maria1 aWiegertjes, Geert F.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2016 Sept., v. 56 p.70-83dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014600206506011700352506007600469520136200545592002801907506003701935650002301972650002301995650002402018650004002042650001302082650001902095650001702114650001702131650001202148650001102160650001302171650001402184650001702198653001302215653001502228653001202243653001302255653002502268653001602293700007102309700006902380700007602449700006702525773013902592856008302731852000902814655001202823IND60748074720221207093619.0220706e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074807472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2021.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJośī, Jyoti,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0095-812610aAyurvedic management of persistent hypoxia in a diabetic and hypertensive COVID-19 patient in the post-hospitalization period–A case report  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCOVID-19 patients may require supplemental oxygen therapy at home after recovery from COVID-19. We report benefits of add on Ayurvedic intervention in a 75-year-old gentleman who was oxygen dependent post hospitalisation. He was earlier treated for COVID-19 related bilateral pneumonitis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Acute Renal Failure. Patient reported breathing difficulty, generalized weakness, reduced appetite and severe constipation. The Pulse Oximetry readings with oxygen support fluctuated between 80 and 85 %, Blood Pressure was 150/100 mm Hg, LDH raised at 463 IU/L and HbA1c at 8.7%. The patient was administered micro-doses of Rasasindura sublingually every 10 min for one day followed by administration of Indukānta Ghṛita and Suvarṇamālinīvasanta Rasa. The oxygen saturation improved to 95 % in 12 hrs of initiating treatment, oxygen support was weaned off on the third day of starting the Ayurvedic treatment, three weeks earlier than prescribed at the time of discharge.

CPM fungi have developed resistance to the commonly used fungicide (Imazalil) rendering its current use less effective. We therefore screened a selection of alternative products, evaluating their ability to control CPM in seven small-scale, semi-commercial, greenhouse experiments. Products were screened for their ability to suppress CPM on a susceptible cultivar, in 2013. In 2015, the best treatments were tested in different combinations, in different intervals on a susceptible and a partially resistant cultivar. The treatment that gave the best CPM control was Sakalia in combination with wetting agent Yuccah, (based on Reynoutria sachaliensis and Yucca schidigera respectively) applied at 7-day intervals. This treatment was highly efficient on both cucumber cultivars. Sakalia mixed with Yuccah applied at 14-day intervals had an almost equally controlling effect on CPM. The microbial pesticides, Polyversum (Pythium oligandrum) and AQ10 (Ampelomyces quiscalis) and the fungicide Imazalil, provided no to poor control of CPM compared to control treatments. Hortistar (Silicon) partially reduced CPM infections and was more efficient on the partially resistant cultivar. We conclude that Sakalia in combination with wetting agent Yuccah could efficiently control the disease even under the severe conditions caused by artificial inoculation. Further testing of this combination in commercial greenhouses will enable evaluation of the potential effects on yield and beneficial or pest insects. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to develop IPM tools for commercial production systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aH1256026cSwedish farmers’ foundation (SLF) 3aAmpelomyces 3aCucurbitaceae 3aPythium oligandrum 3aReynoutria 3aYucca schidigera 3acucumbers 3acultivars 3adisease control 3afungi 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aimazalil 3ainsect pests 3aintegrated pest management 3amicrobial pesticides 3aplant protection 3apowdery mildew 3aproduction technology 3arendering 3ascreening 3asilicon 3aSweden1 aRämert, Birgitta,1 aHökeberg, Margareta1 aVetukuri, Ramesh R.1 aGrenville-Briggs, Laura1 aLiljeroth, Erland0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 Jan., v. 150, no. 1 p.127-138dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1258-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013000156300002000286520176100306592002802067650001102095650003402106650001502140650001502155650002002170650001402190650001602204650003702220700001702257700001702274700001402291700001502305700001302320773014402333856007402477852000902551655001202560IND60642578720221119044234.0190507e20170627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064257872DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta03527f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Zheng12aA new in situ strategy to eliminate partial internal short circuit in Ce₀.₈Sm₀.₂O₁.₉-based solid oxide fuel cells  ap. 12873-12878.  aPartial internal short circuit resulting from the Ce⁴⁺/Ce³⁺ redox reaction is currently one of the most critical issues that hinder the practical application of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with doped ceria electrolytes. In this work, a new strategy utilizing a Sr diffusion induced in situ solid-state reaction to generate a blocking layer to prevent Ce₀.₈Sm₀.₂O₁.₉ (SDC) from reduction is proposed for the first time. As a proof of concept, Ni-SrCe₀.₉₅Yb₀.₀₅O₃₋δ is deployed as a Sr source for the electron-blocking interlayer and was evaluated as an anode for SDC-based SOFCs. A thin interlayer composed of SrCe₁₋ₓ(Sm,Yb)ₓO₃₋δ and SDC is formed in situ during the sintering process of the half cell due to the interdiffusion of metal cations, and the interlayer thickness is highly dependent on the sintering temperature. The high-resolution TEM results indicate that the SrCe₁₋ₓ(Sm,Yb)ₓO₃₋δ perovskite phase is generated and coated on the SDC grains, forming an SDC@SrCe₁₋ₓ(Sm,Yb)ₓO₃₋δ core–shell structure. The SrCe₁₋ₓ(Sm,Yb)ₓO₃₋δ phase effectively suppresses the Ce⁴⁺/Ce³⁺ redox reaction and hence eliminates electronic conduction through the electrolyte membrane. Consequently, the OCVs of the fuel cell are significantly improved after incorporating the electron-blocking interlayer and increase with increasing the interlayer thickness. The OCVs of the cell sintered at 1250 °C reach 0.962, 0.989, 1.017, and 1.039 V at 650, 600, 550, and 500 °C, respectively. The present results demonstrate that Ni-SrCeO₃-based composites are promising alternative anodes for CeO₂-based SOFCs towards enhanced working efficiency at high operating voltages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aelectric potential difference 3afuel cells 3ametal ions 3aredox reactions 3astrontium 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSun, Wenping1 aCao, Jiafeng1 aWu, Yusen1 aMiao, Lina1 aLiu, Wei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 June 27, v. 5, no. 25 p.12873-12878dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta03527f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01832naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245007500158300001600233500002000249520086600269592002801135650002701163650001701190650002401207650001101231650002401242650001901266651001001285773014301295856007101438852000901509655001201518IND60680220420221120151228.0200104e196808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022042DNAL7 a10.2307/12382642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeevers, Gary L.13aAn Evaluation of the Disincentive Effect Caused by P.

Public Law 480 shipments to a hypothetical country show that both prices and output are highly sensitive to elasticities of supply and demand. But for many cases examined, changes in these shipments had relatively insignificant price—output effects and these could have been offset by a modest growth in population. Estimates of parameters for India indicate that a 20‐percent increase in the quantity of foodgrain shipments between 1956–57 and 1961–62, other things being equal, would have decreased foodgrain prices 1.6 percent and domestic foodgrain output 0.4 percent. These disincentives may be outweighed by the effects on consumption, income distribution, and resource allocation, suggesting that, overall, the effects of P.

Water draining from peatlands is rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which can be problematic for water treatment. However, it is unclear how future climate and sulfate deposition changes may impact DOC in peatland‐derived potable water. The United Kingdom (UK) is a global hotspot that consumes 79% of all potable water derived directly from peatlands. Here, a physically‐based hydrological model and a biogeochemical organic carbon model were used to predict discharge and DOC concentration in nine hotspots of peatland‐derived potable water use in the UK under a range of 21st century climate and sulfate deposition scenarios. These nine catchments supply 72% of all peatland‐derived water consumed in the UK and 57% of the global total, equivalent to the total domestic consumption of over 14 million people. Our simulations indicate that annual discharges will decrease and that mean annual DOC concentrations will increase under all future scenarios (by as much as 53.4% annually for the highest emissions scenario) in all catchments. Large increases (by as much as a factor of 1.6) in DOC concentration in the 2090s over the baseline period are projected for autumn and winter, seasons when DOC concentrations are already high in the baseline datasets such that water treatment works often reach their capacity to cope. The total DOC flux is largely insensitive to future climate change because the projected increase in DOC concentration is mostly counterbalanced by the projected decrease in discharge.  aPublisher supplied data  aFJCI‐2017‐32111cSpanish Government  a41571022cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41625001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201506420041cChina Scholarship Council‐ School of Geography, University of Leeds joint scholarship 3aautumn 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adissolved organic carbon 3adrinking water 3ahydrologic models 3apeatlands 3apeople 3aresearch 3asulfates 3awater 3awater supply 3awater treatment 3awinter 3aUnited Kingdom1 aMorris, P.

Separation and quantification of these compounds is mainly achieved on reverse phase HPLC coupled to different detection systems using mostly acetonitrile as the mobile phase of choice. Nevertheless, the scientific community recently faced a worldwide shortage of this solvent which resulted in prices soaring dramatically. In this context, the present study describes the comparison and validation of a newly developed methanol-based method for the identification and quantification of major berry anthocyanins using standard HPLC coupled to photo diode array detection. Moreover, two different commercially available stationary phases were tested. The methanol-based method developed herein showed high repeatability (R.S.D <1.3%), rapidity (<35min) and accuracy and therefore may be suitable for routine quantification of berry anthocyanins. Comparison with an earlier established acetonitrile-based method showed that despite differences in absolute concentrations between both methods the determined anthocyanin concentrations were highly correlated (r>0.95). Method validation was further achieved by elucidating differences in the anthocyanin profile between different blackcurrant and strawberry cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3ablack currants 3acultivars 3adisease incidence 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aquantitative analysis 3astrawberries1 aCrespo, Pamela1 aTerry, Leon A.0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 129, no. 3 p.1265-1273dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.09.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013100163300001600294500001500310520102600325592002801351650002901379650001701408650002101425650001101446650002401457650002601481650000901507650001501516650002301531650001901554650001001573650001101583650001301594650002001607651001101627653001401638700001601652700001901668700001301687700001701700700001301717700001901730700001101749773013401760856008201894852000901976655001201985IND60588733720221123033025.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1281-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, S.F.10aEffects of rate and application method on the efficacy of metam sodium to reduce clubroot (Plasmodiophora brassicae) of canola  ap. 341-349.  a2019-12-06  aClubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, has become a serious threat to canola (Brassica napus) production in western Canada. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of rate of metam sodium fumigant (dithiocarbamate; sodium N-methyldithiocarbamate; trade name Vapam) and application methods including watering, soil surface covering, and soil incorporation on clubroot of canola. At higher rates (0.4–1.6 mL⁻¹ L soil) metam sodium increased canola seedling emergence and plant health, and reduced root hair infection, gall weight and clubroot severity under greenhouse conditions. Metam sodium application improved subsequent plant growth and reduced clubroot severity, but land preparation and volume of water applied did not affect efficacy. The incorporation of metam sodium into the soil and plastic covering after application improved fumigant efficacy. The study showed that soil fumigation with metam sodium can reduce clubroot severity and improve plant health in the subsequent canola crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3aplant growth 3asite preparation 3acanola 3aapplication methods 3agreenhouse production 3asoil 3aroot hairs 3aseedling emergence 3aBrassica napus 3ametam 3asodium 3aclubroot 3asoil fumigation 3aCanada 0afumigants1 aAhmed, H.U.1 aStrelkov, S.E.1 aZhou, Q.1 aGossen, B.D.1 aPeng, G.1 aTurnbull, G.D.1 aFu, H.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 Feb., v. 150, no. 2 p.341-349dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1281-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014100169300001600310520130800326592002801634650001101662650001201673650001901685650001901704650000901723650002301732650001901755650000701774650001401781650002401795650000901819650001401828650001601842650002101858650000901879651001001888653003201898653001901930653002101949653001901970653002801989653001802017700002102035700001602056700001102072700001502083700001702098773013302115856008302248852000902331655001202340IND60601174720221120153101.0180706e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060117472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2013.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Liangcheng10aTrace-element variations in an annually layered stalagmite as recorders of climatic changes and anthropogenic pollution in Central China  ap. 181-188.  aWe analyzed variations in the Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca, REE/Ca (REE: rare earth element), Zn/Ca, and Pb/Ca ratios preserved in an annually layered stalagmite, XL21, from central China. The stalagmite record spans the 95year period AD 1914–2008. The Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios have a significant positive correlation with the stalagmite's growth rate, suggesting that they were primarily controlled by growth-rate variations. Variations in REE/Ca ratios are consistent with local temperature changes, suggesting temperature influenced REE concentrations in the stalagmite over decadal to annual timescales. Higher temperature in this humid area can increase vegetation cover, microbial activity, and organic decomposition in the soil, resulting in enhanced pCO2, organic matter concentration and reduced pH, and consequently increased REE mobilization from the overlying soil layer and host rock. Higher temperatures may also increase the natural Zn mobilization from the overlying soil mediated by organic matter and consequently may have led to increased Zn retention in XL21. An increasing trend is seen in the Pb/Ca ratios from XL21 since 1985, which is consistent with increased lead production in this area, and indicates an increase in mine-derived lead pollution in the local environment over the past 30years.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3alead 3amicrobial activity 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apollution 3arare earth elements 3asoil 3astrontium 3atemperature 3avegetation cover 3azinc 3aChina 0aAnnually layered stalagmite 0aTrace elements 0aREE geochemistry 0aClimate change 0aEnvironmental pollution 0aCentral China1 aShen, Chuan-Chou1 aCai, Yanjun1 aLo, Li1 aCheng, Hai1 aAn, Zhisheng0 tQuaternary research.g2014 Mar., v. 81, no. 2 p.181-188dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2013.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011600162300001600278520130400294592002801598650001601626650002201642650001301664650001501677650002301692650003201715650001101747650001301758650001201771650003401783650001401817650001201831650001401843700001501857700001501872700001801887700001701905700001501922700001801937700001901955700001601974700001801990700001502008773013402023856008202157852000902239655001202248IND60588733820221123032629.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1286-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Teng10aFunctional analysis of spinach CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES5 (SoCPR5) in plant immunity  ap. 515-520.  aSpinach is one of the most nutritious green-leaf vegetables. In the spinach production, diseases cause a significant loss in both yield and quality. Improving disease resistance is one of the major challenges in spinach breeding. Arabidopsis nucleoporin CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 5 (CPR5) functions as a negative regulator of plant cell death and immunity as cpr5 mutant exhibits spontaneous cell death and heightened immunity. In addition, CPR5 play a role in trichome development as the majority of cpr5 mutant trichomes are branchless whereas wild type trichomes are often three-branched. In the spinach genome, we identified a homolog of Arabidopsis CPR5, referred to as Spinacia oleracea CPR5 (SoCPR5). To investigate the function of SoCPR5, we introduced SoCPR5 into Arabidopsis cpr5 mutant. Our data showed that both spontaneous cell death and heightened immunity were suppressed in the SoCPR5-transgenic cpr5 mutants, verifying that SoCPR5 functions as its Arabidopsis counterpart in plant cell death and immunity. SoCPR5 also fully restored wild type trichome phenotype of the cpr5 mutant. Our study therefore indicates that the function of SoCPR5 is conserved between plant species and SoCPR5 can be applied for genetic manipulation of plant immunity in spinach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aSpinacia oleracea 3abreeding 3acell death 3adisease resistance 3agenetically modified plants 3agenome 3aimmunity 3amutants 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aphenotype 3aspinach 3atrichomes1 aLou, Yuxia1 aXu, Chenxi1 aCai, Xiaofeng1 aWang, Xiaoli1 aMa, Huimin1 aWang, Tianhua1 aZhou, Jianjian1 aGe, Chenhui1 aWang, Quanhua1 aWang, Shui0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 Feb., v. 150, no. 2 p.515-520dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1286-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245008000173300001400253520127500267592002801542650001901570650001101589650001901600650001501619650002901634650002101663650001901684651001001703653003001713653002301743653001101766653002301777653000801800653000801808653000801816700002901824700005801853700002301911700001701934700002101951700002701972700001901999773010002018856008702118852000902205655001202214IND60570347920221121062053.0190405e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057034792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartelli, Simone10aDo Voters Support Local Commitments for Climate Change Mitigation in Italy?  ap. 27-35.  aThere is a growing interest in voluntary programmes for climate change mitigation, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction commitments. This paper gauges evidence on the support of citizens for climate change mitigation programmes at the local level, analysing voting behaviour. A quasi-experimental set-up is offered by the EU Covenant of Mayors (CoM) initiative, which is the mainstream European movement for local authorities voluntarily committing to meet and exceed the European Union 20% GHG emission reduction target by 2020. The electoral impact of the participation of Italian municipalities to the CoM is estimated, using an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Mayors committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their municipality appear not to lose electoral support at subsequent elections; this is contrary to what would be implied by a simple (biased) ordinary least squares regression. Moreover, IV point estimates are positive, albeit insignificant at standard levels; this could be due to the possibility of some support of citizens for emission reduction commitments. Finally, strong heterogeneity in socio-economic and demographic characteristics is found, with support of the CoM being more pronounced in wealthier and younger cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acities 3aclimate change 3ademography 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3asocioeconomics 3aItaly 0aClimate change mitigation 0aEmission reduction 0aVoting 0aCovenant of Mayors 0aQ54 0aQ58 0aD721 aJanssens-Maenhout, Greet1 aParuolo, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3982-48891 aBréchet, Thierry,1 aStrobl, Eric1 aGuizzardi, Diego1 aCerutti, Alessandro K.1 aIancu, Andreea0 tEcological economics.g2018 Feb., v. 144 p.27-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013800160300001400298520147700312592002801789650001601817650001101833650001401844650001501858650002101873650001401894650001101908650001301919650000901932650001401941650002801955653003201983653002302015653002002038653001302058653000902071700001502080700001702095700001502112773008202127856008102209852000902290655001202299IND60585751220221120230739.0171114e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058575122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Debo10aElectroacupuncture analgesia with different frequencies is mediated via different opioid pathways in acute visceral hyperalgesia rats  ap. 64-71.  aTo investigate the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) alleviation of acute visceral hyperalgesia, the frequency dependence of this efficacy, and the difference in endogenous opioid pathways as underlying mechanism explaining the frequency dependence.A visceral hyperalgesia model was established by colorectal instillation of 2% acetic acid (AA) in adult rats. EA treatment at 2Hz, 100Hz, 2/100Hz and sham EA were performed at two bilateral acupoints, ST-36 and ST-37, in the hind-limbs. Naloxone (NLX, 2mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 5min before the application of EA. The visceral sensation was quantified by scores of abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and values of rectus abdominis electromyograms (EMGs) in response to colorectal distension (CRD).Acute visceral hyperalgesia was produced by instillation of AA. The hyperalgesia reached the peak at 2h, and maintained steadily for >6h. EA treatment at 2Hz, 100Hz and 2/100Hz attenuated the acute hyperalgesia, and the attenuation lasted for 2.5h, 2h and 3h, respectively. Sham EA produced no such effect. The analgesic potencies of EA treatment at 2Hz, 100Hz and 2/100Hz were completely blocked, almost not affected, and partially blocked by NLX. In the latter two frequencies, the analgesic durations were shortened to 1.5h and 2h, respectively.EA can alleviate acute visceral hyperalgesia. Effective EA analgesia at different frequencies are potentially mediated via different endogenous opioid pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadults 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesics 3aelectromyography 3ahindlimbs 3amodels 3analoxone 3arats 3asensation 3asomatosensory disorders 0aAcute visceral hyperalgesia 0aElectroacupuncture 0aOpioid pathways 0aNaloxone 0aRats1 aWu, Shuqin1 aZhang, Yuhua1 aLi, Weimin0 tLife sciences.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 160 p.64-71dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015600159300002000315520103600335592002801371650001301399650001401412650002101426650001301447650002101460650003001481650001101511650001901522650001201541650002201553650001101575700001301586700001301599700001301612700001801625700001801643700002401661773014401685856007401829852000901903655001201912IND60642579120221119045645.0190507e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064257912DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta03552g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Xiaoheng12aA rGO–CNT aerogel covalently bonded with a nitrogen-rich polymer as a polysulfide adsorptive cathode for high sulfur loading lithium sulfur batteries  ap. 14775-14782.  aThe development of high capacity lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries is hampered by both the shuttle effect of polysulfides and low sulfur areal loading problems. To inhibit the shuttle effect, a polysulfide adsorptive polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) is covalently bonded with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in a one-step hydrothermal reaction. Meanwhile, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are simultaneously interweaved with rGO. The resultant PEI–rGO–MWCNT aerogel (PEI–GC) provides ample chemisorption domains of amine groups and abundant electrical contact sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove a binding energy of 2.43 eV between PEI and polysulfide. The PEI–GC cell achieved a high capacity of 933 mA h g⁻¹ for the 500th cycle at 1C, stable rate performance up to 10C, and low self-discharge rate. The covalent bond between PEI and rGO experiences no degradation during the 500 cycles.

The primary source of inoculum is infected seeds and airborne spores play an important role in dispersal of the pathogen. Detection of seed-borne infection of this pathogen is necessary to limit the spread of this pathogen. Hence, a conventional and SYBR Green real-time PCR assays based on sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker were developed for detection of this oomycete pathogen from maize seeds. In the conventional PCR, the primer pair SCAR-F/SCAR-R was able to detect P. sorghi and shown to be highly specific, with a detection sensitivity of 5 ng of DNA from P. sorghi. The PCR assays could detect the pathogen in naturally-infected maize seeds. A real-time PCR detection protocol was standardized for rapid and sensitive detection of P. sorghi from infected maize seeds. The detection limit of the real-time PCR assay for P. sorghi was 32 fg of DNA per reaction. The standard curve obtained showed a linear correlation between input DNA and cycle threshold (Cq) with R² of 0.99. The results demonstrated that the developed PCR technique is a highly specific and sensitive method that can be used to detect P. sorghi in seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPeronosclerospora sorghi 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrop production 3adetection limit 3adowny mildew 3ahybridization probes 3ainoculum 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseeds 3aspores1 aVelazhahan, Rethinasamy0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 Feb., v. 150, no. 2 p.521-526dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1287-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245010600175300001600281500001500297520112400312592002801436650001501464650002101479650002101500650001701521650002401538650002201562650004301584650002201627650002401649650002301673653001001696700002501706700001901731700002601750700002001776773010301796856004801899852000901947655001201956IND50063592620221122054541.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006359262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-012-9872-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashtroudi, Mehri Seyed10aEndogenous auxins in plant growth-promoting Cyanobacteria—Anabaena vaginicola and Nostoc calcicola   ap. 379-386.  a2019-12-06  aThree isolates of heterocystous cyanobacteria, belonging to the genera Anabaena and Nostoc, gathered from Iranian terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems exhibited considerable growth promotion effect on several vegetables and herbaceous plants. To study the ability of these three isolates to produce auxins, three endogenous auxins, including indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and two of its main homologues, indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-butyric acid, were extracted and analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with diode array detector and fluorescence detector, and the results were further confirmed with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) in the negative-ion mode. The dominant auxin observed in all isolates was indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) in the range of 140.10–2146.96 ng g⁻¹ fresh weight (FW), and only small amounts of IAA (2.19–9.93 ng g⁻¹ FW) were detected. The predominance of IBA in these strains is reported for the first time which is different from the previously reported auxin profiles in microalgae and algae with the predominance of IAA.  aPublisher supplied data 3avegetables 3agrowth promotion 3aNostoc calcicola 3afluorescence 3aindole butyric acid 3aherbaceous plants 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aAnabaena vaginicola 3aindole acetic acid 0aAlgae1 aGhassempour, Alireza1 aRiahi, Hossein1 aShariatmadari, Zeinab1 aKhanjir, Maryam0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2013 Apr., v. 25, no. 2 p.379-386dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-012-9872-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245009500136300001600231520091100247592002801158650001601186650001401202650002201216650002301238650001801261650001901279650002901298650001301327650002101340650001601361650002001377650002501397650001001422650001601432650002301448650001101471650001801482650001101500650001201511650001301523650001101536650001401547650001201561653001501573653002501588700002201613700001801635773014601653852000901799655001201808IND60706040020221123012529.0200807e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070604002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanwal, Ghafirullah10aEffect of selected plant extracts against post-harvest rot fungi of Onion (Allium cepa L.)  ap. 335-338.  aSurvey of fungi associated with post-harvest deterioration of onion bulbs in three major markets in Allahabad district was conducted.

As poor supervision of child-dog interactions may be a key cause of these incidents, we set out to investigate dog owners' attitudes to supervision of everyday interactions of their children with the family dog and whether interactions with family dogs were judged differently than those with unfamiliar dogs. An online survey was conducted over a 4-month period. To take part, respondents had to live with a child (≤6 years) and to own a dog. The questionnaire contained sections about demographics (participant, child, dog), supervision and daily management of the child and dog, intervention in interactions, and awareness of risks of interactions (all scored on a scale from 1 to 6). Questions about intervention included 5 pictures of child-dog interactions which were chosen based on concordant expert ratings. Respondents' average level of tolerance of unsafe behaviors was in the middle of a scale from 1 to 6 (3.05, standard deviation [SD] 1.29), and their level of attentiveness they reported during supervision of child and dog was similar (mean 3.12, SD 1.47). Environmental control of interactions, in particular by giving the dog a resting place separated from the child, was reported on a low level (mean 2.83, SD 1.47). However, respondents rated the need for an intervention in child-dog interactions very differently than experts (U = −13.52, P < 0.001): on average, participants agreed with experts on only 2 depicted situations involving the family dog and on 4 encounters with an unfamiliar dog. Overall, many dog owners need to improve their supervision of child-dog interactions. It is vital to educate caregivers about potentially unsafe behaviors and safety measures to use with the family dog.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanidae 3aattitudes and opinions 3acaregivers 3achildren 3ademographic statistics 3adogs 3aexperts 3ahuman-animal relations 3apet ownership 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 0adomestic dog 0achild-dog interactions 0aparent supervision 0adog bite prevention1 aLandenberger, Ricarda1 aBeetz, Andrea1 aTroxler, Josef0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2016 July,  Aug., v. 14 p.10-16dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2016.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245012100209300001000330500001900340520161100359592002801970650002001998650001302018650001902031650001302050650001302063650001302076650001502089650001302104650001102117650001402128650001202142650001502154651001302169651001302182651002202195700002202217700002102239700002302260773012502283856008302408852000902491655001202500IND60715633620221119220153.0210210e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-020-00764-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrentman, Matt T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9290-867010aAgricultural layering explains variation in sediment P dynamics in streams draining two distinct agricultural biomes  ap. 7.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhosphorus (P) enrichment of headwater agricultural streams due to the runoff of fertilizers can lead to the eutrophication of downstream aquatic ecosystems. Agriculture is intensive but heterogeneous in the Mississippi River Basin, with a mixture of pasture, row crops, and patches of confined animal feedlot operations (CAFOs). Many studies have evaluated how a single form of agricultural land use can affect sediment response to P loading, but few have considered the role of agricultural layering (i.e., one vs. two forms of agriculture in the same watershed). We used a synoptic sampling approach to determine the effect of agricultural layering on sediment P cycling in two watersheds in Arkansas (AR) and Michigan (MI). We sampled stream sediments from 10 sites in each watershed across two seasons; sampling from sites draining row crop vs. row crop plus a dairy in MI, and from sites draining chicken CAFOs vs. chicken CAFOs with pasture in AR. The proportion of bioavailable P was highest in MI and lowest in AR sediments, likely due to enhanced runoff of P rich sediment from row crops in MI, compared to sites in AR that were still predominantly forested, despite isolated CAFOs. Sediment P retention capacity was lowest downstream of sites with row crop + dairy in MI and highest at sites draining CAFOs alone in AR. Finally, substrate size differences between watersheds likely influences the reach-scale potential P retention capacity. Overall, we show that agricultural layering along with underlying geology can explain drivers influencing sediment P dynamics in agricultural streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3achickens 3aeutrophication 3afeedlots 3aland use 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3arowcrops 3arunoff 3asediments 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aArkansas 3aMichigan 3aMississippi River1 aTank, Jennifer L.1 aBraund, Danielle1 aEntrekin, Sally A.0 tAquatic sciences.g2021 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.7-7dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000051x1015-16217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-00764-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245007100195300001800266520142100284592002801705650001501733650001401748650001401762650001101776650000701787650001101794650001501805650002301820650001601843650000901859650001501868650001301883650001501896650001301911650002301924650003501947650004201982650002302024650002402047700001702071700002102088700002002109773013602129856004802265852000902313655001202322IND50068072920221121011101.0140228e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006807292DNAL7 a235892372pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1625-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBizerea Spiridon, Otilia10aPhenol removal from wastewater by adsorption on zeolitic composite  ap. 6367-6381.  aIt is well known that adsorption is an efficient method of removal of various pollutants from wastewater. The present study examines the phenol removal from water by adsorption on a new material, based on zeolitic volcanic tuff. This compound contains zeolitic tuff and cellulose, another known adsorbent, in a mass ratio of 4 to 1. The performances of the new adsorbent composite were compared with those of a widely used adsorbent material, zeolitic volcanic tuff. The adsorbent properties were tested on batch synthetic solutions containing 1-10 mg L(-1) (1-10 ppm) phenol, at room temperature without pH adjustment. The influence of the adsorbent dose, pH and contact time on the removal degree of phenol from water was investigated. The experimental data were modeled using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin adsorption isotherms. The Langmuir model was found to best represent our data revealing a monolayer adsorption with a maximum adsorption capacity between 0.12 and 0.53 mg g(-1) at 25 °C, for 2.00 g of adsorbent, depending on the initial phenol concentration. The adsorption kinetic study was performed using a pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models illustrating that phenol adsorption on zeolite composite is well described by pseudo-first kinetic equations. Our results indicated that phenol adsorption on the new adsorbent composite is superior to that on the classic zeolite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3aequations 3amodels 3apH 3aphenol 3apollutants 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3atuff 3awastewater 3azeolites 2aAdsorption 2aKinetics 2aPhenolsxchemistry 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 2aWater Purification 2aZeolitesxchemistry1 aPreda, Elena1 aBotez, Alexandru1 aPitulice, Laura0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Sept., v. 20, no. 9 p.6367-6381dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1625-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005300142245011400195500002000309520181300329592002802142596005502170596005502225596005502280596004802335650001202383650001302395650002302408650002302431650001902454650001302473650001102486650001002497650002202507650001602529650001202545650001802557650001502575700006202590700006102652700006302713700005002776773013102826856007702957852000903034655001203043IND60772798120221119091413.0220410e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077279812DNAL7 a10.1029/2020WR0295282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7358-162514aThe Limits of Homogenization: What Hydrological Dynamics can a Simple Model Represent at the Catchment Scale?  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLarge‐scale models often use a single grid to represent an entire catchment assuming homogeneity; the impacts of such an assumption on simulating evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow remain poorly understood. Here, we compare hydrological dynamics at Shale Hills (PA, USA) using a complex model (spatially explicit, >500 grids) and a simple model (spatially implicit, two grids using “effective” parameters). We asked two questions: What hydrological dynamics can a simple model reproduce at the catchment scale? What processes does it miss by ignoring spatial details? Results show the simple model can reproduce annual runoff ratios and ET, daily discharge peaks (e.g., storms, floods) but not discharge minima (e.g., droughts) under dry conditions. Neither can it reproduce different streamflow from the two sides of the catchment with distinct land surface characteristics. The similar annual runoff ratios between the two models indicate spatial details are not as important as climate in reproducing annual scale ET and discharge partitioning. Most of the calibrated parameters in the simple model are within the ranges in the complex model, except that effective porosity has to be reduced to 40% of the average porosity from the complex model. The form of the storage‐discharge relationship is similar. The effective porosity in the simple model however represents the dynamic and mobile water storage in the effective drainage area of the complex model that connects to the stream and contributes to high streamflow; it does not represent the passive, immobile water storage in the often disconnected uphill areas. This indicates that an additional uphill functioning unit is needed in the simple model to simulate the full spectrum of high‐low streamflow dynamics in natural catchments.  aPublisher supplied data  aEAR – 0725019cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aEAR – 1239285cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aEAR – 1331726cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  cPenn State College of Agricultural Sciences 3aclimate 3adrainage 3aeffective porosity 3aevapotranspiration 3ahomogenization 3aresearch 3arunoff 3ashale 3asimulation models 3astream flow 3astreams 3awater storage 3awatersheds1 aBrantley, Susan L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4320-23421 aDavis, Kenneth J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1992-83811 aDuncan, Jonathan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9723-05011 aLi, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1641-37100 tWater resources research.g2021 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.e2020WR029528-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR0295283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245007900193300001600272520150200288592002801790650001701818650002101835650001201856650002001868650001201888650002601900650002701926650002801953650002001981650001302001650001802014650001302032650002802045650000902073650002402082650003002106650006302136650002802199650004502227650001402272650002902286650005202315650004202367650003202409650003202441650002102473650002902494650002502523650005102548650002302599650003402622650002402656650003502680650005202715650005202767700001602819700002002835700002202855700001902877700001802896700002202914773009602936856005503032852000903087655001203096IND4469016120221122054624.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446901612DNAL7 a221421662pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04874.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaguchi, Kōji,10aSWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide‐exchange factor in rice  ap. 389-397.  aRho family small GTPases are involved in diverse signaling processes including immunity, growth, and development. The activity of Rho GTPases is regulated by cycling between guanosine diphosphate (GDP)‐bound inactive and guanosine triphosphate (GTP)‐bound active forms, in which guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) predominantly function to promote activation of the GTPases. In animals, most Rho GEFs possess a Dbl (diffuse B‐cell lymphoma) homology (DH) domain which functions as a GEF‐catalytic domain. However, no proteins with the DH domain have been identified in plants so far. Instead, plant‐specific Rho GEFs with the PRONE domain responsible for GEF activity have been found to constitute a large family in plants. In this study, we found rice homologs of human SWAP70, Oryza sativa (Os) SWAP70A and SWAP70B, containing the DH domain. OsSWAP70A interacted with rice Rho GTPase OsRac1, an important signaling factor for immune responses. The DH domain of OsSWAP70A exhibited the GEF‐catalytic activity toward OsRac1 as found in animal Rho GEFs, indicating that plants have the functional DH domains. Transient expression of OsSWAP70A enhanced OsRac1‐mediated production of reactive oxygen species in planta. Reduction of OsSWAP70A and OsSWAP70B mRNA levels by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of chitin elicitor‐induced defense gene expression and ROS production. Thus, it is likely that OsSWAP70 regulates immune responses through activation of OsRac1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aRNA interference 3aanimals 3agene expression 3aguanine 3aguanosine diphosphate 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aimmune response 3alymphoma 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3arice 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aGene Expressionxgenetics 2aGuanine Nucleotide Exchange Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Immunityxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Interaction Mapping 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSignal Transduction 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2arac GTP-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2arho GTP-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aImai, Keiko1 aAkamatsu, Akira1 aMihashi, Masanori1 aHayashi, Nagao1 aShimamoto, Ko1 aKawasaki, Tsutomu0 tplant journal.g2012 May, v. 70, no. 3 p.389-397dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04874.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008600154300002000240520106500260592002801325650001901353650002001372650001101392650001601403650002201419650001701441650001301458650001101471650001901482650001901501700001601520700001501536700001701551700001401568700001501582773014401597856007401741852000901815655001201824IND60642579420221119043941.0190507e20170627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064257942DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta03557h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xu10aTi₂CO₂ MXene: a highly active and selective photocatalyst for CO₂ reduction  ap. 12899-12903.  aPhotocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) into hydrocarbons could promote the CO₂ utilization and retard the greenhouse effect, which has gained much attention. Due to high surface–bulk ratio, two-dimensional materials can be promising candidates for catalysis. In this study, by means of first-principles computations, we have investigated the reduction of CO₂ at the oxygen vacancy on MXene monolayers. Among Ti₂CO₂, V₂CO₂ and Ti₃C₂O₂, Ti₂CO₂ has exhibited the best catalytic performance for the reduction of CO₂. The reaction pathway CO₂ → HCOO → HCOOH was found to be favorable with an energy barrier of 0.53 eV. The energy barriers of the reaction pathways for other single-carbon organic products were much higher, indicating high selectivity for HCOOH. Moreover, we have proposed that CO and H₂ can introduce sufficient oxygen vacancies on O-terminated MXene. This study provides new insights into the design of catalysts for the reduction of CO₂ and further widens the applications of MXene-based materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aenergy 3aformic acid 3agreenhouse effect 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts1 aZhang, Zihe1 aLi, Jielan1 aZhao, Xudong1 aWu, Dihua1 aZhou, Zhen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 June 27, v. 5, no. 25 p.12899-12903dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta03557h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016700165300001600332520163600348592002801984650001202012650001302024650002202037650001902059650002202078650003802100650001002138650005302148650001002201650001502211650001402226650002902240650003202269650002002301650001002321650001802331653001502349653001102364653003002375653000902405653002202414700001302436700001702449700001702466700001902483700001702502700001402519700001502533700001602548700001602564773011402580856008502694852000902779655001202788IND60567344520221120112918.0180904e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056734452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2015.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez, D.10aModulation of the pro-inflammatory molecules E-selectin and TNF-α gene transcription in Eimeria ninakohlyakimovae-infected primary caprine host endothelial cells  ap. 471-477.  aEimeria ninakohlyakimovae is an important coccidian parasite of goats which causes severe hemorrhagic typhlocolitis in young animals, thereby leading to high economic losses in goat industry worldwide. The first merogony of E. ninakohlyakimovae occurs within host endothelial cells (ECs) of the lacteal capillaries of the villi of the distal ileum resulting in the formation of macromeronts (up to 170μm) within 10–12days post-infection (p.i.) and releasing >120,000 merozoites I. The E. ninakohlyakimovae-macromeront formation within highly immunoreactive host endothelial cells (ECs) should rely on several regulatory processes to fulfill this massive replication. Here host EC–parasite interactions were investigated to determine the extent of modulation carried out by E. ninakohlyakimovae in primary caprine umbilical vein endothelial cells (CUVEC) during the first merogony. Gene transcription of the adhesion molecule E-selectin and the cytokine TNF-α were significantly enhanced in the first hours and days p.i. in E. ninakohlyakimovae-infected CUVEC. The activation of CUVEC was also demonstrated by enhanced chemokine CCL2 and cytokine GM-CSF gene transcription, whereas no differences of the eNOS gene transcription were observed in E. ninakohlyakimovae-infected CUVEC when compared to un-infected controls. The data presented here suggest that infection of caprine host ECs by E. ninakohlyakimovae results in EC activation associated with enhanced gene transcription encoding for pro-inflammatory as well as immunomodulatory molecules, which might be important for the defense against this intracellular parasite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria 3aadhesion 3achemical elements 3achemokine CCL2 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3agoats 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3aileum 3amerozoites 3aparasites 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aumbilical veins 3avilli 3ayoung animals 0aE-selectin 0aTNF-α 0aEimeria ninakohlyakimovae 0aGoat 0aEndothelial cells1 aRuiz, A.1 aMuñoz, M.C.1 aMolina, J.M.1 aHermosilla, C.1 aLópez, A.M.1 aMatos, L.1 aOrtega, L.1 aMartin, S.,1 aTaubert, A.0 tParasitology international.g2015 Oct., v. 64, no. 5 p.471-477dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2015.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011200163300001600275520134500291592002801636650003101664650002701695650002801722650001101750650001001761650001001771650001301781650001801794650001901812650003301831650001401864650000901878650003001887650001301917650001801930650002201948650002901970651001001999653002002009653002802029653001502057653001002072653000802082700001602090700001702106700001602123700001802139700002002157700002002177773011402197856008502311852000902396655001202405IND60567344620221123005139.0180904e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056734462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2015.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Meng10aZoonotic Cryptosporidium spp. and Enterocytozoon bieneusi in pet chinchillas (Chinchilla lanigera) in China  ap. 339-341.  aCryptosporidium and Enterocytozoon bieneusi are the most prevalent protist pathogens responsible for inducing human and animal diseases worldwide. The aim of the present work was to determine the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi in pet chinchillas in China. One hundred forty fecal samples were collected from four cities: Beijing, Zhengzhou, Anyang and Guiyang. They were then examined with PCR amplification of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) of Cryptosporidium spp. and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal RNA of E. bieneusi. The infection rates for Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi were 10.0% and 3.6%, respectively. Sequence analysis of SSU rRNA gene products identified two Cryptosporidium spp., Cryptosporidium ubiquitum (n=13) and Cryptosporidium parvum (n=1). Subtyping with the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene showed that all C. ubiquitum isolates belonged to zoonotic subtype family XIId, while the subtype of the C. parvum isolate could not be identified. Two E. bieneusi genotypes were identified in five samples, zoonotic genotypes BEB6 (n=3) and D (n=2). This is the first report of C. ubiquitum and C. parvum, and E. bieneusi in chinchillas. This result indicates that pet chinchillas may be a potential source of human infection with Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinchilla (Chinchillidae) 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aEnterocytozoon bieneusi 3acities 3afeces 3agenes 3agenotype 3aglycoproteins 3ahuman diseases 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogens 3apets 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotists 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3aChina 0aCryptosporidium 0aEnterocytozoon bieneusi 0aChinchilla 0aChina 0aPCR1 aLuo, Nannan1 aWang, Haiyan1 aYu, Fuchang1 aWang, Rongjun1 aHuang, Jianying1 aZhang, Longxian0 tParasitology international.g2015 Oct., v. 64, no. 5 p.339-341dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2015.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245012900178300001600307520086300323592002801186650001501214650002101229650002201250650002401272650001101296650002301307650002701330650001701357651001601374653002301390653002301413653001201436653002201448653002801470653000901498700003201507700003001539700003201569773011801601856008201719852000901801655001201810IND60532096320221121222552.0190401e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053209632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2016.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelyutina, Inessa Yur'evna10aGenetic diversity of the endangered endemic milkvetch Astragalus sericeocanus Gontsch., Fabaceae from the Lake Baikal region  ap. 163-169.  aInter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population genetic structure in six populations of Astragalus sericeocanus, a rare species endemic to the Lake Baikal region. Six selected primers amplified 91 bands with 87.9% being polymorphic. The Nei's gene diversity (He) was estimated to be 0.112 within populations (range 0.086–0.150), and 0.191 at the species level. The genetic differentiation among populations (GST) was 0.415. There is a significant relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance among the A. sericeocanus populations by Mantel's test. Low genetic diversity observed for A. sericeocanus may be imputed mainly to habitat degradation caused by human activity. There is an urgent need to take effective measures to protect A. sericeocanus against the loss of genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arare species 3aLake Baikal 0aPlant conservation 0aEndangered species 0aEndemic 0aGenetic diversity 0aAstragalus sericeocanus 0aISSR1 aKonichenko, Elena Sergeevna1 aDorogina, Olga Viktorovna1 aSandanov, Denis Viktorovich0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2016 Oct., v. 68 p.163-169dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2016.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245017200176300001600348520115300364536023101517592002801748596009401776596008301870650001701953650001101970650001501981650002501996650002402021650000802045650001102053650002302064650001902087650001902106650001102125650002802136651001802164653001902182653003402201653002902235653001802264700002802282700002502310700002302335773013102358856008502489852000902574655001202583IND60654122420221118185941.0190722e20190803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065412242DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2017.14234052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvseev, Alexander V.10aNew look at territories of traditional nature use – traditional nature management lands at the coastal zone of the Ice Silk Road: a case study for the Russian Arctic  ap. 948-961.  aTerritories of traditional nature use (TTNU) of indigenous population in the Arctic zone presents a historical model of sustainable development whose main principles are valuable for modern practice of economic activities in this region as well. Indigenous peoples traditional nature management practice in the Russian Arctic nowadays exists only within tribal community lands, though their virtual limits may be larger and known to indigenous population, helping to preserve regional identities. Preservation of TTNU in the course of modern economic development, including the Northern Silk Road coastal infrastructure, is important for regional ecological and social stability. They may be regarded as ecological buffer zones, restoring ecosystem functions important for regional sustainable development, though modern market economy treats them mainly as economic units less valuable for incomes than industrial. A new look at TTNU may be supported by their ecological-economic assessment. A case study in the coastal Nenets TTNU belonging to family-clan community ‘Ya’Erv’ demonstrates its possible input to local sustainable development.  aThis work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (grant numbers 17-55-53109 and 18-05-00475) and Russian Science Foundation (grant number 18-17-00074) in a part of the methodology atlas information systems.  aPublisher supplied data  a17-55-53109cRussian Foundation for Basic Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002261  a18-17-00074cRussian Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006769 3acase studies 3acoasts 3acold zones 3aecological economics 3aecological function 3aice 3aincome 3aindigenous peoples 3ainfrastructure 3amarket economy 3amodels 3asustainable development 3aArctic region 0aRussian Arctic 0atraditional nature management 0aecosystem services value 0aIce Silk Road1 aKrasovskaya, Tatiana M.1 aTikunov, Vladimir S.1 aTikunova, Irina N.0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2019 Aug. 3, v. 12, no. 8 p.948-961dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2017.14234053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04698naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013600164300001500300520270300315592002803018650001803046650002203064650001603086650002103102650002503123650001703148650001703165650002303182650002303205650001403228650001103242650002503253650003003278650001903308650001703327650002003344650001703364650001203381650001503393650002103408650001003429650001103439650001303450650002503463650002603488650003203514650000903546650001103555650001303566650001503579650002603594650001003620650001403630650002103644653001903665653001203684653001403696653001903710653000903729700001403738700001503752700001603767773010203783856008203885852000903967655001203976IND60532096420221121232137.0190402e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053209642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2016.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Brien, D.12aA life cycle assessment of the effect of intensification on the environmental impacts and resource use of grass-based sheep farming  ap. 95-104.  aIntensification is a strategy that is reported to increase the productivity and environmental performance of livestock farms, but most life cycle assessments (LCA) of livestock (particularly sheep) only consider greenhouse gas (GHG) or carbon footprint (CF). The goal of our LCA study was to assess the effect of intensification on several measures of environmental impact and resource use for grass-based sheep farms. The impacts we considered in addition to CF were acidification and eutrophication. The resource use measures we assessed were fossil fuel energy demand, land occupation and land use efficiency in terms of human digestible protein (HDP) production. Both environmental and resource use measures were expressed per kg of sheep live weight (LW) produced. The sheep production systems we assessed were Irish case study farms that represented average lowland, average hill, intensive lowland mid-season (IMS) and intensive early-season (IES) systems. Our results showed that the food-related environmental impacts and resource use of the average lowland sheep farm could be improved by intensifying grass and animal production. In addition, there was significant potential to increase production within area-based regulatory limits on nitrogen and phosphorus. However, increasing animal production by feeding more concentrate was less efficient and increased environmental impacts compared to increasing grass production, because concentrate required significantly more resources than pasture to produce and generated more emissions. There was limited potential to produce meat from the average hill farm that was located on marginal land. This generally led to the average hill farm having the highest product-related environmental impacts, but this system had the lowest nutrient surpluses per unit area. Modeling assumptions regarding carbon sequestration by grassland had a large effect on farm carbon footprints. The average hill farm had the highest carbon footprint when sequestration was excluded, but the opposite was the case when it was included. Therefore, we recommend clearly documenting the contribution of uncertain carbon sinks such as grassland sequestration to carbon footprints of sheep production systems. Additionally, we suggest that the assessment of land use efficiency should not be confined to HDP production and instead an index or scoring system should be used that accounts for the textile products and ecosystem services (e.g., landscape conservation) of sheep farms. The latter can be quantified using data from agri-environmental schemes or farm surveys and would provide additional important information on the environmental benefits of sheep farming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aanimal production 3abody weight 3acarbon footprint 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3acase studies 3adigestible protein 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aeutrophication 3afarm surveys 3afarming systems 3afossil fuels 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse gases 3ahills 3ahumans 3aland use 3alandscape management 3alife cycle assessment 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameat 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aproduction technology 3asheep 3asurpluses 3atextile products 0aSustainability 0aGrazing 0aLivestock 0aClimate change 0aLamb1 aBohan, A.1 aMcHugh, N.1 aShalloo, L.0 tAgricultural systems.g2016 Oct., v. 148 p.95-104dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2016.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014700175300001800322520172600340592002802066650002702094650001602121650002902137650002102166650001602187650001502203650002202218650001702240650001102257650002002268650000902288650002202297650001402319650001602333650001302349651001102362651001802373653002902391653003502420653003902455653001302494653002102507653001402528700002502542700002002567700002502587700002102612700001102633700003102644700002002675700002502695700001902720700002302739700002702762773009902789856008602888852000902974655001202983IND60562610320221122233056.0190319e20170313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056261032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaha, Muhamed-Kheir10aBactericidal activity of sera from adolescents vaccinated with bivalent rLP2086 against meningococcal serogroup B outbreak strains from France  ap. 1530-1537.  aBivalent rLP2086 (Trumenba®; MenB-FHbp), composed of two factor H binding proteins (FHbps), is a vaccine approved in the United States for prevention of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). Bactericidal activity of sera from subjects vaccinated with bivalent rLP2086 was assessed against MnB isolates from recent disease outbreaks in France.MnB isolates from IMD cases were characterized by whole genome sequencing and FHbp expression was assessed using a flow cytometry-based assay. Sera from subjects (11–<19years old) vaccinated with bivalent rLP2086 at 0, 2, and 6months were evaluated. Bactericidal activity was measured in serum bactericidal assays using human complement (hSBAs). The response rate (RR) represents the percentage of subjects with an hSBA titer ⩾1:4.The six MnB outbreak isolates expressed diverse FHbp variants: A22, B03, B24 (two isolates), B44, and B228. FHbp expression levels ranged from 1309 to 8305 (mean fluorescence intensity units). The RR of preimmune sera from subjects was 7% to 27%. RRs increased for all isolates after each vaccine dose. After two doses, RRs ranged from 40% to 93%. After dose 3, RRs were ⩾73% for all isolates (range, 73%–100%).Each of the representative French outbreak isolates was killed by sera from subjects vaccinated with bivalent rLP2086. Vaccination elicited an immune response with bactericidal activity against these diverse isolates in a large proportion of subjects at risk. These results provide additional support for the licensure strategy of testing MnB strains expressing vaccine-heterologous FHbp variants in hSBAs and further illustrate the breadth of efficacy of this protein-based MnB vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeisseria meningitidis 3aadolescents 3aantibacterial properties 3abinding proteins 3ablood serum 3acomplement 3adisease outbreaks 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aFrance 3aUnited States 0aFactor H binding protein 0aInvasive meningococcal disease 0aNeisseria meningitidis serogroup B 0aOutbreak 0aBivalent rLP2086 0aMenB-FHbp1 aHawkins, Julio Cesar1 aLiberator, Paul1 aDeghmane, Ala-Eddine1 aAndrew, Lubomira1 aHaoli,1 aJones, T.

The prevalence of the species was 18.7%. Mature spores were rounded from a frontal view, with elongated polar capsules of equal size, and had polar filaments with 9–10 turns. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that sporogenesis patterns followed those of other Myxobolus species. The plasmodium walls had numerous invaginations and protrusions, and few pinocytic channels. Numerous mitochondria, generative cells and young pansporoblasts were observed in the peripherical areas of the plasmodia, and mature spores were found in deeper layers. A layer of collagenic fibrils surrounded the plasmodia. The morphological data and molecular analysis of the 18S rDNA identified this parasite as a new species. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree showed M. curimatae n. sp., as a sister species of Thelohanellus marginatus, in a basal branch of the subclade composed by parasites with tropism to different organs and host families.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyxobolus 3aProchilodus 3amitochondria 3anew species 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3arivers 3aspores 3asporulation 3aultrastructure 3aBrazil 0aMyxosporea 0aMyxobolus curimatae 0aUltrastructure 0a18S rDNA 0aPhylogeny1 aNaldoni, Juliana1 aSilva, Márcia R.M.1 aMaia, Antônio A.M.1 aAdriano, Edson A.0 tParasitology international.g2015 Oct., v. 64, no. 5 p.362-368dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2015.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010400168300001400272520180600286592002802092650002002120650000802140650002202148650001302170650001102183650002302194650001102217650002002228650001702248650001002265650004102275650001002316650001102326650002602337650001202363650002502375650001402400650002202414651001002436653001702446653001702463653001602480653001202496653001902508653001202527700002102539700002602560700001902586773010502605856008702710852000902797655001202806IND60552523620221118013003.0161021e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055252362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2012.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgata, Jun10aDNA sequence analyses of blended herbal products including synthetic cannabinoids as designer drugs  ap. 33-41.  aIn recent years, various herbal products adulterated with synthetic cannabinoids have been distributed worldwide via the Internet. These herbal products are mostly sold as incense, and advertised as not for human consumption. Although their labels indicate that they contain mixtures of several potentially psychoactive plants, and numerous studies have reported that they contain a variety of synthetic cannabinoids, their exact botanical contents are not always clear. In this study, we investigated the origins of botanical materials in 62 Spice-like herbal products distributed on the illegal drug market in Japan, by DNA sequence analyses and BLAST searches. The nucleotide sequences of four regions were analyzed to identify the origins of each plant species in the herbal mixtures. The sequences of “Damiana” (Turnera diffusa) and Lamiaceae herbs (Mellissa, Mentha and Thymus) were frequently detected in a number of products. However, the sequences of other plant species indicated on the packaging labels were not detected. In a few products, DNA fragments of potent psychotropic plants were found, including marijuana (Cannabis sativa), “Diviner's Sage” (Salvia divinorum) and “Kratom” (Mitragyna speciosa). Their active constituents were also confirmed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS), although these plant names were never indicated on the labels. Most plant species identified in the products were different from the plants indicated on the labels. The plant materials would be used mainly as diluents for the psychoactive synthetic compounds, because no reliable psychoactive effects have been reported for most of the identified plants, with the exception of the psychotropic plants named above.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aInternet 3aMentha 3aMitragyna speciosa 3aSalvia 3aTurnera diffusa 3acannabinoids 3adrugs 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aherbs 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amarkets 3anucleotide sequences 3apackaging 3asequence analysis 3aJapan 0aBLAST search 0aDNA analysis 0aDNA barcode 0aGC–MS 0aHerbal product 0aLC–MS1 aUchiyama, Nahoko1 aKikura-Hanajiri, Ruri1 aGoda, Yukihiro0 tForensic science international.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 227 p.33-41dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2012.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245007400196300001600270520139000286592002801676650001301704650001901717650002101736650001301757650001301770650001601783650001301799650002301812650001001835650001901845650001101864650001101875650001201886650002501898650004301923650000901966650001201975650002201987650004502009650001902054650002802073700001602101700002402117700001502141700002702156700001502183700001402198773011602212856005502328852000902383655001202392IND4478919120221122165709.0120711e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447891912DNAL7 a219885462pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01921.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantiago‐Moreno, J10aInfluence of Season on the Freezability of Free‐Range Poultry Semen  ap. 578-583.  aThe purpose of the present study was to examine the seasonal variation in freezing damage in free‐range rooster sperm. Over a period of 1 year, heterospermic semen samples were collected weekly by massage from the roosters of 14 Spanish chicken breeds, all housed under natural photoperiod and climatic conditions. All samples were frozen in straws using DMA as a cryoprotectant, placing them first in nitrogen vapour and then plunging them into liquid nitrogen. No seasonal effects on fresh sperm quality were found. Neither did season affect the percentage of viable frozen–thawed spermatozoa nor the percentage with an intact acrosome. However, the collection season influenced (p < 0.05) most frozen–thawed sperm motility values. The percentage of immotile frozen–thawed spermatozoa was lower (p < 0.05) in spring‐collected sperm than in summer‐ or autumn‐collected samples. The percentage of spermatozoa showing progressive motility was higher in spring‐collected sperm compared with winter‐, summer‐ or autumn‐collected samples (p < 0.05). The curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight‐line velocity (VSL) and average path velocity (VAP) values of spring‐collected sperm were also higher (p < 0.05). In conclusion, spring would appear to be the best season for collecting and freezing the semen of free‐range Mediterranean chicken breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3achicken breeds 3aclimatic factors 3afreezing 3anitrogen 3aphotoperiod 3aroosters 3aseasonal variation 3asemen 3asperm motility 3aspring 3avapors 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aCryopreservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aSeasons 2aSemenxphysiology 2aSemen Preservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology1 aCastaño, C1 aToledano‐Díaz, A1 aColoma, MA1 aLópez‐Sebastián, A1 aPrieto, MT1 aCampo, JL0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2012 Aug., v. 47, no. 4 p.578-583dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01921.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245014300177300001600320520142500336592002801761650002001789650001901809650001501828650001101843650004101854650001701895650001901912650002101931650003201952650001301984650002101997650001102018650001802029650001002047651001102057653002002068653001202088653001902100653001002119653000902129653003502138700002602173700002002199700002202219700002902241773009202270856008602362852000902448655001202457IND60590687820221120182826.0190129e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059068782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapageorgiou, Myrsini10aDirect solid phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography – Mass spectrometry for the determination of biogenic amines in wine  ap. 276-282.  aA direct method based on immersion solid phase microextraction (DI-SPME) gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) was optimized and validated for the determination of 16 biogenic amines in Polish wines. In the analysis two internal standards were used: 1,7-diaminoheptane and bis-3-aminopropylamine. The method allows for simultaneous extraction and derivatization, providing a simple and fast mode of extraction and enrichment. Different parameters which affect the extraction procedure were studied and optimized including ionic strength (0–25%), fiber materials (PDMS/DVB, PDMS/DVD + OC, Polyacrylate, Carboxen/PDMS and DVB/CAR/PDMS) and timings of the extraction, derivatization and desorption processes. Validation studies confirmed the linearity, sensitivity, precision and accuracy of the method. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of 44 wine samples originating from several regions of Poland and 3 wine samples from other countries. Analysis showed that many of the samples contained all examined biogenic amines. The method, assessed using an Eco-Scale tool with satisfactory results, was found to be green in terms of hazardous chemicals and solvents usage, energy consumption and production of waste. Therefore the proposed method can be safely used in the wine industry for routine analysis of BAs in wine samples with a minimal detrimental impact on human health and the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenic amines 3aderivatization 3adesorption 3aenergy 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahuman health 3aionic strength 3apolyacrylic acid 3asolid phase microextraction 3asolvents 3atoxic substances 3awastes 3awine industry 3awines 3aPoland 0aBiogenic amines 0aDI-SPME 0aDerivatization 0aGC-MS 0aWine 0a(green chemistry or Eco-Scale)1 aLambropoulou, Dimitra1 aMorrison, Calum1 aNamieśnik, Jacek1 aPłotka-Wasylka, Justyna0 tTalanta.g2018 June 01, v. 183 p.276-282dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03578naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245011000208520239100318592002802709650002202737650001502759650001402774650002402788650001202812650001702824650001602841650001402857650001802871700003702889700004302926700003602969773012803005856008603133852000903219655001203228IND60754292420221119222217.0211023e20211019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075429242DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms91021742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalván Ramírez, Ma. de la Luzq(María de la Luz),10aEffect of 17β-Estradiol, Progesterone, and Tamoxifen on Neurons Infected with Toxoplasma gondii In Vitro  aToxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is the causal agent of toxoplasmosis, which produces damage in the central nervous system (CNS). Toxoplasma–CNS interaction is critical for the development of disease symptoms. T. gondii can form cysts in the CNS; however, neurons are more resistant to this infection than astrocytes. The probable mechanism for neuron resistance is a permanent state of neurons in the interface, avoiding the replication of intracellular parasites. Steroids regulate the formation of Toxoplasma cysts in mice brains. 17β-estradiol and progesterone also participate in the control of Toxoplasma infection in glial cells in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 17β-estradiol, progesterone, and their specific agonists–antagonists on Toxoplasma infection in neurons in vitro. Neurons cultured were pretreated for 48 h with 17β-estradiol or progesterone at 10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 nM/mL or tamoxifen 1 μM/mL plus 17β-estradiol at 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 nM/mL. In other conditions, the neurons were pretreated during 48 h with 4,4′,4″-(4-propyl-[1H] pyrozole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol or 23-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionitrile at 1 nM/mL, and mifepristone 1 µM/mL plus progesterone at 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 nM/mL. Neurons were infected with 5000 tachyzoites of the T. gondii strain RH. The effect of 17β estradiol, progesterone, their agonists, or antagonists on Toxoplasma infection in neurons was evaluated at 24 and 48 h by immunocytochemistry. T. gondii replication was measured with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay. 17β-Estradiol alone or plus tamoxifen reduced infected neurons (50%) compared to the control at 48 h. Progesterone plus estradiol decreased the number of intracellular parasites at 48 h of treatment compared to the control (p < 0.001). 4,4′,4″-(4-propyl-[1H] pyrozole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol and 23-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionitrile reduced infected neurons at 48 h of treatment significantly compared to the control (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). The Toxoplasma infection process was decreased by the effect of 17β-estradiol alone or combined with tamoxifen or progesterone in neurons in vitro. These results suggest the essential participation of progesterone and estradiol and their classical receptors in the regulation of T. gondii neuron infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aastrocytes 3aestradiol 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aneurons 3aprogesterone 3atachyzoites 3atamoxifen 3atoxoplasmosis1 aDueñas-Jiménez, Judith Marcela1 aGutiérrez-Maldonado, Adrián Fernando1 aRodríguez Pérez, Laura Rocío0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Oct. 19, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91021743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01328naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245009000167300001600257520044400273592002800717650001400745650002400759650001000783651002200793651001100815773013800826856007700964852000901041655001201050IND60524007720221116192243.0160701e20110819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052400772DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2011.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiwowarczyk, Renata10aOrobanche mayeri (Suess. & Ronniger) Bertsch & F.

Among the chiropterophilous flowering plants of the New World, Bromeliaceae is one of the most ecologically important families; however, information about the chiropterophilous interaction in this family is still scarce. Aims: We present a comprehensive review of bat pollination in bromeliads, covering floral traits, rewards offered to pollinators, floral attractants and the identity of visiting bat species. Methods: We discuss traits shared among chiropterophilous bromeliads and present general trends in an evolutionary context. We constructed a phylogenetic tree to elucidate the ancestral pollination syndromes of the 42 extant bromeliad species (ca. 1% of total) known to be bat-pollinated. Results: Most of the species within the ten genera reported belong to the Tillandsioideae subfamily, with three genera appearing to be exclusively bat-pollinated. Floral visitors include 19 bat species of 11 genera from the Phyllostomidae. Conclusions: Our analysis indicated that chiropterophilous floral features originated multiple times in bromeliad evolution, most probably from ornithophilous. The evidence for floral traits associated with bat pollination and the chiropterophilous syndrome presented by certain Bromeliaceae indicate the important role played by bats in the evolution of this plant family.  aThis work was supported by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT) by the grant number 59406 awarded to P.A.A.-R.  aPublisher supplied data  a59406cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007350 3aBromeliaceae 3aPhyllostomidae 3aattractants 3aphylogeny 3apollination 3apollinators 0aAnoura 0abromeliads 0achiropterophily 0afloral scent 0anectar 0aWerauhia1 aKrömer, Thorsten,1 aTschapka, Marco1 aGarcía-Franco, José G.,1 aEscobedo-Sarti, Jeanett1 aMacSwiney G., M.Cristina0 tPlant ecology & diversity.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 12, no. 1 p.1-19dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000135x1755-16687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2019.15664093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009100164520123300255592002801488650001601516650001101532650001801543650000901561650000701570650001401577650001901591650000901610650002101619653000901640653000701649653001001656653000901666653000801675653001401683653001001697653000801707653001001715653000901725653000901734653000801743653000901751653000701760653001001767653000801777653000901785653001001794653000801804653000901812653000901821653002201830653002101852653001501873653001501888653001901903700001901922700001301941700001801954700001401972773011401986856008602100852000902186655001202195IND60768835020221119060759.0220929e20220605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076883502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1285812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Song10aEfficient degradation of anthracene in soil by carbon-coated nZVI activated persulfate  aThe easy passivation defect of nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) greatly limits its application in site pollution remediation. Carbon coating can effectively inhibit the passivation of nZVI, but its effectiveness in the soil is still unknown. This study investigated the feasibility of carbon-coated nZVI (Fe⁰@C) as a persulfate (PS) activator to degrade anthracene (ANT) in soil. The results show that the Fe⁰@C/PS system can remove 51.6% of ANT in the soil after 0.5 h of reaction, and reach 76.4% after 12 h of reaction. Not only that, the Fe⁰@C/PS system shows a good removal effect on ANT within the initial pH range of 3–9. Free radical scavenging experiments show that superoxide radicals (O₂•⁻) and singlet oxygen (¹O₂) are mainly responsible for the removal of ANT, while O₂•⁻ may be mainly used as a precursor for the generation of ¹O₂. The activation of PS by Fe⁰@C can generate a large number of free radicals, and soil components (such as β-MnO₂) can promote the conversion of O₂•⁻ to ¹O₂. Furthermore, the possible degradation pathway of ANT was also proposed. The findings are of great significance to fill up the knowledge gaps in the application of nZVI in soil remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthracenes 3acarbon 3afree radicals 3airon 3apH 3apollution 3asinglet oxygen 3asoil 3asoil remediation 0anZVI 0aPS 0aFe0@C 0aPAHs 0aANT 0aSO4•− 0a•OH 0a1O2 0aO2·- 0aFe3+ 0aFe2+ 0aTBA 0aMeOH 0aBQ 0aDABCO 0aXRD 0aHPLC 0aGC-MS 0aEPR 0aTEMP 0aDMPO 0aCarbon-coated Fe0 0aSoil remediation 0aPersulfate 0aAnthracene 0aSinglet oxygen1 aTang, Jingchun1 aYu, Chen1 aLiu, Qinglong1 aWang, Lan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 June 05, v. 431 p.128581-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1285813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015500174300001800329520192900347592002802276650001602304650002202320650001202342650001902354650001902373650001302392650001302405650001402418650003102432650001602463650001302479653003502492653001802527653001202545653002102557653002402578700003102602700002402633700002002657700002202677773009902699856008602798852000902884655001202893IND60562610720221123021139.0190319e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056261072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuijts, Susanne M.10aPost-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial: Diabetes mellitus modifies the efficacy of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in elderly  ap. 4444-4449.  aThe 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate-vaccine (PCV13) was effective in preventing vaccine-type Community-Acquired Pneumonia (VT-CAP) and Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (VT-IPD) in elderly subjects, but vaccine efficacy (VE) in patients with comorbidities at time of vaccination is unknown.This is a post hoc analysis of the CAPiTA study, a double blind, randomized controlled trial with 84,496 immunocompetent participants aged ⩾65years, receiving PCV13 or placebo vaccination. Presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), heart disease, respiratory disease, liver disease, asplenia, and smoking at the time of immunization was verified on medical records in 139 subjects developing the primary endpoint of VT-CAP. Presence of DM and respiratory disease based on International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) coding was also determined in 40,427 subjects.In the 139 subjects developing VT-CAP, DM caused significant effect modification (p-value 0.002), yielding VE of 89.5% (95%CI, 65.5–96.8) and 24.7% (95%CI, −10.4 to 48.7) for those with and without DM, respectively. Comparable effect modification (p-value 0.020) was found in the 40,427 subjects with and without ICPC-based classification of DM with VE of 85.6% (95%CI, 36.7–96.7) and of 7.0% (95%CI, −58.5 to 45.5) respectively. Effect modification through respiratory disease was not statistically significant, although the point estimate of VE was lower for those with respiratory disease in both analyses. There was no evidence of effect modification in subjects stratified by heart disease, smoking, and presence of any comorbidity.Among immunocompetent elderly, VE of PCV13 was modified by DM with higher VE among subjects with DM. Significant effect modification was not observed for subjects with heart disease, respiratory disease, smoking, or presence of any comorbidity.CAPiTA trial registration number: www.ClinicalTrials.gov; trial number NCT00744263.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomorbidity 3adiabetes mellitus 3aelderly 3aheart diseases 3aliver diseases 3apatients 3aplacebos 3apneumonia 3arandomized clinical trials 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aPneumococcal conjugate vaccine 0aComorbidities 0aElderly 0aVaccine efficacy 0aEffect modification1 avan Werkhoven, Cornelis H.1 aBolkenbaas, Marieke1 aGrobbee, D.

Aims: Here, we tested the hypothesis that failure of sexual reproduction due to the absence of pollinators may contribute to the disjunct distribution of Iris ensata. Methods: We assessed floral traits and pollinator visitation frequencies in three native and two ex situ populations. We also conducted controlled pollination experiments and examined progeny performance to estimate pollen limitation (PL) and inbreeding depression. Results: Hand-pollinations indicated that I. ensata was a partially self-compatible outcrosser. Sexual reproduction in our study region depended on Bombus trifasciatus. We observed inbreeding depression for seed set and germination, but not for seedling survival. Native populations had higher frequencies of pollinator visitation and lower pollen-limitation of seed set than ex situ populations. Among populations, the magnitude of PL was negatively related to pollinator visitation rate (P = 0.04). Conclusions: Pollinator limitation and inbreeding depression may both restrict the southern distribution of I. ensata, preventing its northward expansion, thus explaining the disjunct distribution of I. ensata in East Asia.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Research & Development Program [2016YFC0503102]; Research Funds of Shanghai City Appearance & Environmental Sanitation Administration Bureau [F122424].  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0503102cNational Key Research & Development Program  aF122424cResearch Funds of Shanghai City Appearance & Environmental Sanitation Administration Bureau 3aBombus 3aIris ensata 3agermination 3ainbreeding depression 3apollen 3apollination 3apollinators 3aprogeny 3aseed set 3aseedlings 3asexual reproduction 3aEast Asia 0aBumblebee 0along nectary 0along-tongued pollinator limitation 0arestricted distribution1 aJin, Dongmei1 aJiang, Kai1 aHu, Yong-Hong1 aTong, Xin1 aMazer, Susan J.1 aChen, Xiao-Yong0 tPlant ecology & diversity.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 12, no. 1 p.21-35dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000135x1755-16687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2019.15691703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012200176300001600298520105300314592002801367650001501395650001101410650002001421650001101441650002001452650001101472650001301483650001901496650001301515650003301528650002501561650001901586650001001605653002101615653001801636653001301654653002101667653002001688700002301708773009101731856008601822852000901908655001201917IND60590688020221120213700.0201125e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059068802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFresco-Cala, Beatriz10aNanostructured hybrid monolith with integrated stirring for the extraction of UV-filters from water and urine samples  ap. 391-395.  aThis article presents a monolithic extraction unit with integrated stirring using carbon nanohorns and methacrylate-based compounds as monomers.

To achieve the integrated stirring unit, the monolith was grown over an ironware. Variables dealing with the polymerization mixture composition and the microextraction procedure were studied in depth. The resulting hybrid monolithic polymer was also characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen intrusion porosimetry. The target analytes were quantified by UPLC-DAD, and the limits of detection were between 1 and 10 μg/L. The precision of the method (inter extraction units) expressed as relative standard deviation ranged from 5.4% and 7.9%. Also, relative recoveries values of the analyte spiked to swimming pool water and urine samples varied in the interval 72–124 and 71–114%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3amicroextraction 3amixing 3anitrogen 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astatistical analysis 3aswimming pools 3aurine 0aCarbon nanohorns 0aBenzophenones 0aStir bar 0aMonolithic solid 0aMicroextraction1 aCárdenas, Soledad0 tTalanta.g2018 May 15, v. 182 p.391-395dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004200099040001800141100002300159245006400182300001400246520134400260592002801604650000901632700001601641700001801657773010701675852000901782856008901791655001201880991613289660742620221121104524.0181002e197808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891367132DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-197808000-000032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWANG, THOMAS S.

Formulation A contained fewer trihydroxyphenolic compounds and more dihydroxypenolic compounds than formulation B. They were added separately to two portions of a neutralized latosol low in organic matter content at five separate times. The polymerization of the compounds was catalyzed by the soil and traced by paper chromatography. At the end of this part of the experiment, the two portions of the soil were extracted with (1) benzene-95 percent alcohol: 1–1, (2) 0.1 N HC1, (3) 0.1 M Na4P2O7 at pH 7.0, and (4) 0.5 N NaOH in sequence. The model humins were also extracted after treating the soils with HC1-HF Solution. The model HAs and FAs extracted resemble the natural ones in color, solubility in acid and alkali, infrared spectra, etc. In the benzene-95 percent alcohol extract of the soil treated with formulation A, aromatic polymer was the main component, while in that treated with formulation B, aliphatic polymer predominated. The percentage of conversion of the total compounds added to the soil in the two formulations into polymers was a little over 63 percent. The nitrogen found in model HAs was 1.51–3.03 percent and in the model FAs 0.59–1.23 percent.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil1 aLI, SONG WU1 aHuang, P.

These disorders include albinism, leucism, and piebaldism, and can be differentiated based on the pattern and degree of lack of pigmentation. For many species, these disorders persist in nature, suggesting that affected animals can survive and potentially reproduce. Here we report a case of albinism in a Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) captured from a cave dwelling in Cuba. In addition to describing this albino individual's morphological characteristics, we recorded acoustical parameters of echolocation calls during foraging in a flight chamber. We found that the albino individual emits high-frequency multi-harmonic calls with short durations, which are characteristic of this species and other phyllostomid bats. We discuss potential acoustical adaptations in albino bats that could facilitate their survival and suggest future approaches to studying these unique animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtibeus jamaicensis 3aacoustics 3aalbino 3aecholocation 3aflight 3afruits 3apigmentation 3avertebrates 3aCaribbean 3aCuba1 aPollock, Tyler1 aSánchez, Lida1 aMora, Emanuel C.0 tCaribbean journal of science.g2020 Feb. 3, v. 50, no. 1 p.1-8dUniversity of Puerto Rico at MayagüezwJournal:12974x0008-64527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18475/cjos.v50i1.a13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245018300172520193900355592002802294650002402322650002702346650001902373650001602392650001002408650001002418650000902428650002602437650001202463650001102475650001802486650002402504650002302528650001802551650001902569650001102588650001802599650001802617650003202635650001602667650001902683650002002702650002602722650001902748653001302767653002302780653003202803700001602835700001502851700001802866700002002884700001902904700002102923700001402944700001502958773009902973856009003072852000903162655001203171IND60673916620221122035417.0200210e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067391662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qingyang10aGrowth performance and biochemical composition dynamics of ovary, hepatopancreas and muscle tissues at different ovarian maturation stages of female mud crab, Scylla paramamosain  aMud crab (Scylla paramamosain) is an economically important crustacean species due to its high market price, especially females with mature ovaries. Therefore, it is vital to better understand the growth performance and biochemical composition dynamics of ovary at different maturation stages. To accomplish this, one hundred female mud crabs were obtained and their morphometric characters, ovary morphology and weight were analysed. Further, the biochemical composition dynamics of ovary, hepatopancreas and muscle tissues at various ovarian maturation stages were compared. The ovarian maturation process of S. paramamosain is divided into five developmental stages based on coloration and size. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) and six growth traits increased with ovarian maturation stages. Protein content was found constant in ovary throughout all stages, and the lipid content was similar in all three tissues. Total carotenoid content in ovary tissues increased with maturation stages whereas no significant difference was observed in the hepatopancreas and muscle tissues across stages. Highly-unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) was the dominant group in all three tissues. Ovarian saturated fatty acid (SFA), mono-unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and HUFA increased with maturation stages whereas ovarian essential amino acids (EAA) increased significantly during initial vitellogenesis and oogenesis stage (stage II and III). Glutamate was the dominant amino acids in all three tissues throughout maturation stages. There was no significant difference in the individual amino acid composition, flavor amino acids (FAA) and EAA profiles of hepatopancreas and muscle tissues across maturation stages. The knowledge of growth performance and biochemical composition dynamics across ovarian maturation stages should be helpful for the establishment of suitable broodstock diet that would promote ovarian maturation and better larval quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScylla paramamosain 3aamino acid composition 3abreeding stock 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3acrabs 3adiet 3aessential amino acids 3afemales 3aflavor 3aglutamic acid 3agonadosomatic index 3agrowth performance 3agrowth traits 3ahepatopancreas 3alarvae 3alipid content 3amarket prices 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3amorphometry 3amuscle tissues 3aprotein content 3asaturated fatty acids 3avitellogenesis 0aMud crab 0aOvarian maturation 0aAmino acids and fatty acids1 aWaiho, Khor1 aHuang, Zhi1 aLi, Shengkang1 aZheng, Huaiping1 aZhang, Yueling1 aIkhwanuddin, Mhd1 aLin, Feng1 aMa, Hongyu0 tAquaculture.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 515 p.734560-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008900206300002000295520149300315592002801808596005901836650001701895650001901912650001701931650001501948650002501963650002601988650003002014650002202044650001402066650002902080650001302109650002802122651001902150700001802169700002202187700002402209700001602233773015502249856008302404852000902487655001202496IND60794717420221117064947.0220927e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079471742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20692-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObuobi, Bright1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5271-742010aRenewable energy demand, financial reforms, and environmental quality in West Africa  ap. 69540-69554.  aSustainable Development Goal (SDG-7) stipulates the need for clean energy, reduced carbon dioxide emissions, prevention of environmental degradation, promotion of biodiversity, and ecosystem preservation. Toward achieving these goals, this study provides new evidence on the causal link between renewable energy demand, financial reforms, economic growth, foreign direct investment, and environmental quality among emerging West African economies. The study adopted the fully modified ordinary least squares, dynamic ordinary least squares, pooled mean group estimation, and Granger causality test for its analysis. It was found that renewable energy demand has been favorable to the environmental health of West African economies. Also, financial reforms made within the region contributed to increasing the ecological footprints of the region. Direct investments from foreigners showed encouraging results as they improved the quality of the environment. We also found a unidirectional causality from ecological footprints to renewable energy demand and financial reforms but a bidirectional relationship with economic growth and foreign direct investment. Moreover, it was evident that ecological footprints Granger cause financial reforms and economic growth but not vice versa. Policy recommendations outlined encourage governments and policymakers to embark on intensive clean energy technologies and effective green financial reforms to help achieve Sustainable Development Goals.  aPublisher supplied data  a72072154cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abiodiversity 3acarbon dioxide 3aclean energy 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental quality 3aforeign direct investment 3aissues and policy 3apollution 3arenewable energy sources 3aresearch 3asustainable development 3aWestern Africa1 aZhang, Yifeng1 aNketiah, Emmanuel1 aAdu-Gyamfi, Gibbson1 aCudjoe, Dan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Oct., v. 29, no. 46 p.69540-69554dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20692-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011600160300002000276520144800296592002801744650003401772650002201806650002201828650002801850650002601878650001901904650001401923650001401937700002601951700002001977700001901997700002202016700001902038700001802057700001802075773012402093856007402217852000902291655001202300IND60640334520221121005016.0190504e20160311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064033452DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra28074e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, Hari Mohan10aObservation of large dielectric permittivity and dielectric relaxation phenomenon in Mn-doped lanthanum gallate  ap. 26621-26629.  aPolycrystalline LaGa₁₋ₓMnₓO₃ (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.3) samples were prepared via the solid-state reaction method. These samples were characterized using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). XRD studies confirm the orthorhombic structure for the prepared samples whereas XANES analysis reveals the co-existence of Mn³⁺ and Mn⁴⁺ in all Mn-doped samples. Dielectric relaxation is observed for all Mn-doped samples whereas a large dielectric constant (ε′) is perceived in samples with higher Mn doping (x = 0.2 and x = 0.3). Occurrence of a large ε′ is attributed to the huge decrease in impedance with increasing Mn doping which is governed by the hopping charge transport and extrinsic interface effects, whereas at high frequencies, this effect is observed possibly due to dipolar effects associated with the possible off-centrosymmetry of the MnO₆ octahedron which is indicated by the pre-edge feature (Mn K-edge) in XANES and validated through P–E measurements. The appearance of dielectric relaxation was credited to the dipolar effects associated with the flipping of the Mn³⁺/Mn⁴⁺ dipole i.e., with the hopping of charge carriers between Mn³⁺ and Mn⁴⁺ under an external electric field. The value of activation energy (Eₐ = 0.36 eV), extracted from temperature-dependent dielectric data, reveals the polaron hopping mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3adielectric permittivity 3adielectric properties 3aelectric field 3alanthanum 3amanganese1 aSaxena, Shailendra K.1 aLate, Ravikiran1 aMishra, Vikash1 aRajput, Parasmani1 aSagdeo, Archna1 aKumar, Rajesh1 aSagdeo, P.

The performance of the catalysts was investigated by the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to ethanol. The catalysts were characterized by N₂ adsorption–desorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, H₂ temperature-programmed reduction, temperature programmed surface reaction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results revealed that addition of 0.2–0.4 wt% Cr to Rh/SiO₂ increased its activity significantly. However, further addition of 0.1–0.2 wt% Fe lowered CO conversion slightly, while the selectivity towards ethanol was enhanced significantly. Therefore, high catalytic activity and selectivity toward ethanol were achieved by simultaneous introduction of 0.4 wt% Cr and 0.2 wt% Fe to Rh/SiO₂. This may be due to improved dispersion of Rh particles, moderate ability to dissociate CO molecules, and high ratio of Rh⁺ sites to Rh⁰ sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achromium 3aethanol 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3airon 3anitrogen 3asilica 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aChen, Weimiao1 aSong, Xiangen1 aCheng, Xianbo1 aDing, Yunjie0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 11, v. 6, no. 42 p.35348-35353dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra28075c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245010600212300001600318520196000334592002802294650001102322650001402333650001002347650001102357650001402368650001202382650001302394650001402407650000902421650001802430650002002448650000902468653003102477653002702508653002702535653002102562653001902583653003302602653001202635653002202647700002202669700006402691773015202755856008602907852000902993655001203002IND60532097420221119173438.0190214e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053209742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFresnillo, Belén1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0442-115510aOntogenetic shifts in risk behaviours are related to body size and coloration in spiny-footed lizards  ap. 165-172.  aOntogenetic colour changes in animals generally involve cryptic juveniles developing conspicuous coloration when they achieve sexual maturity. However, there are several species in which juveniles develop conspicuously coloured tails that become cryptic in adults. In lizards, colourful tails may act as an antipredator mechanism, either by diverting predator attacks from vital body parts to the expendable tail (decoy hypothesis) or, when associated with tail movements, by signalling to the potential predator that it has been spotted and an attack will probably not succeed (pursuit deterrent hypothesis). In both cases, the antipredator function would allow lizards with colourful tails to show more risk-taking behaviours. The aim of this study was to test whether conspicuous coloration was related to risk behaviours in spiny-footed lizards, Acanthodactylus erythrurus, a species with red-tailed juveniles. Behaviour was recorded in free-ranging lizards and several risk-related behavioural indices were calculated. As predicted, risk behaviour and tail coloration were found to be related, as redder (less orange) lizards stayed further from refuge, maybe because redder coloration was associated with a perception of lower predation risk. Coloration was not related to any other behavioural index, including tail displays, but the level of activity was negatively related to lizard size, suggesting a change towards less active behaviour associated with growth, probably because energy and thermoregulatory requirements depend on body size. In conclusion, the link between red coloration and risk-taking behaviour in spiny-footed lizards supports the antipredator function of this coloration that enables more colourful lizards to take more risks when necessary. Moreover, the nonsignificant association between coloration and tail displays is not consistent with the pursuit deterrent hypothesis, thus making the decoy hypothesis more probable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody size 3acolor 3aenergy 3ajuveniles 3alizards 3aontogeny 3apredation 3arisk 3arisk behavior 3asexual maturity 3atail 0aAcanthodactylus erythrurus 0aantipredator mechanism 0aconspicuous coloration 0adecoy hypothesis 0apredation risk 0apursuit deterrent hypothesis 0areptile 0aspectrophotometer1 aBelliure, Josabel1 aCuervo, José Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7943-78350 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Sept., v. 119 p.165-172dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245007300214300001800287506007600305520134900381592002801730506003701758650001701795650001301812650001601825650002201841650001701863650002001880650002501900650001901925650002801944650003501972650001002007650001602017650002402033650001302057653001702070653002202087653003402109653001202143653002002155653001302175653001202188653001302200653001302213653001702226653002202243653002202265653001002287700002602297700002202323700002602345700002402371700002302395773009902418856008602517852000902603655001202612IND60562611320221207065652.0190319e20170307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056261132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0782doi7 aPMC55483902pmcid7 a281894002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaid, Daniel J.10aHeritability of vaccine-induced measles neutralizing antibody titers  ap. 1390-1394.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding how genetics influences inter-individual variation of antibody titers in response to measles vaccination is vital to understanding possible sources of vaccine failure as well as improved vaccine development. Although it is recognized that both the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and the immunoglobulin allotype genes play significant roles in immune response, there is significant variation in antibody titers that is not explained by these genes. To obtain a more complete estimate of the role of the entire genome, we used a large panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms to estimate the heritability of antibody response to measles vaccine. Based on 935 subjects with European ancestry, we estimated the heritability to be 49% (standard error 0.17). We also estimated the heritability attributable to each chromosome, and found a large range in chromosome-specific heritabilities. Notably, chromosome 1 had the largest estimate (28%), while chromosome 6, which harbors HLA, had an estimated heritability of 13%. Compared with a prior study of twins in the same community, which resulted in a heritability estimate of 88.5%, our study suggests there are either many rare genetic variants, or many common genetic variants of small effect sizes that contribute to variations of antibody titers in response to measles vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHLA antigens 3aancestry 3achromosomes 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin genes 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atwins 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines 0aHeritability 0aGenetic variation 0aGenome-wide association study 0aMeasles 0aMeasles vaccine 0aImmunity 0aHumoral 0aImmunity 0aCellular 0aPolymorphism 0aSingle nucleotide 0aGenetic variation 0aAdult1 aHaralambieva, Iana H.1 aLarrabee, Beth R.1 aOvsyannikova, Inna G.1 aKennedy, Richard B.1 aPoland, Gregory A.0 tVaccine.g2017 Mar. 07, v. 35, no. 10 p.1390-1394dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013800169300001600307520182600323592002802149650004402177650002202221650002502243650002102268650001102289650001402300650001702314650002602331650002002357650001502377650001802392650001902410650001602429650002302445650001402468650001902482650001802501650001402519650000702533650001302540650002702553650001002580650001602590650002102606650003802627650003702665650003702702650001902739653001702758653003602775653002902811653001102840653002202851700001602873700001502889700001402904700001702918773009102935856008603026852000903112655001203121IND60590688620221120213732.0201125e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059068862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xiaoxiao10aPreparation of ionic liquid modified magnetic metal-organic frameworks composites for the solid-phase extraction of α–chymotrypsin  ap. 484-491.  aA novel magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) method based on 1-hexyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride ionic liquid (IL) modified magnetic Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles, hydroxylated multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-OH) and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) nanocomposites (Fe₃O₄-MWCNTs-OH@ZIF-67@IL) were proposed and applied to extract α–chymotrypsin. The magnetic materials were synthesized successfully and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and zeta potentials. Subsequently, the UV–vis spectrophotometer at about 280 nm was utilized to quantitatively analyze the α–chymotrypsin concentration in the supernatant. Furthermore, single factor experiments revealed that the extraction capacity was influenced by initial α–chymotrypsin concentration, ionic strength, extraction time, extraction temperature and pH value. The extraction capacity could reach up to about 635 mg g⁻¹ under the optimized conditions, absolutely higher than that of extraction for Ovalbumin (OVA), Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Bovine hemoglobin (BHb). In addition, the regeneration studies showed Fe₃O₄-MWCNTs-OH@ZIF-67@IL particles could be reused several times and kept a high extraction capacity. Besides, the study of enzymatic activity also indicated that the activity of the extracted α–chymotrypsin was well maintained 93% of initial activity. What's more, the proposed method was successfully applied to extract α–chymotrypsin in porcine pancreas crude extract with satisfactory results. All of above conclusions highlight the great potential of the proposed Fe₃O₄-MWCNTs-OH@ZIF-67@IL-MSPE method in the analysis of biomolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abovine serum albumin 3acarbon nanotubes 3acattle 3achlorides 3achymotrypsin 3acoordination polymers 3aenzyme activity 3ahemoglobin 3aionic liquids 3aionic strength 3airon oxides 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aovalbumin 3apH 3apancreas 3asolid phase extraction 3aswine 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential 0aIonic liquid 0aMagnetic solid-phase extraction 0aMetal-organic frameworks 0aZIF-67 0aα–chymotrypsin1 aWang, Yuzhi1 aChen, Jing1 aXu, Panli1 aZhou, Yigang0 tTalanta.g2018 May 15, v. 182 p.484-491dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008800176500002200264500002200286520145300308592002801761650001301789650001301802650001301815650001101828650001201839653002001851653001301871653001901884653003701903700001401940700001401954700001701968773007801985856008402063852000902147655001202156IND60609710720221119101330.0180823s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060971072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2017.12.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Gandarillas, L.10aCompaction properties of dry granulated powders based on Drucker–Prager Cap model  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aDry granulation by roll compaction is a process of size enlargement used to produce granules with a good flowability for further die compaction process. To gain in the understanding of how granulated powders behave during die compaction and why they exhibit different behaviors different from those showed by the feed powder, the main material parameters proposed in Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) model, were determined for MCC101 powder and two granule sizes obtained from roll-compacted ribbons. For that, the standard procedure calibration of DPC was used.Results showed that all the material properties are density-dependent and the properties of feed powder are higher than those of granulated powder. Moreover, the yield hardening function showed a decrease with the increase of the granule size, which highlighted that the granules of MCC 101 exhibit a softer work hardening than feed powders. Overall, the granules have smaller yield surface than the feed powder. Particularly, it was found, for both granule sizes and the MCC 101 powder, an overlapping of shear failure line at high relative density. Nevertheless, at low density, the cohesion was affected by the roll compaction of MCC 101, but no variation was observed for the internal friction angle. The obtained results are in agreement with the literature, where the granules were prepared from mini-tablets rather than from roll-compaction. However, some discrepancies were highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3afriction 3agranules 3amodels 3apowders 0aRoll compaction 0aGranules 0aDie compaction 0aDrucker–Prager cap (DPC) model1 aMazor, A.1 aLecoq, O.1 aMichrafy, A.0 tPowder technology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.12.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245011900207300002000326520150000346592002801846650001201874650001101886650001701897650002201914650001701936650002201953650001001975650001101985650002701996650001402023650001102037650002502048650002402073650002902097650001702126650000902143651001202152700002002164773015502184856008302339852000902422655001202431IND60794717920221117065243.0220927e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079471792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20760-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaadaoui, Haifa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7218-229110aExploring the inter-factor and inter-fuel substitution possibilities in Tunisia: the potential of renewable energy  ap. 70448-70463.  aTunisia is among the developing countries that have taken initiatives to develop renewable energy and strengthen energy efficiency. Moreover, it has considerable potential, especially in the field of wind and solar energy. However, the country is still dependent on fossil fuel energy. In this context, the transition to renewable energy is considered one of the possible solutions to reduce energy dependence and strengthen the economy in general. Therefore, the aim of this research study is to evaluate the role of renewable energy in shaping the energy transition in Tunisia in order to qualify the possibilities of energy transition. Accordingly, we investigate the potential for substitution between the following factors and fuels: Capital, labor, renewable, and non-renewable energy in Tunisia using a translog production function approach. Due to the multicollinearity of the model, the ridge regression method is used to estimate the parameters of the function. The obtained results showed that the possibility of substitution between inputs, especially between renewable and non-renewable energy, can replace fossil fuels with clean energy consumption. Moreover, to maximize the potential of renewable energy in Tunisia, this study recommends that policy makers should take more reliable measures to reflect the exact price of energy through price regulation measures, encourage investment in research and development, and introduce carbon taxes that could accelerate this transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon 3aclean energy 3aenergy efficiency 3afossil fuels 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3amodels 3anonrenewable resources 3apollution 3aprices 3aproduction functions 3aregression analysis 3aresearch and development 3asolar energy 3awind 3aTunisia1 aChtourou, Nouri0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Oct., v. 29, no. 46 p.70448-70463dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20760-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001200156245010000168300001300268520140400281592002801685650001801713650001601731650001001747650002101757650001201778650001301790650001701803650001601820650001001836650001501846650001401861650001801875650001901893650002201912650001401934653001501948653001401963653001601977653002401993653000902017653002902026653002202055700001802077700001802095700001902113700001502132700001102147700001102158700001902169700001502188700001802203700001402221700001302235700001502248700001502263700001602278700001902294700001802313700001702331700001302348773009002361856009102451852000902542655001202551IND60635090220221119160524.0190425e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063509022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Hao10aBioinspired nanoplatelets for chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer metastasis inhibition  ap. 1-12.  aBreast cancer is associated with high mortality due to tumor metastasis. The anti-metastasis efficacy of photochemotherapy is strictly limited by poor targeting capability with respect to circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood and lymph. Herein, we decorate the platelet membrane (PM) on a surface of nanoparticles (NPs), referred to as nanoplatelets. A chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (DOX), and an FDA-approved photothermal agent, indocyanine green (ICG), are co-encapsulated into the biomimetic nanoplatelets. Nanoplatelets possess immune surveillance-escaping capability and specifically capture and clear CTCs in both blood and lymphatic circulations via high-affinity interactions between the P-Selectin of PM and CD44 receptors of tumor cells. PM-coated NPs show greater cellular uptake in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and further elicit higher cytotoxicity to tumor cells relative to uncoated NPs. In vivo, we disclose that the multifunctional nanoplatelets not only completely ablate the primary tumor but also inhibit breast cancer metastasis with high efficiency in the three established xenograft or orthotopic breast tumor-bearing mice models. We conclude that such biomimetic nanoplatelets represent a promising strategy of coating a surface of nanoparticles with platelet membrane to actively capture and destroy CTCs in blood and lymph in breast cancer anti-metastasis therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abiomimetics 3ablood 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acoatings 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3alymph 3ametastasis 3amortality 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aphotochemotherapy 3areceptors 0aBiomimetic 0aDoxorubin 0aIndocyanine 0aP-Selectin and CD44 0aCTCs 0aBreast cancer metastasis 0aPlatelet membrane1 aWang, Kaiyuan1 aWang, Menglin1 aLiu, Rongzheng1 aSong, Hang1 aLi, Na1 aLu, Qi1 aZhang, Wenjuan1 aDu, Yuqian1 aYang, Wenqian1 aZhong, Lu1 aWang, Yu1 aYu, Bohong1 aWang, Hong1 aKan, Qiming1 aZhang, Haotian1 aWang, Yongjun1 aHe, Zhonggui1 aSun, Jin0 tBiomaterials.g2019 June, v. 206 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010900158300002000267520178800287592002802075650002202103650000802125650001202133650001302145650001302158650002302171650001602194650002802210650001702238650001502255650001002270650001302280650001402293650001102307650001602318650002202334700001202356700001902368700002702387773014402414856007402558852000902632655001202641IND60642575920221119044152.0190507e20170711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064257592DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta03381h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhesheng10aBismuth-doped La₁.₇₅Sr₀.₂₅NiO₄₊δ as a novel cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells  ap. 14012-14019.  aBismuth has been doped into mixed ionic–electronic conducting La₁.₇₅Sr₀.₂₅NiO₄₊δ (LSN) with the 2D K₂NiF₄-type structure to evaluate its influence on various properties of the host material, which include its potential use as a SOFC cathode. X-ray powder diffraction indicates that LSN retains its tetragonal structure after doping with 5 mol% bismuth to form La₁.₆₅Bi₀.₁Sr₀.₂₅NiO₄₊δ (LSN–Bi). Bismuth doping profoundly lowers (by ∼150 °C) the sintering temperature of LSN. Both LSN and LSN–Bi show excellent compatibility with electrolytes yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and samaria-doped ceria (SDC) in terms of thermal expansion and chemical reactivity (<900 °C). The electrical conductivity of both materials is metallic like and reaches values of 99.3 S cm⁻¹ and 100.3 S cm⁻¹ at 550 °C for LSN and LSN–Bi, respectively. The data from electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurements demonstrate that the substitution of lanthanum by bismuth enhances the chemical diffusion coefficient (Dcₕₑₘ) and surface exchange coefficient (kcₕₑₘ) by factors of 2–3. The faster kinetics of oxygen transport exhibited by LSN–Bi relative to parent LSN is reflected by a lower polarization resistance of the former when the electrode performance of both materials is compared in symmetric cells. The corresponding values at 700 °C are 4.2 Ω cm² and 0.61 Ω cm² for LSN and LSN–Bi, respectively. High peak power densities are achieved (328 mW cm⁻² and 131 mW cm⁻² at 700 and 600 °C, respectively), when LSN–Bi is incorporated as the cathode in a fuel cell operated with humidified hydrogen as the fuel and air as the cathode gas. The material is considered a promising candidate for further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3abismuth 3acathodes 3aceramics 3achemical reactions 3adiffusivity 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3alanthanum 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3athermal expansion1 aLi, Mei1 aXia, Changrong1 aBouwmeester, H.

However, due to their preparation/functionalization shortcomings (laborious and time-consuming), poor flexibility and compatibility, and limited paradigm, it is still a big challenge whether simple molecules can be used to achieve comprehensive and universal applications from sensing to information storage and protection. Herein, we for the first time demonstrated a molecular paradigm—computer-like “basic input output system (BIOS)” which can realize “plug-and-play” sensing, information encoding, molecular cryptography, and steganography based on a simple artificial molecule (p-nitrophenol, PNP). Based on its molecular recognition and inherent chemical identities, PNP was utilized for colorimetric detection of multiple metal ions (Hg²⁺, Fe³⁺, Al³⁺, Cr³⁺) and distinguishing their valence (like Cr³⁺/Cr⁶⁺, Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺). Interestingly, PNP can achieve the “plug-and-play” fluorescent expansion of detection channels by directly mixing with fluorescent molecules, indicating that PNP molecule can be served as a molecular BIOS with flexibility and compatibility. Impressively, the selectivity embedded in PNP-based BIOS sensing system can be developed as molecular-level double cryptographic steganography to encode, encrypt and hide specific information (like the content of classical literature). This research not only provides a basic idea for building a molecular paradigm with “plug-and-play” flexibility and compatibility, but also provides ideas for the use of molecular sensing and informatization to open up the digitalization of the molecular world.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acolorimetry 3afluorescence 3ainformation storage 3ap-nitrophenol 0aNitrophenol 0aColorimetric and fluorescent detection 0aDetection of multiple metal ions 0aMolecular cryptography and steganography 0aMolecular informatization 0aPlug-and-play1 aBu, Zhen Qi1 aQuan, Min Xia1 aWu, Ying1 aDing, Xuezhi1 aXia, Li Qiu1 aLu, Jiao Yang1 aHuang, Wei Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2779-55470 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 209 p.114260-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2022.1142603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245008600204300002000290520180100310592002802111650001502139650002402154650002202178650001402200650003002214650001102244650001502255650001502270650002502285653003302310653002902343653002102372653001802393653000802411653001102419700002002430700001802450773014202468856007902610852000902689655001202698IND60759324620221117222147.0211208e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075932462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c173782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaafreh, Russlan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5023-770610aLattice Thermal Conductivity: An Accelerated Discovery Guided by Machine Learning  ap. 57204-57213.  aIn the present work, we used machine learning (ML) techniques to build a crystal-based model that can predict the lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) of crystalline materials. To achieve this, first, LTCs of 119 compounds at various temperatures (100–1000 K) were obtained based on density functional theory (DFT) and phonon calculations, and then, these data were employed in the next learning process to build a predictive model using various ML algorithms. The ML results showed that the model built based on the random forest (RF) algorithm with an R² score of 0.957 was the most accurate compared with the models built using other algorithms. Additionally, the accuracy of this model was validated using new cases of four compounds, which was not seen for the model before, where a good matching between calculated and predicted LTCs of the new compounds was found. To find candidates with ultralow LTCs (<1 W m–¹ K–¹) at room temperature, the model was used to screen compounds (32116) in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. From the screened compounds, Cs₂SnI₆ and SrS were selected to validate the ML prediction using the counterpart theoretical calculations (DFT and phonon), and it was found that the outcome behaviors by both methods (ML prediction and DFT/phonon calculations) are fairly consistent. Considering the type of employed feature, the prime novelty in this work is that the built model can credibly predict the LTC–temperature behaviors of new compounds that are constructed based on prototype structures and chemical compositions, without the use of any DFT-relaxed structure parameters. Accordingly, using the periodic table, prototype structures, and the RF-based model, the LTC–temperature behavior of a huge number of compounds can be predicated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aambient temperature 3acrystal structure 3adatabases 3adensity functional theory 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprototypes 3athermal conductivity 0alattice thermal conductivity 0athermoelectric materials 0amachine learning 0arandom forest 0aDFT 0aphonon1 aKang, Yoo Seong1 aHamad, Kotiba0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 13, no. 48 p.57204-57213dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c173783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245015400165300002000319500001900339520154600358592002801904650001301932650003001945650002401975650001201999700005802011700002002069700001602089700001302105700005602118700005602174773013802230856008002368852000902448655001202457IND60715630920221119214943.0201030e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c072812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeymour, V.

Certain oxynitride crystal structures allow very significant compositional variation through extensive Si/N exchange for Al/O, which implies a degree of atomic ordering. In this study, solid-state ²⁹Si MAS NMR and variable field 1D and 2D ²⁷Al MAS NMR measurements are combined with density functional theory calculations of both the structural and NMR interaction parameters for various points across the Y₄Si₂O₇N₂–Y₄Al₂O₉ compositional range. This series provides numerous possibilities for significant variation of atomic ordering in the local ditetrahedral (Si,Al)₂O₇–ₓNₓ units. The two slightly structurally inequivalent aluminum sites in Y₄Al₂O₉ are unambiguously assigned to the observed resonances. Computational findings on Y₄Si₂O₇N₂ demonstrate that the single observed ²⁹Si NMR resonance covers a range of local inequivalent silicon environments. For the first time, the MAS NMR and neutron diffraction data from the Y₄SiAlO₈N structure have been directly reconciled, thus establishing aspects of atomic order and disorder that characterize this system. This comparison suggests that, although the diffraction data indicates long-range structural order supporting a highly crystalline character, the short-range information afforded by the solid-state NMR measurements indicates significant atomic disorder throughout the (Si,Al)₂O₇–ₓNₓ units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3adensity functional theory 3aneutron diffraction 3asilicon1 aGriffin, J.

Research has to a lesser extent measured eating behaviors such as eating with family, eating in front of a screen, and other behaviors that could play a significant role in obesity-related outcomes. Furthermore, such behaviors are closely tied to cultural and familial traditions that may morph as Hispanic/Latinos spend more time in the US or over generations. Eating behaviors are notoriously difficult to capture through self-report mechanisms; recent developments in wearable sensors such as cameras or Global Positioning Systems (GPS) can provide objective measurements of what/with who/when/where/how an individual engages with food. This study presents a protocol for collecting, coding, and validating data on food-related behavior with wearable sensors in a population of Hispanics/Latinos. An observational cohort of Mexican adults (n = 80) engaged in a one-week study during which they wore a wearable camera (FrontRow) and GPS device. The GPS device logged location (latitude/longitude) every minute. The FrontRow camera recorded images ever 15–30 seconds depending on movement of participant. A protocol was developed to code each image for several food-related behaviors including: social/individual eating, distracted eating, duration/time of eating, snacking, home cooked meals, traditional Mexican meals, and grocery/fast food/convenience/restaurant food purchasing. Validation was performed by second and third coders coding the images and measuring for agreement. Behaviors were linked to locations using time stamp of image and GPS and tied to geographic information system data about food environments to aid in validation of coded images. n/a. Understanding eating and purchasing behaviors could aid in understanding relationships between what Hispanic/Latino individuals eat and obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome outcomes. This protocol provides researchers with a way to objectively measure food-related behaviors that may be connected to food acculturation in a Hispanic/Latino cohort.

Muscle tissue was blended with octadecylsilyl-derivatized silica (C18). A column made from the C18/muscle tissue matrix was washed with n-hexane, after which CAP was eluted with acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v) and partitioned into ethyl acetate. The final extract was evaporated, and reconstituted into methanol/water (10:90, v/v) for the analysis of UPLC–MS/MS. The correlation coefficient (r2) with each matrix-matched calibration curve is higher than 0.999. CCα and CCβ of the fenicols upon the method were ranged from 0.02 to 0.06 μg kg−1 and 0.11–0.16 μg kg−1 respectively. At the fortified levels, mean recoveries of the three compounds were ranged from 84.2% to 99.8%, and the RSDs were lower than 12%. The method was accurate and reproducible, being successfully applied to the monitoring of CAP, TAP and FF in fish samples obtained from the Chinese market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3acorrelation 3aethyl acetate 3afish 3aflorfenicol 3ahexane 3aliquid chromatography 3amarkets 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3asilica 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aChloramphenicol 0aThiamphenicol 0aFlorfenicol 0aUltra-high pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 0aFish muscle1 aWu, Ping-Gu1 aJiang, Wei1 aMa, Bin-jie0 tFood control.g2015 June, v. 52 p.34-38dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012200174300001600296520106000312592002801372650001401400650002601414650001501440650002401455650002101479650001701500650001701517650002101534650001201555650001601567650000901583650001401592653000901606653000801615653000701623653000801630653000801638653000801646653000901654653000701663653001001670653000801680653000901688653000801697653000801705653000801713653000801721653000701729653000701736653003201743653001301775653001701788653003601805653003301841653001301874700002001887700001601907700001801923700002201941700002101963700001901984700002302003700002102026773008502047856008402132852000902216655001202225IND60552029520221118120549.0161019e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055202952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2015.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoppelkamp, Sandra10aMurine pattern recognition receptor dectin-1 is essential in the development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis  ap. 398-406.  aMycobacteria in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) are an essential component of immunization protocols in a number of autoimmune disease animal models including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and uveoretinitis (EAE and EAU, respectively). We determined the role in EAU of two C-type lectin receptors on myeloid cells that recognize and respond to mycobacteria. Using receptor-specific antibodies and knockout mice, we demonstrated for the first time that the macrophage mannose receptor delays disease development but does not affect severity. In contrast, dectin-1 is critically involved in the development of CFA-mediated EAU. Disease severity is reduced in dectin-1 knockout mice and antibody blockade of dectin-1 during the induction, but not the effector phase, prevents EAU development. Significantly, similar blockade of dectin-1 in vivo has no effect in non-CFA-mediated, spontaneously induced or adoptive transfer models of EAU. Thus dectin-1 plays a critical role in the ability of complete Freund’s adjuvant to induce EAU in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aanimal disease models 3aantibodies 3aautoimmune diseases 3adisease severity 3aencephalitis 3aimmunization 3aknockout mutants 3alectins 3amacrophages 3amice 3areceptors 0aCARD 0aCLR 0aDC 0aEAE 0aEAU 0aHEL 0aIRBP 0aMR 0aMyD88 0aNLR 0aPAMP 0ap.i 0aPRR 0aRLR 0aSyk 0aTg 0aWT 0aMacrophage mannose receptor 0aDectin-1 0aMycobacteria 0aExperimental autoimmune uveitis 0aPattern recognition receptor 0aAdjuvant1 aReid, Delyth M.1 aYeoh, Joyce1 aTaylor, Julie1 aMcKenzie, Emma J.1 aBrown, Gordon D.1 aGordon, Siamon1 aForrester, John V.1 aWong, Simon Y.C.0 tMolecular Immunology.g2015 Oct., v. 67 p.398-406dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2015.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245020200166500002000368520159200388592002801980596006102008650002002069650001702089650001502106650001502121650001302136650001602149650001002165700002202175700002402197700002402221700002702245773013102272856007702403852000902480655001202489IND60772795220221119091355.0220410e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077279522DNAL7 a10.1029/2018WR0242402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaclaren, Oliver J.10aIncorporating Posterior‐Informed Approximation Errors Into a Hierarchical Framework to Facilitate Out‐of‐the‐Box MCMC Sampling for Geothermal Inverse Problems and Uncertainty Quantification  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe consider geothermal inverse problems and uncertainty quantification from a Bayesian perspective. Our main goal is to make standard, “out‐of‐the‐box” Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling more feasible for complex simulation models by using suitable approximations. To do this, we first show how to pose both the inverse and prediction problems in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We then show how to incorporate so‐called posterior‐informed model approximation error into this hierarchical framework, using a modified form of the Bayesian approximation error approach. This enables the use of a “coarse,” approximate model in place of a finer, more expensive model, while accounting for the additional uncertainty and potential bias that this can introduce. Our method requires only simple probability modeling, a relatively small number of fine model simulations and only modifies the target posterior—any standard MCMC sampling algorithm can be used to sample the new posterior. These corrections can also be used in methods that are not based on MCMC sampling. We show that our approach can achieve significant computational speedups on two geothermal test problems. We also demonstrate the dangers of naively using coarse, approximate models in place of finer models, without accounting for the induced approximation errors. The naive approach tends to give overly confident and biased posteriors while incorporating Bayesian approximation error into our hierarchical framework corrects for this while maintaining computational efficiency and ease of use.  aPublisher supplied data  aC05X1306cNew Zeland Ministry of Business and Innovation 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 3aresearch 3auncertainty 3awater1 aNicholson, Ruanui1 aBjarkason, Elvar K.1 aO'Sullivan, John P.1 aO'Sullivan, Michael J.0 tWater resources research.g2020 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.e2018WR024240-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR0242403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245024000159300002000399520156300419592002801982650001602010650003102026650001502057650001302072650001902085653002002104653003302124653004202157653003302199653005602232700001602288700001602304700005502320700001602375700001302391700001902404700005002423773014202473856007902615852000902694655001202703IND60759324720221117222120.0211208e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075932472DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c173862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Huiqin10aPhotoirradiation-Induced Capacitance Enhancement in the h-WO₃/Bi₂WO₆ Submicron Rod Heterostructure under Simulated Solar Illumination and Its Postillumination Capacitance Enhancement Retainment from a Photocatalytic Memory Effect  ap. 57214-57229.  aRecently, photoassisted charging has been demonstrated as a green and sustainable approach to successfully enhance the capacitance of supercapacitors with low cost and good efficiency. However, their light-induced capacitance enhancement is relatively low and is lost quickly when the illumination is off. In this work, a novel active material system is developed for supercapacitors with the photoassisted charging capability by the decoration of a small amount of Bi₂WO₆ nanoparticles on an h-WO₃ submicron rod surface in situ, which forms a typical type II band alignment heterostructure with a close contact interface through the co-sharing of W atoms between h-WO₃ submicron rods and Bi₂WO₆ nanoparticles. The photogenerated charge carrier separation and transfer are largely enhanced in the h-WO₃/Bi₂WO₆ submicron rod electrode, which subsequently allows more charge carriers to participate in its photoassisted charging process to largely enhance its capacitance improvement under simulated solar illumination than that of the h-WO₃ submicron rod electrode. Furthermore, the h-WO₃/Bi₂WO₆ submicron rod electrode could retain its photoinduced capacitance enhancement in the dark for an extended period of time from the photocatalytic memory effect. Thus, our work provides a solution to the two major drawbacks of reported supercapacitors with the light-induced capacitance enhancement property, and supercapacitors based on active materials with the photocatalytic memory effect could be utilized in various technical fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrodes 3alighting 3aphotocatalysis 0asupercapacitors 0ah-WO3/Bi2WO6 heterojunctions 0aphotoinduced capacitance enhancements 0aphotocatalytic memory effect 0apostillumination capacitance enhancement retainment1 aYang, Weiyi1 aGao, Shuang1 aLin, Zifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9292-95591 aMo, Zheyang1 aLi, Chao1 aShang, Jian Ku1 aLi, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0735-88600 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 13, no. 48 p.57214-57229dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c173863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009200168300001400260520180900274592002802083650001102111650001102122650001502133650001302148650002402161650001102185650002502196650001302221650003802234650003502272650001902307650001102326650001302337650001102350650001302361650002002374650001302394650002102407650002202428650001402450653000802464653001002472653001102482653000802493653000802501653000902509653002702518653001302545653001302558653001402571700001802585773008302603856008402686852000902770655001202779IND60552029620221118120525.0161019e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055202962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2015.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRonco, Pierre10aMembranous nephropathy: A fairy tale for immunopathologists, nephrologists and patients  ap. 57-62.  aThis article reviews the considerable progress which has been made in the recent years in the understanding of the pathophysiology of membranous nephropathy, a model of organ-specific auto-immune disease. It shows how experimental models developed more than 30 years ago have led to the identification of several human antigens including neutral endopeptidase in the neonate, phospholipase A2 receptor, and thrombospondin 1 domain 7A in the adult, and cationic bovine serum albumin in children. Thanks to a successful GWAS performed in European Caucasians, the genetics of the disease begins to be understood. These groundbreaking findings already have a major impact on patients' care owing to the development of reliable ELISA and immunofluorescence test for the detection of PLA2R antibodies and of PLA2R antigen screening in biopsies. This review will tell the story from the careful clinical observation of cases to the most recent therapeutic perspectives which have been made possible by these advances.Advances in medical science often proceed by steps which are highly interdependent. New, groundbreaking findings with important clinical implications often result from the combination of faithful experimental models and careful clinical observations. This is well illustrated by the story of membranous nephropathy which started more than 50 years ago. It is remarkable that in this disease, the experimental models predicted the pathophysiology of the human glomerulopathy. The stories that we will tell in this article are aimed at young clinical investigators who are sometimes reluctant to embark on research projects. We hope that they will convince them that bedside research performed with intellectual curiosity and a bit of chance can lead to significant progress in clinical medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhites 3aadults 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aautoimmune diseases 3abiopsy 3abovine serum albumin 3achildren 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglomerulopathy 3ahumans 3amedicine 3amodels 3aneonates 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3aphospholipase A2 3aresearch projects 3ascreening 0aNEP 0aPLA2R 0aTHSD7A 0aBSA 0aERT 0aHepB 0aMembranous nephropathy 0aPodocyte 0aAntigens 0aDiagnosis1 aDebiec, Hanna0 tMolecular Immunology.g2015 Nov., v. 68 p.57-62dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2015.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245012000136300001600256520139800272592002801670650001601698650001501714650002701729650002601756650003801782650001901820650001501839650001401854650002201868650001301890650003801903650001601941650002001957650001701977650001401994650001102008650001302019650003002032650001902062650001202081651001002093653001702103653000802120700002002128700001502148773014502163852000902308655001202317IND60706036120221118235408.0200807e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070603612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaruah, Borsha Rani10aIncidence, detection and integrated management of viral disease complex in Bhut Jolokia, a Chilli cultivar in Assam  ap. 136-141.  aDouble antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays detected the infection of four viruses viz., Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Potato virus Y (PVY), Groundnut Bud Necrosis Virus (GBNV) and Chilli leaf curl virus (ChLCV) in Bhut Jolokia with 55.0% infection by CMV, 36.0% by PVY, 44.9% by GBNV and 42.5% by ChLCV in Assam.

Hewlett and Hibbert (1963, https://doi.org/10.1029/JZ068i004p01081) constructed an idealized hillslope model (0.91 × 0.91 × 15.0 m; 21.8°) using reconstituted C horizon soil to investigate importance of interflow, a type of subsurface flow. They saturated the model, covered it to prevent evaporation, and allowed free drainage for 145 days. The resulting recession drainage curve suggested two phases: fast drainage of saturated soil in the first 1.5 days and then slow drainage of unsaturated soil. Hydrologists interpreted the latter as evidence interflow could sustain baseflow, even during extended drought. Since that experiment, typical forest vegetation grew in the model, providing root and litter inputs for 55 years. We removed all aboveground live biomass and repeated the experiment physically and numerically (HYDRUS‐2D), hypothesizing that pedogenesis would change the drainage curve and further elucidate the role of unsaturated flow from hillslopes. Contrary to this hypothesis, drainage curves in our twice‐repeated physical experiments and numerical simulation were unchanged for the first ~10 days, indicating pedogenesis and biological processes had not largely altered bulk hydraulic conductivities or soil moisture release characteristics. However, drainage unexpectedly ceased after about 2 weeks (14.3 ± 2.5 days), an order of magnitude sooner than in the original experiment, due to an apparent leak in the hillslope analogous to commonly observed bedrock fractures in natural systems. Thus, our results are a more natural recession behavior that highlight how incorporation of alternative hydrologic outputs can reduce drainage duration and volume from soils to baseflow.  aPublisher supplied data  cMcIntire‐Stennis Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture  cInstitute for Critical Technology and Applied Science  aNSF-DEB-1440485cCoweeta Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program (National Science Foundation)  cUSDA Forest Service  cEdna Bailey Sussman Foundation  cVirginia Water Resources and Research Center 3abase flow 3abedrock 3abiomass 3adrainage 3adrought 3aevaporation 3aforests 3amathematical models 3aresearch 3asoil formation 3asoil water 3asubsurface flow 3atopographic slope 3aunsaturated flow1 aMcGuire, Kevin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5751-39561 aStrahm, Brian D.1 aKnoepp, Jennifer D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8807-22141 aJackson, C.

Recent experimental and simulation studies have suggested that molten carbonates contain non-negligible amounts of hydroxide ions in the presence of water at low partial pressures of CO₂. However, due to the high temperatures (≃600 °C or higher) required to melt pure alkali carbonates and their mixtures, there is a lack of experimental thermodynamic and transport data for these molten phases. Here, we deploy a recently parametrized force field for molten alkali carbonates and hydroxides [J. Chem. Theory Comput.2020, 16, 5736−5746, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00285] to simulate some physical properties using atomistic molecular dynamics. Our predictions show a consistent decrease in viscosity and an increase in ionic conductivity with increasing hydroxide fractions, whereas a higher Li⁺ mole fraction leads to an increase in both viscosity and ionic conductivity. The computed surface tension values exhibit an upward trend with higher asymmetry in cation and anion sizes. Structural analysis suggests that in the carbonate–hydroxide melts the smaller/harder ions, OH– and Li⁺, are more favored at the interface than the larger/softer ions, CO₃²– and K⁺/Na⁺. The current approach provides a systematic route to obtaining physicochemical properties of molten alkali carbonate and hydroxide mixtures over a large domain of chemical compositions and thus can steer future experimental research for molten carbonates and their applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acations 3amolecular dynamics 3asurface tension 3athermodynamics 3aviscosity1 aYoung, Jeffrey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8879-51321 aBarckholtz, Timothy A.1 aKiss, Gábor,1 aKoziol, Lucas1 aPanagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8152-66150 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 124, no. 43 p.23532-23540dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c072953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245015500164300001600319520123200335592002801567650001901595650001101614650001901625650003301644650001701677650001501694650001001709650001701719650001901736650002601755650002001781650001701801650001101818651001001829653001501839653002101854653002801875653002501903653001701928653003001945700001901975773013201994856008302126852000902209655001202218IND60601172120221120070927.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060117212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2013.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, LuPeng10aHolocene climate change inferred from stratigraphy and OSL chronology of aeolian sediments in the Qaidam Basin, northeastern Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau  ap. 488-499.  aPaleoclimatic reconstruction based on aeolian sediments in the eastern Qaidam Basin (QB) has been hindered by the limited chronological data.

On the basis of these OSL ages and the lithologic stratigraphy, we propose the ‘effective moisture index (EMI)’ for aeolian sediments to reconstruct the effective moisture change. Based on the EMI from twelve sections, the effective moisture change, moisture sources and relevant mechanisms for paleoclimatic change in the eastern QB are discussed. The results indicate that (1) aeolian deposition started at least before 12.4±0.7ka during the deglaciation, the paleosols developed at the early and mid-Holocene, and aeolian sand and loess accumulated at mid- and late Holocene; (2) effective moisture history was: hyper-arid at 12.8–11.6ka, humid and variable at 11.6–8.3ka, moderately humid and stable at 8.3–3.5ka, and increasingly arid at 3.5–0ka; (3) the effective moisture change was mainly controlled by the Asian summer monsoon (ASM), which mainly followed the change of Northern Hemispheric summer insolation, and the westerlies strengthened and increased the aridity in the QB when the ASM shrank.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3abasins 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aeolian sands 3aglaciation 3aloess 3aluminescence 3amonsoon season 3apaleosolic soil types 3asolar radiation 3astratigraphy 3asummer 3aChina 0aOSL dating 0aAeolian activity 0aHolocene climate change 0aAsian summer monsoon 0aQaidam Basin 0aQinghai–Tibetan Plateau1 aLai, ZhongPing0 tQuaternary research.g2014 May, v. 81, no. 3 p.488-499dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2013.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03867naa a2200937 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245004400173520139900217592002801616650001501644650001601659650001201675650001801687650002301705650001901728650001201747650000901759650002201768651001401790651001401804651001101818651001001829651001001839651001301849651001201862651001101874651000901885651001101894651001601905651001301921651001101934651001301945651001701958651001001975651001801985651001202003651001402015651001202029653002302041653001702064653001802081653002702099653002902126700002002155700002002175700002102195700002902216700002202245700002502267700001602292700002402308700001402332700001502346700002002361700001702381700001602398700002502414700002602439700001802465700002202483700002102505700001802526700001702544700002002561700001802581700002702599700001702626700001702643700002302660700001602683773011202699856008502811961001202896852000902908655001202917IND60679755120221121055532.0200228e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067975512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2019.1020822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCubbage, Frederick10aGlobal timber investments, 2005 to 2017  aWe estimated timber investment returns for 22 countries and 54 species/management regimes in 2017, for a range of global timber plantation species and countries at the stand level, using capital budgeting criteria, without land costs, at a real discount rate of 8%. Returns were estimated for the principal plantation countries in the Americas—Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Paraguay, Mexico, and the United States—as well as New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, China, Vietnam, Laos, Spain, Finland, Poland, Scotland, and France. South American plantation growth rates and their concomitant returns were generally greater, at more than 12% Internal Rates of Return (IRRs), as were those in China, Vietnam, and Laos. These IRRs were followed by those for plantations in southern hemisphere countries of Australia and New Zealand and in Mexico, with IRRs around 8%. Temperate forest plantations in the U.S. and Europe returned less, from 4% to 8%, but those countries have less financial risk, better timber markets, and more infrastructure. Returns to most planted species in all countries except Asia have decreased from 2005 to 2017. If land costs were included in calculating the overall timberland investment returns, the IRRs would decrease from 3 percentage points less for loblolly pine in the U.S. South to 8 percentage points less for eucalypts in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aPinus taeda 3acapital 3adiscount rate 3aforest plantations 3ainfrastructure 3amarkets 3arisk 3atemperate forests 3aArgentina 3aAustralia 3aBrazil 3aChile 3aChina 3aColombia 3aFinland 3aFrance 3aLaos 3aMexico 3aNew Zealand 3aParaguay 3aPoland 3aScotland 3aSouth Africa 3aSpain 3aUnited States 3aUruguay 3aVenezuela 3aVietnam 0aTimber investments 0aBenchmarking 0aGlobal trends 0aLand expectation value 0aInternal rates of return1 aKanieski, Bruno1 aRubilar, Rafael1 aBussoni, Adriana1 aMorales Olmos, Virginia,1 aBalmelli, Gustavo1 aDonagh, Patricio Mac1 aLord, Roger1 aHernández, Carmelo1 aZhang, Pu1 aHuang, Jin1 aKorhonen, Jaana1 aYao, Richard1 aHall, Peter1 aDel La Torre, Rafael1 aDíaz Balteiro, Luis,1 aCarrero, Omar1 aMonges, Elizabeth1 aThu, Ha Tran Thi1 aFrey, Gregory1 aHoward, Mike1 aChavet, Michael1 aMochan, Shaun1 aHoeflich, Vitor Afonso1 aChudy, Rafal1 aMaass, David1 aChizmar, Stephanie1 aAbt, Robert0 tForest policy and economics.g2020 Mar., v. 112 p.102082-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2019.1020823Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245010500155300001400260500002000274520054600294592002800840650002700868650002400895650002100919650001100940650002500951773014100976856007101117852000901188655001201197IND60680218220221122185245.0200104e196802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068021822DNAL7 a10.2307/12378712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmes, R.

A trade‐off between the image field of view (FOV) and image resolution is made. This can be compensated for with superresolution (SR) techniques that take a wide FOV, low‐resolution (LR) image, and superresolve a high resolution (HR). The Enhanced Deep Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (EDSRGAN) is trained on the DeepRock‐SR, a diverse compilation of raw and processed micro‐computed tomography (μCT) images in 2D and 3D. The 2D and 3D trained networks show comparable performance of 50% to 70% reduction in relative error over bicubic interpolation with minimal computational cost during usage. Texture regeneration with EDSRGAN shows superior visual similarity versus Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) and other methods. Difference maps show SRCNN recovers large‐scale edge features while EDSRGAN regenerates perceptually indistinguishable high‐frequency texture. Physical accuracy is measured by permeability and phase topology on consistently segmented images, showing EDSRGAN results achieving the closest match. Performance is generalized with augmentation, showing high adaptability to noise and blur. HR images are fed into the network, generating HR‐SR images to extrapolate network performance to subresolution features present in the HR images themselves. Underresolution features are regenerated despite operating outside of trained specifications. Comparison with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shows details are consistent with the underlying geometry. Images that are normally constrained by the mineralogy of the rock, by fast transient imaging, or by the energy of the source can be superresolved accurately for further analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ageometry 3amicro-computed tomography 3amineralogy 3aneural networks 3apermeability 3aresearch 3atexture 3atopology 3awater1 aArmstrong, Ryan T.1 aMostaghimi, Peyman0 tWater resources research.g2020 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.e2019WR026052-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR0260523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245017300164300002000337500001900357520169800376592002802074650001502102650001602117650002002133650001202153650001702165650001502182650002202197650001302219650001402232700001302246700006202259773013802321856008002459852000902539655001202548IND60715631120221119214911.0201030e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c073382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGee, Megan Y.10aIsothermal Titration Calorimetry Resolves Sequential Ligand Exchange and Association Reactions in Treatment of Oleate-Capped CdSe Quantum Dots with Alkylphosphonic Acid  ap. 23964-23975.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis article examines a prototypical nanocrystal surface reaction, the replacement of carboxylate ligands with alkylphosphonate on CdSe quantum dots (QDs), in an anhydrous solvent using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). A highly repeatable exothermic signature is detected associated with quantitative displacement of oleate from the QDs as oleic acid. Furthermore, on the basis of the magnitude and time dependence of the heat responses to octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) addition over the course of the reaction, an additional chemical process could be unambiguously resolved: the association of ODPA to a separate set of sites on the QD surface. The anionic ligand exchange predominates at first, proceeding with equilibrium constant Kₑₓcₕ ≥ 100 and an exothermic average ΔH ≈ −6.7 kJ mol–¹, while the association reaction is also exothermic and proceeds with Kₐ > 10³ M–¹. Changes in synthetic and purification conditions led to significant changes in the equivalencies (sites per QD) for these two surface reactions that are clearly revealed by ITC despite no apparent changes in electronic absorption spectra or the QD size. These results demonstrate the capabilities of ITC as a technique for studying QD surface reactions in a manner that is complementary to NMR and optical spectroscopic methods. Finally, we introduce a timetrace analysis to extract additional information from ITC signals in the case of simultaneous equilibria with differing reaction kinetics. We anticipate that the direct thermal measurement provided by ITC will help to resolve the detailed thermodynamics of a variety of QD reactions and enable improved descriptions of QD surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acalorimetry 3aheat production 3aligands 3ananocrystals 3aoleic acid 3areaction kinetics 3asolvents 3atitration1 aShen, Yi1 aGreytak, Andrew B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8978-64570 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 124, no. 43 p.23964-23975dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c073383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013600174300001400310520127400324536009801598592002801696650001901724650001801743650001001761650001901771650002201790650001201812650001701824650001401841650000901855650001101864650002101875650002701896650001301923650001501936653001301951653002001964653002001984653002102004700001902025773013502044856008602179852000902265655001202274IND60773186220221118152316.0220411e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077318622DNAL7 a10.1080/02648725.2022.20484342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhruv Patel, Dhara10aEnvironmental pollution, toxicity profile, and physico-chemical and biotechnological approaches for treatment of textile wastewater  ap. 33-86.  aTextile industries discharges a huge quantity of unused synthetic dyes in wastewater leading to increased environmental pollution and pose a great risk to human health. Thus, a significant improvement in effluent quality is required before it is discharged into the environment. Although, several physicochemical methods have been practiced for the efficient color and dyes removal from textile effluents, these approaches have some drawbacks of greater use of expensive chemicals, low sensitivity, formation of excess sludge which also have secondary disposal problem. Thus, there is still a need for energy efficient, affordable, effective, and environmentally friendly treatment technologies. Bioremediation has been considered as a promising an upcoming active field of research for the treatment of unwanted color and target compounds from the contaminated environment. In order to efficient treatment of textile effluent, the main objective of the present study was to isolate and characterize the indigenous microbial isolates from textile industry effluents and sludge samples and investigate their dye removal and decolorization ability along with the influence of various process parameters on effluents decolorization that draining into the open environment.  aThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3abiotechnology 3acolor 3adecolorization 3aenergy efficiency 3afabrics 3ahuman health 3apollution 3arisk 3asludge 3atextile industry 3atextile mill effluents 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aBacteria 0abio-degradation 0abio-remediation 0atextile effluent1 aBhatt, Shreyas0 tBiotechnology & genetic engineering reviews.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 38, no. 1 p.33-86dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12279x2046-55567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02648725.2022.20484343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03998naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013100169520226200300592002802562650003202590650001002622650002202632650001302654650001402667650002602681650002302707650002702730650001802757650001502775650000902790650001802799650001102817650001402828650002002842650003002862650001302892650002502905650001102930651001502941700002602956700002402982700002103006700002003027700002003047700001803067700002403085700002403109700001903133700001703152700002303169773013403192856008503326852000903411655001203420IND60672765820221120101200.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067276582DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz036.P13-024-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarson, Leila10aUsing a Developmental Test and Electroencephalography to Examine Child Cognition and Its Predictors in Bangladesh (P13-024-19)  aThe majority of global health studies use behavioural assessments to measure early child development. Few studies have examined neural indices of cognition using electroencephalography (EEG) in low-income settings. Using data from the Benefits and Risks of Iron Supplementation in Children (BRISC) trial, we examined cognitive development and neural indices of memory and attention in 11 month-old Bangladeshi children and their environmental, socio-demographic, and biological predictors. At 8 months of age, 3300 children were randomized to iron syrup, multiple micronutrient supplementation, or placebo for 3 months. The main trial outcomes include child development measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID)-III, anthropometry, haemoglobin, morbidity, and iron indices. EEG is being conducted to measure event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in a random subset of 250 children at 11 months of age. ERPs are measured in response to auditory and visual stimuli, using roving oddball and attention orienting tasks. Generalized linear mixed models estimated the predictors of BSID-derived cognitive development and EEG-derived neural indices of memory and attention. Potential predictors include psychosocial stimulation, anthropometry, haemoglobin, socio-economic status, food security, sex, and parental education. Additionally, we examined correlations between the BSID cognitive scores and EEG-derived neural indices of cognition. Preliminary BSID data up to December 2018 indicates that 1749 children have completed measurements at 11 months of age. Psychosocial stimulation was significantly associated with BSID cognitive development scores. ERPs in children at 11 months of age are expected to be completed by May 2019 and relevant results will be presented. This study is the first to acquire ERP data in children at 11 months of age in rural Bangladesh. Our findings will identify significant predictors of cognitive functioning measured using the BSID (a well-established developmental test) and using EEG (a sensitive neurophysiological approach) in young children in this setting.

Using a three-electrode electrochemical cell filled with aqueous ionic solution under atomic force microscopy, a potential-dependent friction phenomenon was observed on a graphitic surface. With an applied positive potential on the graphitic surface, the friction force increased over that observed under neutral applied potential and increased with increasing positive potential. With the applied negative potential on the graphitic surface, lubricity was observed compared to the case with the neutral potential on the graphitic surface. The applied potential also changed the interaction force between the probe and graphitic surface, where the positive potential resulted in a stronger attractive force, while the negative potential induced a stronger repulsive force. The mechanism of the friction and interaction force modulation under the applied potential was ascribed to the rearrangement of hydrated cations and anions on the graphitic surface under different potentials, resulting in electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonds varying as a function of potential. This study demonstrates that the friction on a graphitic surface can be modulated by the surface potential in aqueous ionic solutions, which may provide a novel method for reducing friction in aqueous environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatomic force microscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3afriction 3ahydrogen 3aliquids1 aLi, Jinjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9835-168X1 aYi, Shuang1 aLuo, Jianbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5132-07120 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Oct. 14, v. 124, no. 43 p.23745-23751dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c073583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245007600206300002000282506007600302520097400378592002801352506003701380650003401417650001901451650002001470650001001490650002801500650002501528650002001553650001301573650002601586700002101612700001901633773017601652856008301828852000901911655001201920IND4481155620221207113204.0120502e20111011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448115562DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11142281082doi7 aPMC31932512pmcid7 a219493662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan de Velde, Sam10amTOR links incretin signaling to HIF induction in pancreatic beta cells  ap. 16876-16882.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnder feeding conditions, the incretin hormone GLP-1 promotes pancreatic islet viability by triggering the cAMP pathway in beta cells. Increases in PKA activity stimulate the phosphorylation of CREB, which in turn enhances beta cell survival by upregulating IRS2 expression. Although sustained GLP-1 action appears important for its salutary effects on islet function, the transient nature of CREB activation has pointed to the involvement of additional nuclear factors in this process. Following the acute induction of CREB-regulated genes, cAMP triggers a second delayed phase of gene expression that proceeds via the HIF transcription factor. Increases in cAMP promote the accumulation of HIF1α in beta cells by activating the mTOR pathway. As exposure to rapamycin disrupts GLP-1 effects on beta cell viability, these results demonstrate how a pathway associated with tumor growth also mediates salutary effects of an incretin hormone on pancreatic islet function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acell viability 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aislets of Langerhans 3aphosphorylation 3asecretin 3atranscription factors1 aHogan, Meghan F.1 aMontminy, Marc0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Oct. 11, v. 108, no. 41 p.16876-16882dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11142281083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014700168520108700315592002801402650003101430650001101461650002301472650001601495650001201511650001201523650001401535650001601549650000701565650001501572653002101587653001601608653002101624653003801645700001601683700001801699700001301717700001501730700001601745700001701761773010601778856008701884852000901971655001201980IND60748072320221120091118.0220110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074807232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1257992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Qinglan10aEnhancing l-glutamine production in Corynebacterium glutamicum by rational metabolic engineering combined with a two-stage pH control strategy  al-glutamine is a semi-essential amino acid widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The microbial synthesis of l-glutamine is limited by lack of effective strains with high titer and safety. First, ARTP mutagenesis combined with high-throughput screening generated an l-glutamine-producing strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum with titer of 25.7 ± 2.7 g/L. Subsequently, a series of rational metabolic approaches were used to further improve l-glutamine production, which included increasing the carbon flow to l-glutamine (proB and NCgl1221 knockout), enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the key enzyme (glnE knockout and glnA screening and overexpression) and reinforcement of ATP regeneration (ppk overexpression and RBS optimization). Finally, we proposed a two-stage pH control strategy to address the inconsistent effect of pH on cell growth and l-glutamine production. These combined strategies led to a 186.0% increase of l-glutamine titer compared to that of the initial strain, reaching 73.5 ± 3.1 g/L with a yield of 0.368 ± 0.034 g/g glucose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3acell growth 3aenzymes 3aglucose 3aglutamine 3amutagenesis 3apH 3atechnology 0aARTP mutagenesis 0al-glutamine 0aATP regeneration 0aTwo-stage pH control fermentation1 aHu, Mengkai1 aTian, Lingzhi1 aLiu, Fei1 aWang, Qing1 aXu, Meijuan1 aRao, Zhiming0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Dec., v. 341 p.125799-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1257993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010900171300001600280520123800296536009701534592002801631650002201659650001901681650001301700650001201713650001801725650001901743650002501762650001701787650002001804650002901824650001501853650001901868650001501887653001201902700001501914700002001929700002101949773013701970856008602107852000902193655001202202IND60773186420221118152324.0220411e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077318642DNAL7 a10.1080/02648725.2022.20533192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhanker, Raunak10aDiatoms as a biotechnological resource for the sustainable biofuel production: a state-of-the-art review  ap. 111-131.  aThe greenhouse gas emission from fossil fuel and higher economic cost in its transportation are stimulating scientists to explore biomass energy production at the local level. In the present review, the authors have explored the prospects of commercial-scale biofuels production from the microalgal group, diatoms. Insights on suitability of mass cultivation systems for large-scale production of diatoms have been deliberated based on published literature. Diatoms can proliferate extracting nutrients from the wastewater and the same biomass can be harvested for biofuel production. Residues can be further utilized for the formation of other bioproducts and biofertilizers. The residual applications of diatoms from mass culture are estimated to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the removal of impurities. Well-planned research is required to optimize the commercial-scale production of biofuels from diatoms. The aim of this review is therefore, to demonstrate the economically feasible, hygienically safe cultivation of diatoms on nutrients from wastewater, limitations in using diatoms for biofuel production, and how these limitations can be shorted out for optimum utilization of diatom for biofuel production.  aThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured inthis article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3abiofertilizers 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3aeconomic costs 3aeconomic feasibility 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amicroalgae 3atransportation 3awastewater 0adiatoms1 aKumar, Ram1 aTiwari, Archana1 aWinīta Kumāra,0 tBiotechnology & genetic engineering reviews.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 38, no. 1 p.111-131dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12279x2046-55567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02648725.2022.20533193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003500134024001200169040001800181100002300199245007500222300001600297506017300313520157600486592002802062650002702090650002502117650002002142650001702162650001202179650001002191650002002201650001402221650001802235700002002253700001802273773013402291856011402425856008202539956011602621961001302737852000902750655001202759IND60588731520221214223757.0191113e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873152DNAL7 a3385882aris7 a10113/58873152hdl7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1260-32doi8 ans13782  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidmer, Timothy L.10aRecovery of Phytophthora ramorum in plant tissue with mixed infections  ap. 253-258.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThis study was performed to investigate the frequency with which P. ramorum would be isolated from host tissue co-infected with P. ramorum as well as an indigenous Phytophthora species or P. kernoviae. Three separate experiments were tested in a similar manner using different combinations of pathogens and hosts. Overall for any of the individual experiments, very few segments did not have any growth of Phytophthora spp. For mixed infections of P. ramorum and P. kernoviae, a difference was observed between isolating both of the species and P. ramorum only on rhododendron. The data showed that P. ramorum or P. kernoviae will not be detected 29 or 12% of the time, respectively, in infected Rhododendron sp. Phytophthora kernoviae was not detected alone in mixed infections with P. ramorum on Pieris japonica. When two different P. ramorum isolates were co-inoculated individually with one P. citricola isolate, there was a significant difference between isolating P. ramorum and isolating both species. These results confirm that choice of host species used for baiting can strongly influence detection results. For example, if P. japonica were used for baiting in mixed infections, there is a 55% chance that P. kernoviae would not be detected. This study highlights the difficulty in being confident in isolating and identifying an individual Phytophthora sp. from host material when mixed infections are present, and emphasizes the importance of a large sample size in order to increase the chances to recover all possible different species in a mixed infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora kernoviae 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3aPieris japonica 3aRhododendron 3abaiting 3ahosts 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3aplant tissues1 aTooley, Paul W.1 aCamp, Mary J.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 Jan., v. 150, no. 1 p.253-258dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/58873153Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1260-33Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/MS%20-%20Log%23%20338588%20-%20Widmer.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245014100191300001500332520142500347592002801772650001401800650001401814650000901828650002501837650001401862650000901876650001201885650001401897650001201911650002701923650002901950650002501979650001602004650003502020650003702055700002002092700002102112773010802133856004802241852000902289655001202298IND50073115520221122001016.0140218e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007311552DNAL7 a119196912pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-001-0275-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValentine, Doreen E.10aOrienting responses and vocalizations produced by microstimulation in the superior colliculus of the echolocating bat, Eptesicus fuscus   ap. 89-108.  aAn echolocating bat actively controls the spatial acoustic information that drives its behavior by directing its head and ears and by modulating the spectro-temporal structure of its outgoing sonar emissions. The superior colliculus may function in the coordination of these orienting components of the bat's echolocation system. To test this hypothesis, chemical and electrical microstimulation experiments were carried out in the superior colliculus of the echolocating bat, Eptesicus fuscus, a species that uses frequency modulated sonar signals. Microstimulation elicited pinna and head movements, similar to those reported in other vertebrate species, and the direction of the evoked behaviors corresponded to the site of stimulation, yielding a map of orienting movements in the superior colliculus. Microstimulation of the bat superior colliculus also elicited sonar vocalizations, a motor behavior specific to the bat's acoustic orientation by echolocation. Electrical stimulation of the adjacent periaqueductal gray, shown to be involved in vocal production in other mammalian species, elicited vocal signals resembling acoustic communication calls of E. fuscus. The control of vocal signals in the bat is an integral part of its acoustic orienting system, and our findings suggest that the superior colliculus supports diverse and species-relevant sensorimotor behaviors, including those used for echolocation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEptesicus 3aacoustics 3aears 3aelectrical treatment 3aemissions 3ahead 3amammals 2aAcoustics 2aAnimals 2aChiropteraxphysiology 2aEcholocationxphysiology 2aElectric Stimulation 2aOrientation 2aSuperior Colliculixphysiology 2aVocalization, Animalxphysiology1 aSinha, Shiva R.1 aMoss, Cynthia F.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2002 Mar., v. 188, no. 2 p.89-108dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-001-0275-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010500167300001600272520108900288592002801377650001601405650002401421650001901445650001501464650002001479650001501499650001701514650001101531650001101542650001001553650001501563650002001578650000901598650001401607650001301621650002001634650001501654650001101669651001001680653001901690653002001709653002201729653002101751653001201772653001001784700002001794700002101814700002001835700002101855773013301876856008302009852000902092655001202101IND60601172620221120070930.0180706e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060117262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2013.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartini, Ivan14aThe latest Ursus spelaeus in Italy, a new contribution to the extinction chronology of the cave bear  ap. 117-124.  aThe skeleton of a young prime adult cave bear, Ursus spelaeus, was found in Chiostraccio Cave (Siena, Tuscany, central Italy), only slightly buried under rock falls. The specimen was dated yielding a conventional age of 24,030±100¹⁴CyrBP (29,200–28,550calyrBP), which makes it the latest known representative of the species in Italy. The skeleton was accompanied by the remains of wolf (Canis lupus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), aurochs (Bos primigenius), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), bat (Vespertinus murinus), and crow (Corvus monedula). The site seems confirming that the latest Italian U. spelaeus populations shared the risk of intrusion. The association of the cave bear with other animals suggests that the assemblage is an attritional palimpsest of remains of different species not originally associated in life. Cave bears were probably more vegetarian than brown bears and possibly became extinct when plant productivity dropped at the onset of MIS 2. Central and southern Italy may have offered isolated and sheltered refugia for cave bears.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aCervus elaphus 3aChiroptera 3aCorvus monedula 3aSus scrofa 3aUrsus arctos 3aadults 3acattle 3acrows 3aextinction 3arefuge habitats 3arisk 3arockfalls 3askeleton 3avegetarian diet 3awild boars 3awolves 3aItaly 0aUrsus spelaeus 0aLast Occurrence 0aChiostraccio Cave 0aLate Pleistocene 0aTuscany 0aItaly1 aColtorti, Mauro1 aMazza, Paul P.A.1 aRustioni, Marco1 aSandrelli, Fabio0 tQuaternary research.g2014 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.117-124dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2013.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009700169300001600266520157500282592002801857650002001885650002501905650002501930650001501955650001101970650002501981650003002006650002402036650001102060650002502071650001102096650001102107653002002118653002502138653002402163653003102187653001902218653002502237700001302262700001802275700001502293700001402308773012002322856008802442852000902530655001202539IND60570345920221120101627.0180830e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057034592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yupeng12aA modified ecological footprint method to evaluate environmental impacts of industrial parks  ap. 293-299.  aIndustrial parks have been playing a crucial role on driving regional economic development, but also been exerting significant impacts on natural ecosystems due to intensive resource consumption and waste emission. Ecological footprint method is a tool for analyzing the impact of human activities on environment, which has been applied in many fields. Most of the researches applying ecological footprint are conducted on large-scale objects, such as nation and globe. The ecological footprint analysis on the scale of the industrial park, however, is limited. This paper presents a modified ecological footprint accounting model, and applies it to appraise the environmental impact of an industrial park-Hefei economic and technological development area. Results show that the ecological footprint (8.87E+05gha (global hectares)) far exceeds the ecological capacity (4.82E+04gha), meaning that the ecological footprint is 18.4 times of the ecological capacity in the study park. In addition, the ecological footprint reduction caused by eco-industrial development in the study industrial park is quantified by ecological footprint model. The ecological footprint has been reduced by 15.9%, from 1.06E+06gha to 8.87E+05gha, which signifies an obvious environmental performance and economic benefits. Based on this study, the utilization of energy and material could be optimized in industrial park to reduce the influence of industrial activities on natural ecosystem. This paper provides a basis for an industrial park’s environmental management and decision making.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aecological footprint 3aeconomic development 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afinancial economics 3ahumans 3aindustrial symbiosis 3amodels 3awastes 0aIndustrial park 0aEcological footprint 0aEcological capacity 0aEco-industrial development 0aSustainability 0aEnvironmental impact1 aQiao, Qi1 aXian, Chaofan1 aXiao, Yang1 aFang, Lin0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2017 Oct., v. 125 p.293-299dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245010400132300001600236520115500252592002801407650002301435650002201458650002401480650002901504650002001533650001801553650000901571650001001580650001701590650001901607650001101626650001401637650001001651650002301661650001601684650002401700650001201724650000901736650003701745650000901782650000901791650001701800650002001817650001601837650001001853650001701863650002201880650001301902650001601915773014501931852000902076655001202085IND60706037120221118235719.0200807e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070603712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Narendra10aFumigant efficacy of Cumin essential oil on fungi and insect infesting Pisum sativum during storage  ap. 196-201.  aPisum sativum showed association of fifteen fungal species and one species of insect Callosobruchus chinensis. On the basis of % frequency Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. ochraceous, A. terreus were found to be dominant. These species showed reduction in terms of weight loss, germination and protein content of pea. Essential oil was extracted by hydro distillation from fruits of Cuminum cyminum. The obtained oil was evaluated against the frequently present fungi, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger as well as insect-Callosobruchus chinensis and exhibited the greatest toxicity. The oil was cidal and showed thermostable nature at its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 400ppm. The oil safely preserved pea seeds up to 4 months at 0.50 (1000ppm) and 0.76 mL (1500ppm) in polyethylene and jute bags of 500 mL capacity containing 400g seeds separately with no changes in organoleptic behaviour of food seeds during storage.

Due to their diverse bioactive profiles, essential oils have strong antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, making them as an ideal replacement of synthetic food additives in commercial food products. In current scenario, packaged food consumerism posed real scourge of food-borne illnesses due to synthetic additives used to maintain organoleptic and microbiological food quality. Utilizing preservative properties of essential oils is considered as a natural solution to these problems. Essential oils not only enhance the product shelf life but also act as natural flavoring agent. Essential oil alone and in combination are also incorporated in food packaging material in order to control food-spoiling agents. This review is primarily focused to develop an insight on the novel applications of essential oil in commercial food production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aconsumer behavior 3aessential oils 3afood industry 3afood production 3afood quality 3alipophilicity 3aresearch 3asecondary metabolites 3ashelf life 0aedible packaging 0anano-encapsulation 0aantioxidant 0aantimicrobial 0aadditives1 aPāshā, ʻImrān,1 aJahangir Chughtai, Muhammad Farhan1 aAli, Zaryab1 aBukhari, Hina1 aZuhair, Muhammad0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 34, no. 2 p.97-110dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43444x2163-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2022.20297763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03929naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245011000198300002000308520214400328592002802472650002802500650001902528650001402547650001102561650001302572650002002585650002402605650001302629650001702642650001402659650001702673650002502690653002502715653002302740653002002763653002702783653003502810653001902845700001802864700002002882700002602902700001802928700005902946700001903005700005603024700001303080700006403093773014203157856007903299852000903378655001203387IND60759325520221117222101.0211208e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075932552DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c175042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8026-929310aMicromechanical Compatibility between Cells and Scaffolds Directs the Phenotypic Transition of Stem Cells  ap. 58152-58161.  aThis study experimentally substantiates that the micromechanical compatibility between cell and substrate is essential for cells to achieve energetically favorable mechanotransduction that directs phenotypic transitions. The argument for this compatibility is based on a thermodynamic model that suggests that the response of cells to their substrate mechanical environment is a consequence of the interchange between forms of energy governing the cell–substrate interaction. Experimental validation for the model has been carried out by investigating the osteogenic differentiation of dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs) seeded on electrospun fibrous scaffolds. Electrospinning of blends containing polycaprolactone (PCL) and silk fibroin (SF) with varying composition of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) resulted in three-dimensional (3D) fibrous scaffolds with bimodal distribution of fiber diameter, which provides both macroscopically stiff and microscopically compliant scaffolds for cells without affecting the surface chemical functionality of scaffolds. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a colloidal probe and single-cell force spectroscopy were used to characterize cell stiffness and scaffold stiffness on the cellular level, as well as cell–scaffold adhesive interaction (chemical functionality). This study has successfully varied scaffold mechanical properties without affecting their surface chemistry. In vitro tests indicate that the micromechanical compatibility between cells and scaffolds has been significantly correlated with mechanosensitive gene expression markers and osteogenic differentiation markers of DFSCs. The agreement between experimental observations and the thermodynamic model affirms that the cellular response to the mechanical environment, though biological in nature, follows the laws of the energy interchange to achieve its self-regulating behavior. More importantly, this study provides systematic evidence, through extensive and rigorous experimental studies, for the first time that rationalizes that micromechanical compatibility is indeed important to the efficacy of regenerative medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3abone formation 3acellulose 3aenergy 3afibroins 3agene expression 3amechanotransduction 3amedicine 3ananocrystals 3aphenotype 3aspectroscopy 3athermodynamic models 0aphenotype transition 0ascaffold stiffness 0aelectrospinning 0acellulose nanocrystals 0asingle-cell force spectroscopy 0athermodynamics1 aLong, Jiaoyue1 aDunkers, Joy P.1 aWoodcock, Jeremiah W.1 aLin, Hungchun1 aFox, Douglas M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0533-20931 aLiao, Xiaoling1 aLv, Yonggang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3966-89751 aYang, Li1 aChiang, Martin Y.

Both factors interactively had highly significant (P < 0.01) effects on variables assessed. The highest mean final adult population density of 129.7 ± 4.6 was recorded in samples infested with the highest initial adult population density and stored for 150 d, while the least mean adult population density of 10.8 ± 0.54 was recorded on samples infested with the lowest initial adult population density in samples stored for 30 d. The highest percentage damaged cocoa beans 51.0 ± 1.21% was recorded in samples infested with the highest initial adult population density, while the least mean percentage damaged beans of 16.9 ± 1.26% was also recorded on samples infested with the lowest initial adult population density. Similar trends of means were recorded for all the remaining variables. Correlation between factors was significant and positive. Multiple and simple linear regressions analyses were also significant (P < 0.01) and all equations fitted the regression models and perfectly described the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables. Our results show that T. castaneum can impact negatively on both the quantity and quality of stored cocoa within just 30 days of infestation, with the impact increasing with increasing population density and post infestation storage time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTribolium castaneum 3aadults 3abeans 3acocoa beans 3aequations 3ainsects 3alaboratory experimentation 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3astorage time 0aCocoa beans 0aInsect infestation 0aTribolium castaneum 0aPopulation density 0aDamage 0aStorage time1 aMuhamad, R.1 aDzolkhifli, O.1 aSinniah, U.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1242-94240 tJournal of stored products research.g2018 Jan., v. 75 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2017.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165300001600292520185300308592002802161596006502189650001802254650003102272650001402303650002002317650001802337650002002355650002202375650001902397650002102416650001402437650002402451650001002475700002002485700001902505773013402524856008202658852000902740655001202749IND60588732020221123044841.0191113e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1259-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelch, Thomas10aEffect of host resistance on genetic structure of core and accessory chromosomes in Irish Zymoseptoria tritici populations  ap. 139-148.  aIn agricultural pathosystems resistant cultivars are typically only temporarily effective, as widespread growth of said cultivars drives selection for pathogen genotypes capable of infecting them. A gene-for-gene interaction between Z. tritici and wheat has been demonstrated for one cultivar; however results of studies into the relevance of these interactions in the field remain inconsistent. Because genetic drift does not appear to occur between Z. tritici populations that are not widely geographically separated, according to neutral genetic theory if adaptation to different host cultivars is occurring, reduced genetic variation, and some differentiation between populations sourced from different cultivars should be observed. Selectively neutral microsatellite markers were used to genotype 260 isolates of Z. tritici taken from two naturally infected randomized block trials of four different cultivars, representing a spectrum of resistance to Z. tritici from susceptible to resistant. By calculating genetic parameters such as overall heterozygosity and F ST from this genotypic data, the presented study aimed to determine if genetic drift or host selection is impacting on the genetic structure of the Irish Z. tritici population. Results indicated that diversity was distributed almost entirely within, rather than among populations, with little or no differentiation, and almost no clone isolates were present in the dataset. However this result was not reflected in the accessory chromosomes, where evidence of minor but significant genetic structure was found. This lack of structure in the core chromosomes and weak structure in the accessory chromosomes confirms that forces of genetic drift and selection are minor compared to sexual reproduction, in concurrence with multiple previous studies on other populations worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  a11S113cIrish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine 3aB chromosomes 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3acultivars 3adata collection 3agenetic drift 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahost preferences 3apathogens 3asexual reproduction 3awheat1 aFeechan, Angela1 aKildea, Steven0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 Jan., v. 150, no. 1 p.139-148dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1259-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011600168300001600284500001900300520114000319592002801459650001101487650001401498650001501512650001301527650001201540650001501552650001101567650001101578650002101589653001101610700002301621773022901644856008201873852000901955655001201964IND60679756220221122113328.0210608e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067975622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaa.2019.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarter, Linda S.10aPlasma dopamine concentrations following dopamine infusion to isoflurane-anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits  ap. 219-223.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo determine the pharmacokinetics of dopamine following a short infusion in isoflurane-anesthetized rabbits.Prospective, descriptive pharmacokinetic study.A group of six adult female New Zealand White rabbits weighing 4.4 ± 0.2 kg.Rabbits were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen and maintained at 1.2 × minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane (2.3% atmosphere). Dopamine (30 μg kg–¹ minute–¹) was infused for 10 minutes. Arterial blood was sampled prior, during and following the infusion at various intervals for 1 hour.A one-compartment model with baseline concentration best fitted the time–plasma dopamine concentration data. Estimated typical population value (interindividual variability) for volume of distribution and clearance were 10.3 (232%) L kg–¹ and 9.9 (508%) L minute–¹ kg–¹, respectively.There was a large degree of interindividual variation in the disposition of dopamine. The large volume of distribution and high metabolic clearance rate reported for dopamine in this study likely explains the lack of clinical efficacy of dopamine in rabbits at doses up to 30 μg kg–¹ minute–¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanalgesia 3aanesthesia 3adopamine 3afemales 3aisoflurane 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apharmacokinetics 0arabbit1 aPypendop, Bruno H.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2020 Mar., v. 47, no. 2 p.219-223dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaa.2019.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008300169300001600252520102500268592002801293596004901321650002901370650001001399650000901409650001601418650002001434650001101454650001001465650001001475650004501485650001801530650001401548650001801562650002201580651002101602700001701623700001901640700001901659773013401678856008201812852000901894655001201903IND60588732220221120045212.0191113e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1265-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAktaruzzaman, Md.10aPost-harvest anthracnose of papaya caused by Colletotrichum truncatum in Korea  ap. 259-265.  aIn October 2016, we collected samples of post-harvest anthracnose of papaya from Gangneung, Gangwon Province, Korea. Infected fruits first showed tiny light brown spots on their surface followed by development of sunken water-soaked lesions with black acervuli. Fungal pathogen was isolated from the infected fruits and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and synthetic nutrient agar (SNA) medium. For identification of the fungus, morphological assessment and sequencing analysis of 5.8S ribosomal DNA (ITS-5.8S rDNA) and three protein-coding genes: actin (ACT), chitin synthase I (CHS-1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were performed. Pathogenicity of the fungal isolate was confirmed according to Koch’s postulates. The results of morphological examination, pathogenicity tests, and the ITS-5.8S rDNA, ACT, CHS-1, and G3PDH sequences confirmed Colletotrichum truncatum as the causal agent. This study provides news information about C. truncatum isolated from post-harvest papaya in Korea.  aPublisher supplied data  a213001-04-4-SB630cGolden Seed Project Grant 3aColletotrichum truncatum 3aactin 3aagar 3aanthracnose 3achitin synthase 3afruits 3afungi 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3aKorean Peninsula1 aAfroz, Tania1 aYi, Yŏng-gyu,1 aKim, Byung-Sup0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 Jan., v. 150, no. 1 p.259-265dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1265-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03891naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100003000174245011700204300001600321520192600337592002802263650001902291650001902310650002302329650002802352650002302380650002902403650001702432650001502449650001702464650002602481650002102507650002802528650001102556650001502567650002102582650001102603650001202614650001702626650003402643650003202677650001702709650002702726650001102753650002902764650001802793650002902811650004102840650001802881650003702899651001902936651001802955700002602973700001802999700002003017773011803037856008903155852000903244655001203253IND50059287720221118184608.0141111e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005928772DNAL7 a230727002pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, Line Lindegaard10aBiodiversity and probiotic potential of yeasts isolated from Fura, a West African spontaneously fermented cereal  ap. 144-151.  aFura is a spontaneously fermented pearl millet product consumed in West Africa. The yeast species involved in the fermentation were identified by pheno- and genotypic methods to be Candida krusei, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Candida tropicalis, Candida rugosa, Candida fabianii, Candida norvegensis and Trichosporon asahii. C. krusei and K. marxianus were found to be the dominant species. Survival in pH 2.5 or in the presence of bile salts (0.3% (w/v) oxgall) and growth at 37°C were independently determined as indicators of the survival potential of the isolates during passage through the human gastrointestinal tract. Selected yeast species isolates were assessed for their probiotic potential. All of the examined yeast isolates survived and grew at human gastrointestinal conditions in pH 2.5, 0.3% (w/v) oxgall at 37°C. The effect on the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) across polarized monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells of human (Caco-2) and porcine (IPEC-J2) origin, were determined. The Caco-2 cells and IPEC-J2 cells displayed clearly different relative TEER results. The strains of C. krusei, K. marxianus, C. rugosa and T. asahii were able to increase the relative TEER of Caco-2 monolayers after 48h. In comparison, the relative TEER of IPEC-J2 monolayers decreased when exposed to the same yeasts, even though T. asahii did not differ significantly from Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii which is used as a human probiotic. C. tropicalis resulted in the largest relative TEER decrease for both the human and the porcine cell model assays. Hyphal growth was observed for C. albicans and C. tropicalis after 48h of incubation with polarized Caco-2 monolayers, whereas this was not the case for the remaining yeast species. In the present study new yeast strains with potential probiotic properties have been isolated to be used potentially as starter cultures for fura production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida krusei 3aCandida rugosa 3aCandida tropicalis 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aTrichosporon 3abile salts 3abiodiversity 3aelectrical resistance 3aepithelial cells 3agastrointestinal system 3agrains 3aprobiotics 3astarter cultures 3ayeasts 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aCandidaxgrowth & development 2aEdible Grainxmicrobiology. 2aFermentation 2aGastrointestinal Tract 2aHumans 2aIntestinesxmicrobiology 2aKluyveromyces 2aPennisetumxmicrobiology 2aProbioticsxisolation & purification 2aSaccharomyces 2aYeastsxisolation & purification 3aWestern Africa 0aAfrica, West.1 aOwusu-Kwarteng, James1 aThorsen, Line1 aJespersen, Lene0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 159, no. 2 p.144-151dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012100183300001600304520059500320592002800915650001900943650001800962650001000980650002200990650001001012650001401022650003001036650001201066650002101078650002201099650001401121650007201135650002501207650002701232650002901259651001101288651002001299651002501319700002001344700002201364700002801386700002301414700002101437773009601458856004801554852000901602655001201611IND4449584720221119151307.0121003e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444958472DNAL7 a212939682pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-011-0918-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDallot, Sylvie10aMediterranean and central-eastern European countries host viruses of two different clades of plum pox virus strain M  ap. 539-542.  aThe genetic diversity of plum pox virus strain M (PPV-M) was assessed by analyzing 28 isolates collected in 8 European countries.

These cells possess an evolutionarily conserved invariant T cell receptor α chain restricted by the nonpolymorphic class Ib major histocompatibility (MHC) molecule, MHC class I-related protein (MR1). The recent discovery that MAIT cells are activated by MR1-bound riboflavin metabolite derivatives distinguishes MAIT cells from all other αβ T cells in the immune system. Since mammals lack the capacity to synthesize riboflavin, intermediates from the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway are distinct microbial molecular patterns that provide a unique signal to the immune system. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that MAIT cells, which produce important cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-17A, have the potential to influence immune responses to a broad range of pathogens. Here we will discuss our current understanding of MAIT cell biology and their role in pathogen defense.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3abiochemical pathways 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-17 3ametabolites 3apathogens 3ariboflavin 3atumor necrosis factors0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2014 Dec., v. 71, no. 24 p.4831-4840dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-014-1708-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245009400177300001600271520106200287592002801349650002301377650001501400650001201415650002701427650002001454650001301474650001501487650001401502650001601516650002001532650001001552700002701562700002201589700001801611700002101629700002101650700003001671773009601701856008801797990002301885852000901908655001201917IND60098476320221123002510.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009847632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLjunger, Elisabeth10aUltrasonographic findings in spontaneous miscarriage: relation to euploidy and aneuploidy  ap. 221-224.  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate a possible correlation between transvaginal ultrasound findings in miscarriages and cytogenetic analyses from chorionic villi obtained by dilatation and curettage.

RESULT(S): The mean gestational age was 9.5 weeks. Chromosomal analyses were successful in 259 cases, 159 with cytogenetic abnormalities and 100 euploidy. Empty gestational sacs were equally often found in euploidy and aneuploidy, whereas small embryonic or fetal poles were significantly more often associated with aneuploidy. CONCLUSION(S): A smaller than expected fetal size when a miscarriage is diagnosed during the first trimester is significantly associated with a chromosomal aberration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabortion (animals) 3aaneuploidy 3achorion 3achromosome aberrations 3agestational age 3apatients 3apolyploidy 3apregnancy 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 3awomen1 aStavreus-Evers, Anneli1 aCnattingius, Sven1 aEkbom, Anders1 aLundin, Catarina1 aAnnéren, Göran1 aSundström-Poromaa, Inger0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.221-224dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.06.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010900162300001600271500002000287520185100307592002802158650001702186650001702203650001002220650001302230650002002243650002002263650001902283650001402302650001602316650001102332651001202343651002902355700002302384773012702407856007302534852000902607655001202616IND60587926120221117215854.0180102e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058792612DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.125292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantangeli, Andrea10aAre winter and breeding bird communities able to track rapid climate change? Lessons from the high North  ap. 308-316.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Climate change is a major threat to biodiversity and a major factor underlying observed shifts in species distribution, abundance and phenology. Research effort on climate change impacts on species has often been based on single‐species studies focused on a single season, typically the breeding season, of species life cycles. We test how well winter and breeding bird communities are able to track climate change. LOCATION: Finland. METHODS: We use a dataset consisting of bird counts from the winter and the breeding period spanning over four decades and a 1000 km latitudinal gradient across Finland, Northern Europe. We use the bird count data in combination with a species‐specific average temperature index to derive a functional index, the Community Temperature Index (CTI), which provides a measure of the relative temperature average of a community. RESULTS: We show that the CTI of the winter bird community (CTIw) in Finland has increased significantly over the past four decades, but not as fast as the average winter temperature. Across Finland, CTIw decreased towards the north and the east of the country and increased with increasing temperature. Further, we show that change in CTI through time (from 1970s–1980s to 2000–2014) was similar between the winter and the breeding communities. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results suggest that while the winter and breeding bird communities are, to a certain level, tracking increasing temperatures, the magnitude of temperature change is multiple times greater than the magnitude of community shifts. This is particularly true for the winter birds that are facing the most rapid temperature shifts. Our findings shed light on the importance of assessing and eventually addressing the effects of rapid climate warming beyond the breeding season of species life cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3adata collection 3aglobal warming 3aphenology 3atemperature 3awinter 3aFinland 3aNorthern European region1 aLehikoinen, Aleksi0 tDiversity & distributions.g2017 Mar., v. 23, no. 3 p.308-316dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.125293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011200204520101500316592002801331650001901359650002001378650001901398700002101417700002201438700001801460700002101478700001901499773009401518856008101612852000901693655001201702IND60725072720221118063529.0210124e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072507272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1040642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBylow, Helene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0315-159810aSupplementary dataset to self-learning training compared with instructor-led training in basic life support  aIn this article, we present supplementary data to the article entitled “Self-learning training versus instructor-led training in basic life support: a cluster randomised trial” [1].

In this study, we used empirical data to produce an estimate of the population trend for sub-adult and adult white sharks in central California. We used the unique dorsal fin morphology to build a mark-recapture data set in a modified Jolly-Seber model (POPAN formulation) to estimate annual abundance and then investigate population growth rates using parametric bootstrapping methods for sub-adult and adult sharks (males and females). For all demographic groups combined, we found equivocal evidence for a positive regional population growth (λ = 1.07 (95% CI = 0.91 to 1.23)). However, sex- and size-specific population growth rate estimates provided some evidence of population increases for reproductively mature males (λ = 1.06 (95% CI = 0.99 to 1.13)) and females (λ = 1.06 (95% CI = 0.95 to 1.17)). For sub-adult male and female white sharks, point estimates of λ were positive but uncertainty prevents strong inference (λ = 1.07 (95% CI = 0.85 to 1.29)) and (λ = 1.08 (95% CI = 0.88 to 1.28)), respectively. Our findings of a potential increase in reproductive-aged white sharks in central California may be a result of regional fluxes in density or attributed in part to current protection efforts and subsequent increase in abundance of pinnipeds as well as reduced gill-net fisheries mortality of juveniles. A trend estimate for the entire northeastern Pacific will require obtaining similar data across known aggregation areas along the west coast of North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinnipedia 3aadults 3acoasts 3adata collection 3afemales 3afins 3agillnets 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3amodels 3amortality 3apopulation growth 3asexual maturity 3auncertainty 3aCalifornia 0aAbundance 0aPopulation trend 0aMark-recapture 0aWhite shark 0aCalifornia1 aRotella, Jay J.1 aChapple, Taylor K.1 aAnderson, Scot D.1 aWhite, T.

The phytase preparation had protease and amylase activities. Addition of the crude phytase preparation induced bread crust collapse. Protease-free high- and low-amylase phytase fractions were prepared using preparative ampholyte-free isoelectric focusing (autofocusing). Addition of the protease-free low-amylase phytase fraction did not significantly affect loaf volume and did not collapse the crust. Addition of the protease-free high-amylase phytase fraction significantly increased loaf volume approximately 1.5× in the presence of amylase at 193–1029U. However, addition of 1029 and 2058U of amylase induced partial and whole bread crust collapse, respectively. Therefore, removal of protease and control of amylase activities in the phytase preparation are crucial in the preparation of brown rice flour-added bread with a low myo-inositol phosphate (IP₆) and good swelling property.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3abreads 3abrown rice 3aingredients 3aisoelectric focusing 3aloaves 3amyo-inositol 3aphytases 3aproteinases1 aSatō, Kenji,1 aPark, Eun Young1 aNakamura, Yasushi1 aOhtsuki, Kozo0 tJournal of functional foods.g2012 Apr., v. 4, no. 2 p.513-519dElsevier Ltdx1756-46467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245014600203300001600349506007600365520155400441592002801995506003702023650002702060650002902087650001902116650002102135650001802156650002102174650001502195650001802210650002302228650003802251650001002289650001102299650001202310650000902322650002002331650002102351650001902372650001402391650001702405650001302422651001002435653002702445653001402472653002102486653001702507653001002524700001902534700002102553700001702574700001802591700002202609700001802631700001802649700001702667700001902684700002302703700001702726700002202743700002502765773011902790856007902909852000902988655001202997IND60515166920221207055026.0160313e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051516692DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2013.13492doi7 aPMC39930672pmcid7 a246899892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Neekun10aSerosurveillance for Francisella tularensis Among Wild Animals in Japan Using a Newly Developed Competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay  ap. 234-239.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTularemia, a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by Francisella tularensis, occurs sporadically in Japan. However, little is known about the prevalence of the disease in wild animals. A total of 632 samples obtained from 150 Japanese black bears, 142 Japanese hares, 120 small rodents, 97 rats, 53 raptors, 26 Japanese monkeys, 21 Japanese raccoon dogs, 20 masked palm civets, and three Japanese red foxes between 2002 and 2010 were investigated for the presence of antibodies to F. tularensis by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) and the commonly used microagglutination (MA) test. Seropositive cELISA and MA results were obtained in 23 and 18 Japanese black bears, three and two Japanese raccoon dogs, and two and one small rodents, respectively. All MA-positive samples (n=21) were also positive by cELISA. Six of seven samples that were only positive by cELISA were confirmed to be antibody-positive by western blot analysis. These findings suggest that cELISA is a highly sensitive and useful test for serosurveillance of tularemia among various species of wild animals. Because this is the first study to detect F. tularensis–seropositive Japanese raccoon dogs, these could join Japanese black bears as sentinel animals for tularemia in the wild in Japan. Further continuous serosurveillance for F. tularensis in various species of wild animals using appropriate methods such as cELISA is important to assess the risks of human exposure and to improve our understanding of the ecology of F. tularensis in the wild.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aNyctereutes procyonoides 3aPaguma larvata 3aUrsus thibetanus 3aVulpes vulpes 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3abirds of prey 3adisease prevalence 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahares 3ahumans 3amonkeys 3arats 3arisk assessment 3asentinel animals 3aseroprevalence 3atularemia 3awild animals 3azoonoses 3aJapan 0aFrancisella tularensis 0aTularemia 0aSerosurveillance 0aWild animals 0aJapan1 aHotta, Akitoyo1 aYamamoto, Yoshie1 aUda, Akihiko1 aFujita, Osamu1 aMizoguchi, Toshio1 aShindo, Junji1 aPark, Chun-Ho1 aKudo, Noboru1 aHatai, Hitoshi1 aOyamada, Toshifumi1 aYamada, Akio1 aMorikawa, Shigeru1 aTanabayashi, Kiyoshi0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 14, no. 4 p.234-239dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-77597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fvbz.2013.13493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009800165520094200263592002801205650002201233650002001255651001001275653002201285653002501307653002001332653001301352653001701365653002601382700001801408700002001426700002301446773009401469856008101563852000901644655001201653IND60725073020221118063532.0210124e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072507302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1040672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCh'ng, Eugene10aDatasets from the evaluation of the adoption and use of digital technologies in China museums  aThe datasets described in this article were collected as a result of 5 months of funded study, carried out between 23rd January 2017 and 30th May 2017 within China.

For this purpose, FTIR was explored together with mechanical loading as a means of studying the molecular responses to the loading of spruce wood and cellulose paper material. A linear shift of absorption bands was detected as the loading was applied. In relation to the applied stress these shifts were higher under moist conditions than under dry ones but they were similar with regard to the strains applied. There were no shifts detected in bands related to lignin or the hemicelluloses. The results are interpreted as reflecting a parallel arrangement of the load bearing component, the cellulose ordered structure, and the moisture accessible regions in the cellulose microfibril structure. This therefore represents an equal strain loaded system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3acellulose 3alignin 3amechanical loads 3amechanical properties 3apaper 3awood 3awood fibers1 aBergström, Elina0 tCellulose.g2009 Dec., v. 16, no. 6 p.975-982dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-009-9331-z3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02571naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009300173520124600266592002801512650002101540650001701561650002101578650002301599650001101622650001201633650001601645650001401661650001701675650001901692650001101711653002401722653002401746653002801770653002501798653002601823653004801849700001601897700002401913773010601937856008502043852000902128655001202137IND60735498120221119132424.0211001e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073549812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2021.1091182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandler, Ronald L.13aAn ethical analysis of cloning for genetic rescue: Case study of the black-footed ferret  aGenetic rescue is a management tool used to decrease genetic load and increase fitness. The technique relies on the addition of unique genomes into a population's gene pool, but when no living candidates are available for translocation, preserved genetic resources may be an option. Biobanks are a source of cryopreserved material, including fibroblasts which have the potential to be used as source genetic material, but would require the use of cloning to create a living individual with the desired genome. An ethical analysis of this emerging technology in conservation is necessary to help determine when cloning is justified and to identify issues that need to be addressed in order that the management action is approached responsibly. We provide a framework for ethical analysis of conservation cloning for genetic rescue by considering the goals, means and desirability of conservation cloning. We then conduct a preliminary analysis of the use of conservation cloning for the genetic rescue of an endangered species, the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), as a case study. The analysis generates several recommendations for moving toward ethically responsible introduction of cloning into black-footed ferret recovery efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMustela nigripes 3acase studies 3acryopreservation 3aendangered species 3aethics 3aferrets 3afibroblasts 3agene pool 3agenetic load 3agenetic rescue 3agenome 0aBlack-footed ferret 0aBioethical analysis 0aBiosynthetic technology 0aConservation cloning 0aInbreeding depression 0aInterspecific somatic cell nuclear transfer1 aMoses, Lisa1 aWisely, Samantha M.0 tBiological conservation.g2021 May, v. 257 p.109118-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.1091183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245011200208300001800320506007600338520140500414592002801819506003701847650001601884650002001900650002201920650002001942650002601962650001001988650001801998650002202016650001102038650002202049700001602071700002902087700002302116700002102139700002002160700002002180773011402200856008102314852000902395655001202404IND60119067320221207095258.0141128e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011906732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-014-1655-72doi7 aPMC42347022pmcid7 a250126982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoland, Coilín10aCell-free expression and in meso crystallisation of an integral membrane kinase for structure determination  ap. 4895-4910.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMembrane proteins are key elements in cell physiology and drug targeting, but getting a high-resolution structure by crystallographic means is still enormously challenging. Novel strategies are in big demand to facilitate the structure determination process that will ultimately hasten the day when sequence information alone can provide a three-dimensional model. Cell-free or in vitro expression enables rapid access to large quantities of high-quality membrane proteins suitable for an array of applications. Despite its impressive efficiency, to date only two membrane proteins produced by the in vitro approach have yielded crystal structures. Here, we have analysed synergies of cell-free expression and crystallisation in lipid mesophases for generating an X-ray structure of the integral membrane enzyme diacylglycerol kinase to 2.28-Å resolution. The quality of cellular and cell-free-expressed kinase samples has been evaluated systematically by comparing (1) spectroscopic properties, (2) purity and oligomer formation, (3) lipid content and (4) functionality. DgkA is the first membrane enzyme crystallised based on cell-free expression. The study provides a basic standard for the crystallisation of cell-free-expressed membrane proteins and the methods detailed here should prove generally useful and contribute to accelerating the pace at which membrane protein structures are solved.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-radiation 3acell physiology 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adiacylglycerol kinase 3adrugs 3alipid content 3amembrane proteins 3amodels 3aspectral analysis1 aLi, Dianfan1 aShah, Syed Tasadaque Ali1 aHaberstock, Stefan1 aDötsch, Volker,1 aBernhard, Frank1 aCaffrey, Martin0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2014 Dec., v. 71, no. 24 p.4895-4910dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-014-1655-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011200169520184100281592002802122650002202150650002102172650001902193650001502212650001202227650002702239650001602266650002502282650001802307650001302325650002002338650001102358650001902369653001802388653002202406653001402428653002402442700001402466700001302480700002002493700001602513773011902529856008802648852000902736655001202745IND60745991520221123024621.0211003e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074599152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1492232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lijie10aAssessing effects of Ca2+ addition on membrane bioreactor performance and macro-floc sludge characteristics  aCalcium ions (Ca²⁺) can trigger coagulation-flocculation process to form macro-flocculated sludge (MFS). Thus, dosing Ca²⁺-containing reagents into membrane bioreactors (MBRs) is considered as a promising approach to mitigate membrane biofouling. However, a mechanistic understanding of Ca²⁺ addition to MBR performance remains elucidated, such as physicochemical characteristics of MFS and their functionality variations. Consequently, this study was sought to understand the interplays of Ca²⁺ addition and MBR performance with a focus on characterizing MFS in detail. Three parallel MBRs were amended with 82, 208 and 410 mg-Ca²⁺/L final concentrations. Particle size analyses revealed that MFS formation was overall enhanced by the Ca²⁺ addition and granular sludge with diameters of up to 900 μm was formed in the 410 mg-Ca²⁺/L scenario. We believed that cationic bridges facilitated by elevated Ca²⁺ concentrations in conjunction with coagulation-flocculation were primary mechanisms of the formation of large flocs. Moreover, significant portions of soluble proteins and polysaccharides were flocculated and precipitated by Ca²⁺, which demonstrated a negative correlation between extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) concentrations and the formation of MFS. Furthermore, the population abundancies of Thiotrichaceae, Sphingomonadales and Hyphomicrobiaceae decreased in the sludge with Ca²⁺ addition resulted in profound changes of the microbial communities in the MBRs. But MBR performance, such as chemical oxygen demand removal (over 90%), showed no variation during the MBR operation. On the contrary, total nitrogen removal was inhibited in the MBRs. It was because the enlarging MFS formed diffusion barriers to prevent organic component from entering into the sludge flocs to be consumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyphomicrobiaceae 3aSphingomonadales 3aThiotrichaceae 3abiofouling 3acalcium 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenvironment 3amembrane bioreactors 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3asludge 3atotal nitrogen 0aCa2+ addition 0aMacro-floc sludge 0aFloc size 0aMembrane bioreactor1 aDong, Nan1 aYe, Biao1 aZhuang, Wei-Qin1 aXia, Siqing0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 798 p.149223-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1492233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014000156500001400296520143700310592002801747650003001775650002301805650000901828650001101837650001201848650002001860650001301880650001401893650001601907650002101923650001101944650002201955650001301977650001901990650001802009650002702027650001702054650001502071651001002086700001502096700002002111700001402131700001402145700002002159773011902179856007402298852000902372655001202381IND60704418020221119125523.0200723e20200316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070441802DNAL7 a10.3390/w120308362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Biao 10aHydrochemical Characteristics of Groundwater and Dominant Water–Rock Interactions in the Delingha Area, Qaidam Basin, Northwest China  aNAL-light  aGroundwater is undoubtedly important for water supplies and eco-environment protection, especially for arid and semi-arid regions. Analyzing the characteristics and evolution of groundwater is significant for the rational management of groundwater resources. This study investigated the hydrogeochemical characteristics and evolutions of groundwater in the Delingha area, northeast of the Qaidam Basin, northwest China, with a total of 123 water samples, including 105 unconfined groundwater samples, 12 confined groundwater samples, and 6 surface water samples. Hydrochemical results showed that the unconfined and confined groundwater presented diversity in ion concentration. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) of the unconfined groundwater increased from 146.5 to 8954 mg/L along the groundwater flow direction. The groundwater hydrochemical types were HCO₃-Ca·Mg and HCO₃·SO₄-Ca·Mg in the mountain front area, SO₄·HCO₃-Ca·Mg and SO₄·Cl-Ca·Mg types in the alluvial-lacustrine plain, and Cl·SO₄-Na and Cl-Na types in the lacustrine plain. The saturation index showed that parts of the groundwater samples were supersaturated with carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite); however, all the samples were undersaturated with evaporite minerals (halite and gypsum). Groundwater chemical evolution is mainly controlled by evaporite and carbonate mineral dissolutions, aluminosilicates weathering, and cation exchange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aaluminum silicates 3aarea 3abasins 3acalcite 3acation exchange 3adolomite 3aevolution 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3agypsum 3ahydrogeochemistry 3asampling 3asemiarid zones 3asurface water 3atotal dissolved solids 3awater supply 3aweathering 3aChina1 aZhao, Dan 1 aZhou, Pengpeng 1 aQu, Shen 1 aLiao, Fu 1 aWang, Guangcai 0 tWater.g2020 Mar. 16, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120308363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013500171300001600306520124000322592002801562650001801590650001601608650001501624650001601639650002001655650001201675650002601687650002801713650001401741650002601755650002301781650001501804653003101819653002801850653002801878653003801906653003201944700002001976773009601996856005102092852000902143655001202152IND50086572120221123004752.0140412e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008657212DNAL7 a10.1080/01650424.2012.6430522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzivák, Ildikó10aAre there any differences between taxa groups having distinct ecological traits based on their responses to environmental factors?  ap. 173-187.  aThe aim of this study was to explore the differences between taxa groups with different ecological strategies for persistence, regarding their responses to environmental factors and seasonal variation. We studied the relationship between the seasonal patterns and habitat attributes of the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) and the Colepotera, Heteroptera (CH) assemblages. Sampling was carried out in May, July and October of 2009. Samples were taken according to the AQEM protocol at 10 stream sections in the Mecsek Mountains. Based on multivariate analyses (RDA, pRDA), distinctive differences were found between the EPT and the CH taxa groups regarding their response to local chemical variables and variables describing the riparian vegetation. The measured environmental variables had a higher relative influence on the distribution patterns of EPT and CH assemblages than spatial variation of species patterns. The physical structure of aquatic habitats, including the type of bedrock, had greater effects on CH than EPT patterns, whereas the structure of riparian vegetation was more important for EPT than CH. Average density and average taxon richness of EPT were seasonally variable, but CH assemblages were not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphemeroptera 3aHeteroptera 3aPlecoptera 3aTrichoptera 3aaquatic habitat 3abedrock 3aenvironmental factors 3ainterspecific variation 3amountains 3amultivariate analysis 3aseasonal variation 3avegetation 0aaquatic insect assemblages 0anear-natural headwaters 0aenvironmental variables 0aspatial and seasonal distribution 0aPartial Redundancy Analysis1 aCsabai, Zoltán0 tAquatic insects.g2012 June 1, v. 34, no. sup1 p.173-187dTaylor & Francisx1744-41527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650424.2012.643052  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010100170520197300271592002802244650001102272650001102283650001402294650001502308650001802323650001302341650001402354653003902368653001902407653001802426653003202444700001502476700001702491700001902508773010602527856008702633852000902720655001202729IND60790552820221118150044.0221004e20221120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079055282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xianliang10apH-responsive bimetallic Ce-ZIF-8 nanocontainer for the active corrosion protection of Al alloys  aIn this study, novel pH-sensitive bimetallic Ce-ZIF-8 nanocontainers are loaded with benzotriazole (BTA) corrosion inhibitors and then decorated with a polydopamine (PDA) shell. The applied PDA layer acts as an acid-responsive gatekeeper, controlling the intelligent release of the encapsulated inhibitors and also preventing their self-leakage. UV–vis and ICP-OES tests indicate that the BTA and cerium inhibitors release slowly in the neutral 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Afterward, the designed pH-responsive Ce-ZIF-8-BTA-PDA nanocontainers are dispersed uniformly in the epoxy matrix as a novel intelligent filler. EIS results demonstrate that the incorporation of Ce-ZIF-8-BTA-PDA nanocontainers significantly improves the corrosion resistance of epoxy coatings, in which the low-frequency impedance is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of the pure epoxy coating after 60 days of immersion. Furthermore, the low-frequency value of the scratched Epoxy-Ce-ZIF-8-BTA-PDA coating increases from 5.05 × 10⁵ Ω cm² to 8.83 × 10⁵ Ω cm² after 8 h of exposure to the 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, confirming their outstanding self-healing performance. The excellent corrosion protection and self-healing ability are due to the incorporation of the Ce-ZIF-8-BTA-PDA nanocontainers, improving the surface compactness and therefore enhancing the physical barrier effect. Moreover, the intelligent release of the encapsulated corrosion inhibitors provides active corrosion protection performance by forming a dense protective film on the Al alloy surface when the coating is damaged. Meanwhile, the highly dispersed nanocontainers lengthen the diffusion path of corrosive ions and therefore extend the service life of the epoxy coatings in aggressive environments. This new type of acid-responsive smart coating based on the bimetallic Ce-ZIF-8 nanocontainers has the potential to broaden the future applications of active corrosion protection of metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acerium 3acorrosion 3adurability 3aencapsulation 3aepoxides 3atriazoles 0aBimetallic metal-organic framework 0aNanocontainers 0apH-responsive 0aActive corrosion protection1 aDi, Yuyang1 aChen, Zhihao1 aYang, Wenzhong0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 653 p.129990-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012400167300001800291520099400309592002801303650004401331650001401375650002501389650001701414650002301431650001601454650000901470650001401479650001301493650002501506650001601531700002001547700001901567700002001586700005701606773011101663856008201774852000901856655001201865IND60685052920221119204821.0200227e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068505292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02947-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevanič, Jaka10aStable nanocellulose gels prepared by crosslinking of surface charged cellulose nanofibrils with di- and triiodoalkanes  ap. 2053-2068.  aNanocellulose gels were prepared by a new chemical crosslinking approach. Carboxy group containing cellulose nanofibrils, which were prepared by (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl (TEMPO) mediated oxidation, were reacted with two different diiodoalkanes and one triiodoalkane in DMSO/water dispersions at elevated temperatures.

It was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy that crosslinking of TEMPO oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TCNF) occurs by the formation of ester bonds. The kinetics of gel formation were evaluated by oscillatory rheology experiments. For long alkyl chain cross-linkers, namely 1,4-diiodobutane and 1,10-diiododecane, the initial gel was formed within a short time (gel point < 5 min) and further evolved upon time for about 0.5–2 h. For the short crosslinker triiodomethane, gel formation was slower and resulted in lower mechanical strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acrosslinking 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adispersions 3agels 3aoxidation 3arheology 3astrength (mechanics) 3atemperature1 aGericke, Martin1 aHeinze, Thomas1 aPoljanšek, Ida1 aOven, Primož1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8151-38170 tCellulose.g2020 Mar., v. 27, no. 4 p.2053-2068dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02947-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002400167245010600191300001600297520198700313592002802300650001902328650002002347650001802367650002202385650001902407650001902426650001002445650000902455651001902464653001502483653003402498653002902532653001502561653001902576653002302595653002602618700002702644773010102671856011502772852000902887655001202896IND50065153520221118002046.0151127e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006515352DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2005)16[587:SRBTSA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoukoulas, Sotirios10aSpatial relationships between tree species and gap characteristics in broad-leaved deciduous woodland  ap. 587-596.  aQuestions: 1. What are the spatial patterns of all trees, individual tree species, trees within particular height classes, all gaps and gaps with specific properties across the study site in broad-leaved deciduous forest at a range of scales? 2. Are patterns of the above features spatially associated? 3. Are these patterns indicative of gap creation mechanisms and phases of regeneration?Location: Frame Wood, New Forest, UK.Methods: Ripley's K-function analysis was applied to spatial information derived from airborne remotely sensed imagery to characterize the patterns of trees and gaps and to test for spatial interactions between these patterns. The patterns of trees and gaps with specific physical and spatial properties were analysed.Results: The pattern of all tree species combined was random for most scales; Quercus robur followed the same random pattern, while Fagus sylvatica and Betula pendula were clustered over most spatial scales. Large gaps (> 250 m²) and larger trees (> 17.5 m) were randomly distributed, while smaller gaps and smaller trees were clustered. Significant spatial relationships were demonstrated between the patterns of different tree species and between trees within different size classes, as well as between the patterns of trees and gaps with specific properties.Conclusions: Small gap patterns and field evidence indicated that progressive gap enlargement is the most likely creation mechanism for large gaps (> 250 m²). Clustered patterns of younger individuals were indicative of patches of past regeneration. As a complement to field-based data, data derived from remotely sensed imagery provides spatially comprehensive information with which to further investigate woodland stand/community processes and gap dynamics.Abbreviations: ATM == Airborne thematic mapper; CHM == Canopy height model; CSR == Complete spatial randomness; GHD == Gap height diversity; GSCI == Gap shape complexity index; LiDAR == Light detection and ranging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aFagus sylvatica 3aQuercus robur 3adeciduous forests 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3atrees 3awood 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFrame Wood 0aGap-tree spatial relationship 0aForest spatial structure 0aNew Forest 0aRemote sensing 0aRipley' K-function 0aSpatial point pattern1 aBlackburn, George Alan0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2005 Oct., v. 16, no. 5 p.587-596dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1100-9233%282005%2916%5B587%3ASRBTSA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01485naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011700151300001800268520049400286592002800780650002100808650000900829650002200838650001400860700001300874700001800887700001900905700002000924700001400944773011700958856007501075852000901150655001201159IND60550126520221119150514.0160909e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055012652DNAL7 a10.1021/jo400228g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xun10aAu(I)/Ag(I)-Catalyzed Cascade Approach for the Synthesis of Benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazolinones  ap. 4312-4318.  aAn efficient and facile Au(I)/Ag(I)-catalyzed cascade method has been developed for one-pot synthesis of the complex polycyclic heterocycles benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazolinone derivatives through treatment of the substituted 2-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)anilines with 4-pentynoic acid or 5-hexynoic acid.

This makes pasta a great vehicle for delivering functional ingredients. This article reviews the popular functional ingredients – cereals, pseudocereal, legumes and vegetables, that are used to enrich pasta. The influence of these functional ingredients, additives and cooking process on pasta’s nutritional, technical and sensory properties is summarized. This article focusses on the effects of different forms of these ingredients on the quality of cereal foods. Such as carrot juice pasta has a superior technical quality than carrot flour pasta. As far as can be established there are very few articles examining the effects of different forms of ingredients on pasta. Puree or liquid form raw vegetable materials offfers a better option than conventional powder form to add to semolina to produce functional pasta with superior technical quality and improved nutritional value.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrot juice 3acarrots 3aflour 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3apasta 3apseudocereals 3asemolina 3astaple foods 0aLegumes 0avegetable 0awhole-grain cereals 0adietary fibers 0aadditives1 aBrennan, Margaret Anne1 aServenti, Luca1 aBrennan, Charles Stephen0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 July 23, v. 62, no. 22 p.6069-6080dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.18957123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245015400164520179900318592002802117650002102145650001802166650001102184650001802195650001502213650001902228650001802247650001402265650001902279650001502298650001702313650002002330650001402350650002602364653002102390653003002411653001902441653001902460653001702479700001402496700001402510700001702524700001502541773010602556856008702662852000902749655001202758IND60790553120221119180916.0220914e20221205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079055312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wei10aSuperamphiphobic cotton fabric with photocatalysis and ultraviolet shielding property based on hierarchical ZnO/halloysite nanotubes hybrid particles  aThe combination of photocatalysis and superamphiphobic cotton fabric has attracted extensive attention as it can not only repel the millimeter-scale contaminant droplets in daily life, but also photodegrade the micro-droplet pollutants with ultralow surface tension d in light. However, its invention is a great challenge. In this work, superamphiphobic cotton fabrics with photocatalysis and ultraviolet (UV) shielding property were fabricated based on fluorinated ZnO/halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) hybrid particles with micro/nano hierarchical structures and photocatalytic activity. The ZnO/HNTs hybrid particles were prepared by in-situ growth of ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) with unique needlelike microstructure, high aspect ratio, eco-friendliness, low cost, biocompatibility, and abundance in nature. The fluorinated ZnO/HNTs (F-ZnO/HNTs) based on ZnO/HNTs were sprayed onto cotton fabrics to obtain superamphiphobic cotton fabrics with ultraviolet (UV) shielding and photocatalysis. The as-obtained cotton fabrics could repel common liquids in daily life even with low surface tension (the rapeseed oil contact angle was 154.3 ± 0.9°), exhibiting excellent superamphiphobic self-cleaning and antifouling properties. About 89 % of methylene orange was degraded after being irradiated by UV lamp for 4 h, indicating that the coated cotton fabric had excellent photocatalytic activity. Importantly, after 1500 cycles of mechanical abrasion, 60 h UV illumination or1h of immersion in acidic and alkali solutions, the coated cotton fabrics retained superamphiphobic performance. Due to the synergistic effect of the superamphiphobic and photocatalytic performance, the obtained cotton fabrics showed potential applications in various promising fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acontact angle 3acotton 3acotton fabric 3ahalloysite 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3arapeseed oil 3asurface tension 3asynergism 3aultraviolet radiation 0aSuperamphiphobic 0aZnO/HNTs hybrid particles 0aCotton fabrics 0aPhotocatalysis 0aUV shielding1 aXu, Lihui1 aPan, Hong1 aWang, Liming1 aShen, Yong0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Dec. 05, v. 654 p.129995-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011100159500002000270520178200290592002802072650001802100650006902118650001802187650001302205650001102218650001502229650002002244650001202264650001602276650001302292650001102305650002102316650001802337650003202355651000902387700006202396700002902458700002702487700002702514700003102541773011602572856007302688852000902761655001202770IND60688195220221117044258.0200410e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068819522DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.025982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi, Kourosh10aPatterns of density and structure of natural populations of Taxus baccata in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIran's Hyrcanian forests cover a relatively narrow strip in the northeastern part of the country, and are among the most important and valuable ecosystems inscribed in United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List. European yew Taxus baccata L. is a Tertiary relict in the region and a long‐lived dioecious tree with high ecological and economic importance in the Hyrcanian forests. To study the structure and analysing the survivorship of yew stands, we selected two forest reserves (Gazou and Afratakhteh) with European yew. In the two study areas, we established 165 0.1 ha circular sample plots (75 of the sample plots were in Gazou and 90 sample plots were in Afratakhteh) and measured three characteristics of each tree. The structure of the stands was quantified by means of 1) size distributions by diameter at breast height (DBH), 2) height classes, 3) and stand basal area. Comparison of the diameter distribution by DBH classes in two the forest reserves showed that there was no statistical difference between the two populations. The highest number of yew trees in the Afratakhteh and Gazou populations were in the 12–16 and 18–24 m height classes, respectively. In Gazou, abundance was greatest at 1000 m a.s.l. on mesic exposures and intermediate slopes (40–50%), whereas in Afratakhteh it was found at 1600–1620 m a.s.l. on east‐facing areas with 55–65% slopes. Static life tables indicated that the first two age classes have particularily high mortality. Based on these results, we conclude that forest managers should support the regeneration of stands and increase survival rates by applying treatments such as thinning and selective removal of shrubs and saplings of other tree species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaxus baccata 3aUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 3aage structure 3aaltitude 3adioecy 3aecosystems 3aforest reserves 3aforests 3alife tables 3asaplings 3ashrubs 3astand basal area 3asurvival rate 3atree and stand measurements 3aIran1 aJalil Alavi, Seyed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7490-406X1 aZahedi Amiri, Ghavamudin1 aMohsen Hosseini, Seyed1 aSerra‐Diaz, Josep M.1 aSvenning, Jens‐Christian0 tNordic journal of botany.g2020 Mar., v. 38, no. 3dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl33104x0107-055X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/njb.025983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245006200188300001400250520154300264592002801807650001201835650001301847650001801860650001101878650001501889650000901904650001201913650001401925650002301939650003501962650002401997700001702021700002602038700002102064773009202085856004802177852000902225655001202234IND4486572220221118002109.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448657222DNAL7 a220951492pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-011-0862-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarmer, Aaron M. T.10aOptimal web investment in sub-optimal foraging conditions  ap. 65-70.  aOrb web spiders sit at the centre of their approximately circular webs when waiting for prey and so face many of the same challenges as central-place foragers. Prey value decreases with distance from the hub as a function of prey escape time. The further from the hub that prey are intercepted, the longer it takes a spider to reach them and the greater chance they have of escaping. Several species of orb web spiders build vertically elongated ladder-like orb webs against tree trunks, rather than circular orb webs in the open. As ladder web spiders invest disproportionately more web area further from the hub, it is expected they will experience reduced prey gain per unit area of web investment compared to spiders that build circular webs. We developed a model to investigate how building webs in the space-limited microhabitat on tree trunks influences the optimal size, shape and net prey gain of arboricolous ladder webs. The model suggests that as horizontal space becomes more limited, optimal web shape becomes more elongated, and optimal web area decreases. This change in web geometry results in decreased net prey gain compared to webs built without space constraints. However, when space is limited, spiders can achieve higher net prey gain compared to building typical circular webs in the same limited space. Our model shows how spiders optimise web investment in sub-optimal conditions and can be used to understand foraging investment trade-offs in other central-place foragers faced with constrained foraging arenas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aforaging 3amicrohabitats 3amodels 3atree trunk 3awebs 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Biological 2aPredatory Behaviorxphysiology 2aSpidersxphysiology1 aKokko, Hanna1 aHerberstein, Marie E.1 aMadin, Joshua S.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2012 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.65-70dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-011-0862-4  aDNAL 7aarticle01024naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245004400167300001200211520021000223592002800433650002200461650001400483650001700497653002300514653002100537653001900558773010000577856004800677852000900725655001200734IND50086572720221123004802.0140412e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008657272DNAL7 a10.1080/092910110036507812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlksnis, Edgars10aBiological clock and the origin of life  ap. 1-3.  aA hypothesis about two physical fields that created organic life in Earth's ancient ocean 3–4 billion years ago, and still determine the biological clock phenomenon via changes in the structure of water.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological clocks 3aevolution 3aoceanography 0astructure of water 0abiological clock 0aorigin of life0 tBiological rhythm research.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 42, no. 1 p.1-3dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291011003650781  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009800152300001800250500001900268520120900287592002801496650002301524650002401547650002201571650001901593700001301612700001901625700001901644773014201663856007401805852000901879655001201888IND60734690520221119195321.0210422e20210420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073469052DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta11910e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jie10aTwo-dimensional layered double hydroxides as a platform for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution  ap. 9389-9430.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) plays an essential role in hydrogen production via water splitting, metal–air secondary batteries, and artificial photosynthesis. Among the various OER catalysts, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted significant attention due to their compositional and structural flexibility, as well as tenability, and have been acknowledged as one of the most promising electrocatalysts. Nonetheless, OER possesses sluggish kinetics because it involves a four-electron pathway. Numerous efforts directed to tailoring the structure and composition of electrocatalysts have resulted in accelerated intrinsic catalytic activity and more exposed active sites, and subsequently advanced electrocatalytic performance. In this review, the recent progress of LDHs for the OER and the primary mechanisms for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity are presented. Besides, other tactics for promoting the catalytic performance, such as synthesis of LDH-based derivatives and configurations of heterostructures, are summarized, followed by a hypothesis on the enhanced OER activity. Finally, the applications of the OER, as well as the challenges in using LDHs are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogen production 3aoxygen production 3aphotosynthesis1 aYu, Feng1 aYuen, Muk-Fung1 aWang, Chundong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 9, no. 15 p.9389-9430dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta11910e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245003500195500002000230520126200250592002801512650001001540650002401550650002601574650001101600650001001611650001501621650002301636650002001659650001201679650001701691650001101708650000901719700005301728700002601781700002001807700001501827700001701842773011801859856007301977852000902050655001202059IND60688195420221117044941.0200410e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068819542DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.023922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKölzsch, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0193-156310aGoose parents lead migration V  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany migratory animals travel in large social groups. Large, avian migrants that fly in V‐formations were proposed do so for energy saving by the use of up‐wash by following individuals and regularly change leadership. As groups have been rather homogeneous in previous work, we aimed to explore leadership and its flight mechanics consequences in an extremely heterogeneous case of social migration, namely in spring migration of goose families. In families the experience of group members differs strongly and inclusive fitness may be important. We successfully collected overlapping spring migration tracking data of a complete family of greater white‐fronted geese Anser a. albifrons and extracted leadership, flapping frequency and wind conditions in flight. Our data revealed V‐formations where one parent was flying in front at all times. Although the father led the family group most of the time, he did not flap at higher frequency while doing so. In contrast, the mother flapped faster when leading, possibly because she experienced less supportive wind conditions than when the father led. We argue that in heterogeneous, social groups leadership might be fixed and not costly if supportive environmental conditions like wind can be used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnser 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental factors 3aflight 3ageese 3aleadership 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory birds 3aparents 3asocial class 3aspring 3awind1 aFlack, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9099-28021 aMüskens, G.

However, sludge organic matter (SOM) influences PAHs degradation during ozone treatment is still rarely understood. In this study, we investigated such an influence with the aid of solid-state ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and the corresponding two-dimensional correlation analysis (2D-COS) strategy. The results showed that the degradation of SOM macromolecules in the order of aromatic substances > aliphatic carbon > α carbon > amides groups > O-alkyl upon ozone treatment. Moreover, the PAHs removal efficiency was positively correlated with the aromaticity of sludge (R² = 0.84–0.98), while negative associated with its aliphaticity (R² = 0.81–0.95). Lastly, humic acid (HA) was used as a proxy of aromatic SOM to further explore their interaction with PAHs in sludge matrix. The results revealed that freely dissolved (HA-D) and suspended particulates (HA-S) imposed distinctively different influence on ozone-based PAHs degradation. The HA-S facilitated the elimination of PAHs by 7.95 ± 0.11%, while those HA-D reduced the removal efficiency by 16.70 ± 0.13%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aamides 3acarbon 3aenvironment 3ahumic acids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aparticulates 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aWaste activated sludge 0aSludge organic matter 0aHumic substance1 aZhu, Nanwen1 aYuan, Haiping1 aShen, Yanwen0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 797 p.149232-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1492323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006300171300001800234520151000252592002801762650002701790650002601817650001901843650002201862650001301884650001101897650001001908650006601918650004401984650003102028650000902059700001902068700002802087700001802115700002502133773011702158856005502275852000902330655001202339IND4510567620221122215942.0150730e200010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451056762DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01709.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Frauke10aEther lipids in the cell membrane of Mycoplasma fermentans  ap. 6276-6286.  aTwo new ether lipids, 1âOâalkyl/alkenylâ2âOâacylâglyceroâ3âphosphocholine and its lyso form, 1âOâalkyl/alkenylâglyceroâ3âphosphocholine, were identified in the cell membrane of Mycoplasma fermentans using chemical analyses, GLCâMS, MALDIâTOF MS, and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The lipids are heterogeneous with respect to both acyl and alkyl/alkenyl residues. The acyl residues at position 2 of glycerol are hexadecanoyl and octadecanoyl in a molar ratio of 3.6â:â1 with a trace amount of octadecenoyl. The alkyl/alkenyl residues at position 1 of glycerol are hexadecyl (78%), octadecyl (7%), octadecenyl (14%), and hexadecenyl (traces). In the octadecenyl residue, the double bond has a cis configuration and is located at either position 1â² (plasmalogenâtype lipid) or 9â² in a ratio ââ1â:â1. This is the first report of the presence of alkyl and vinyl (alkâ1â²âenyl) ether lipids in the cell membrane of aerobically grown mycoplasmas. Lipids of this type have been found in some Gramâpositive bacteria, thus supporting the hypothesized close taxonomical relationship of these bacteria to mycoplasmas. The ether lipids of M.âfermentans are structurally similar to platelet activating factor; it was demonstrated that the 2âOâacetylated lyso form lipid can mimic plateletâactivating factor activity in isolated perfused and ventilated rat lungs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aMycoplasma fermentans 3acell membranes 3achemical analysis 3aglycerol 3alipids 3alungs 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplatelet-activating factor 3arats1 aRottem, Shlomo1 aHeld, HeinzâDieter1 aUhlig, Stefan1 aZÃ¤hringer, Ulrich0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Oct., v. 267, no. 20 p.6276-6286dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01709.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245013000179520078600309592002801095650001501123650001101138650002201149650001101171650001001182650000901192650002201201650001101223650001701234650001401251653003001265653001301295653002401308700002701332700002301359700002101382700002501403700002201428700003201450700003101482773013901513856008301652852000901735655001201744IND60645483120221118053212.0190801e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064548312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2019.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres-Herrador, Francisco12aA high heating rate pyrolysis model for the Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) based on mass spectroscopy experiments  aA novel model for the pyrolysis of the Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) at high heating rate is developed and calibrated based on high fidelity thermal decomposition experiments. The calibration relies on accurate quantification of pyrolysis gases obtained from mass spectroscopy analysis during thermal decomposition at fast heating rates simulating flight conditions. Model calibration is achieved by coupling the Porous material Analysis Toolbox based on OpenFOAM (PATO) with an optimization software (Dakota). A multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to fit the experimental data by optimizing the model parameters for an element and a species-based formulation.

A comprehensive literature search without any limitation on language was conducted using the following bibliographical databases: ISI Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Search was conducted up to 23 January 2020. A total of 35 clinical trials were included for final analysis. Pooling of results showed a significant reducing effect of cinnamon on total cholesterol (TC) (weighted mean difference (WMD) = −11.67 mg/dL; P = 0.010), triglyceride (TG) (WMD = −16.27 mg/dL; P < 0.001), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (WMD = −6.36 mg/dL; P < 0.001), serum glucose (WMD = −11.39 mg/dL; P < 0.001), serum insulin (WMD = −1.27 μIU/mL; P = 0.028), and waist circumstance (WC) (WMD = −1.68 cm; P = 0.016). These lowering effects on TG, TC, LDL-C, and serum glucose levels were robust in studies that used cinnamon supplementation dose ≤1.5 g. Also, our findings of the present meta-analysis showed that cinnamon supplementation could have favorable effects on high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C, WMD = 1.35; P = 0.038) as well as systolic (WMD = −3.95 mmHg; P = 0.018) and diastolic (WMD = −3.36; P = 0.001) blood pressure among patients with metabolic diseases. The present meta-analysis suggests that cinnamon might exert beneficial effects on various cardiometabolic risk factors among patients with metabolic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3acinnamon 3adose response 3afood science 3ainsulin 3ameta-analysis 3anutrition 3asystematic review 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist 0acinnamon 0alipid profile 0aglucose metabolism 0ametabolic diseases 0ameta-analysis1 aSohouli, Mohammad Hassan1 aFatahi, Somaye1 aLari, Abolfazl1 aShidfar, Farzad1 aAljhdali, Maha Mari1 aAlhoshan, Faisal Musaad1 aElahi, Saad Saif1 aAlmusa, Hashem Ameen1 aAbu-Zaid, Ahmed0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 July 23, v. 62, no. 22 p.6113-6131dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.18964733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015700172300001400329520175800343592002802101650001502129650002502144650002002169650002202189650001502211650001002226650001202236650002102248650001002269650001502279653002202294653001802316653002102334653002102355653002002376653000902396700002402405700002602429773010202455856004802557852000902605655001202614IND50086572820221123004556.0140412e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008657282DNAL7 a10.1080/092910110036931612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajagopal, Thangavel10aDiurnal variation in preorbital gland scent marking behaviour of captive male Indian Blackbuck (Antelope cervicapra L.) and its territorial significance  ap. 27-38.  aScent marking is a common behaviour among mammals, which involves the deposition of a pheromone, intended to elicit a response from conspecifics. The present study is aimed to establish the diurnal profile of the distribution of scent marking behaviour and its influence of the marker. The frequency of preorbital gland scent marking behaviour was observed in territorial and non-territorial male Indian blackbucks on 72 days, over a period of 18 weeks, starting data collection at 06.00 and continuing until the end of the photophase at about 16.00. An ANOVA with post hoc (DMRT) test was assessed to compare the frequency of preorbital gland scent marking at six 2-hour intervals using pooled data for territorial and non-territorial males. The result showed that the preorbital gland scent marking behaviour occurred significantly (P < 0.001) more often between 10:00–12:00 hrs and 16:00–18:00 hrs. It suggests that scent-marking behaviour in Indian blackbuck has a preferential incidence at a particular time, and this might have occurred in association with feeding hours. Moreover, an ANOVA with a post hoc comparison (DMRT) test revealed that the frequency of scent marking is significant (P < 0.001) when territorial males are compared to non-territorial males. We conclude that territorial male preorbital gland scent marking has the following proposed functions: (i) marking related to use for defense of the home range or territorial region may serve as a permanent threat signal and (ii) marking related to suppressing daily activities in non-territorial males (i.e. feeding, aggression, mating, scent marking, and territorial patrolling activities etc.), and involves maintenance of hierarchy and the avoidance of physical combat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3aanalysis of variance 3adata collection 3adiurnal variation 3ahome range 3amales 3amammals 3amarking behavior 3aodors 3aphotophase 0adiurnal variation 0ascent marking 0aterritorial male 0apreorbital gland 0apheromonal cues 0aAAZP1 aManimozhi, Arulmani1 aArchunan, Govindaraju0 tBiological rhythm research.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 42, no. 1 p.27-38dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291011003693161  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158300001800283500001900301520137100320592002801691650002001719650002501739650001901764650002001783650001101803650001301814650001901827650002501846650001901871700001901890700001701909700002001926700001801946700001701964773014201981856007402123852000902197655001202206IND60734690620221119195536.0210422e20210420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073469062DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta11959h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Zhenming10aSuperhydrophobic gradient wrinkle strain sensor with ultra-high sensitivity and broad strain range for motion monitoring  ap. 9634-9643.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFlexible strain sensors have potential applications in electronic skin, healthcare monitoring, human–machine interface, and other fields. The key challenge in the use of the strain sensor for human motion monitoring is that both broad strain range and full-range high sensitivity have to be achieved simultaneously. Herein, we report a gradient wrinkle strain sensor based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by a simple pre-stretching method, which includes two wrinkle regions. One region contributes to high sensitivity through wrinkle cracks during stretching, and the other region maintains good contact to provide a broad strain range. The sensitivity can be easily adjusted according to the gradient wrinkle structure. The sensor exhibits a broad strain range (up to 300%), ultra-high sensitivity (a maximum gauge factor (GF) of 167 665.6), good stability (10 000 cycles), and a low detection limit (0.1% strain). It can be used to detect full-range human body motions, including subtle physiological signals and large motions. Besides, the sensor has good super-hydrophobicity and anti-corrosion property, which can be used in humidity, underwater, acid, alkali, and other harsh environments. This new structure and sensing mechanism of the strain sensor provides a new idea for achieving high sensitivity in the full range.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aelectronic equipment 3agraphene oxide 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3ahumidity 3ahydrophobicity 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3auser interface1 aJiao, Weicheng1 aHuang, Yifan1 aZheng, Yongting1 aWang, Rongguo1 aHe, Xiaodong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 9, no. 15 p.9634-9643dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta11959h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245015600175520127400331592002801605650002301633650005201656650002101708650001601729650000901745650001501754650001501769650002701784653001301811653002301824653001801847653001401865653001801879653002001897700001701917700002801934700002401962773011901986856008802105852000902193655001202202IND60745992120221123013149.0211003e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074599212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1492332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabaahmadi, Vahid10aBiodegradable and multifunctional surgical face masks: A brief review on demands during COVID-19 pandemic, recent developments, and future perspectives  aProviding the greater public with the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines is time-consuming and research-intensive; intermediately, some essential ways to reduce the transmission include social distancing, personal hygiene, testing, contact tracing, and universal masking. The data suggests that universal masking, especially using multilayer surgical face masks, offers a powerful efficacy for indoor places. These layers have different functions including antiviral/antibacterial, fluid barrier, particulate and bacterial filtration, and fit and comfort. However, universal masking poses a serious environmental threat since billions of them are disposed on a daily basis; the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has put such demands and consequences in perspective. This review focuses on surgical face mask structures and classifications, their impact on our environment, some of their desirable functionalities, and the recent developments around their biodegradability. The authors believe that this review provides an insight into the fabrication and deployment of effective surgical face masks, and it discusses the utilization of multifunctional structures along with biodegradable materials to deal with future demands in a more eco-friendly fashion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3abiodegradability 3aenvironment 3aface 3aface masks 3afiltration 3agood hygiene practices 0aCOVID-19 0aSurgical face mask 0aBiodegradable 0aAntiviral 0aAntibacterial 0aMultifunctional1 aAmid, Hooman1 aNaeimirad, Mohammadreza1 aRamakrishna, Seeram0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 798 p.149233-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1492333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245013700150300001800287520082900305592002801134650001101162650002301173650002301196650001901219650001201238650002201250650001101272700001701283700001701300700002201317700001901339773011701358856007501475852000901550655001201559IND60550126920171220000000.0160909e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055012692DNAL7 a10.1021/jo400278c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Na10aMechanistic Insight into Self-Propagation of Organo-Mediated Beckmann Rearrangement: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study  ap. 4297-4302.  aOrgano-mediated Beckmann rearrangement in the liquid phase, which has the advantage of high efficiency and straightforward experimental procedures, plays an important role in the synthesis of amides from oximes. However, the catalytic mechanisms of these organic-based promoters are still not well understood. In this work, we report a combined experimental and computational study on the mechanism of Beckmann rearrangement mediated by organic-based promoters, using TsCl as an example. A novel self-propagating cycle is proposed, and key intermediates of this self-propagating cycle are confirmed by both experiments and DFT calculations. In addition, the reason why cyclohexanone oxime is not a good substrate of the organo-mediated Beckmann rearrangement is discussed, and a strategy for improving the yield is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acyclohexanones 3aliquids 3aorganic chemistry 3aoximes1 aTian, Bo-Xue1 aPi, Hong-Jun1 aEriksson, Leif A.1 aDeng, Wei-Ping0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 May 03, v. 78, no. 9 p.4297-4302dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo400278c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010600172520104400278592002801322650001901350650002201369650001101391650001001402650001801412650002301430650001201453653002401465653002801489653002001517700001501537700002601552700001601578700003501594700002401629773009001653856008501743852000901828655001201837IND60751892420221120111615.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075189242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Ake, A.10aNumerical study and thermal evaluation of a triple glass window under Mexican warm climate conditions  aThe conjugate heat transfer in a triple glass window (TG) is presented to determine the air-gap width that improves its thermal performance under a warm Mexican climate. Five different air-gap widths (Hc = 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22 mm), 4 mm of thickness for each glass, and 80 cm in height are considered. Hourly climatic data of the coldest and the warmest day of Merida were used to assess the thermal behavior of the TG, and the results were compared against a double glass (DG) and a singles glass window (SG). A validated numerical code based on the Finite Volume Method was developed to model the windows. We found that an air-gap width of 10 mm reduces the hourly heat flux to the indoor during the warmest day up to 17.7 and 38.7 % compared to the DG and SG, respectively. Moreover, the daily total heat flux, electricity cost, and CO₂ emission on the TG are up to ≈ 40% lower than an SG, respectively. Therefore, we recommended a TG to improve the thermal performance on windows under weather conditions of Merida, Yucatan.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3aglass 3aheat transfer 3athermal properties 3aweather 0aTriple glass window 0aConjugate heat transfer 0aMexican climate1 aXamán, J.1 aHernández-López, I.1 aSauceda, D.1 aCarranza-Chávez, Francisco J.1 aZavala-Guillén, I.0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122075-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013900167300001400306520208200320592002802402650001002430650001102440650001202451650001602463650001502479650002202494650001202516650001602528650000902544650001602553650001902569650001202588650002702600650001402627650001102641650001102652650001602663653001602679653002002695653002902715653001502744653001602759700001502775773010202790856004802892852000902940655001202949IND50086572920221123044605.0140412e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008657292DNAL7 a10.1080/092910110037264902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Dipak10aEffect of thermal exposure on diurnal rhythms of physiological parameters and feed, water intake in Tharparkar and Karan Fries heifers  ap. 39-51.  aTo explore the effect of thermal stress on diurnal rhythms of physiological responses, peripheral temperatures, feed and water intake, blood biochemical parameters, stress enzymes and plasma sodium, potassium levels in Tharparkar (TP) and Karan Fries (KF) heifers, 12 animals, six each from two breeds were taken and kept first in control thermoneutral (21–26°C and 50–60% RH) and in heat exposed (38–39°C temperature and 60–70% RH) conditions thereafter. All the data recording and blood sample collections were done twice (morning and evening) a day for a continuous seven days each for control and thermal exposed conditions. Values of physiological responses, peripheral temperatures, blood biochemical parameters, stress enzymes and plasma sodium, potassium levels in both Tharparkar and Karan Fries heifers showed a significant variation (P < 0.05) in the morning and evening. So a diurnal fluctuation of rectal temperature was observed in this experiment. Significant (P < 0.01) variation in all the above parameters was observed in both Tharparkar and Karan Fries heifers in control and heat exposed conditions. Feed intake decreased and water intake increased in the heat exposed condition in both the breeds. Values of physiological responses were lower in the morning and showed an increasing trend, reaching highest values in the afternoon. The changes in physiological parameters were greater in Karan Fries in comparison to Tharparkar heifers that expressed lower heat tolerance capacity in crossbred than indigenous cattle. The correlation coefficient showed a significant relationship among all the parameters studied. This finding suggests that it is important to standardize the time of sample collection in comparative studies, in which more discrete differences may be identified in physiological parameters. Animals are comfortable in thermoneutral conditions and are in stress in thermal exposed conditions, so shade and cooling facilities should be provided during summer to withstand the heat stress and for better health and productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abreeds 3acooling 3acorrelation 3acrossbreds 3adiurnal variation 3aenzymes 3afeed intake 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheifers 3aphysiological response 3apotassium 3asodium 3asummer 3atemperature 0aheat stress 0adiurnal rhythms 0aphysiological parameters 0aTharparkar 0aKaran Fries1 aAshutosh, 0 tBiological rhythm research.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 42, no. 1 p.39-51dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291011003726490  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245011000183300001600293520138300309592002801692650001501720650002201735650001101757650001601768650002101784650001501805650001901820650001101839650001301850650001401863700002401877700003001901700004001931700003301971700002802004700002102032700003502053773011102088856008102199852000902280655001202289IND50068865420221118001437.0150208e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006886542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-013-0234-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte, Henrique Silva Silveira10aDevelopment and validation of a set of standard area diagrams to estimate severity of potato early blight  ap. 249-257.  aStandard area diagrams (SADs) to assess the severity of potato early blight (Alternaria grandis) on leaves of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) were developed and validated. The proposed SADs include images of leaves with 10 distinct disease severities (0.1, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 %). The SADs were validated by 12 raters who had no previous experience in evaluating plant disease. Lin’s concordance correlation analysis of estimated vs. actual disease severity (based on image analysis) showed that precision and accuracy improved for most raters using the SADs, compared to assessments made without the SADs. The SADs improved accuracy (coefficient of bias, C b = 0.97 and 0.99, without and with SADs, respectively) and agreement (Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, ρ c = 0.91 and 0.98 without and with SADs, respectively) of the estimates of severity. Severity estimates were more reliable when using SADs (coefficient of determination, R ² = 0.80 unaided and R ² = 0.95 with SADs, and the intra-class correlation ρ = 0.86 without SADs and ρ = 0.97 using the SADs). The SADs improved raters’ ability to accurately, precisely and reliably estimate potato early blight severity, and as such can be used to assess severity for several purposes, including breeding for resistance, fungicide screening, and pathotype characterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aSolanum tuberosum 3ablight 3acorrelation 3adisease severity 3afungicides 3aimage analysis 3aleaves 3apotatoes 3ascreening1 aZambolim, Laércio,1 aCapucho, Alexandre Sandri1 aJúnior, Antonio Fernandes Nogueira1 aRosado, André Wilson Campos1 aCardoso, Carine Rezende1 aPaul, Pierce A.,1 aMizubuti, Eduardo Seiti Gomide0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2013 Oct., v. 137, no. 2 p.249-257dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-013-0234-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001400281520131700295592002801612650002601640650001101666650001801677650002101695650002201716650001601738650001201754650001501766650001601781653001601797653000801813653002101821653002601842773010201868856004801970852000902018655001202027IND50086573020221123044657.0140412e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008657302DNAL7 a10.1080/092910110037292392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarakaş, Alper14aThe effects of photoperiod and age on food anticipatory activity in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus)  ap. 53-65.  aIn many animal models, the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity is regulated by at least two external pacemakers, environmental photoperiod and food availability. Entrainment with food is characterized by an anticipatory increase in locomotor activity before mealtime. In the present study, the effects of photoperiod and age on the food anticipatory activity (FAA) of Mongolian gerbils were investigated. The experiments were performed under long (14L:10D) and short photoperiods (8L:16D) in young (3 months old) and old (2 years old) adult male gerbils. Food was given only for two hours (11 am–1 pm) during the light phase. Food restriction created FAA in the gerbils. The wheel turn performance of the gerbils was affected by photoperiod, age of the gerbil and food restriction in both light and dark phases. The gerbils experiencing the short photoperiod did perform better than those experiencing the long photoperiod. Young gerbils did perform better than old ones. The light/dark ratio in locomotor activity was affected significantly by photoperiod and food restriction. Food intake of the gerbils was affected by photoperiod, age, and food restriction. In conclusion, photoperiod, age of the gerbil and the food availability were found to be effective in the regulation of FAA in Mongolian gerbils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeriones unguiculatus 3aadults 3aanimal models 3acircadian rhythm 3afood availability 3afood intake 3agerbils 3alocomotion 3aphotoperiod 0aphotoperiod 0aFAA 0aMongolian gerbil 0aMeriones unguiculatus0 tBiological rhythm research.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 42, no. 1 p.53-65dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291011003729239  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245012300164520106500287592002801352650001401380650001001394650002001404650001801424650002101442650002101463650002001484650002501504650001601529650002501545653001701570653001501587653002601602653003001628700001601658700001301674700001801687773010601705856008701811852000901898655001201907IND60790553620221118150250.0221004e20221120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079055362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1300012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jie10aSolar thermal power generation characteristics based on metal foam and phase change materials doped with nanoparticles  aDue to the low photoelectric conversion efficiency caused by the low thermal conductivity of pure paraffin, hence, solar thermal power generation characteristics based on metal foam and phase change materials doped with nanoparticles were experimentally investigated to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency. The effects of solar light intensity (I=600 mw/cm², 700 mw/cm², 800 mw/cm², 900 mw/cm², 1000 mw/cm²), light angle (θ = 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°) and nanoparticle concentration (ω = 0 %, 0.5 %, 0.8 %, 1.0 %) on the power generation characteristics were discussed. Results showed that paraffin doped with nanoparticles (ω = 1.0 %) can increase the hot end temperature of daylighting device by 4.86 % at most compared with pure paraffin. The maximum output power increases with the light intensity, light angle and nanoparticle concentration, and the maximum increase ratios can reach 37.88 %, 14.07 % and 22.31 % respectively. The research is useful for the design and application of solar thermal power generation equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3afoams 3alight intensity 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3apower generation 3asolar radiation 3asolar thermal energy 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 0aNanoparticle 0aMetal foam 0aPhase change material 0aThermoelectric conversion1 aWang, Yuwei1 aQi, Cong1 aZhang, Wenjie0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 653 p.130001-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1300013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015800169300001400327520133400341592002801675650002201703650001501725650001001740650001301750650002101763650001901784650002101803650002501824650002301849650000901872650001901881650001801900650002701918650001001945650002001955650001201975651001001987653002001997653002402017653001702041653002402058700001402082700002002096700001802116700001302134700001702147700002102164700001602185700001902201700002002220700001502240700001802255700001302273700001302286700002002299700001202319773010502331856008502436852000902521655001202530IND60605387020221118012312.0190705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060538702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Bao-Yang10aProtective efficacy of a high-growth reassortant H1N1 influenza virus vaccine against the European Avian-like H1N1 swine influenza virus in mice and pigs  ap. 75-84.  aSwine influenza A viruses (SIVs) causing outbreaks of acute, highly contagious respiratory disease in pigs also pose a potential threat to public health. European avian-like H1N1 (EA H1N1) SIVs are the predominant circulating viruses in pigs in China and also occasionally cause human infection. In this study, a high-growth reassortant virus (SH1/PR8), with HA and NA genes from a representative EA H1N1 isolate A/Swine/Shanghai/1/2014 (SH1) in China and six internal genes from the high-growth A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus, was generated by plasmid-based reverse genetics and tested as a candidate seed virus for the preparation of inactivated vaccine. The protective efficacy of inactivated SH1/PR8 was evaluated in mice and pigs challenged with wild-type SH1 virus. After primer and boost vaccination, the SH1/PR8 vaccine induced high-level hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibodies, IgG antibodies, and neutralization antibodies in mice and pigs. Mice and pigs in the vaccinated group showed less clinical phenomena and pathological changes than those in the unvaccinated group. In conclusion, the inactivated high-growth reassortant vaccine SH1/PR8 could induce high antibody levels and complete protection is expected against SH1 wild type SIV, and protection against heterologous EA H1N1 SIV needs further evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantibodies 3agenes 3agenetics 3ahemagglutination 3ahuman diseases 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainactivated vaccines 3ainfluenza vaccines 3amice 3aneutralization 3apublic health 3asecondary immunization 3aswine 3aswine influenza 3aviruses 3aChina 0aSwine influenza 0aEuropean avian-like 0aH1N1 subtype 0aProtective efficacy1 aWen, Feng1 aGong, Xiao-Qian1 aLiu, Xiao-Min1 aWang, Qi1 aYu, Ling-Xue1 aWang, Shuai-Yong1 aZhang, Peng1 aYang, Haiming,1 aShan, Tong-Ling1 aZheng, Hao1 aZhou, Yan-Jun1 aTong, Wu1 aGao, Fei1 aTong, Guang-Zhi1 aYu, Hai0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2018 Aug., v. 222 p.75-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008400167300001600251520144900267592002801716650002201744650001601766650002501782650002201807650002101829650001201850650002201862650001601884650001401900650003001914650002301944650001701967650002501984651001002009700001502019773011802034856004802152852000902200655001202209IND50065443820221120033325.0130426e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006544382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-012-9393-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Manmohan10aNon-timber forest products certification in India: opportunities and challenges  ap. 567-586.  aForest certification has emerged as a marketing tool for linking the good forest management practices with the environmentally conscious consumers. Its genesis can be attributed to the society’s concern for the social and environmental significance of forests. Forest management certification when coupled with the chain-of-custody certification; then, the supply chain stages for such forest products can carry an ecolabel. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are of socio-economic and cultural importance for the forest dwelling communities, particularly for the tropical countries like India. India is home to an amazing diversity of plants, with over 46,000 plant species recorded to occur there. NTFP’s availability, utilization, commercialization, exploitation, management practices, policies and tenure systems in different parts of India have high diversity and variability. There is concern, however, that collection methods for most of NTFP species are destructive and wild populations are declining as a result. Thus, the harvest of NTFPs is coming under increasing scrutiny from certification programmes, as it plays a key role in the sustainable management of forest resources and community benefit worldwide. Thus, the present research paper highlights the issues relevant to certification of NTFPs in India, based on more than a decadal experience in dealing with this subject at Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3aecolabeling 3aforest certification 3aforest management 3aforest resources 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland tenure 3amarketing 3anontimber forest products 3asocial environment 3asupply chain 3asustainable forestry 3aIndia1 aDugaya, D.0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2013 June, v. 15, no. 3 p.567-586dSpringer-Verlagx1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-012-9393-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013300167520136300300592002801663650003401691650002801725650002001753650002301773650001101796653002001807653003501827653002101862653001701883653002701900700002001927700002601947700002001973700005501993773009002048856008502138852000902223655001202232IND60751892720221120162319.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075189272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ajeet10aEffect of aspect ratio of piezoelectric constituents on the energy harvesting performance of magneto-mechano-electric generators  aIn this study, we investigate the effect of the aspect ratio (length (L)/width (W)) of piezoelectric constituents on the energy harvesting performance of cantilever-structured magneto-mechano-electric energy generators comprising magnetoelectric composites. 56 Pb(Mg₁/₃,Nb₁/₃)O₃–10PbZrO₃–34PbTiO₃ (PMN-PZT) single crystal fiber bundled plates with different aspect ratios (L/W = 0.59, 0.78, 1, 1.25, and 1.6), a magnetostrictive Ni plate and NdFeB permanent magnet proof mass were used to fabricate the magneto-mechano-electric generator. The results of a finite element analysis showed that the output electric potential is strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of PMN-PZT single crystal fiber plates for dual potential-inducing mechanisms, i.e., the magnetic torque (flexural transverse) and magnetic magnetostrictive (in-plane longitudinal) vibrations. However, magnetostrictive vibrations rather than magnetic torque dominate the generated output energy. The experimental results show good agreement with the results of the finite element analysis. The magneto-mechano-electric harvester with a PMN-PZT single crystal fiber aspect ratio of 1.6 shows a ∼440% increment in the root mean square voltage and power and a ∼300% enhancement in the power density measured at a load resistance of 100 kΩ and a magnetic field of 10 Oe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3afinite element analysis 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3atorque 0aMagnetoelectric 0aMagneto-mechano-electric (MME) 0aEnergy harvester 0aAspect ratio 0aPMN-PZT single Crystal1 aPark, Sung Hoon1 aPatil, Deepak Rajaram1 aHwang, Geon-Tae1 aRyu, Jungho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4746-57910 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122078-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245007500205300001600280500001900296500002000315520186400335592002802199596002602227596003602253650002202289650001502311650001302326650002302339650001402362650001602376650001802392650002302410650001302433650001602446650001102462650001402473650001402487650001902501650001202520650001902532650002502551650001302576650002202589650001002611700005802621700005902679773013702738856007302875852000902948655001202957IND60731275120221121004855.0210319e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073127512DNAL7 a10.1111/jac.124682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKibria, Mohammad Golam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8143-485X10aFoliar application of magnesium mitigates soil acidity stress in wheat  ap. 378-389.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil acidity is one of the most important soil constraints for wheat growth, and magnesium (Mg) can play a critical role in mitigating the adverse effects of soil acidity on plants. There is, however, limited information available about the influence of Mg nutrition, especially foliar application, on wheat (Triticum aestivum) growth in acidic soil. In a series of glasshouse experiments, Al‐sensitive wheat genotype (ES8) was grown to vegetative stage (Zadoks 23) with or without foliar Mg application at different rates (0, 50, 200 and 1,000 mg Mg/L), and acidic soil was used as the growth medium with or without lime and Mg amendment. The effects of these treatments on plant growth, physiological responses, tissue concentration of Mg, dry biomass accumulation and root length were characterized. Magnesium application to foliage significantly increased (by around 14%) both shoot and root dry biomass compared to the control (0 foliar Mg). No significant variation was observed in response to different Mg salts (sulphate or chloride) applied to either soil or foliage in relation to wheat growth and physiological responses. Other than liming, foliar Mg application (200 mg Mg/L) coupled with Mg application to soil (20 mg/kg soil) provided optimum conditions for wheat growth in an acid soil. Leaf extension rate, chlorophyll content and root length of wheat treated with 200 mg Mg/L foliar application were increased significantly (by 12%, 10% and 23%, respectively) in comparison to plants treated with 0 foliar Mg. Physiological parameters such as net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were 4‐fold higher in foliar Mg‐treated plants compared with those receiving no foliar Mg. Therefore, applying 200 mg Mg/L to the foliage may assist in minimizing the negative impact of soil acidity on wheat growth.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Government  cUniversity of Western Australia 3aTriticum aestivum 3aacid soils 3aagronomy 3abiomass production 3achlorides 3achlorophyll 3aculture media 3afoliar application 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3anutrition 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil pH 3asoil treatment 3astomatal conductance 3asulfates 3avegetative growth 3awheat1 aBarton, Louise1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7187-41681 aRengel, Zdenko,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3433-161X0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2021 Apr., v. 207, no. 2 p.378-389dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57791x0931-22507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.124683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009500163300001400258520095900272592002801231650001501259650001001274650001901284650001001303650001501313653001501328653001301343653001801356653002101374700001601395700001501411773010201426856004801528852000901576655001201585IND50086573220221121221824.0140412e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008657322DNAL7 a10.1080/092910109035571872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTonetti, L.10aEffects of different mattresses on sleep quality in healthy subjects: an actigraphic study  ap. 89-97.  aThe purpose of this study was to verify whether different technological solutions for mattresses had different effects on sleep quality. To this end, 16 healthy volunteers tested a latex mattress and 16 healthy participants tested an independent spring mattress. Sleep quality was assessed before and after introducing new mattresses both objectively and subjectively by means of actigraphy and Mini Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ), respectively. Both kinds of mattress led to a significant improvement in several actigraphic sleep parameters: sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency and motor activity. On the contrary, no significant improvement in subjective sleep quality was detected. The use of both kinds of mattress is associated with an improvement in objective sleep quality. Future studies should investigate if sleep quality improvement is merely due to the introduction of a new mattress or prevalently to the technological features of the mattress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactigraphy 3alatex 3aquestionnaires 3asleep 3avolunteers 0aactigraphy 0amattress 0asleep quality 0ahealthy subjects1 aMartoni, M.1 aNatale, V.0 tBiological rhythm research.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 42, no. 2 p.89-97dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291010903557187  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168520148700285592002801772650001801800650002101818650002301839650001901862650002001881650002901901650001301930650002001943650001501963650001301978650002101991650000702012650001502019650001302034650001602047650001502063650002502078650001002103653001502113653002102128653002502149653002302174653002102197653001802218653000802236653000902244653000602253653000602259653000802265653000802273653000702281700001902288773009702307856008502404852000902489655001202498IND60766277020221120151810.0220228e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076627702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1181652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Vishal10aEvaluation of the effects of input variables on the growth of two microalgae classes during wastewater treatment  aWastewater treatment carried out by microalgae is usually affected by the type of algal strain and the combination of cultivation parameters provided during the process. Every microalga strain has a different tolerance level towards cultivation parameters, including temperature, pH, light intensity, CO₂ content, initial inoculum level, pretreatment method, reactor type and nutrient concentration in wastewater. Therefore, it is vital to supply the right combination of cultivation parameters to increase the wastewater treatment efficiency and biomass productivity of different microalgae classes. In the current investigation, the decision tree was used to analyse the dataset of class Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae. Various combinations of cultivation parameters were determined to enhance their performance in wastewater treatment. Nine combinations of cultivation parameters leading to high biomass production and eleven combinations each for high nitrogen removal efficiency and high phosphorus removal efficiency for class Trebouxiophyceae were detected by decision tree models. Similarly, eleven combinations for high biomass production, nine for high nitrogen removal efficiency, and eight for high phosphorus removal efficiency were detected for class Chlorophyceae. The results obtained through decision tree analysis can provide the optimum conditions of cultivation parameters, saving time in designing new experiments for treating wastewater at a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorophyceae 3aTrebouxiophyceae 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3ainoculum 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aresearch 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater 0aMicroalgae 0aMachine learning 0aWastewater treatment 0aBiomass production 0aTrebouxiophyceae 0aChlorophyceae 0aIIL 0aTemp 0aN 0aP 0aPRE 0aNRE 0aLI1 aMishra, Vishal0 tWater research.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 213 p.118165-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1181653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014400168520131600312592002801628650001101656650001801667650002201685650002301707650002101730650001601751653003401767653002601801653002301827653003201850653002001882700001501902700001501917700001401932700001701946700001301963700001801976773009001994856008502084852000902169655001202178IND60751892820221120162327.0211129e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075189282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhizuan10aExperimental study on the thermal management performance of phase change material module for the large format prismatic lithium-ion battery  aPhase change material (PCM) technology is an interesting method for battery thermal management, while the cooling behavior and cooling efficiency of PCM on prismatic lithium-ion batteries are unclear. In this work, a series of experiments are conducted to systematically investigate the cooling efficiency of PCM and the several detailed factors on the thermal management performance, such as the structure, phase change temperature and thickness of PCM. The results show that the PCM structure (sides of the battery surround by PCM) has an excellent heat dissipation efficiency at high discharge rate of 2C. Decreasing the phase change temperature is beneficial to enhance the cooling performance. Moreover, increasing the thickness of PCM enhances the cool performance, but the heat dissipation efficiency will decrease once the thickness exceeds the value of 25 mm, hence the selection of the PCM thickness is variable based on the heat dissipation capability and cooling efficiency. Furthermore, by investigating the cooling behavior of PCM during the cycle test, it is found that the PCM structure with 25 mm thickness can keep the maximum temperature of the battery under 55 °C in dynamic cycling. This work can provide experimental references for the thermal management system of prismatic batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3alithium batteries 3amanagement systems 3aphase transition 3atemperature 0aPrismatic lithium-ion battery 0aPhase change material 0aThermal management 0aHeat dissipation efficiency 0aDynamic cycling1 aWang, Dong1 aPeng, Yang1 aLi, Maoyu1 aWang, Boxuan1 aCao, Bei1 aYang, Lizhong0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 238 p.122081-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245004000168300001400208520079600222592002801018650001801046650001301064650001501077650001101092650002001103650001801123650001301141650001901154650001401173700002501187773012201212856007901334852000901413655001201422IND60331785120221122224035.0150727e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033178512DNAL7 a10.1126/science.aaa49712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchumacher, Ton N.10aNeoantigens in cancer immunotherapy  ap. 69-74.  aThe clinical relevance of T cells in the control of a diverse set of human cancers is now beyond doubt. However, the nature of the antigens that allow the immune system to distinguish cancer cells from noncancer cells has long remained obscure. Recent technological innovations have made it possible to dissect the immune response to patient-specific neoantigens that arise as a consequence of tumor-specific mutations, and emerging data suggest that recognition of such neoantigens is a major factor in the activity of clinical immunotherapies. These observations indicate that neoantigen load may form a biomarker in cancer immunotherapy and provide an incentive for the development of novel therapeutic approaches that selectively enhance T cell reactivity against this class of antigens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms1 aSchreiber, Robert D.0 tScience.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 348, no. 6230 p.69-74dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa49713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245009500178300001400273520169100287592002801978650002702006650001902033650001602052650002202068650002002090650002302110650003302133650001602166650002302182650001302205650001602218651002502234653001602259653002102275653001602296653001602312653002302328700001902351700002202370700004602392700002102438773011002459856008702569852000902656655001202665IND60525264420221120133149.0190318e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052526442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2015.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClemente, Adelaide S.10aEffect of hydroseeding components on the germination of Mediterranean native plant species  ap. 68-72.  aThe use of native species by hydroseeding has been encouraged for the restoration of degraded Mediterranean areas, but their success is frequently low. Several biotic and abiotic constraints have been reported that partially explain such failure, but the effects of the slurry components on the performance of native species have not been evaluated so far. We used germination tests to assess the effects of four such components – bacteria-based fertilizing agent, biostimulant, dye and surfactant – on the germination of 12 native species used in hydroseeding of quarry slopes.Hydroseeding components significantly affected germination only in four species. Bacteria-based fertilizing agent, biostimulant and a mixture of the four components increased the germination percentage of Thymus mastichina while bacteria-based fertilizing agent and biostimulant decreased the germination speed of Cistus albidus. Component- and species-specific effects on time to germination were observed in Bituminaria bituminosa, C. albidus, Helichrysum stoechas and T. mastichina.The results showed that only a few of the native species studied were affected by a specific hydroseeding component. Therefore, poor establishment of native species observed in the field could not be wholly attributed to negative effects of those components on their germination. These might have contributed to failure in the field by further reducing the low germination speed of certain species. This study suggests that a better knowledge of species characteristics and species-specific responses to hydroseeding components may help to improve the success and the cost-effectiveness of this restoration procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBituminaria bituminosa 3aCistus albidus 3aHelichrysum 3aThymus mastichina 3aadverse effects 3acost effectiveness 3adry environmental conditions 3agermination 3aindigenous species 3aslurries 3asurfactants 3aMediterranean region 0aGermination 0aGrowth-promoters 0aStabilizers 0aRestoration 0aCost-effectiveness1 aMoedas, Ana R.1 aOliveira, Graça,1 aMartins-Loução, M.

In order to better reflect the actual operation of the system, the main devices of system are considered as off-design models. A novel parameter named start factor of off-design devices is proposed to improve devices efficiency. Under following electric load and following thermal load operating strategies, the optimal capacity and comprehensive performance of the system devices are obtained. By different off-design models, seven system models are built to analysis under two operating strategies. Moth flame optimization is selected as the optimization method to get model results.

Through a scanning electron microscope test and a N₂ adsorption/desorption test, it is found that, as the TEPA loading increases from 4 wt% to 20 wt%, the specific surface area and pore volume of the samples decrease slowly and micropores gradually disappear. Besides, the CO₂ adsorption capacity of the samples was tested by a fixed-bed adsorption experimental device at 298 K and 0–1 bar. The results show that the CO₂ adsorption capacity reaches the maximum (71.29 mg/g) at a 12 wt% TEPA loading, which is attributed to the high content of affinity sites in CO₂. Furthermore, the effect of temperature (298–398 K) was investigated at 1 bar. It is concluded that an appropriate increase in adsorption temperature can enhance the flexibility of TEPA and greatly reduce its diffusion resistance. The highest adsorption capacity (83.05 mg/g) is achieved at 348 K. Then, the effect of pressure (0–40 bar) was analyzed at the optimal temperature (348 K) and optimal TEPA loading (12 wt%), and the results suggest that the adsorption capacity gradually strengthens with the increase in pressure, ultimately reaching a peak of 204.06 mg/g. The adsorption selectivities of CO₂/N₂ and CO₂/H₂ are 14.88 and 9.66, respectively, indicating that the porous particles have a stronger affinity for CO₂ than for N₂ and H₂. The infrared spectra prove the formation of carbamates, which confirms that CO₂ is sequestered in porous particles by chemical adsorption. The adsorption kinetics and adsorption thermodynamics results reveal the presence of both physical and chemical adsorptions of 12 wt% TEPA-porous particles in the adsorption process, and the chemical one is dominant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbamates 3acarbon dioxide 3adesorption 3amicropores 3asolid wastes 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aAlkaline solid wastes 0aPorous particles 0aTetraethylenepentamine 0aCO2 adsorption1 aZhang, Huilin1 aQi, Guansheng1 aLu, Wei1 aWang, Mingjun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 653 p.130004-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1300043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01672naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009500160300001800255520067200273592002800945650001200973650002200985650002201007700001701029700001801046700002101064700002201085700001601107700002201123773011701145856007501262852000901337655001201346IND60550127320221119150738.0160909e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055012732DNAL7 a10.1021/jo40031352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichihata, Naoki10aHigh-Yield Total Synthesis of (−)-Strictinin through Intramolecular Coupling of Gallates  ap. 4319-4328.  aThis paper describes a total synthesis of (−)-strictinin, an ellagitannin that is 1-O-galloyl-4,6-O-(S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-β-d-glucose. In the study, total efficiency of the synthesis was improved to produce a 78% overall yield in 13 steps from d-glucose. In the synthesis, formation of the 4,6-(S)-HHDP bridge including the 11-membered bislactone ring was a key step, in which intramolecular aryl–aryl coupling was adopted. The coupling was oxidatively induced by CuCl₂–n-BuNH₂ with perfect control of the axial chirality, and the reaction conditions of this coupling were optimized thoroughly to achieve the quantitative formation of the bridge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglucose 3aoptical isomerism 3aorganic chemistry1 aKaneko, Yuki1 aKasai, Yusuke1 aTanigawa, Kotaro1 aHirokane, Tsukasa1 aHigasa, Sho1 aYamada, Hidetoshi0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 May 03, v. 78, no. 9 p.4319-4328dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo40031353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002400167245010200191300001600293520093300309592002801242650002201270650001001292650001001302650001101312650002101323650002301344650001801367650004301385650006601428650002301494650007701517700001701594700003701611700001801648700003101666700002101697700002101718700002101739700001801760700002601778700002101804700002301825700002501848700002401873700002301897700002001920700002401940773008701964856008402051852000902135655001202144IND4458841720221118035127.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445884172DNAL7 a216403112pmid7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2011.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiquelme, Meritxell10aArchitecture and development of the Neurospora crassa hypha – a model cell for polarized growth  ap. 446-474.  aNeurospora crassa has been at the forefront of biological research from the early days of biochemical genetics to current progress being made in understanding gene and genetic network function.

Hence, it is meaningful to effectively utilize CO₂, the main greenhouse gas and a major component of the Martian atmosphere. Due to their high capacity and ability to capture CO₂, Li–CO₂ batteries have received much attention. However, there are problems that still need to be solved relating to Li–CO₂ batteries, including the instability of the electrolyte and the non-negligible polarization caused by the formation and decomposition of Li₂CO₃. To address these issues, an all-solid-state Li–CO₂ battery, which uses RuO₂ nanoparticles combined with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as the cathode material and a sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type ceramic solid electrolyte, Li₁.₅Al₀.₅Ge₁.₅(PO₄)₃ (LAGP), has been developed and it operates over a broad temperature range. Under a pure CO₂ atmosphere, this well-designed battery shows a discharge capacity of 2499 mA h g⁻¹ and a charge capacity of 2137 mA h g⁻¹ in the first cycle at 60 °C, and stable cycling performance over 30 cycles under a capacity limitation of 500 mA h g⁻¹ at a current density of 50 mA g⁻¹. This result enhances the possibility of the utilization of the Li–CO₂ battery in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3aceramics 3achemistry 3aelectrolytes 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gases 3ahumans 3asodium 3atemperature1 aLiu, Yijie1 aYang, Sixie1 aLi, Chao1 aCheng, Zhu1 aQiu, Feilong1 aHe, Ping1 aZhou, Haoshen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 9, no. 15 p.9581-9585dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta12421d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007400164300001800238520077800256592002801034650004401062650002201106650003701128650001501165650001501180650001401195650001101209650001501220650002201235650001701257650000701274650002301281650002101304650003701325700005601362773011101418856008201529852000901611655001201620IND60685054320221119204959.0200227e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068505432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02919-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yecan10aDendrimer functionalized nanocrystalline cellulose for Cu(II) removal  ap. 2173-2187.  aA series of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer-functionalized nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) composites were prepared and characterized by FTIR, XPS, XRD, TGA and TEM as well as elemental analysis.

The influence of the initial concentration of Cu(II), pH value, contact time on the adsorption performance was studied. Compared with unmodified NCC, PAMAM functionalized NCCs show significantly higher adsorption capacity. The second generation of PAMAM functionalized NCC (NCC-2.0 PAMAM) shows a Cu(II) adsorption capacity of 92.07 mg/g at 25 °C.

Direct personal protection of individuals and households arises from deterrent and insecticidal activities which divert or kill mosquitoes before they can feed. However, at high coverage, community-level reductions of mosquito density and survival prevent more transmission exposure than the personal protection acquired by using a net or living in a sprayed house. METHODS: A process-explicit simulation of malaria transmission was applied to results of 4 recent Phase II experimental hut trials comparing a new mosaic long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) which combines deltamethrin and piperonyl butoxide with another LLIN product by the same manufacturer relying on deltamethrin alone. RESULTS: Direct estimates of mean personal protection against insecticide-resistant vectors in Vietnam, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Benin revealed no clear advantage for combination LLINs over deltamethrin-only LLINs (P = 0.973) unless both types of nets were extensively washed (Relative mean entomologic inoculation rate (EIR) ± standard error of the mean (SEM) for users of combination nets compared to users of deltamethrin only nets = 0.853 ± 0.056, P = 0.008). However, simulations of impact at high coverage (80% use) predicted consistently better impact for the combination net across all four sites (Relative mean EIR ± SEM in communities with combination nets, compared with those using deltamethrin only nets = 0.613 ± 0.076, P < 0.001), regardless of whether the nets were washed or not (P = 0.467). Nevertheless, the degree of advantage obtained with the combination varied substantially between sites and their associated resistant vector populations. CONCLUSION: Process-explicit simulations of community-level protection, parameterized using locally-relevant experimental hut studies, should be explicitly considered when choosing vector control products for large-scale epidemiological trials or public health programme procurement, particularly as growing insecticide resistance necessitates the use of multiple active ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCulicidae 3aactive ingredients 3adeltamethrin 3ahouseholds 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticide resistance 3amalaria 3apiperonyl butoxide 3apublic health 3avector control 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aInsect Vectorsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aInsecticide-Treated Bednetsxutilization. 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aMalariaxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aMosquito Controlxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aMosquito Netsxutilization. 2aResidence Characteristics 3aBenin 3aBurkina Faso 3aCameroon 3aVietnam 0aVietnamxepidemiology.1 aOkumu, Fredros O1 aN’Guessan, Raphael1 aCoosemans, Marc1 aAdeogun, Adedapo1 aAwolola, Sam1 aEtang, Josiane1 aDabiré, Roch K1 aCorbel, Vincent0 tParasites & vectors.g2011 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.426-426dSpringer-Verlagx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-4-160  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013500157300001800292500001900310520133900329592002801668650002401696650001101720650002101731650003301752650002301785650001901808650002201827650001301849700001601862700001701878700001401895700001301909700001701922700001701939700001501956773014201971856007402113852000902187655001202196IND60734691520221119195439.0210422e20210420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073469152DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta12591a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianan12aA saddle-shaped o-tetraphenylene based molecular semiconductor with a high glass transition temperature for perovskite solar cells  ap. 9927-9936.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe application of exotic conjugated skeletons in organic semiconductors is alluring due to the topology related optoelectronic peculiarities. In this paper we explore the design of molecular semiconductors starting from the saddle-shaped o-tetraphenylene (OTP) for the first time. The in silico tailored molecular semiconductor OTPE-OMeTPA with extended π-conjugation presents an improved hole mobility in comparison with its counterpart OTP-OMeDPA, due to the reduced reorganization energy and the larger intermolecular centroid distance. Molecular dynamics simulations clarify the atomic-scale microscopic origins of glass transition in the pristine materials and their p-doping promotor containing composites, being associated with the torsional motion of central OTP and the translational motion of all centroids, respectively. The OTPE-OMeTPA based organic composite displays desirable combined properties of conductivity, glass transition temperature, solution processibility, and interfacial charge transfer kinetics, allowing for the fabrication of thermostable perovskite solar cells with 21.5% power conversion efficiency. A comprehensive comparison of device degradation is also performed by joint experimental measurements and theoretical modeling, laying a solid foundation for further materials and device development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3aenergy 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3amolecular dynamics 3asemiconductors 3athermal stability 3atopology1 aXie, Xinrui1 aCai, Yaohang1 aHe, Lifei1 aYuan, Yi1 aFei, Weidong1 aWang, Lidong1 aWang, Peng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 9, no. 15 p.9927-9936dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta12591a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245006000174300001300234520091300247592002801160650001901188650001801207650002501225773013801250856005701388852000901445655001201454IND4479669220221118035357.0120418e199604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447966922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1996.tb00726.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanner, Carolyn10aAgricultural trade liberalisation and the uruguay round  ap. 1-35.  aWith the Punta del Este Declaration, agriculture was accorded prominence in the GATT negotiations and, for the first time, national support policies were on the agenda. In this paper, the progress of the negotiations on agriculture is reviewed in an attempt to understand the factors which shaped the final outcome and to assess the likely impact of the round on liberalising agricultural trade. Although the immediate impact is likely to be modest, the round will provide longer term benefits to agricultural trade through the extension of the GATT rulesâbased system to agriculture. The framework which has been laid should provide a sound basis for future negotiations. Within the multilateral framework, the pace of change is a function of the willingness of all parties to compromise and this is evident in the Uruguay Round's outcome which reflects the European Union's agricultural reform agenda.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aUruguay Round 3atrade liberalization0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g1996 Apr., v. 40, no. 1 p.1-35dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8489.1996.tb00726.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011800163300001600281520085500297592002801152650001401180650001401194650002201208650001601230650001201246650001401258653003201272653001301304653002601317653002201343653002301365773008601388856008201474852000901556655001201565IND4487524620221122215934.0170417e20120403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448752462DNAL7 a10.2478/s11535-012-0032-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWielbo, Jerzy10aRhizobial communities in symbiosis with legumes: genetic diversity, competition and interactions with host plants  ap. 363-372.  aThe term âRhizobium-legume symbiosisâ refers to numerous plant-bacterial interrelationships. Typically, from an evolutionary perspective, these symbioses can be considered as species-to-species interactions, however, such plant-bacterial symbiosis may also be viewed as a low-scale environmental interplay between individual plants and the local microbial population. Rhizobium-legume interactions are therefore highly important in terms of microbial diversity and environmental adaptation thereby shaping the evolution of plant-bacterial symbiotic systems. Herein, the mechanisms underlying and modulating the diversity of rhizobial populations are presented. The roles of several factors impacting successful persistence of strains in rhizobial populations are discussed, shedding light on the complexity of rhizobial-legume interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizobium 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3ahost plants 3alegumes 3asymbiosis 0aSymbiotic nitrogen fixation 0aRhizobia 0aBacterial populations 0aGenetic diversity 0aStrain competition0 tOpen life sciences.g2012 Apr. 3, v. 7, no. 3 p.363-372dVersitax2391-54127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/ 10.2478/s11535-012-0032-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013800167300001600305520160000321592002801921650002101949650001101970650001601981650002501997650002002022650001202042650001602054650001902070650003602089650001802125650001002143650002002153650001002173650002002183650001302203650001702216650001302233650002202246650000902268650001602277650001702293650001802310650003602328650003202364653001202396653001602408653000902424653000902433653000702442653001702449653002102466700002602487700002402513773009802537856008202635852000902717655001202726IND60622661120221120115800.0220228e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062266112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathy, Moustafa10aModulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase pathway by eugenol and telmisartan in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in rats  ap. 207-214.  aInducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) pathway has been in the limelight since its discovery as a key mediator in the process of liver fibrogenesis. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to elucidate the in vivo molecular mechanism underlying the hepatic preventive relevance of eugenol (EUG) and telmisartan (TEL) through iNOS pathway modulation against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic injury. Sixty healthy male albino rats were used in this study. Serum aminotransferases activities and NO levels were assessed. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), total nitrite/nitrate content and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration were estimated. Liver NF-kB, TNF-α, IL-6 and iNOS proteins expressions were investigated by western blot assay. Histopathological examination was done. CCl4 resulted in damage to centrilobular regions of the liver, elevation of serum aminotransferases, rise in oxidative parameters level, and up-regulation of NF-kB, TNF-α, IL-6 as well as iNOS proteins expressions. Treatment of fibrotic rats with either EUG or TEL significantly alleviated CCl4-induced biochemical, inflammatory and histopathological changes. Moreover, the combined administration of EUG with TEL has an ameliorative effect which is greater than either of them alone. In conclusion, the combination therapy between EUG and TEL is more effective than either drug alone which is attributed to suppression of NO production and iNOS protein expression. The results support that use of EUG and TEL exerts beneficial effects in the attenuation of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aalbino 3ablood serum 3acarbon tetrachloride 3aenzyme activity 3aeugenol 3aglutathione 3ahistopathology 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3atelmisartan 3atherapeutics 3atransaminases 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aEugenol 0aTelmisartan 0aCCl4 0aiNOS 0aNO 0aInflammation 0aOxidative stress1 aKhalifa, Esraa M.M.A.1 aFawzy, Michael Atef0 tLife sciences.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 216 p.207-214dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013600162520167500298592002801973650002602001650002102027650001502048650001602063650001502079650001402094650002502108650002202133650003102155650001502186650001402201650001802215650001102233650001902244650001402263650001802277650001202295650001702307650001602324653001602340653002202356653001402378653002402392700001502416700001602431700001802447700001602465700001902481700001702500700001702517700001402534773012502548856008302673852000902756655001202765IND60783379320221120051233.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078337932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1056152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Wei10aInfluence of different radial distribution zones of Douglas fir trunk as precursors on the properties of prepared activated carbons  aIn this study, four zones including the innermost (IM), the middle inner (MI), the middle outer (MO) and the outermost (OM) zone, evenly distributed from inside to outside along the radial direction of Douglas firs, is used as the precursors for the preparation of activated carbons. The elemental and chemical composition, the cell wall microstructure, the thermal weight loss and the surface crystallinity of Douglas fir trunk are characterized to analyze the differences among four zones. The higher cell wall thickness, lignin and hemicellulose content are observed in the heartwood (IM and MI) of Douglas fir trunk, while higher cellulose content and more oxygen-containing functional groups are found in the sapwood (MO and OM). Using these four zones as the precursors, activated carbons prepared from heartwood of Douglas fir exhibit desired qualities including higher specific surface area and better adsorption performance. BET specific surface area of activated carbons fluctuate between 1595 and 1734 m²/g when the raw material of Douglas fir is not carefully classified, but directly used as a whole. In the heartwood, MI zone rather than IM zone, is confirmed to be a better raw material for the preparation of activated carbon using H₃PO₄ or KOH as the activating agent. Furthermore, when the activated carbon prepared from MI zone is used to be the electrode material of supercapacitors, its specific capacitance reaches 71 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, which is higher than other activated carbons prepared from IM, MO and OM. This work shows that the preparation of wood-based activated carbon needs careful classification of raw material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3acapacitance 3acell walls 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrodes 3aheartwood 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3amicrostructure 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3asapwood 3asurface area 3aweight loss 0aDouglas fir 0aActivated carbons 0aCell wall 0aEvenly distribution1 aWang, Yuan1 aLuo, Weiyan1 aLei, Shengwen1 aYe, Yueyuan1 aZheng, Zhifeng1 aLi, Shuirong1 aWang, Dechao1 aWang, Duo0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2022 Sept., v. 166 p.105615-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1056153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245016800161300001800329520104900347592002801396650002301424650002201447650002001469650002301489650001101512650001901523650001901542650001601561700002001577700001301597700001601610700005701626773017001683856008001853852000901933655001201942IND60600934720221122055736.0180705e20170510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060093472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b001402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Qilin10aSynergistic Toughening Effect of Olefin Block Copolymer and Highly Effective β-Nucleating Agent on the Low-Temperature Toughness of Polypropylene Random Copolymer  ap. 5277-5283.  aIn the present work, the synergistic toughening effect of olefin block copolymer (OBC) and a highly effective β nucleating agent (NA)-Calcium salt of pimelic acid (CaPim) on polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) was studied. Mechanical tests showed that with the introduction of 0.1 wt % CaPim, there was almost no change in the low-temperature (below 0 °C) toughness of PPR. Although introduction of OBC could obviously improve the toughness at 23 °C, high content is needed to effectively toughen PPR at low temperature. By coadding OBC and CaPim, PPR/OBC/NA blends showed not only great enhancement of toughness over the temperature range tested but also lower OBC content of undergoing brittle-ductile transition compared with PPR/OBC blends. The crystalline structure, crystallization behavior and phase morphology were investigated to explore the possible synergistic toughening mechanism. The high β-crystal content formed in PPR matrix and the finer distribution of OBC phase might be responsible for the superior toughness achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3amechanical testing 3aolefin 3apolypropylenes 3aprocess design 3atemperature1 aZhang, Qinglong1 aWang, Li1 aYi, Jianjun1 aFeng, Jiachun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9410-75080 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 May 10, v. 56, no. 18 p.5277-5283dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b001403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008500166520095000251592002801201650002201229650002301251650002201274650001401296650001301310650002201323650002001345650001901365650001201384650001301396650000901409650003201418650001201450650001201462650001601474650002101490653001701511653001701528653002501545700001601570700002701586700002401613700001901637700002101656700002501677700001801702700001901720773009401739856008501833852000901918655001201927IND60673130820221121154559.0191126e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foostr.2019.1001282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManasi, Iva10aPlanar sucrose substrates for investigating interfaces found in molten chocolate  aWe present planar substrates suitable for investigating the sucrose/triglyceride fat interfaces found in molten chocolate with surface science techniques.

One of the post-transcriptional regulatory pathways involves small RNA (sRNA)-guided, Argonaute (AGO) protein complex-mediated target cleavages. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the well-known sRNA species participating in the cleavage-based regulation of gene expression. In plants, most miRNAs are incorporated into AGO1-associated silencing complexes. Thus, the AGO1 protein is considered to be the most important slicer for sRNA-mediated target cleavages. Previous phylogenetic analysis revealed that AGO1, AGO5, and AGO10 belonged to the same clade in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In addition, experimental evidence pointed to the possibility that AGO2, AGO7, and AGO10 were implicated in specific miRNA-mediated regulatory pathways. To investigate the potential slicer activities of AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10, a comprehensive search was performed for the sRNAs enriched in the four AGO proteins in Arabidopsis. A total of 3 499, 1 618, 4 632, and 63 sRNAs are enriched in AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10, respectively. Interestingly, several miRNAs were found to be enriched in AGO2 or AGO5. Transcriptome-wide target identification based on degradome sequencing data uncovered that a number of sRNAs enriched in the four AGOs could perform target cleavages like AGO1-associated miRNAs in plants. Based on the above results, the opinion was put forward that not only AGO1, but also AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10 might be essential for the sRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agene expression regulation 3amicroRNA 3aplants (botany) 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aArgonaute 0acleavage 0adegradome 0amicroRNA 0asmall RNA 0atarget.1 aDong, Ai-wen1 aMa, Xiaoxia1 aMeng, Yijun0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Dec., v. 65, no. 22 p.6293-6299dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru3823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014600168300001600314520090000330592002801230650002901258650001301287650002001300650002901320650001601349650002801365650001701393650002001410650001201430650000901442650001201451650001401463650001601477650001201493700003001505700001601535700001801551700002101569773009801590856008101688852000901769655001201778IND60088724220221120163628.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008872422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2011.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCudennec, Benoit10aIn vitro and in vivo evidence for a satiating effect of fish protein hydrolysate obtained from blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) muscle  ap. 271-277.  aTo find appetite suppressive molecules derived from fish protein hydrolysates, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed in order to demonstrate that hydrolysates produced from blue whiting muscle (BWMH) possess satiating properties. Here we demonstrated for the first time that a protein hydrolysate obtained from marine source was able to enhance cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in STC-1 cell line. To demonstrate that these in vitro activities also exist in vivo, we investigated the effect of BWMH preload administration in rats and its repercussion on food intake and metabolic plasma marker levels. Results showed that BWMH reduced the short term food intake which was correlated to an increase in the CCK and GLP-1 plasma levels. Moreover it was demonstrated that the chronic administration of BWMH led to a decrease in the body weight gain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicromesistius poutassou 3aappetite 3acholecystokinin 3afish protein hydrolysate 3afood intake 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3ahydrolysates 3ain vivo studies 3amuscles 3arats 3asatiety 3asecretion 3aweight gain 3awhiting1 aFouchereau-Peron, Martine1 aFerry, Faty1 aDuclos, Elisa1 aRavallec, Rozenn0 tJournal of functional foods.g2012 Jan., v. 4, no. 1 p.271-277dElsevier Ltdx1756-46467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011000166300001600276520166600292592002801958650002701986650002202013650001102035650001802046650001602064650001602080650001302096650001502109650001102124650001102135650002002146650001302166651001802179700001702197700001802214700002002232700002102252773009702273856004802370852000902418655001202427IND4467431020221119144841.0120427e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446743102DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452120101222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZavolokin, A.

Body size of spawning adults has decreased significantly for the decade of 1990–2000s compared to the period of 1960–1970s, and the ratio of elder specimens was higher. Annual growth dynamics showed different patterns. Estimated from measuring intersclerite distances on scales, first-year growth of Anadyr chum salmon samples collected in 1962 to 2007 was enhanced. After the first year, growth was reduced. The greatest reduction occurred in the third and forth years. Analysis of seasonal growth of scale evidences to the relaxation of the growth rates of Anadyr chum salmon after the first year of life preconditioned by both the over-wintering and foraging period. These data are in contradiction with the wide-spread suggestion of decreasing of chum salmon body length during winter due to bad feeding conditions. According to the similarity of the dynamics of body length and growth rates of chum salmon and pink salmon O. gorbuscha observed for the last decades, we assume that this may be preconditioned by the same large-scale limiting factors that affect similarly these salmon species inhabiting vast areas. Our data do not support the idea about high-density population of chum salmon as a main factor affecting the productivity characteristics of this species in the northern Pacific Ocean in the second half of the 20th-beginning of the 21st century. Reasons for decrease of chum salmon body length are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus gorbuscha 3aOncorhynchus keta 3aadults 3aage structure 3abody length 3abody weight 3aforaging 3amonitoring 3arivers 3asalmon 3aseasonal growth 3aspawning 3aPacific Ocean1 aKulik, V.

Physico-mechanical and antibacterial properties of the obtained films were investigated. The results indicated that St-ZnO film had higher tensile strength than those of St/Ag and St/CuO films at 2 wt.% of each NPs. Moreover, the film containing a combination of Ag-ZnO-Cuo NPs showed a higher tensile strength and Young’s modulus than those of St/Ag film. Elongation at break % of the control (pure starch) film was the highest followed by St-Ag, St-CuO, St-ZnO, and St-Ag-ZnO-CuO nanocomposite films. The results showed that St-ZnO-CuO-Ag film with 0.667 wt.% of each NPs as well as St-ZnO (3%) film had the lowest solubility in water. The ultraviolet spectroscopy revealed that the St-ZnO film had the highest UV absorbance. Microbial tests showed that St-Ag and St-CuO films had the highest antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. With increasing NPs concentration from 1 to 3 wt.% this effect was more enhanced. We found that combinatorial use of Ag/ZnO/CuO NPs in the formulation of starch-based films exhibit synergistic effect in enhancing the antimicrobial and mechanical properties of the resulting films. This would have an important impact in the development of antimicrobial films aiming to reduce the required does of individual metallic NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aabsorbance 3aantibacterial properties 3acupric oxide 3afood packaging 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3ashelf life 3asilver 3asolubility 3astarch 3asynergism 3atensile strength 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc oxide 0aActive packaging 0aAntibacterial 0aMechanical properties 0aMetallic nanoparticles 0aNanocomposite film1 aPeighambardoust, Seyed Hadi1 aPournasir, Niloufar1 aMohammadzadeh Pakdel, Parisa0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2019 Dec., v. 22 p.100420-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2019.1004203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014800168520166500316592002801981650002202009650002202031650001502053650001502068650002702083650002902110650001902139650001302158650001502171650001502186653000802201653000702209653000902216653000902225653000802234653000902242653000802251653001002259653000702269653000702276653002802283653003202311653001902343653002002362653002502382653001602407700001802423700001902441700001702460700001402477700001802491700001202509700001602521700001602537773011402553856008602667852000902753655001202762IND60792390520221119131053.0221004e20230105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079239052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1298732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Lechen10aSulfonate-modified calixarene-based porous organic polymers for electrostatic enhancement and efficient rapid removal of cationic dyes in water  aDeveloping of fast and efficient adsorbents for removal of low concentration refractory organics in water is significant. Herein, a novel calix[4]arene-based porous organic polymer CaPy is constructed through Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling polycondensation. The strong polar sulfonate is further anchored onto the polymer skeleton of CaPy and three sulfonate-modified anionic polymers CaPy-S1, CaPy-S2, and CaPy-S3 were obtained and fully characterized. The adsorption isotherms showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of CaPy, CaPy-S1, CaPy-S2, and CaPy-S3 toward methylene blue (MB) were 270, 1454, 558 and 1381 mg g⁻¹, whereas those for Rhodamine B (RhB) were 183, 2653, 1132, and 1796 mg g⁻¹, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity toward RhB was the highest reported vale among the currently used synthetic adsorbents. In addition, the pseudo-second-order rate constants of CaPy, CaPy-S1, CaPy-S2, and CaPy-S3 toward MB were 0.00572, 0.488, 2.24, and 0.192 g mg⁻¹ min⁻¹, respectively, and those toward RhB were 0.000234, 0.138, 0.0819, and 0.203 g mg⁻¹ min⁻¹, respectively. The pseudo-second-order rate constant of CaPy-S2 toward MB was 2.24 g mg⁻¹ min⁻¹ indicating one of the highest adsorption speeds. The activation energy of CaPy-S1 for RhB and MB were 121 and 109 kJ mol⁻¹, respectively, demonstrating that the adsorption of both dyes on CaPy-S1 was chemisorption process. Further, the obtained values of Gibbs free energy were negative, revealing that the adsorption process was spontaneous. This work provides an effective approach for improving adsorption performance via post-modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aactivation energy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acondensation reactions 3across-coupling reactions 3amethylene blue 3apolymers 3arhodamines 3asulfonates 0aRhB 0aMB 0aPOPs 0aDIPA 0aDMF 0aAIBN 0aTHF 0aCaPys 0aAR 0aMO 0aPorous organic polymers 0aPost-synthetic modification 0aDye adsorption 0aWater treatment 0aSulfonic acid groups 0aCalixarenes1 aZhou, Shiyuan1 aZhao, Jiaojiao1 aXu, Qingfeng1 aLi, Najun1 aChen, Dongyun1 aLi, Hua1 aHe, Jinghui1 aLu, Jianmei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2023 Jan. 05, v. 441 p.129873-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1298733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245012200166300001400288500002000302520202700322592002802349650001002377650001502387650001502402650001302417650003502430650003002465650001902495650002302514650001102537650001502548650001602563650002202579650001102601651001102612651003102623700002202654773012502676856007302801852000902874655001202883IND60587924020221117215927.0180102e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058792402DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.124992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez‐Ruiz, Emma P.10aModelling the potential geographic distribution of an endangered pollination corridor in Mexico and the United States  ap. 67-78.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Every spring endangered Mexican long‐nosed bats (Leptonycteris nivalis) migrate up to 1200 km from central Mexico to southern United States. Evidence suggests that L. nivalis follows the blooms of paniculate agave plants (genus Agave, subgenus Agave). Paniculate agave inflorescences are adapted to attract bats, and studies have indicated that Leptonycteris spp. played a key role in Agave speciation. We test the hypothesis of the Agave migratory corridor by (1) modelling the distribution of the relevant Agave species; and (2) testing whether bat records are significantly related to Agave species richness as predicted by our models. LOCATION: Mexico and United States. METHODS: We selected nine paniculate Agave species based on a set of criteria and modelled the current distribution of those species using maxent and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule‐set Production (GARP), and geographic information systems to analyse the spatial correspondence of Agave richness and presence of L. nivalis. RESULTS: We combined the Agave presence maps that resulted from the models with higher performance to create a richness map. This map indicated up to five species overlapping. L. nivalis occurrence areas correspond with areas with two, three and four Agave species more often than random expectations at the 0.05 significance level. The opposite is observed for areas with 0 Agave species where L. nivalis correspond less often than random. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Presence–pseudo‐absence and presence–background modelling tools allowed us to map potential Agave presence. These maps could guide conservation actions to ensure the maintenance of this pollination corridor. Areas with higher number of Agave species are distributed along mountain chains and may provide foraging resources for L. nivalis for longer period of time during its migration. We recommend implementing a long‐term monitoring programme in those areas to document inflorescence timing in Agave species and the presence of L. nivalis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave 3aChiroptera 3aalgorithms 3aforaging 3ageographic information systems 3ageographical distribution 3ainflorescences 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apollination 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3aMexico 3aSoutheastern United States1 aLacher, Thomas E.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2017 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.67-78dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.124993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245011200175300001600287520179700303592002802100650001002128650001102138650001102149650001102160650002602171650002302197650001702220650001302237650002302250650001502273650002502288650002302313650002202336650001102358650001602369650001302385650001102398651001602409700002202425773009202447856005502539852000902594655001202603IND50065657320221119144947.0130424e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006565732DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07790.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCraig, Robert J.10aFactors influencing geographic patterns in diversity of forest bird communities of eastern Connecticut, USA  ap. 599-609.  aAt regional scales, the most important variables associated with diversity are latitudinally‐based temperature and net primary productivity, although diversity is also influenced by habitat. We examined bird species richness, community density and community evenness in forests of eastern Connecticut to determine whether: 1) spatial and seasonal patterns exist in diversity, 2) energy explains the greatest proportion of variation in diversity parameters, 3) variation in habitat explains remaining diversity variance, and 4) seasonal shifts in diversity provide clues about how environmental variables shape communities. We sought to discover if our data supported predictions of the species–energy hypothesis. We used the variable circular plot technique to estimate bird populations and quantified the location, elevation, forest type, vegetation type, canopy cover, moisture regime, understory density and primary production for the study sites. We found that 1) summer richness and population densities are roughly equal in northeastern and southeastern Connecticut, whereas in winter both concentrate toward the coast, 2) variables linked with temperature explained much of the patterns in winter diversity, but energy‐related variables showed little relationship to summer diversity, 3) the effect of habitat variables on diversity parameters predominated in summer, although their effect was weak, 4) contrary to theory, evenness increased from summer to winter, and 5) support for predictions of species–energy theory was primarily restricted to winter data. Although energy and habitat played a role in explaining community patterns, they left much of the variance in regional diversity unexplained, suggesting that a large stochastic component to diversity also may exist.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acanopy 3acoasts 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest communities 3aforest types 3ahabitats 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3atemperature 3avariance 3awinter 3aConnecticut1 aKlaver, Robert W.0 tEcography.g2013 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.599-609dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07790.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245006600178300001800244520074800262592002801010650001601038650001101054650002201065650003001087650004801117650001801165650002101183650003301204650004001237650002801277650003001305650001501335650003901350651001001389651001001399700001901409773009901428856007701527852000901604655001201613IND60119350320221123004002.0141213e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011935032DNAL7 a110439552pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500700702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoissac, X.10aCharacterisation of two citrus apscaviroids isolated in Spain  ap. 1975-1983.  aSequence variability in the PCR amplified cDNAs from two citrus apscaviroid isolates CVd-Ia and CVd-IIId from Spain, was analysed.

To this end a large eddy simulation (LES) model was set up and validated capable of simulating a highly underexpanded jet up to a point sufficiently far from the nozzle exit such that flow features at the weft location could be analyzed. The quality of the LES was evaluated based on several quality criteria as well as by comparing the results with experiments and data from the literature. The results show that for a free jet substantial velocity fluctuations are present at a representative yarn location. By inserting a rigid cylinder at this location, the corresponding force fluctuations on a smooth yarn were also obtained. The research shows that the unsteadiness in the jet is quite substantial, as are the corresponding force fluctuations. These fluctuations could have a profound impact on the yarn motion and should at least be considered when using numerical tools to evaluate the forces on or the motion of a yarn acted on by a relay nozzle jet.  aFunding The authors disclosed the receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Ghent University Special Research Fund (BOF) (Grant No. 01D26216).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3afabrics 3aresearch 3aturbulent flow 0aair jet loom 0arelay nozzle 0acomputational fluid dynamics 0alarge eddy simulation1 aVan Langenhove, Lieva1 aDegroote, Joris1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4225-17910 tTextile research journal.g2021 May, v. 91, no. 9-10 p.990-1008dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175209682853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03648naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245017000163520172100333592002802054650001402082650001802096650002102114650001602135650002202151650001302173650002902186650002202215650001302237650001902250650003702269650001302306650001902319650001802338650001902356650001802375650001802393650003402411650003302445650002202478650001502500650001702515650002202532650000902554650001502563653002902578653001602607653002002623653002902643653002502672653003802697700001302735700001502748700001602763700001202779700001802791773010902809856008302918852000903001655001203010IND60673131420221121122208.0191126e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2019.1004182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiahao10aCharacterization of zinc oxide nanoparticles-epoxy resin composite and its antibacterial effects on spoilage bacteria derived from silvery pomfret (Pampus argenteus)  aEpoxy resin was conjugated with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) to prepare antibacterial zinc oxide-epoxy resin (ZnO-ER) composite. The property of ZnO-ER was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and SEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) assays. Results showed the presence of ZnO NPs on the surface and cross-sections of ZnO-ER composite. The average thickness of ZnO-ER was 392.38 μm. The strong antibacterial effect of ZnO-ER on the test bacterial mixture derived from spoiled silvery pomfret (Pampus argenteus) was observed using SEM assay. After addition of ZnO-ER for 6 h in the bacterial mixture, cellular membrane integrities of most bacteria were destroyed. High-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing revealed the decreases of both community richness and diversity in the ZnO-ER treated bacterial mixture. As for relative abundances, significant decreases were detected in the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicute, while dramatic increase of the phylum Proteobacteria was observed after ZnO-ER treatment. The family of Enterobacteriaceae was predominant in the ZnO-ER treatment. The genera of Providencia and Yersinia showed dramatically high relative abundances. However, the abundances of some specific genera such as Aeromonas and Shewanell, which are related to human infections or food spoilage, were decreased to 0.00% after addition of ZnO-ER for 6 h. When the incubation time of ZnO-ER with the bacterial mixture was prolonged to 24 h, bacteria colony was hardly detected to a negligible level. The results suggest the potential application of ZnO-ER in food packaging to inhibit spoilage bacteria derived from aquatic organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas 3aBacteroidetes 3aPampus argenteus 3aProvidencia 3aX-ray diffraction 3aYersinia 3aantibacterial properties 3aaquatic organisms 3abacteria 3acell membranes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aepoxides 3afood packaging 3afood spoilage 3ahuman diseases 3ananoparticles 3aribosomal RNA 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asequence analysis 3ashelf life 3aspectroscopy 3aspoilage bacteria 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aZinc oxide nanoparticles 0aEpoxy resin 0aCharacteristics 0aSilvery pomfret spoilage 0aAntibacterial effect 0a16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing1 aSong, Ru1 aDai, Yubin1 aYang, Shuyi1 aLi, Jie1 aWei, Rongbian0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2019 Dec., v. 22 p.100418-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2019.1004183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012200165300001100287520065300298592002800951650001900979650001700998650003001015650001001045650003301055650001401088650001101102650002701113650001801140650001701158650002701175650001101202650001001213651001401223700002301237773011001260856008101370852000901451655001201460IND60440729620221119170003.0151215e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044072962DNAL7 a10.1007/s13314-015-0179-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoslemi, Azin10aPestalotiopsis chamaeropis causing leaf spot disease of round leaf mint-bush (Prostanthera rotundifolia) in Australia  ap. 29.  aPestalotiopsis chamaeropis was isolated from necrotic leaf spots of round leaf mint-bush -Prostanthera rotundifolia (Lamiaceae) in Melbourne, Australia.

Here, we show that mating induced significant transcriptional changes both in the reproductive tract (RT) and head of Spodoptera litura females, with all those genes that are directly related to fecundity, such as yolk protein and vitellogenin, being upregulated after mating, suggesting that mating promoted egg production. The most interesting changes are the upregulation of the heat shock response and the downregulation of immunity soon after mating in the RT. An increased heat shock response after mating may contribute to the formation of a favorable microenvironment for the interaction between gametes. The downregulation of immune activities may be due to males suppressing female immunity directly to promote sperm storage and fertilization in females. Another interesting finding is that mating results in the downregulation of five circadian regulation genes (including two clock core genes) in the RT. Moreover, mating also induced significant changes in other gene families, such as neuropeptides and cytochrome p450, suggesting that some of them may play important functions in mating responses and postmating physiological and behavioral switches. In addition, a prominent change in the head was found in which many olfactory-related genes were upregulated after mating. S. litura females usually start to lay eggs at night soon after mating, and thus, an increased olfactory function after mating is beneficial for host location by females during the night.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera litura 3acoevolution 3acytochrome P-450 3aegg production 3aentomology 3afecundity 3afemale reproductive system 3afemales 3agenes 3ahead 3aheat shock response 3aimmunity 3amales 3aneuropeptides 3asmell 3aspermatozoa 3atranscription (genetics) 3avitellogenin 0aSpodoptera litura 0aRNA-seq 0aMating-responsive genes 0aReproduction 0aHeat shock protein 0aImmunity1 aGao, Bo1 aYu, Hong1 aLi, Yong-He1 aChen, Peng1 aXu, Jin0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.101919-dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245006100161300001600222520097800238592002801216650001401244650001801258650001601276650001401292650001701306650001001323650002401333650001001357650001301367650001901380650002501399650001401424650001101438651002801449651001201477651002901489651001601518653001801534653000901552653001601561653002401577653002601601700001701627700001901644700002201663700002001685700001701705700002801722700003401750773011901784856007901903852000901982655001201991IND60515164920221116210602.0160313e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051516492DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2013.13542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEiden, Martin10aIsolation of Sindbis Virus from a Hooded Crow in Germany  ap. 220-222.  aSindbis virus (SINV) is an arbovirus that causes clinical symptoms, including arthritis, rash, and fever during acute human infections. In Europe, SINV outbreaks are largely restricted to northern Europe. Intrigued by the isolation of SINV from mosquitoes in southwestern Germany in 2009, we initiated a passive arbovirus-monitoring program in birds and analyzed a total of 685 samples. By this approach, we were able to detect a SINV in a Hooded Crow in Germany for the first time. It was possible to isolate SINV virus in cell cultures and even to visualize virus particles by electron microscopy. After the determination of the complete SINV genome sequence, the phylogenetic analysis revealed its close relationship to SINV genotype I sequences previously obtained from mosquitoes in Germany and Scandinavia. This first report on the isolation of viable SINV indicates the potential involvement of crows in an enzootic circulation of SINV in Germany and Central Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aSindbis virus 3aarboviruses 3aarthritis 3acell culture 3acrows 3aelectron microscopy 3afever 3agenotype 3ahuman diseases 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3avirion 3aCentral European region 3aGermany 3aNorthern European region 3aScandinavia 0aSindbis virus 0aSINV 0aHooded crow 0aElectron microscopy 0aPhylogenetic analysis1 aZiegler, Ute1 aKeller, Markus1 aMüller, Kerstin,1 aGranzow, Harald1 aJöst, Hanna1 aSchmidt-Chanasit, Jonas1 aGroschup, M.

In the present study, we used otolith silhouette and morphometric analysis (n = 103) in addition to chemical signatures (n = 20) to test the hypothesis of a single stock unit of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (20–34°S). No significant differences were found between sexes (t-test p > 0.05), enabling analyses for all study specimens to be grouped. Cluster analysis using Fourier coefficients (30 first harmonics) differentiated three otolith morphotypes within South (28–34°S) and Southeast (20–28°S) regions of the study area. Harmonic principal component analysis using the first two significant axes showed no pattern of spatial separation by region. Among the seven shape descriptors examined, only circularity and form factor showed significant differences between the morphotypes (A and B). Microchemistry analysis (LA/ICP-MS) applied to the core portion of fish otoliths showed significant differences in Ba, Mn and Mg concentrations between the two regions and morphotypes (p < 0.05). These results support that the Katsuwonus pelamis population in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean belong to a single stock unit with a probable common area of origin. Specimens captured in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil had heterogeneous phenotypic attributes regarding otolith shape, probably determined by a temporal equilibrium selection process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKatsuwonus pelamis 3achemical analysis 3acluster analysis 3afish 3amorphometry 3amorphs 3aotoliths 3aphenotype 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3at-test 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBrazil 0aSkipjack tuna 0aMorphometric 0aChemical analyses 0aAtlantic 0aMorphotypes1 aColetto, Juliano Lauser1 aCastello, Jorge Pablo1 aMiller, Nathaniel R.1 ade Almeida Tubino, Rafael1 aMonteiro-Neto, Cassiano1 aCosta, Marcus Rodrigues da0 tFisheries research.g2022 Nov., v. 255 p.106436-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2022.1064363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245010200184300001600286520130000302592002801602650001801630650002201648650001701670650001501687650001701702650001501719650001801734650001201752650001701764650000801781650006901789650003501858650001401893650002901907650002001936651001001956700002201966700002401988773010002012852000902112856008102121930003302202946001102235655001202246IND60439149520221121035001.0151024e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043914952DNAL7 a174270332pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-007-0085-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobe, Hiroshi10aDevelopment and structure of the female gametophyte in Austrobaileya scandens (Austrobaileyaceae)  ap. 431-436.  aAustrobaileyales, comprising the four families Austrobaileyaceae, Trimeniaceae, Schisandraceae, and Illiciaceae, are included in the basal angiosperms along with Amborellaceae and Nymphaeaceae. Here, we present the first developmental study of the female gametophyte in Austrobaileya scandens, the only species of Austrobaileyaceae, which are sister to the rest of the Austrobaileyales. Austrobaileya scandens has a four-celled/four-nucleate embryo sac as in the derived families of the order, e.g., Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae. It is monosporic, with the chalazal megaspore of a tetrad developing into the embryo sac composed of an egg cell, two synergids, and one polar nucleus. This mode of embryo sac formation was first reported in Schisandra over 40 years ago and should now be established as the Schisandra type. Its occurrence in A. scandens shows that the Schisandra-type embryo sac is likely common to the whole Austrobaileyales as well as to Nymphaeaceae. Amborellaceae were recently reported to have an eight-celled/nine-nucleate embryo sac, clarifying that none of the basal angiosperms has the seven-celled/eight-nucleate Polygonum-type embryo sac found in the majority of angiosperms, and that the Polygonum-type embryo sac represents a derived character state in angiosperms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmborellaceae 3aAustrobaileyaceae 3aNymphaeaceae 3aSchisandra 3aTrimeniaceae 3aembryo sac 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3agametophytes 3aova 2aMagnoliopsidaxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aFlowersxcytologyxphysiology. 2aPhylogeny 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSeedsxcytology 0aJapan1 aKimoto, Yukitoshi1 aPrakash, Nallamilli0 tJournal of plant research.g2007 May, v. 120, no. 3 p.431-436dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-007-0085-03Available from publisher's site  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01336naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007600169300001600245520046100261592002800722650001400750650001500764650001100779650001200790650001800802650001600820651001500836773009300851856008100944852000901025655001201034IND60440729820221119170106.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044072982DNAL7 a10.1134/S207909611503004X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYermolaeva, N.

Cigarette smoke (CS) is one of the major causes of ALI/ARDS. Since high expression of prostaglandin (PG) D₂ has been observed in CS-induced lung injury. Currently, no effective pharmacological therapies are available to treat ALI, and supportive therapies remain the mainstay of treatment. Therefore, we investigated the protective effect of CT‑133, a newly discovered selective CRTH2 antagonist, on CS-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro. CT‑133 (10 and 30 mg/kg), dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) and normal saline were intratracheally administrated 1 hr prior to whole-body CS-exposure for seven consecutive days to study the key characteristics of ALI. Subsequently, CSE (4%)- and PGD₂-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were used to evaluate the protective effect of CT‑133. CT‑133 remarkably attenuated infiltration of inflammatory cells, neutrophils, and macrophages in the BALF, albumin contents, expression of IL‑1β, IL‑6, TNF‑α and KC, lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and lung histopathological alterations caused by CS exposure in mice. Moreover, CT‑133 not only reversed the uncontrolled secretion of IL‑1β, IL-6, TNF‑α and KC from CSE- and PGD₂-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages but also augmented IL-10 production in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Additionally, CT‑133 alleviated in vitro neutrophil migration chemoattracted by PGD₂. Our results provide the first evidence that targeting CRTH2 could be a new potential therapeutic option to treat CS-induced ALI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute respiratory distress syndrome 3aalbumins 3aantagonists 3acigarettes 3adexamethasone 3ahistopathology 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amice 3amortality 3amyeloperoxidase 3aneutrophils 3aprostaglandins 3aprotective effect 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aCRTH2 antagonist 0aPGD2 0aCigarette smoke 0aPro-inflammatory mediators 0aRAW 264.7 macrophages1 aXu, Chengyun1 aYao, Minli1 aZhang, Qin1 aWu, Junsong1 aWu, Xiling1 aLu, Meiping1 aTang, Lanfang1 aWu, Fugen1 aWu, Ximei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3316-893X0 tLife sciences.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 216 p.156-167dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245021200169520156600381592002801947650001601975650001801991650001502009650002302024650002502047650001402072651002102086653001302107653002502120653003502145653002902180653002002209700001702229700001902246700001902265700002002284700001502304773016502319856008402484852000902568655001202577IND60774554320221120104938.0220914e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077455432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jeong Sun10aMolecular identification of the strains of the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), which are endemic to Korea, based on single nucleotide polymorphisms in mitochondrial genome sequences  aThe domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), has been diversified into various strains over a long period. However, methods to distinguish silkworm strains remain limited partially owing to the genetic similarity caused by the long history of domestication. In this study, we developed molecular identification methods to distinguish three domestic silkworm strains, which are endemic to Korea. By comparing publicly available complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences of five endemic strains and 34 stock silkworm strains analyzed in a previous study, we detected 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; SNP1–SNP15), which distinguished the following three endemic strains: Sun7ho (SN7), Sandongsammyeon (SDS), and Sammyeonhonghoeback (SMH). We used two SNPs for each strain to identify the three endemic strains. To distinguish each SN7 and SDS from the remaining four endemic and 34 stock strains, the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was employed using Acu I and Hpa I restriction enzymes, which recognize SNP1 and SNP8, respectively. Additionally, the tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system PCR method was used to determine the regions containing SNP3, SNP11, and both SNP14 and SNP15 to distinguish SN7, SDS, and SMH, respectively, from the remaining strains. A validation test with additional individuals showed that each target strain was clearly recognized, suggesting that mitogenome SNP-based methods can be used to identify three endemic silkworm strains during culture and breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3adomestication 3aentomology 3agenetic similarity 3amitochondrial genome 3asilkworms 3aKorean Peninsula 0aSilkworm 0aMitochondrial genome 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aMolecular identification 0aEndemic strains1 aKim, Min Jee1 aKim, Seong-Wan1 aKim, Kee-Young1 aKim, Seong-Ryul1 aKim, Iksoo0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.101922-dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245017200182300001400354520159600368592002801964650001501992650000902007650001702016650003702033650001302070650002202083650001902105700002002124773009402144856008802238990002302326852000902349655001202358IND60098474320221121233940.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009847432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicopoullos, James D.M.10aPoor response cycles: when should we cancel? Comparison of outcome between egg collection, intrauterine insemination conversion, and follow-up cycles after abandonment  ap. 68-71.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine optimal management with one or two mature follicles after stimulation. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Lister fertility clinic. PATIENT(S): A total of 1,350 IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles (7.3% of total) during 1998–2009 were found to have one or two mature follicles. INTERVENTION(S): Group 1 (n = 807) comprised those who proceeded to vaginal egg collection (VEC) (59.8%; outcome per egg collection), group 2 (n = 248) those who converted to IUI (18.4%; outcome per insemination) and group 3 (n = 259) those who abandoned the current cycle (21.9%; outcome per abandoned cycle in first subsequent cycle). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and biochemical pregnancy rate. RESULT(S): Biochemical pregnancy rates of 13.1%, 4.9%, and 9.7%, clinical pregnancy rates of 8.1%, 3.6%, and 7.2%, and ongoing pregnancy rates of 6.8%, 2.0%, and 5.5% were achieved in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All pregnancy outcomes were significantly higher after VEC (group 1) than for those converted to IUI (group 2), and all pregnancy outcomes were higher with borderline significance in group 3 vs. group 2. There was no significant difference in outcome between groups 1 and 3. CONCLUSION(S): Our data suggest that for such poor responders, proceeding to VEC may represent their best chance of successful outcome. Conversion to IUI offers the poorest outcome, and despite the potential for improvements in cycle protocol, abandoning and a further attempt does not improve outcome (using abandoned cycle as the denominator).  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth rate 3aeggs 3ainsemination 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3apatients 3apregnancy outcome 3apregnancy rate1 aAbdalla, Hossam0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.68-71dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.05.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245010300165300001400268500002000282520202600302592002802328650002502356650001102381650002902392650001502421650002602436650001002462650002302472650002102495650001502516650002202531650001302553650002402566650001102590651001702601700002002618700002402638773012502662856007302787852000902860655001202869IND60587924520221117215534.0180102e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058792452DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.124932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKietzka, Gabriella J.10aAerial adult dragonflies are highly sensitive to in‐water conditions across an ancient landscape  ap. 14-26.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Adult dragonflies are renowned for being good bioindicators of anthropogenic change, but their response to the heterogeneity of undisturbed river systems has received little investigation. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) has had a long lineage of natural selection which has honed life stages to the fine grain of the river systems. This leads to the intriguing question: How sensitive are the aerial adults to the in‐water conditions? LOCATION: Rivers of the CFR, in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, are naturally heterogeneous and complex ecosystems running across a geologically ancient landscape. The CFR is a significant centre of local endemism for many taxa, including dragonflies. METHODS: We investigated dragonfly assemblages and 20 environmental variables along untransformed reaches of three CFR rivers. RESULTS: We found that each river has its own particular ‘signature’ dragonfly assemblage. We also found that certain in‐water parameters were the most important factors driving adult dragonfly assemblages, and not variables associated with substrate or riparian vegetation under these historic, natural conditions. This responsiveness to a heterogeneous range of in‐water variables was similar from one river to the next, and also was independent of species turnover among the different dragonfly assemblages. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: From a conservation perspective, the natural variation in certain water parameters, particularly in‐water conditions, is essential for supporting the full suite of adult dragonfly species. Challenging but important for conservation planning is that each river has its own biotic merit. Addressing this challenge also means that maintenance and restoration of historic, heterogeneous, in‐water conditions in addition to the removal of alien invasive trees which are already known to be highly detrimental to this largely irreplaceable dragonfly fauna. Prioritizing which rivers to conserve can be achieved through using indices involving dragonflies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3anatural selection 3aplanning 3ariparian vegetation 3arivers 3aSouth Africa1 aPryke, James S.1 aSamways, Michael J.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2017 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.14-26dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.124933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245010300206300001600309500001500325506007600340520096500416592002801381506003701409650001801446650000901464650002201473650001101495650002001506650000801526650001201534650002501546650000901571650001001580650001201590651001501602651001301617651001501630653001501645653001901660700003501679700002101714700002301735700003101758700002601789700002401815700001901839773011901858856007901977852000902056655001202065IND60515165020221207084356.0160313e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051516502DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2013.13592doi7 aPMC39525872pmcid7 a245757552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynes, Jean-Marc10aAnjozorobe Hantavirus, a New Genetic Variant of Thailand Virus Detected in Rodents from Madagascar  ap. 212-219.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUntil now, there was only serological evidence that hantaviruses were circulating in rodents and infecting humans from Madagascar. To assess the presence of a hantavirus on the island, between October, 2008, and March, 2010, we sampled 585 rodents belonging to seven species in the Anjozorobe-Angavo forest corridor, 70 km north from the capital city Antananarivo. A hantavirus was detected from organs of the ubiquist roof rat (Rattus rattus) and of the endemic Major's tufted-tailed rat (Eliurus majori). Amazingly, sequence analysis of the S (small), M (medium), and L (large) coding DNA sequence of this virus showed that the Anjozorobe strain (proposed name) was a new genetic variant of Thailand virus (THAIV) that comprises other variants found in Southeast Asia. Because THAIV is suspected of causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans, ongoing studies are addressing the risk of infection by this new variant in the Malagasy population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRattus rattus 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3ahumans 3aOrthohantavirus 3aDNA 3aviruses 3anucleotide sequences 3arats 3afever 3aforests 3aMadagascar 3aThailand 0aMadagascar 0aHantavirus 0aEliurus majori1 aRazafindralambo, Nadia Kaloina1 aLacoste, Vincent1 aOlive, Marie-Marie1 aBarivelo, Tony Andrianaivo1 aSoarimalala, Voahangy1 aHeraud, Jean-Michel1 aLavergne, Anne0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 14, no. 3 p.212-219dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-77597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fvbz.2013.13593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245012900178300001400307520120600321592002801527650002701555650001401582650002201596650002501618650001301643651001801656700002701674700002601701700001901727700001901746700002001765773009401785856008801879990002301967852000901990655001201999IND60098474420221121233921.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009847442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinn, Gwendolyn P.10aState laws and regulations addressing third-party reimbursement for infertility treatment: implications for cancer survivors  ap. 72-78.  aOBJECTIVE: To examine codified state policies related to infertility and assess their implications for cancer patients. Lack of insurance is often identified as a barrier to use of fertility preservation (FP) services. DESIGN: None. SETTING: A keyword search was developed to identify statutes and administrative regulations of insurance coverage for FP in the United States. PATIENT(S): N/A INTERVENTION(S): N/A MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Laws addressing the general population but pertaining to FP were compiled using Lexis-Nexis. Data were analyzed by reviewing the “plain meaning” of the text, legislative/administrative history, and annotated case law. Legal reasoning and common rules of statutory construction and legislative interpretation were used. RESULT(S): Fifteen states (29.4%) had laws relating to insurance coverage for infertility or in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures and two states (CA and IL) specifically excluded IVF from a mandatory offer of coverage. No state laws or regulations addressed insurance coverage for FP methods specific to cancer patients. CONCLUSION(S): There is an argument for policies that require coverage for FP for cancer survivors before treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3ain vitro fertilization 3ainsurance 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3apatients 3aUnited States1 aVadaparampil, Susan T.1 aMcGowan Lowrey, Kerri1 aEidson, Shelby1 aKnapp, Caprice1 aBukulmez, Orhan0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.72-78dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.05.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01764naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011700158300001800275520062800293592002800921650002300949650002800972650002501000650002201025650002101047700001601068700003101084700001801115700001901133700002001152700002001172700002001192773010601212856007501318852000901393655001201402IND60578722220180316000000.0170813e20140718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057872222DNAL7 a10.1021/ol501529z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchurgers, Ben10aSynthesis of Fused 3-Aminoazepinones via Trapping of a New Class of Cyclic Seven-Membered Allenamides with Furan  ap. 3712-3715.  aNovel tricyclic tetrahydroazepinones were synthesized via an in situ Diels–Alder reaction of furan with cyclic allenamides.

However, it is not clearly known whether or not DPSCs maintain their immunosuppressive effects after differentiation. In the present study, we examined the immunomodulatory effects of osteogenic differentiated DPSCs (OD-DPSCs). OD-DPSCs and undifferentiated DPSCs were co-cultured with allogenic PBMCs in different ratios and the proliferation of the PBMCs was measured. The concentration of IL-10, TGF-β, PGE2, IL-6, and NO were then examined. Moreover, the expression of IDO, HLAG, and HGF genes were determined in undifferentiated and OD-DPSCs. The results showed that OD-DPSCs could inhibit the proliferation of allogenic PBMCs. The levels of PGE2, IL-6, and TGF-β anti-inflammatory cytokines increased after the co-culture. Moreover, the levels of NO increased during the differentiation process and the expression of IDO, HLAG, and HGF genes remained unchanged after osteogenic differentiation. Although, there were some differences between the OD-DPSCs and undifferentiated DPSCs in terms of their cytokine and NO production, undifferentiated DPSCs maintained their immunomodulatory activities upon differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3acoculture 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunomodulators 3aimmunosuppression 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3amedicine 3amononuclear leukocytes 3anitric oxide 3astem cells 3atooth pulp 3atransforming growth factor beta 0ahDPSC 0aOD-DPSC 0aPBMC 0aTGF-b 0aIL-6 0aIL-10 0aHGF 0aPGE2 0aHLA-G 0aNO 0aIDO 0aDental pulp stem cell (DPSC) 0aOsteogenic 0aDifferentiation 0aImmunomodulatory 0aImmunosuppression1 aHashemi, Seyed Mahmoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1389-58031 aNamaki, Saeed1 aGhanbarian, Hossein1 aSattari, Mandana1 aKhojasteh, Arash0 tLife sciences.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 216 p.111-118dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003900146245011900185300001800304520157900322592002801901650001501929650000801944650002401952650001101976650002401987650001302011650001102024650002202035650002402057650001902081650001902100700003002119700006102149700002102210773017002231856008002401852000902481655001202490IND60600935620180822000000.0180705e20170517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060093562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b002192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseinzadeh Hejazi, Sayed Alireza10aCycle Development and Process Optimization of High-Purity Oxygen Production Using Silver-Exchanged Titanosilicates  ap. 5679-5691.  aProducing oxygen with purity higher than 95.0% from atmospheric air (78.0% N₂, 21.0% O₂, and 1.0% Ar) is challenging because of the similar physical properties of oxygen and argon. Silver-exchanged titanosilicates have shown the potential to separate these gases based on their thermodynamic affinities. In this study, various vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) cycle configurations including the simple Skarstrom cycle and more complicated 6-step VSA cycles were simulated using mathematical models to maximize O₂ purity and recovery. The simulations were verified by conducting simple 3-step and Skarstrom VSA cycle experiments. A mixture of 95.0%/5.0% O₂/Ar feed was considered in the simulations, and a rigorous multiobjective optimization was conducted to maximize O₂ purity and recovery. The simulations predicted 27.3% recovery for a product with 99.5% purity for a 6-step cycle with pressure equalization and light product pressurization steps. The recovery for the same level of purity was improved significantly to 91.7% by implementing a heavy product pressurization step. The effect of bed length on O₂ purity and recovery and the comparison of VSA with pressure swing adsorption and pressure–vacuum swing adsorption for high-purity O₂ production were also investigated. Rigorous multiobjective optimizations were conducted to maximize oxygen productivity and minimize energy consumption of the VSA cycles, while meeting different purity constraints, and significant improvement in the performance indicators was obtained through process optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aargon (noble gases) 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3aphysical properties 3aprocess design 3athermodynamics1 aEstupiñan Perez, Libardo1 aRajendran, Arvind1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4367-48921 aKuznicki, Steven0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 May 17, v. 56, no. 19 p.5679-5691dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b002193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002200162245008200184300001800266500001500284520133100299592002801630650001301658650001601671650002501687650001301712650002801725650001901753650000801772650002201780650002501802650003801827650003801865650003501903650001201938650002301950650001401973650002001987650001802007650002902025650001102054650005102065650002902116650003002145650001302175650003602188650001702224650002902241650003202270653002802302700002502330700002002355700002302375773009902398856007702497852000902574655001202583IND60119350820221123021207.0141213e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011935082DNAL7 a110439442pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500700592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeeters, B.

Negative-sense minigenome RNA was generated from transfected plasmid DNA by means of in vivo transcription. Subsequent replication of minigenome RNA was determined either after infection with NDV helpervirus or after contransfection with helperplasmids that expressed the essential viral replication proteins NP, P, and L. In both systems, efficient replication of minigenome RNA was observed only if the genome size was a multiple of six nucleotides. Hence, in these systems, replication of NDV minigenome RNA's is strictly dependent on the rule-of-six. When the supernatant from helpervirus-infected, transfected cells was used to infect fresh monolayers, efficient transfer of SEAP activity by virus-like particles was observed only if the size of the minigenome RNA obeyed the rule-of-six. However, after several serial passages, we also observed efficient transfer of SEAP activity by virus-like particles derived from minigenome RNA’s that did not obey the rule-of-six. Evidence was obtained which indicated that successful replication of these minigenomes was not due to a change in genome size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3anucleotides 3avirus-like particles 3aplasmids 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3areporter genes 3aRNA 3avirus replication 3aalkaline phosphatase 2a3' Untranslated Regionsxgenetics 2a5' Untranslated Regionsxgenetics 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCell Line 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGenome, Viral 2aHelper Virusesxgenetics 2aHumans 2aNewcastle disease virusxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aNucleoproteinsxgenetics 2aPhosphoproteinsxgenetics 2aPlasmids 2aRNA, Viralxanalysisxgenetics. 2aTransfection 2aViral Proteinsxgenetics 2aVirus Replicationxgenetics 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aGruijthuijsen, Y.

DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort analysis. SETTING: University-based medical center. PATIENT(S): Women treated with IVM or IVF. INTERVENTION(S): We studied the first serum β-hCG levels in 104 pregnant women who were successfully treated with IVM and in another 104 women with IVF treatment. Blood samplings for β-hCG were drawn on day 12–15 after ET. The two groups were matched by age, order of pregnancy, and day of blood sampling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): First β-hCG levels. RESULT(S): Serum β-hCG levels on days 12 to 13 after ET of IVM viable singleton pregnancies were significantly higher than those of IVF pregnancies (343.2 ± 48.4 vs. 264.0 ± 29.2 IU/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 22–229). Similarly, β-hCG levels on days 14 to 15 after ET of IVM viable singleton pregnancies were higher than those of IVF pregnancies (350.1 ± 126.4 vs. 284.4 ± 30.2 IU/L). Similar trends were found in β-hCG levels on days 12 to 13 after ET of twin viable pregnancies (IVM, 682.1 ± 97.7 vs. IVF, 434.5 ± 41.8 IU/L; 95% CI 44–662). Grouped linear regression with covariance analysis showed a significant difference between IVM and IVF regression lines. CONCLUSION(S): The first serum β-hCG levels in pregnancies after IVM are consistently higher than those after IVF treatment. More studies are needed to elucidate these findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3achorionic gonadotropins 3aconfidence interval 3acovariance 3ain vitro fertilization 3alinear models 3apatients 3apregnancy 3apregnant women1 aAl-Shalaty, Jana1 aSheizaf, Boaz1 aShehata, Fady1 aSon, Weon-Young1 aTan, S.

In this paper, AC was endowed with abundant AOS by modifying with (NH₄)₂S₂O₈ and MnOₓ-FeOₓ for Hg⁰ removal. (NH₄)₂S₂O₈ treatment induced abundant micropores and oxygen-containing functional groups, and thus provided more anchoring sites for the dispersion of MnOₓ-FeOₓ. The synergy of MnOₓ-FeOₓ and interaction between MnOₓ-FeOₓ and NAC support contributed to a larger surface area, highly-dispersed active components, stronger reducibility, and more metal ions with high valence of MnFe/NAC. The optimal MnFe/NAC exhibited superior Hg⁰ removal efficiency above 90% at 120∼180 ℃, as well as excellent performance for simultaneous removal of Hg⁰ and NO, and 600 ppm SO₂ and 8 vol.% H₂O addition led to a slight deterioration. XPS and Hg-TPD revealed that mercury adsorbed on MnFe/NAC included phy-Hg, C=O-Hg, COO-Hg, and OL-HgO. Besides, the priority of AOS for Hg⁰ chemisorption was C=O > COO- > OL, and Hg²⁺ was also detected in the outlet. Moreover, the SO₂-poisoning effect was ascribed to the sulfation of MnOₓ and the occupation of COO- and C=O, and FeOₓ incorporation enhanced the SO₂-resistance through weakening SO₂ adsorption on C=O and COO-. The motivation of O₂ mainly contributed to the regeneration of AOS, especially OL. The excellent regeneration performance and stability further affirmed the application potential of MnFe/NAC for Hg⁰ capture from coal-fired flue gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive oxygen species 3aadsorption 3acoal 3aflue gas 3amercury 3amicropores 3amotivation 3aoccupations 3asurface area 0aMnFe/NAC 0aoxygen functional groups 0aHg0 control 0aSO2-resistance 0aHg-TPD1 aLi, Caiting1 aZhang, Jie1 aZhu, Youcai1 aLiang, Caixia1 aHuang, Le1 aYang, Guang,1 aYao, Chaoliang1 aMa, Ying0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2023 Jan. 05, v. 441 p.129882-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1298823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01317naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008300166300001600249520034100265592002800606650001800634650001500652650002500667650001500692650003000707650001100737650001600748700002200764700002200786773009300808856008100901852000900982655001200991IND60440730020221119173539.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044073002DNAL7 a10.1134/S20790961150301052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapanov, M.

This impressive feat of transport and sorting is achieved by the combined action of targeting signals on mitochondrial proteins and the mitochondrial protein import apparatus. The mitochondrial protein import apparatus is composed of a number of multi-subunit protein complexes that recognize, translocate, and assemble mitochondrial proteins into functional complexes. While the core subunits involved in mitochondrial protein import are well conserved across wide phylogenetic gaps, the accessory subunits of these complexes differ in identity and/or function when plants are compared with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), the model system for mitochondrial protein import. These differences include distinct protein import receptors in plants, different mechanistic operation of the intermembrane protein import system, the location and activity of peptidases, the function of inner-membrane translocases in linking the outer and inner membrane, and the association/regulation of mitochondrial protein import complexes with components of the respiratory chain. Additionally, plant mitochondria share proteins with plastids, i.e. dual-targeted proteins. Also, the developmental and cell-specific nature of mitochondrial biogenesis is an aspect not observed in single-celled systems that is readily apparent in studies in plants. This means that plants provide a valuable model system to study the various regulatory processes associated with protein import and mitochondrial biogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3amitochondria 3aprotein transport 3aproteins 0aDual targeting 0amitochondria 0apeptidase 0aprotein import 0asignalling 0atargeting signals.1 aKmiec, Beata1 aKubiszewski-Jakubiak, Szymon1 aTeixeira, Pedro F.1 aGlaser, Elzbieta1 aWhelan, James0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Dec., v. 65, no. 22 p.6301-6335dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru3993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100002100195245013100216300001400347520144300361592002801804650002201832650001101854650001501865650001501880650001601895650002101911650002301932650002701955650001301982650001901995650001002014700001902024700001902043700002002062700002402082700002502106773009402131856008802225990002302313852000902336655001202345IND60098474720221121234006.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009847472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.03.0502doi7 aPMC36192112pmcid7 a204511862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCsokmay, John M.10aAre there ethnic differences in pregnancy rates in African-American versus white women undergoing frozen blastocyst transfers?  ap. 89-93.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine whether frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer pregnancy rates (PR) are lower in African-American compared with white women. DESIGN: Retrospective review of frozen blastocyst cycles. SETTING: University-based assisted reproductive technology (ART) program. PATIENT(S): All patients who underwent a frozen blastocyst transfer between 2003 and 2008. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Live birth rate. RESULT(S): One hundred sixty-nine patients underwent transfer of a frozen-thawed blastocyst. African-American women had a higher incidence of leiomyoma (40% vs. 10%) and tubal and uterine factor infertility. There was no difference in the live birth rate for African-American patients (28.0%) compared with white patients (30.2%). Of the patients who underwent a frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer, 58% (n = 98) had their fresh, autologous IVF cycle, which produced the cryopreserved blastocyst, at Walter Reed Medical Center. A higher peak serum E₂ level was noted in African-American patients (5,355 pg/mL) compared with white patients (4,541 pg/mL). During the fresh cycle, the live birth rates between African-American and white patients were significantly different at 16.7% versus 39.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Live birth rates after frozen blastocyst transfer are not different between African-American and white women despite a fourfold higher incidence of leiomyomas in African-American women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aWhites 3abirth rate 3ablastocyst 3ablood serum 3acryopreservation 3aethnic differences 3ain vitro fertilization 3apatients 3apregnancy rate 3awomen1 aHill, Micah J.1 aMaguire, Marcy1 aPayson, Mark D.1 aFujimoto, Victor Y.1 aArmstrong, Alicia Y.0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.89-93dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.03.0503Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165300001600278520156300294592002801857650001301885650001201898650001601910650002401926650001101950650002001961650001901981650001602000650001002016650001602026650000902042650001102051650002202062650001302084650001702097650001802114653001602132653001202148653001502160653001302175700002102188700002202209700001802231700002102249700006202270773009802332856008202430852000902512655001202521IND60622662220221120123854.0220228e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062266222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkter, Salina10aAnxiolytic effects of γ-oryzanol in chronically- stressed mice are related to monoamine levels in the brain  ap. 119-128.  aThe present study was aimed to investigate the anxiolytic effect of γ-oryzanol (GORZ) during chronic restraint stress treatment (CRST), which is a well-documented model of stress-related disorders, like anxiety, and its potential molecular mechanisms. In this experiment, 5-week-old male ICR mice were used and the concentration of GORZ was fixed at 0.5% in the mouse standard diet (14% casein, AIN 93 M). Mice were immobilized daily for 3 h from ZT 2.5 to 5.5 (ZT0 was designated as light-on time) for 20 consecutive days, followed by behavioral testing, including the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test. The concentration of serum corticosterone (CORT) was measured. In addition, the expression of central monoamine neurotransmitters with their metabolites in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala of the brain were examined. 0.5% GORZ partially blocked stress-induced reduction of body weight gain while stressed mice had significantly lower body weights during the entire experimental period. Further, 0.5% GORZ treatment could significantly improve the main behavioral parameters even in CRST situations. The significant increase in serum CORT levels indicated CRST-induced stress, which was almost unaffected by 0.5% GORZ treatment. Moreover, 0.5% GORZ also supported the anxiolytic mechanism with enhancement of 5-HIAA and NE levels in the amygdala of brain after CRST. Taken together, our studies suggested that 0.5% GORZ is a potential therapeutic drug candidate against anxiety under chronic stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamygdala 3aanxiety 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3acasein 3acerebral cortex 3acorticosterone 3ahippocampus 3amales 3ametabolites 3amice 3amodels 3aneurotransmitters 3aoryzanol 3atherapeutics 3atranquilizers 0aγ-oryzanol 0aAnxiety 0aMonoamines 0aAmygdala1 aSasaki, Hiroyuki1 aUddin, Kazi Rasel1 aIkeda, Yūko,1 aMiyakawa, Hiroki1 aShibata, Shigenobu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6177-19630 tLife sciences.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 216 p.119-128dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01321naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011900173300001600292520039900308592002800707650001900735650001500754650001400769650001200783650001600795650001200811651001300823773009300836856008100929852000901010655001201019IND60440730120221119174003.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044073012DNAL7 a10.1134/S20790961150300382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi︠a︡zrov, L.

Propagation of all seven serotypes was successful in the human cell lines Caco-2, T84, HT-29, and in the African green monkey kidney cell line MA-104. Both primary and secondary African green monkey kidney cells were more effective than Rhesus monkey kidney cells for cultivation of astrovirus. Except for human foreskin cells, all of the other human and simian cell lines supported growth of at least one astrovirus serotype. The only non-primate cell line that permitted sustained passage of astroviruses was the BHK-21 (C13) cell line for astrovirus serotype 2. Seventeen human stool specimens that had previously been shown to be astrovirus positive by ELISA were cultured in Caco-2, T84, HT-29, SK-CO-1, PLC/PRF/5, MA-104, and VERO cells. Caco-2 cells (13 isolates), T84 cells (12 isolates) and PLC/PRF/5 cells (12 isolates) were the cell lines most effective for isolation of human astroviruses from clinical stool specimens. By immunofluorescent staining of infected cells, culturing of the same 17 specimens in shell vials for 18 h was positive for astroviruses in all 17 specimens in Caco-2 cells, 12 in T84 cells, and 7 in PLC/PRF/5 cells. Shell vial assay is suitable as a rapid and sensitive culture technique for detection of astroviruses in clinical specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercopithecus aethiops 3aHuman astrovirus 3aMacaca mulatta 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3akidney cells 3akidneys 3aserotypes 2aAnimals 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aCell Line 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aFecesxvirology 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aHT29 Cells 2aHaplorhini 2aHumans 2aMamastrovirusxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aTime Factors 2aVero Cells1 aBlacklow, N.

Thermal decomposition of the prepared oxalates has been studied experimentally using differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) and the decomposition products were characterized. Topological properties of electron density, bond orders, bond length and bond angle calculations were carried out in the light of the thermal decomposition pathway characteristic for these compounds with the help of density functional theory using LanL2DZ as basis set. All the computational studies were made using Gaussian09W simulation package. The obtained results shed some additional light on the origins of the complex pathway observed during the thermal decomposition process. Global reactive descriptors like vertical ionization potential, vertical electron affinity, electronegativity, electrophilicity, softness, hardness, etc., are calculated in order to analyze the extent of reactivity of the molecules considered. The obtained results from the experiments, support the conclusion that during the thermal decomposition process, copper oxalate decompose to Cu, Cu2O/CuO nanoparticles and CO/CO2, where as the silver oxalate decompose to Ag metal and CO2, the silver metal on exposure to air is transformed to Ag2O, which are in agreement with the theoretical analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3acalorimetry 3acarbon dioxide 3acopper 3ahardness 3aionization 3ananoparticles 3aoxalates 3apyrolysis 3asilver 3athermogravimetry 3atopology 0aBond order 0aBond length 0aBond angle 0aElectron density topology 0aThermal decomposition of copper and silver oxalates1 aVijisha, K.R.1 aMuraḷīdharan, Ke.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2984-11400 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2016 July, v. 120 p.207-214dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2016.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001400162245006900176300001600245520102700261592002801288650000801316650004301324650001501367650002301382650001001405650001101415650001201426650002501438650001501463650001001478700001701488700001901505700001701524700002401541700001701565700001401582773010901596856004401705852000901749655001201758IND50074565820221122064201.0140408e199803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007456582DNAL7 a247108742pmid7 a10.1007/s0012200507512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, L.-J.12aA simple PCR-based method for scoring the ph1b deletion in wheat  ap. 371-375.  aThe amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to isolate DNA sequences present in the euploid wheat Chinese Spring but not in the Chinese Spring ph1b mutant (which has a deletion of the Ph1 gene, a suppressor of homoeologous chromosome pairing). The polymorphic DNA fragments identified by AFLP were then cloned, sequenced, and used to design two primer pairs. These primers were used in a PCR-based assay to specifically amplify products from the Chinese Spring euploid but not from the ph1b mutant. This PCR assay can be carried out from extracted genomic DNA or directly from alkaline-treated wheat leaves, and the reaction products can be scored on a plus-minus basis, making the screening amenable to automation. The reliability of the assay was tested using a F₁-derived doubled-haploid population of 55 lines which segregate for the ph1b deletion. This PCR-screening technique is less time and labour consuming, and more accurate and reliable, than cytologically based conventional methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aautomation 3achromosome pairing 3agenes 3aleaves 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3apolyploidy 3awheat1 aFoote, T.

IL-21 binds with its cognate receptor complex, which consists of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma chain. We identified a novel IL-21R-binding molecule, WSB-1, which contains WD-40 repeats and a SOCS-box domain. WSB-1 associates with the middle part of intracytoplasmic region of IL-21R and enhances the maturation of IL-21R from N-linked glycosylated form to fully glycosylated mature form. Furthermore, WSB-1 moderates IL-21R degradation. Taken together, our present study suggests that WSB-1 has a role in the tuning of the maturation and degradation of IL-21R.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytokines 3aglycosylation1 aOnoda, Tadashi1 aRahman, Mizanur1 aAraki, Akemi1 aJuliana, Farha Matin1 aTanaka, Nobuyuki1 aAsao, Hironobu0 tCellular immunology.g2011, v. 269, no. 1 p.54-59dElsevier Inc.x0008-87497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.03.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012300174300001600297520108500313536015301398592002801551650001901579650002201598650001501620650001601635650001601651650001601667650001301683653002501696653002101721653003001742653000901772653001601781653001701797653003101814653003701845653001701882653002101899700002401920700002801944773010901972856008602081852000902167655001202176IND60781163420221119130317.0220624e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078116342DNAL7 a10.1080/01426397.2022.20391092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIoannidis, Romanos10aLandscape design in infrastructure projects - is it an extravagance? A cost-benefit investigation of practices in dams  ap. 370-387.  aLandscape design of major civil infrastructure works has often been undermined as a policy requirement or been neglected in practice. We investigate whether this is justified by technical challenges, high costs or proven lack of utility of landscape design of infrastructure, focussing on dam-design practice. Initially, we investigate global practice and identify 56 cases of dams in which landscape or architectural treatment has been applied. We then create a typology of utilised design techniques and investigate their contribution to improving landscape quality perception through literature review and through the analysis of photograph upload densities in geotagged photography databases. Finally, we investigate costs of landscape works, analysing three dam projects in detail. The results demonstrate that landscape design of civil infrastructure (a) improves landscape quality perception of infrastructures’ landscapes and (b) that its implementation can be both economically and technically feasible, especially if existing knowledge from best practices is utilised.  aRI was supported by the Eugenides Foundation through its Scholarships Program for Doctorate Research in the National Technical University of Athens.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3aphotographs 3aphotography 3aresearch 0aCivil infrastructure 0alandscape design 0awater-blue infrastructure 0adams 0afeasibility 0aproject cost 0alandscape value perception 0ageotagged photography data bases 0aGoogle Earth 0alandscape policy1 aSargentis, G.-Fivos1 aKoutsoyiannis, Demetris0 tLandscape research.g2022 Apr. 3, v. 47, no. 3 p.370-387dRoutledgewJournal:J000000120x1469-97107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2022.20391093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03844naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003100132040001800163100001700181245009500198300001800293506017300311520202900484650002302513650001302536650001902549650002002568650001402588650001602602650002402618650001202642650001002654650001202664650003702676650001402713650001502727650001102742651000902753700001702762700001902779700001302798700001902811773010602830856011202936856007703048956019503125961000903320852000903329655001203338IND60006280420221214225555.0160713e20150724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000628042DNAL7 a3159542aris7 a10113/628042hdl7 a10.2527/jas.2015-91012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelch, K.

A considerable amount of research has been conducted over the years in both field and pen settings. The results of these research efforts have significantly increased our understanding of the poisoning of cattle by larkspurs. However, most of the pen studies conducted thus far have used a dosing regimen of a single bolus dose, which does not accurately mimic the manner by which cattle are poisoned by larkspur while grazing. Consequently, the objective of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of tall larkspur (Delphinium barbeyi collected near Manti, UT) when administered in multiple doses, with the intent to identify a no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL). The adverse effect selected for this study was muscle weakness to the point the cattle could no longer remain ambulatory as would be required in a grazing environment, thus becoming sternally recumbent when exercised. Hereford steers were administered various doses of tall larkspur at 12-h intervals for 4 d or until they showed marked signs of muscle weakness. The results suggest that a dose of 2 mg kg(-1)∙d(-1) N-(methylsuccinimido) anthranoyllycoctonine (MSAL)–type alkaloids is the NOAEL for a tall larkspur population with a norditerpenoid alkaloid profile containing 4 mg MSAL-type alkaloids/g plant material and 12 mg non-MSAL-type alkaloids/g plant material. Additionally, a computer model was generated to simulate multiple-dosing regimens at the various doses as well as different dosing regimens. The results from this study suggest that a 500-kg steer can consume a daily dose of 1.25 kg of fresh tall larkspur (with a similar alkaloid profile) without becoming severely poisoned (suffering from muscle weakness to the point of recumbency). Additionally, these results indicate that a serum concentration of approximately 355 ng methyllycaconitine/mL may represent a toxic threshold. 3aDelphinium barbeyi 3aHereford 3aacute toxicity 3aadverse effects 3aalkaloids 3ablood serum 3acomputer simulation 3agrazing 3ahills 3amuscles 3ano observed adverse effect level 3apoisoning 3arangelands 3asteers 3aUtah1 aGreen, B.

Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is considered to be not an innate pathogen to Bombyx mori, but some silkworm strains have been identified to be permissive to AcMNPV, indicating the positive or negative involvement of certain host factors in baculovirus replications in vivo. To provide a fundamental knowledge of this process, we performed large-scale screening to investigate the responses of 448 silkworm strains against recombinant AcMNPV inoculation. By genetic analysis between permissive and resistant strains identified, we further confirmed that a potential corresponding locus on chromosome 3 regulates host responses to AcMNPV in silkworm. Additionally, we found that it is available for AcMNPV–silkworm baculovirus expression vector system to produce proteins of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aBombyx mori 3aloci 3apathogens 3aproteins 3ascreening 3asilkworms 2aAnimals 2aBombyxxgeneticsxvirology. 2aGenes, Insect 2aGenetic Loci 2aGenetic Testing 2aNucleopolyhedrovirusesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aVirus Replication1 aKusakabe, Takahiro1 aYamamoto, Kimiko1 aSuetsugu, Yoshitaka1 aMon, Hiroaki1 aLi, Zhiqing1 aZhu, Li1 aIiyama, Kazuhiro1 aBanno, Yutaka1 aYoshimura, Kaito1 aLee, Jae Man0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Apr., v. 98, no. 7 p.3049-3058dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5437-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009500161300001600256520244400272592002802716650001602744650001802760650001402778650001002792650002002802650002002822650001302842650003802855650001002893650001602903650001802919650001602937650001002953650001602963650001802979650000902997650003003006650002303036650001203059700001703071700002103088700001803109773014003127856008203267852000903349655001203358IND60627253020221119133202.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062725302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-018-3182-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayer, W.10aQuantification of the allergen soy (Glycine max) in food using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)  ap. 499-509.  aTo meet the increasing need for quantification of allergens and to have an alternative to commercially available ELISA and PCR systems, the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety started establishing in-house PCR systems. To obtain low limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), target sequences are preferably sought in multicopy genomes like mitochondrial- or chloroplast DNA. These molecules are of high but varying abundance even among tissues of the same organism. Beyond that, DNA might be degraded by processes of food manufacturing which additionally affects their quantification. Therefore, a reliable correlation of the allergen portion in a sample and its chloroplast-DNA concentration cannot be preassumed. This incoherence is not further considered (e.g., by a matrix-related reference material), and therefore, our quantitative results can only be understood as the mass of soy which maintained its biochemical activity, related to the soy content of the reference material used. To convert absolute results expressed in copies per microliter (Cp/µL) as obtained by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) into a unit of mass fraction (e.g., milligram per kilogram), a conversion function is generated by the measurement of a reference material in the same run. For the specific detection and quantification of the allergenic ingredient soy (Glycine max) in food a primer/probe system has been developed which amplifies a 140 bp product of the ndhH gene of the chloroplast DNA. It is specific for soy and does not react with even closely related plant species. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) was selected for quantification for its particular advantages and the method has been validated in-house. It was found to be applicable to various matrices including meat products, flour, milk, and fatty creams, with recovery rates between 60 and 100%. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification (LOQ) are 0.16 mg/kg and 0.60 mg/kg, respectively. Repeated analysis of analyte-free food matrices spiked with reference material provided acceptable values for precision: The relative standard deviation (RSDₒᵥₑᵣₐₗₗ) of the whole method (including DNA extraction) is below 25%. The recovery of pure soy material (pulverized beans) was between 112.5 and 135.0%. The presented method is shown to be reliable and accurate, provided that samples and reference material are extracted and amplified in the same way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3abeans 3achloroplast DNA 3adetection limit 3adroplets 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflour 3afood matrix 3afood research 3afood safety 3agenes 3aingredients 3ameat products 3amilk 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astandard deviation 3atissues1 aSchuller, M.1 aViehauser, M.

Determination of critical temperature for sterility breakdown in wild abortive cytoplasmic male sterile (WA-CMS) lines under field condition is essential for efficient seed production planning. CMS lines IR58025A and IR68897A were grown at different dates of sowing to give exposure to a series of temperature regime and day length at natural field condition. At panicle initiation stages, temperatures below 28.5 °C, the CMS lines were sterile and at temperatures below 30 °C, the lines became partially sterile. Above 30 °C, the CMS line reverted to fertile. The highest pollen sterility was recorded (98.3%) during the long day condition while the lowest was recorded (43.5%) during the short day condition indicating the effect of both temperature and day-length on break down of sterility. Differential expression of floral characters like panicle exertion and stigma was found with variation in temperature. This simple field-driven technique can be successfully employed to work out the functional temperature for fertility reversibility which is of utmost importance for planning seed production and maintenance of genetic purity of the hybrids. The technique will aid in designing seed production planning for hybrid rice locally in any rice-growing area of the world in the present scenario of restrictions in export and import of agricultural commodities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3aexports 3afloral characteristics 3agene expression regulation 3ahybrids 3aimports 3apanicles 3aphotoperiod 3aplanning 3aplant physiology 3apollen 3apurity 3arice 3astigma 3atemperature1 aDeka, Sharmila Dutta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2145-36021 aSarma, Debojit1 aGogoi, Smrita0 tPlant Physiology Reports.g2020 Dec., v. 25, no. 4 p.689-696dSpringer IndiawJournal:27098x2662-253X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40502-020-00556-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245010900205300001600314500002000330520214400350592002802494650002002522650001302542650003202555650001502587650002302602650001702625650002602642650000902668650002302677650001802700650002202718650001002740650001602750650001502766650001802781650001602799650001802815650002302833650002202856700005602878773012302934856007903057852000903136655001203145IND60631678420221120095237.0190312e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063167842DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.144452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzdemir, Fatma,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4804-936X10aMolecular Characterization and Toxin Profiles of Bacillus spp. Isolated from Retail Fish and Ground Beef  ap. 548-556.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBacillus species are common in the environment due to their spore‐forming ability and nutritional versatility and cause food contamination. Bacilli play a significant role in foodborne illnesses and food spoilage. In this study, 52 Bacillus isolates from retail fish and ground beef were identified and differentiated based on 16S rRNA, gyrB, and rpoB gene sequencing. The presence of genes encoding emetic toxin (ces), hemolytic enterotoxin hemolysin BL (hbl), nonhemolytic enterotoxin (nhe) and cytotoxin K (cytK1) was assessed in all Bacillus isolates. The ability of the Bacillus isolates to produce several extracellular enzymes that contribute to pathogenicity and food spoilage was investigated. The 16S rRNA, rpoB, and gyrB gene sequence similarities of the Bacillus isolates tested were 96.1%, 83.2%, and 77.5%, respectively. The gyrB gene demonstrated a higher degree of sequence variation than the 16S rRNA and rpoB genes. The prevalence of Bacillus isolates producing at least two of the genes of the HBL and NHE complexes was 23.1% and 15.4%, respectively. Of the B. cereus isolates, 10 (41.7%) possessed two or more enterotoxin genes. None of the isolates carried the ces and cytK1 genes. All isolates were positive for the production of enzymes such as protease, lipase, gelatinase, and DNase. However, only 92.3% of the tested isolates were positive for amylase. In conclusion, our results revealed that the presence of genes involved in toxin production and enzyme production in meat‐originated B. cereus and other Bacillus isolates may cause spoilage of food and pose a health risk for consumers. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Bacillus species can be found in various foods due to their ubiquitous nature. Bacillus spp., especially B. cereus, are associated with food poisoning and other infections in humans. Toxins and many extracellular enzymes produced by Bacillus spp. are the causative agents of foodborne outbreaks, food spoilage, and low‐quality food with significantly reduced edibility. This study highlights the characterization of Bacillus spp. and presence of potentially pathogenic Bacillus species in meats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aamylases 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acytotoxins 3adeoxyribonucleases 3aenterotoxins 3aextracellular enzymes 3afish 3afood contamination 3afood spoilage 3afoodborne illness 3agenes 3aground beef 3ahemolysins 3apathogenicity 3aproteinases 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence diversity 3asequence homology1 aArslan, Seza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2478-68750 tJournal of food science.g2019 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.548-556dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.144453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009800165300001600263500001400279500001100293520131200304592002801616650001901644650001701663650001901680650001001699650001201709650002801721650000901749650001701758650001601775650001101791650001201802650001701814650002801831650001301859650002101872650001101893700001801904773011301922856008202035852000902117655001202126IND60720797120221119165736.0201220e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072079712DNAL7 a10.1007/s40502-020-00553-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSita, Kumari10aRole of Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) against abiotic stress tolerance in legumes: a review  ap. 654-663.  aNAL-light  aReview  aLegumes are well known for their nutritional and health benefits as well as for their impact in the sustainability of agricultural systems. Under current scenarios threatened by climate change highlights the necessity for concerted research approaches in order to develop crops that are able to cope up with environmental challenges. Various abiotic stresses such as cold, heat, drought, salt, and heavy metal induce a variety of negative effects in plant growth, development and significantly decline yield and quality. Plant growth regulators or natural products of plants are reported to be effective to improve plant tolerance to several abiotic stresses. Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) is a non-protein amino acid involved in various metabolic processes, and partially protects plants from abiotic stress. GABA appears to impart partial protection to various abiotic stresses in most plants by increasing leaf turgor, increased osmolytes and reduced oxidative damage by stimulation of antioxidants. We have compiled various scientific reports on the role and mechanism of GABA in plants against coping with various environmental stresses. We have also described the emerging information about the metabolic and signaling roles of GABA which is being used to improve legume crop against abiotic stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidants 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adrought 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aheat 3aheavy metals 3ainformation 3aleaves 3alegumes 3aplant growth 3aplant growth substances 3aresearch 3astress tolerance 3aturgor1 aKumar, Vaneet0 tPlant Physiology Reports.g2020 Dec., v. 25, no. 4 p.654-663dSpringer IndiawJournal:27098x2662-253X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40502-020-00553-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005100144245019900195300002000394520166500414592002802079650001302107650001602120650002102136650001902157650001002176650002602186650001902212650001502231650001502246653002202261653002002283653002702303653002302330653001702353653001902370653002402389700001602413700002002429700001302449700001702462700002202479700001702501700001502518700001402533700001502547700002102562700002202583700002102605700001202626773014202638856007802780852000902858655001202867IND60598296320180803000000.0180629e20180606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059829632DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b054072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5166-039710aMicrodevice Platform for Continuous Measurement of Contractility, Beating Rate, and Beating Rhythm of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Cardiomyocytes inside a Controlled Incubator Environment  ap. 21173-21183.  aThe heart completes a complex set of tasks, including the initiation or propagation of an electrical signal with regularity (proper heart rate and rhythm) and generating sufficient force of contraction (contractility). Probing mechanisms of heart diseases and quantifying drug efficacies demand a platform that is capable of continuous operation inside a cell incubator for long-term measurement of cardiomyocyte (CM) monolayers. Here, we report a microdevice array that is capable of performing continuous, long-term (14 days) measurement of contractility, beating rate, and beating rhythm in a monolayer of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-CMs (hiPSC-CMs). The device consists of a deformable membrane with embedded carbon nanotube (CNT)-based strain sensors. Contraction of the hiPSC-CMs seeded on the membrane induces electrical resistance change of the CNT strain sensor. Continuously reading the sensor signals revealed that hiPSC-CMs started to beat from day 2 and plateaued on day 5. Average contractile stress generated by a monolayer of hiPSC-CMs was determined to be 2.34 ± 0.041 kPa with a beating rate of 1.17 ± 0.068 Hz. The device arrays were also used to perform comprehensive measurement of the beating rate, rhythm, and contractility of the hiPSC-CMs and quantify the cell responses to different concentrations of agonists and antagonists, which altered the average contractile stress to the range of 1.15 ± 0.13 to 3.96 ± 0.53 kPa. The continuous measurement capability of the device arrays also enabled the generation of Poincaré plots for revealing subtle changes in the beating rhythm of hiPSC-CMs under different drug treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3acarbon nanotubes 3acardiomyocytes 3adrugs 3aelectrical resistance 3aheart diseases 3aheart rate 3astem cells 0amicrodevice array 0acarbon nanotube 0acontinuous measurement 0acontractile stress 0abeating rate 0abeating rhythm 0ahiPS-cardiomyocytes1 aDou, Wenkun1 aMalhi, Manpreet1 aZhu, Min1 aLiu, Haijiao1 aPlakhotnik, Julia1 aXu, Zhensong1 aZhao, Qili1 aChen, Jun1 aChen, Siyu1 aHamilton, Robert1 aSimmons, Craig A.1 aMaynes, Jason T.1 aSun, Yu0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 June 06, v. 10, no. 25 p.21173-21183dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b054073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001600189245012400205300001600329506007600345520082600421592002801247506003701275650001101312650002201323650001201345650000901357650002601366653002201392653001201414653002001426653001601446653000901462653002501471700006301496700002501559700002401584700006101608773014601669856008301815852000901898655001201907IND60628050320221207085008.0190725e20180607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062805032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.1252doi7 aPMC59562782pmcid7 a296785712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Bangfu14aThe transcription factor MEF2A plays a key role in the differentiation/maturation of rat neural stem cells into neurons  ap. 645-649.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing multipotent stem cells that can be proliferated in vitro and differentiated into neuronal and/or glial lineages, making them an ideal model to study the processes involved in neuronal differentiation. Here we have used NSCs to investigate the role of the transcription factor MEF2A in neuronal differentiation and development in vitro. We show that although MEF2A is present in undifferentiated NSCs, following differentiation it is expressed at significantly higher levels in a subset of neuronal compared to non-neuronal cells. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of MEF2A reduces the number of NSC-derived neurons compared to non-neuronal cells after differentiation. Together, these data indicate that MEF2A participates in neuronal differentiation/maturation from NSCs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amodels 3aneural stem cells 3aneurons 3arats 3atranscription factors 0aNeural stem cells 0aNeurons 0aDifferentiation 0aDevelopment 0aMEF2 0aTranscription factor1 aCarmichael, Ruth E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2665-29661 aSolabre Valois, Luis1 aWilkinson, Kevin A.1 aHenley, Jeremy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3589-83350 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 June 07, v. 500, no. 3 p.645-649dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012200206300001600328500001400344500001100358520177100369592002802140596004602168650001602214650001802230650001302248650001202261650001102273650001602284650001602300650001102316650000902327650001602336650001402352650001402366650002102380650002802401650001302429650001302442650002002455650002502475650001702500700006102517700002002578700005902598700002302657700006702680773011302747856008202860852000902942655001202951IND60720797320221119165655.0201220e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072079732DNAL7 a10.1007/s40502-020-00538-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstmeyer, Troy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3793-729X10aImpacts of heat, drought, and their interaction with nutrients on physiology, grain yield, and quality in field crops  ap. 549-568.  aNAL-light  aReview  aAmong different abiotic stresses that negatively affect crop productivity, heat and drought stresses are the most common and their combined stress is highly prevalent under field conditions. Significant research progress has been achieved on heat or drought stress responses in crops, and, more recently, combined heat and drought stress is receiving additional emphasis. Knowledge generated either through controlled environmental chambers or field-based facilities on heat and drought impacts on field crops captures a part of the complex phenomenon. An additional dimension to this interaction and the ability of the plants to respond to and mitigate these stresses depends on their ability to take up and efficiently utilize micro- and macro-nutrients. Improved nutrient use enhances the tolerance potential of the plant through production of essential compounds such as amino acids and carbohydrates. These, in turn, provide energy required to synthesize stress ameliorating compounds such as reactive oxygen species scavengers, including superoxide dismutase and catalase, and balanced hormonal production, which have the potential to reduce or minimize the damage. The review focuses on information generated from controlled environments and field conditions that synthesizes the interactions between heat and nutrients or drought and nutrients in cereals and soybean. The major objective is to highlight if different types of nutrients applied as additional treatment factors either ameliorate or aggravate the impact of these abiotic stress combinations on physiological parameters, grain yield, and quality. In addition, knowledge gaps in addressing these interactions are identified, and directions for future research to help bridge these gaps are given.  aPublisher supplied data  a1736192cNational Science Foundation, USA 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrates 3acatalase 3adrought 3aenergy 3afield crops 3agrain yield 3agrains 3aheat 3ainformation 3aknowledge 3anutrients 3aplant physiology 3areactive oxygen species 3aresearch 3asoybeans 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater stress1 aParker, Nathaniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4821-11791 aJaenisch, Brent1 aAlkotami, Linah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6810-73121 aBustamante, Carlos1 aJagadish, S.

Shoot meristems are responsible for all the post-embryonic aerial organs. Despite the central importance of stem cells in plant growth and development, the molecular signatures associated with them have not been revealed in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this article, we report a rice putative translation initiation factor SUI1 gene, OsSUI1, whose expression was mainly detected in different meristem regions and was upregulated by cold and drought stresses. The activity of the promoter of OsSUI1 was examined by GUS reporter gene technology in stably transformed rice plants. GUS activity was found to be tissue and development-specific being detected in roots, buds, and internode of seedlings, in the veins and midrib of young leaves, as well as in late developing anthers, stigmas, and developing endosperms. Overexpression of OsSUI1 in transgenic rice resulted in an increase in the number of floral organs, including the stamen, carpel, palea/lemma, and stigma. In addition, the overexpression of OsSUI1 increased the transcriptional activities of the type A RR genes OsRR1, OsRR4, and OsRR8 and reduced the expression of OsRR2 and OsRR6, OsRR7. Our data suggest that OsSUI1 may play a critical role in rice floral organ development by affecting cell proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aanthers 3abuds 3acell proliferation 3aendosperm 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3areporter genes 3arice 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoot meristems 3astem cells 3astigma 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 3atranslation (genetics)1 aLi, Li1 aLi, Yixing1 aWang, Tiankang1 aFu, Xi-Qin,0 tMolecular breeding.g2018 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.4-4dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-017-0757-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245004800176300001400224520090900238592002801147650001701175650003901192650002301231650003001254650001501284650002101299653001601320653001601336653001701352653001701369653002701386653001601413653001001429700002601439700002101465700002401486700002801510773011601538856008801654852000901742655001201751IND60552631220221119133217.0180830e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055263122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Dam, Annemieke10aOn the autofluorescence of aged fingermarks  ap. 19-25.  aFingermark autofluorescence changes with time, both spectrally and in total intensity. In this study we investigate which components in the aged fingermarks cause this change in autofluorescent signal. Thin layer chromatography combined with fluorescence spectroscopy was used to identify fluorescent aging products. Based on our results, tryptophan derivatives, including indoleacetic acid, (nor)harman and xanthurenic acid are indicated as important contributors to the autofluorescence of aged fingermarks. Knowledge about which fluorescent aging products are present in fingermarks might be useful in the development of fingermark age estimation methods. This work is part of a larger project of which the major goal is to develop a method to estimate the time of deposition of fingermarks. Additionally, by selective targeting of aging products the development of aged fingermarks might be improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aindole acetic acid 3athin layer chromatography 3atryptophan 3axanthurenic acid 0aFingermarks 0aFingerprint 0aFluorescence 0aLuminescence 0aTryptophan derivatives 0aComposition 0aAging1 aAalders, Maurice C.G.1 aTodorovski, Toni1 avan Leeuwen, Ton G.1 aLambrechts, Saskia A.G.0 tForensic science international.g2016 Jan., v. 258 p.19-25dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010000164300001200264520058000276592002800856650002500884650001300909650001500922650001600937650002000953650001000973650002500983650001501008650000901023650001901032650001901051650002801070651001001098653003601108653003101144653003601175700001401211700001701225700001701242773009001259856008501349852000901434655001201443IND60552128920221121221122.0161020e20151010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055212892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.06.4212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Bing10aComplete genome sequence of the petroleum-emulsifying bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri SLG510A3-8  ap. 1-2.  aPseudomonas stutzeri SLG510A3-8, isolated from oil-contaminated soil in Shengli Oilfield, China, has the potential to be applied for microbial enhanced oil recovery.

Many of the subsequent measurements have been reexamined and found not to support the existence of a long-range hydrophobic force. The principal difficulty was that hydrophobic solids frequently experience other forces, which obscured or were mistaken for a hydrophobic force. In this paper, we review the surviving evidence for a long-range hydrophobic force and find that there is only supporting evidence in a total of two papers, one old and one new, where net attractive forces were measured at separations greater than about 5–6nm. Thus the evidence is scarce. In contrast there are new experiments showing no such force, thereby arguing against the universality of a measureable hydrophobic force beyond about 6nm. Since solvent water is common to the experiments, such evidence makes it difficult to describe a universal mechanism for a long-ranged hydrophobic force based on water structure. There are also new measurements that are consistent with a hydrophobic force with a decay length in the range 0.3–1.0nm. In particular, attractive forces have been measured on small radius surfaces (8–50nm) consistent with a hydrophobic force with a decay length of 0.5–0.6nm, and a variety of net repulsive measurements are consistent with an attractive hydrophobic force that has a decay length of 0.3–1.0nm. We also discuss some new measurements, which are consistent with cavitation, and not a surface force that acts at a distance.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrophobicity 3aresearch methods 3asolids 3asolvents 3awater 0aPlease note that this is a submission for the special issue on “Weak Self-Assembly”1 aMastropietro, Dean1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4052-38370 tCurrent opinion in colloid & interface science.g2016 Apr., v. 22 p.51-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:12032x1359-02947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2016.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012900171300001800300520142500318536016601743592002801909596001401937650003001951650002301981650001602004650001702020650000902037650002002046650002102066650001102087650001402098650002002112650001702132650001402149650001302163650001502176650001302191653001902204653001702223653002402240653002002264653002002284653002202304700001802326700002902344700002102373773014602394856008602540852000902626655001202635IND60781164120221119130411.0220820e20220623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078116412DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2021.18771082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Michelle M.10aMicrobial biopreservatives for controlling the spoilage of beef and lamb meat: their application and effects on meat quality  ap. 4571-4592.  aBiopreservation is a recognized natural method for controlling the growth of undesirable bacteria on fresh meat. It offers the potential to inhibit spoilage bacteria and extend meat shelf-life, but this aspect has been much less studied compared to using the approach to target pathogenic bacteria. This review provides comprehensive information on the application of biopreservatives of microbial origin, mainly bacteriocins and protective cultures, in relation to bacterial spoilage of beef and lamb meat. The sensory effect of these biopreservatives, an aspect that often receives less attention in microbiological studies, is also reviewed. Microbial biopreservatives were found to be able to retard the growth of the major meat spoilage bacteria, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Pseudomonas spp., and Enterobacteriaceae. Their addition did not have any discernible negative impact on the sensory properties of meat, whether assessed by human sensory panels or instrumental and chemical analyses. Although results are promising, the concept of biopreservation for controlling spoilage bacteria on fresh meat is still in its infancy. Studies in this area are still lacking, especially for lamb. Biopreservatives need more testing under conditions representative of commercial meat production, along with studies of any possible sensory effects, in order to validate their potential for large-scale industrial applications.  aThis work was supported by the Australian Meat Processor Corporation under Grant (2016-1438) and the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016-1438 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aPseudomonas 3abacteriocins 3abeef 3abiopreservation 3abiopreservatives 3ahumans 3alamb meat 3ameat production 3ameat quality 3anutrition 3araw meat 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 0aAntimicrobials 0abacteriocins 0aprotective cultures 0asensory effects 0ameat shelf-life 0aspoilage bacteria1 aKaur, Mandeep1 aPillidge, Christopher J.1 aTorley, Peter J.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 June 23, v. 62, no. 17 p.4571-4592dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.18771083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245014900165300001600314520132600330592002801656650001201684650002101696650002101717650001301738650002001751650001701771650002601788650001201814650001601826650002201842653000901864653001801873653002601891653001601917653002101933700001501954700001501969700001501984773010801999856008602107852000902193655001202202IND60553029920221120110644.0170607e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055302992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.03.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, H.C.10aEffect of ZrO2 additions on the crystallization, mechanical and biological properties of MgO–CaO–SiO2–P2O5–CaF2 bioactive glass-ceramics  ap. 226-233.  aA series of ZrO2 doped MgO–CaO–SiO2–P2O5–CaF2 bioactive glass-ceramics were obtained by sintering method. The crystallization behavior, phase composition, morphology and structure of glass-ceramics were characterized. The bending strength, elastic modulus, fracture toughness, micro-hardness and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of glass-ceramics were investigated. The in vitro bioactivity and cytotoxicity tests were used to evaluate the bioactivity and biocompatibility of glass-ceramics. The sedimentation mechanism and growth process of apatites on sample surface were discussed. The results showed that the mainly crystalline phases of glass-ceramics were Ca5(PO4)3F (fluorapatite) and β-CaSiO3 (β-wollastonite). m-ZrO2 (monoclinic zirconia) declined the crystallization temperatures of glasses. t-ZrO2 (tetragonal zirconia) increased the crystallization temperature of Ca5(PO4)3F and declined the crystallization temperature of β-CaSiO3. t-ZrO2 greatly increased the fracture toughness, bending strength and micro-hardness of glass-ceramics. The nanometer apatites were induced on the surface of glass-ceramic after soaking 28 days in SBF (simulated body fluid), indicating the glass-ceramic has good bioactivity. The in vitro cytotoxicity test demonstrated the glass-ceramic has no toxicity to cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3abending strength 3abiocompatibility 3acolloids 3acrystallization 3acytotoxicity 3amodulus of elasticity 3asoaking 3atemperature 3athermal expansion 0aZrO2 0aGlass-ceramic 0aMechanical properties 0aBioactivity 0aBiocompatibility1 aWang, D.G.1 aMeng, X.G.1 aChen, C.Z.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 June 01, v. 118 p.226-233dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.03.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245021600131300001600347520167500363592002802038650001302066650001002079650001002089650002002099650001302119650002802132650001402160650001802174650001702192650002202209650001402231650001902245650002502264650001102289650001402300650001302314650002002327650001602347651001402363651001102377653001402388653002202402653002402424653001602448700002802464773012002492852000902612655001202621IND60597732520221119015240.0180625e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059773252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiranda, Ivana10aPorcelain crabs of the genera Pachycheles Stimpson and Neopisosoma Haig (Decapoda : Anomura : Porcellanidae): new premises based on molecular data and comments on phylogenetic relationships in the family  ap. 509-520.  aPorcellanidae Haworth, 1825 is a family of marine anomuran crabs distributed throughout tropical and temperate regions of all the oceans, typically littoral and sublittoral waters, with a considerable diversity of lifestyles, habitats and colouration. Pachycheles Stimpson, 1858 and Neopisosoma Haig, 1960 share, among other morphological characteristics, the fragmentation of the lateral carapace walls. The morphology of this body region was key to supporting the establishment of Neopisosoma, which increased uncertainty about the taxonomic status of these genera due to the high intraspecific variation of this character. Our study reconstructs the phylogenetic relationship between Pachycheles and Neopisosoma based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences to evaluate whether these are valid taxa. While Pachycheles seems to be monophyletic, the position of Neopisosoma mexicanum (Streets, 1871) indicates that the group is polyphyletic, and deserves further investigation. Pachycheles is revealed to be older than Neopisosoma, and likely originated in the Indo-Pacific, later spreading to the American continent during the early Tertiary. Neopisosoma may have arisen much later in the Caribbean Province before the closure of the Isthmus of Panama, explaining its distribution, which is restricted mainly to Central America. The inclusion of a considerable number of species from both genera represents a significant advance in the study of this controversial group. The phylogenetic reconstruction of Pachycheles unveiled clades corroborated by morphology, but also revealed unclear relationships, which may indicate the potential existence of cryptic species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDecapoda 3acolor 3acrabs 3acryptic species 3ahabitats 3aintraspecific variation 3alifestyle 3alittoral zone 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amonophyly 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aoceans 3apolyphyly 3ataxonomy 3atemperate zones 3auncertainty 3aCaribbean 3aPanama 0aCrustacea 0amitochondrial DNA 0amolecular taxonomic 0anuclear DNA1 aMantelatto, Fernando L.0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2016 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.509-520dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957319x1447-26007nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011100171300001800282520152600300592002801826650001501854650001801869650001801887650002801905650003201933650002501965650001601990650002702006650001702033650001702050650002802067650002502095650001702120650001402137650004302151650001402194650001202208650001302220650002702233653002302260653002302283653001202306653002002318653001702338653002502355700002102380700001802401700002102419773014602440856008602586852000902672655001202681IND60781164220221119130356.0220820e20220623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078116422DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2021.18771092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Brij Pal10aBioactive peptides in the management of lifestyle-related diseases: Current trends and future perspectives  ap. 4593-4606.  aLifestyle-related diseases constitute a major concern in the twenty-first century, with millions dying worldwide each year due to chosen lifestyles and associated complications such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Although synthetic drugs have been shown to be quite effective in the treatment of these conditions, safety of these compounds remains a concern. Natural alternatives to drugs include food-derived peptides are now being explored for the prevention and treatment of lifestyle-related complications. Peptides are fragments nascent in the primary protein sequences and could impart health benefits beyond basic nutritional advantages. Evidence suggests that by controlling adipocyte differentiation and lipase activities, bioactive peptides may be able to prevent obesity. Bioactive peptides act as agents against type 2 diabetes because of their ability to inhibit enzymatic activities of DPP-IV, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase. Moreover, bioactive peptides can act as competitive inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, thus eliciting an antihypertensive effect. Bioactive peptides may have a hypocholesterolemic effect by inhibiting cholesterol metabolism pathways and cholesterol synthesis. This review addresses current knowledge of the impact of food-derived bioactive peptides on lifestyle diseases. In addition, future insights on the clinical trials, allergenicity, cytotoxicity, gastrointestinal stability, and regulatory approvals have also been considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aallergenicity 3aalpha-amylase 3aantihypertensive effect 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acholesteremic effect 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3acytotoxicity 3afood science 3agastrointestinal system 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ahypertension 3alifestyle 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition 3aobesity 3apeptides 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 0aBioactive peptides 0alifestyle diseases 0aobesity 0aType-2 diabetes 0ahypertension 0ahypercholesterolemia1 aAluko, Rotimi E.1 aHati, Subrota1 aSolanki, Divyang0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 June 23, v. 62, no. 17 p.4593-4606dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.18771093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01467naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011000158300001800268520036100286592002800647650002300675650001100698650001300709650001300722650001400735700001200749700001500761700001400776700001800790700001700808700001700825700001600842700001900858773013300877856007401010852000901084655001201093IND60701243320221123024047.0200710e20200709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070124332DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc02722g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Xianxian10aBifunctional pyridoxal derivatives as efficient bioorthogonal reagents for biomacromolecule modifications  ap. 7601-7604.  aTwo types of pyridoxal analogs, azido pyridoxal (PL-N₃) and carboxyl pyridoxal (PL-COOH), were developed as novel bifunctional bioorthogonal molecules.

The technique uses perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as both a micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) reagent for separation of neutral explosives and as the complexation reagent for mass spectrometric detection of PFOA-explosive complexes in the negative ion mode. High explosives that formed complexes with PFOA included RDX, HMX, tetryl, and PETN. Some nitroaromatics were detected as molecular ions. Detection limits in the high parts per billion range and linear calibration responses over two orders of magnitude were obtained. For proof of concept, the technique was applied to the quantitative analysis of high explosives in sand samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aexplosives 3aforensic sciences 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3anitroaromatic compounds 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aquantitative analysis 3asand 0aHigh explosives 0aCE–MS 0aMEKC 0aPerfluorooctanoic acid complexation reagent 0aSand analysis1 aRollman, Christopher1 aCopper, Christine1 aGenzman, Ashton1 aRine, Jacqueline1 aLurie, Ira1 aMoini, Mehdi0 tForensic science international.g2016 Jan., v. 258 p.74-79dElsevier Ireland LtdaElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01395naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006800171300001600239520052600255592002800781650001200809650001500821650000900836650002100845650001900866651001000885773011900895856008201014852000901096655001201105IND60617081720221118004204.0181023e199307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061708172DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517593063007032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuhara, Mototada10aInnovation in Polyester Fibers: From Silk-Like to New Polyester  ap. 387-391.  aIn the past several years, "Shingosen," or new synthetic fibers have been developed in Japan.

Semen of seven male individuals was pooled in equal volumes and diluted with 4°C Tris‐Hcl (100 mM), pH = 8 extenders containing 0, 5, 10, 15 μM of AFP type III in a ratio of 1:1 (semen/extenders). Treated semen was dropped into liquid nitrogen. Solidified droplets were stored for 2, 60 and 120 days and thawed by plunging them into a tube containing 5 mL Tris‐Hcl (100 mM), pH=8 with 1% BSA at 37°C. Motility duration in all treatments had no significant difference comparing to fresh sperm (P > 0.05), but their motility percentage was significantly lower. Treatment with 10 μM of AFP had significantly higher motility percentage (16.11 ± 0.5%) comparing to other treatments (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between 0, 5, 15 μM of antifreeze protein treatments (P > 0.05), suggesting that antifreeze protein effectiveness are highly dose dependent, and dose of 10 μM is appropriate in Persian sturgeon spermatozoa droplet vitrification. Besides, the present technique obtained higher quality of spermatozoa comparing to its analogue techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser persicus 3aantifreeze proteins 3adose response 3adroplets 3afish 3amales 3anitrogen 3apH 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3avitrification1 aFarahmand, Hamid1 aMojazi‐Amiri, Bagher1 aRafiee, Gholamreza1 aRahimi, Ruhollah0 tAquaculture research.g2015 Oct., v. 46, no. 10 p.2392-2397dBlackwell Sciencex1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.123973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002600169245006300195300001200258520110100270592002801371650001501399650001001414650002201424650002901446650002901475650002001504650002501524650002001549650002401569650002601593651001101619653001001630653003101640653001001671653003701681653003401718700001801752700001701770700001401787700001801801700002301819773008501842856008401927852000902011655001202020IND60086736820221119114517.0160903e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673682DNAL7 a235013412pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Goethem, T.M.W.J.10aPlant Species Sensitivity Distributions for ozone exposure  ap. 1-6.  aThis study derived Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD), representing a cumulative stressor-response distribution based on single-species sensitivity data, for ozone exposure on natural vegetation. SSDs were constructed for three species groups, i.e. trees, annual grassland and perennial grassland species, using species-specific exposure–response data. The SSDs were applied in two ways. First, critical levels were calculated for each species group and compared to current critical levels for ozone exposure. Second, spatially explicit estimates of the potentially affected fraction of plant species in Northwestern Europe were calculated, based on ambient ozone concentrations. We found that the SSD-based critical levels were lower than for the current critical levels for ozone exposure, with conventional critical levels for ozone relating to 8–20% affected plant species. Our study shows that the SSD concept can be successfully applied to both derive critical ozone levels and estimate the potentially affected species fraction of plant communities along specific ozone gradients.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasslands 3aozone 3aplant communities 2aAir Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aOzonextoxicity 2aPlantsxdrug effects 2aRisk Assessment 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStress, Physiological 3aEurope 0aOzone 0aEcological risk assessment 0aAOT40 0aSpecies Sensitivity Distribution 0aPotentially affected fraction1 aAzevedo, L.B.1 avan Zelm, R.1 aHayes, F.1 aAshmore, M.R.1 aHuijbregts, M.A.J.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 July, v. 178 p.1-6dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245014500169300001600314520096600330592002801296650001101324650003301335650001901368651001001387700001701397700001601414700001801430700001701448700001301465773009601478856008701574852000901661655001201670IND60084096220221119081850.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008409622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Hong10aMagnetostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental records for a Late Cenozoic sedimentary sequence drilled from Lop Nor in the eastern Tarim Basin  ap. 113-122.  aThe Tarim Basin, one of the largest inland basins in the world, is situated in the northwestern China and to the north of the Tibetan Plateau. Continuous Cenozoic deposits have accumulated in this basin, which are crucial for investigating the growth of the Tibetan Plateau and the paleoclimatic evolution in Asian interior. Here we report the magnetostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental records for a Late Cenozoic sedimentary sequence drilled from Lop Nor in the eastern Tarim Basin. Magnetostratigraphic results show that this core has recorded a magnetic polarity sequence from C3Bn to C1n, covering an age range from ca. 7Ma to the present. Decreased magnetic susceptibility occurred after ca. 5.6–5.1Ma, which was interpreted to indicate an enhancement of aridity in the Tarim Basin since this period. We attribute this aridification to the combined effect of global climate cooling and the uplift of the Northern Tibetan Plateau since the late Miocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adry environmental conditions 3aglobal cooling 3aChina1 aAn, Zhisheng1 aLiu, Weiguo1 aQiang, Xiaoke1 aSong, Yougui1 aAo, Hong0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2012 Jan., v. 80-81 p.113-122dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006200137245008700199500002000286520107300306592002801379650001501407650002601422650001001448650001801458650001501476650001201491650001401503650001401517650001401531650002101545700002001566700002101586700001801607700005701625773011501682856007201797852000901869655001201878IND60790628520221121041449.0220826e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079062852DNAL7 a10.1002/vro2.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogler, Barbara R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8330-526910aLow occurrence of Salmonella spp. in wild birds from a Swiss rehabilitation centre  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Salmonella are bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae with a wide host range. Infection in birds causes subclinical disease to mass mortality events. Wild birds may act as healthy carriers posing a hazard to livestock and humans. The present study investigated the occurrence of Salmonella in wild birds admitted to a rehabilitation centre in order to assess the exposure of the staff to this zoonotic pathogen. METHODS: Faecal swabs of 552 avian patients (68 species) were collected over the course of 12 months. Each sample was propagated in enrichment broth and subsequently incubated on a RAPID'Salmonella plate. Salmonella isolates were serotyped, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed. RESULTS: Six Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and 1 S. Schleissheim were detected; all were pansusceptible to the antibiotics tested. CONCLUSION: Despite the low positive rate in the tested population, the authors recommend applying protective equipment and hygiene measures when handling wild birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aantibiotic resistance 3abirds 3aculture media 3ahost range 3ahygiene 3alivestock 3amortality 3apathogens 3asafety equipment1 aZurfluh, Katrin1 aMattmann, Prisca1 aSchmitt, Kira1 aAlbini, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9498-02430 tVeterinary record open.g2021 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.e17-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vro2.173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012000177300001600297500001500313520164100328592002801969650001501997650002802012650001902040650001902059650001802078650002202096650001402118650001202132650002402144650001002168650002402178650002102202650001102223650001702234651001102251653002202262653002702284653002302311653001702334653001502351700001602366700002202382700001802404773011602422856008502538852000902623655001202632IND60542605520221122005717.0190403e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054260552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuay-Picard, Alexandre10aPartial harvesting in boreal mixedwoods: A case for planned heterogeneity in industrial silvicultural prescriptions  ap. 291-302.  a2019-12-06  aIn large areas of the boreal mixedwoods of eastern Canada, conventional forestry practices dominated by large-scale clearcutting have led to an increase in early-successional trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands and a decrease in late-successional mixedwood stands. Partial harvesting provides an alternative practice that could promote a return to mixedwood composition with greater potential economic returns. Our objective was to identify the stand attributes that have an effect on trembling aspen regeneration following industrial harvest operations. Ninety plots were surveyed immediately before and five years after partial harvesting, to collect information on harvested trees (stumps), residual cover and pre- and post-harvesting regeneration. Using zero-inflated beta regression models, we found that the transition probabilities (projected relative abundance) of trembling aspen were positively influenced by an increase in removal percentage and by an increase in initial basal area of trembling aspen in the overstory. Abundant balsam fir advance growth had a strong negative influence on trembling aspen transition probabilities. This information could be incorporated into silvicultural prescription decision tools to suggest optimal local basal area removal targets that would limit the regeneration success of trembling aspen. Using these results, we propose a new approach that consists of deliberately introducing heterogeneity within partial cutting prescriptions in order to limit deciduous encroachment and to promote the recruitment of coniferous regeneration in eastern Canadian boreal mixedwoods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvesting 3asilvicultural practices 3aboreal forests 3aAbies balsamea 3amixed forests 3acosts and returns 3aoverstory 3acutting 3aregression analysis 3atrees 3aPopulus tremuloides 3astand basal area 3astumps 3aclearcutting 3aCanada 0aBoreal mixedwoods 0aDeciduous encroachment 0aPartial harvesting 0aRegeneration 0abasal area1 aAuty, David1 aMunson, Alison D.1 aAchim, Alexis0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 358 p.291-302dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011000167500001900277520182200296592002802118650002502146650002402171650001802195650001302213650001802226650002002244650002702264650001802291650001102309650001002320650002202330650001302352650001502365650002002380650002502400650002002425653001902445653002002464653002602484700001702510700001602527700001802543700001502561700001702576773010602593856008402699852000902783655001202792IND60736475220221119151441.0210610e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073647522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2021.1042582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shaohua10aProteomic analysis of liver tissues in chicken embryo at Day 16 and Day 20 reveals antioxidant mechanisms  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo investigate the mechanisms of the defense system and antioxidant defense system during chicken embryo development, protein profiling of liver tissues in chicken embryo at Day 16 and Day 20 was conducted. TMT was used to analyze the liver tissues proteomes with significantly different activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in chicken embryo. PRM was operated to validate the target differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) using the same samples. The result showed a total of 34 DAPs were identified. Among these, 9 were upregulated and 25 were downregulated. The screened DAPs strictly related to regulation of oxidoreductase activity (DDO and GAS2L1), response to stress (ERAD2 and SAA), immune system process (GAL3 and PDCD4), and lipid regulation and metabolism (ETNPPL, APOV1, LIPM, and APOA4). These analyses indicated that the antioxidant enzyme activity of chicken embryo is regulated through different pathways. Correlation analysis revealed a linear relationship between mRNA and protein expression and 12 genes (ORM1, C8B, KPNA2, CA4, C1S, SULT1B, ETNPPL, ERCC6L, DDO, SERPINF1, VAT1L, and APOA4) were detected to be differently expressed both at mRNA and protein levels. In consequence, these findings are an important resource that can be used in future studies of antioxidant mechanisms in chicken embryo.The genetic mechanisms of antioxidant activity are still unclear in chicken embryo. In the article, the combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis is used to further explore potential signaling pathways and differentially abundant proteins related to antioxidant activity. These findings will facilitate a better understanding of the mechanism and these DAPs can be further investigated as candidate markers to predict the activity of antioxidant enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3achick embryos 3achickens 3aembryogenesis 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aimmune system 3alipids 3aliver 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscriptomics 0aChicken embryo 0aTandem mass tag 0aAntioxidant mechanism1 aWei, Zhangqi1 aWu, Jianxin1 aSun, Miaomiao1 aMa, Yilong1 aLiu, Guoqing0 tJournal of proteomics.g2021 July 15, v. 243 p.104258-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2021.1042583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007700164300001800241520092400259592002801183650002201211650001301233650002601246650001701272650001901289650004401308650001201352650003301364650002001397650001201417650002101429700001801450700001401468700001501482773015401497856008101651852000901732655001201741IND60624223120221120043537.0181202e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062422312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-7182-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotdevin, A.10aSol-gel elaboration and characterization of YAG: Tb3+ powdered phosphors  ap. 2201-2209.  aPure and Tb³⁺-doped Y₃Al₅O₁₂ materials have been successfully synthesized from sol-gel based alkoxide precursors.

A lack of specific biomarkers hinders the early diagnosis and treatment of this disease in many children. This study analyzes and validates potential urinary biomarkers using mass spectrometry proteomics. Global proteomics profiles of urine from 19 ASD patients and 19 healthy control subjects were compared to identify significantly changed proteins. These proteins were validated with targeted proteomics using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) in an independent validation set consisting of samples from 40 ASD patients and 38 healthy controls. A total of 34 significantly changed proteins were found in the discovery set, among which seven proteins were identified as potential biomarkers for ASD through PRM assays in the validation set. Of these seven proteins, immunoglobulin kappa variable 4–1, immunoglobulin kappa variable 3–20, and immunoglobulin lambda variable 1–51 were up-regulated, while ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha, 10 kDa heat shock protein, apolipoprotein C-III, and arylsulfatase F were down-regulated. Six of these seven proteins support previous findings that ASD is accompanied by altered immune response and lipid metabolism, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. This study lays the groundwork for additional research using biomarkers to clinically diagnose ASD. The proteomics and PRM raw data of this study have been deposited under the accession number IPX0002592000 at iProX.This study identified 34 proteins in urine of ASD patients that were significantly changed from the urinary proteins of healthy subjects using LC-MS/MS-based proteomics in a discovery set. Seven of these proteins were validated by PRM analysis in an independent validation set. This report represents the first description of combined label-free quantitative proteomics and PRM analysis of targeted proteins for discovery of ASD urinary biomarkers. The results will be helpful for early diagnosis and can provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms of ASD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aapolipoprotein C-III 3aarylsulfatase 3aautism 3abiomarkers 3aearly diagnosis 3aheat shock proteins 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulins 3alipid metabolism 3amitochondria 3aproteomics 3aurinalysis 3aurine 0aAutism spectrum disorder 0aParallel reaction monitoring1 aZhang, Jishui1 aSong, Wenqi1 aTian, Xiaoyi1 aLiu, Ying1 aWang, Yanfei1 aMa, Jie1 aWang, Chengbin1 aYan, Guangtao0 tJournal of proteomics.g2021 June 30, v. 242 p.104259-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2021.1042593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001400137245016800151300001800319520175600337592002802093650001102121650001302132650001602145650000902161650001802170650001102188650001402199650001002213650001802223650002602241650001902267650002502286650000902311650001302320650002802333650001302361650002402374650001802398650001002416653002802426653002002454653003502474653003202509653001902541700002002560700002002580700001302600700001902613773009902632856007102731852000902802655001202811IND60081709120221119051759.0141010s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008170912DNAL7 a10.1071/AN141712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, L.10aNitrogen partitioning, energy use efficiency and isotopic fractionation measurements from cows differing in genetic merit fed low-quality pasture in late lactation  ap. 1651-1656.  aThe study was carried out to evaluate energy and nitrogen (N) use efficiencies of high and low breeding worth (BW) cow groups relative to N isotopic fractionation (Δ15N). Eight high- and eight low-BW cows (mean BW index = 198 and 57, respectively) in late lactation were used to conduct an N balance study with all cows fed autumn pasture. Individual cow pasture DM intake, N intake and N outputs of milk, urine and faeces were quantified. Plasma sample from each cow was harvested. Feed, plasma, faeces, urine and milk samples were measured for δ15N and calculated for Δ15N. Urea N in milk and plasma, and urinary excretion of purine derivatives were also measured. The metabolisable energy (ME) intake, milk energy output, and energy and N use efficiencies of high-BW cows were greater on average than low-BW cows. Conversely, the ratios of urinary N excretion to faecal N excretion and urinary N excretion to N intake were greater for low-BW cows than high-BW cows. There was no effect of BW groups on manure N output, apparent N digestibility, retained N, purine derivatives excretion or ratio of purine derivatives excretion to ME intake. No relationships were found between N and energy efficiencies and δ15N measurements. Regression analysis with individual cow measurement showed plasma δ15N – feed δ15N was negatively correlated with DM intake. N use efficiency was positively correlated with BW. High genetic merit cows are more efficient in N and energy use than lower genetic merit cows when fed low quality pasture in late lactation. Plasma δ15N – feed δ15N was proved to be a potential indicator of DM intake for individual cows when identical feed was offered. BW may be used to predict N use efficiency for individual cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abreeding 3acorrelation 3acows 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3aexcretion 3afeces 3agenetic merit 3aisotope fractionation 3alate lactation 3ametabolizable energy 3amilk 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3apastures 3aregression analysis 3aurea nitrogen 3aurine 0aisotopic discrimination 0amanure nitrogen 0amicrobial energetic efficiency 0amicrobial protein synthesis 0asustainability1 aWoodward, S.

Among the various types of artificial synapses, synaptic transistors using an electrolyte as the gate electrode have been implemented as the high capacitance of the electrolyte increases the driving current and lowers operating voltages. Here, transistors using maltose–ascorbic acid as the proton-conducting electrolyte are proposed. A novel electrolyte composed of maltose and ascorbic acid, both of which are biocompatible, enables the migration of protons. This allows the channel conductance of the transistors to be modulated with the gate input pulse voltage, and fundamental synaptic functions including excitatory postsynaptic current, paired-pulse facilitation, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression can be successfully emulated. Furthermore, the maltose–ascorbic acid electrolyte (MAE)-gated synaptic transistors exhibit high mechanical endurance, with near-linear conductivity modulation and repeatability after 1000 bending cycles under a curvature radius of 5 mm. Benefitting from its excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility, the proposed MAE has potential applications in environmentally friendly, economical, and high-performance neuromorphic electronics, which can be further applied to dermal electronics and implantable electronics in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aascorbic acid 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acapacitance 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronics 3amaltose 0aartificial synapse 0asynaptic transistor 0aindium tin oxide1 aKang, Byung Ha1 aKim, Hyun Jae1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6879-92560 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 19, v. 13, no. 29 p.34597-34604dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c070733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003300137245013800170500002000308520177500328592002802103596004402131650003602175650001402211650001502225650001702240650002202257650002302279650001402302650003502316650002202351650001802373650002602391650001602417650001302433650002002446650001502466650001402481650001002495650001402505700003702519700004002556700002402596700002802620700003302648773011502681856007202796852000902868655001202877IND60790628820221121041447.0220826e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079062882DNAL7 a10.1002/vro2.202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez‐Cuellar, Eduardo13aAn in vitro study of ApxI from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 10 and induction of NLRP3 inflammasome‐dependent cell death  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (AP) is the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia. Apx exotoxins are the most important virulence factors associated with the induction of lesions. ApxI is highly cytotoxic on a wide range of cells. Besides the induction of necrosis and apoptosis of ApxI on porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), its role in pyroptosis, a caspase‐1‐dependent form of cell death, has not been reported. The aim of this study was to analyse if NLRP3 inflammasome participates in cell death induced by ApxI. METHODS: PAMs, the porcine alveolar macrophage cell line 3D4/21 and a porcine aortic endothelial cell line were used in this study. We used Z‐VAD‐FMK and Ac‐YVAD‐cmk to inhibit caspase‐1. Glyburide and MCC950 were used to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome. A lactate dehydrogenase release assay was used to measure the percentage of cell death. Caspase‐1 expression was analysed by immunofluorescence. End‐point RT‐PCR was used to analyse the expression of NLRP3 mRNA. RESULTS: Rapid cell death in PAMs, 3D4/21 cells and the endothelial cell line were induced by ApxI. This cell death decreased by using caspase‐1 and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors and by blocking the K⁺ efflux. Expression of NLRP3 mRNA was induced by ApxI in alveolar macrophages while it was constitutive in the endothelial cell line. Detection of caspase‐1 in alveolar macrophages was higher after ApxI treatment and it was blocked by MCC950 or heat inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, we have described for the first time in vitro induction of ApxI associated pyroptosis in alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells, a rapid cell death that depends on the activation of caspase‐1 via the NLRP3 inflammasome.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes 3aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 3acaspase-1 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3aendothelial cells 3aetiological agents 3aexotoxins 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aheat inactivation 3ainflammasomes 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amacrophages 3anecrosis 3apleuropneumonia 3apyroptosis 3aserotypes 3aswine 3avirulence1 aGuerrero‐Barrera, Alma Lilián1 aAvelar‐Gonzalez, Francisco Javier1 aDíaz, Juan Manuel,1 aChávez‐Reyes, Jesús1 aSalazar de Santiago, Alfredo0 tVeterinary record open.g2021 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.e20-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vro2.203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002200163245007300185300001600258520079900274536011901073592002801192650001101220650001701231650001501248650002901263650001401292650001901306650002501325650001201350650001101362650003101373650005101404650003701455650000901492650004801501650005501549653000901604653002401613653002301637653002701660653002701687700001801714700001301732700002101745700001901766773010601785852000901891856008101900655001201981IND4434777120221118222127.0181003e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443477712DNAL7 a201183212pmid7 a10.1177/03009858093584292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriestnall, S.

A 2-day-old male Belgian Blue cross calf was presented for multiple congenital cutaneous masses that were soft, alopecic, and hyperemic; the calf had no other apparent abnormalities. Two weeks later, one mass had regressed. Surgical excision of one of the remaining masses was performed; histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings were considered diagnostic for epithelioid hemangioma. Eight months following initial presentation, all the masses had regressed spontaneously. This constitutes the first account in the veterinary literature of spontaneous regression in a congenital vascular tumor.  aThe authors declared that they received no financial support for their research and/or authorship of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalves 3askin lesions 3ahemangioma 3acongenital abnormalities 3aremission 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxpathology 2aHemangiomaxcongenitalxpathologyxveterinary. 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aMale 2aNeoplasm Regression, Spontaneousxpathology 2aSkin Neoplasmsxcongenitalxpathologyxveterinary. 0acalf 0acongenital neoplasm 0acutaneous neoplasm 0aepithelioid hemangioma 0aspontaneous regression1 aDe Bellis, F.1 aBond, R.1 aAlony-Gilboa, Y.1 aSummers, B.

Although many bark beetle insect associates have little or no measurable impact on bark beetle brood production, some reduce brood production by either competing with brood for the limited phloem tissue or by feeding on brood. Several studies have observed synchrony between the colonization of hosts by bark beetles and the arrival of insect associates. Some insect associates mediate synchrony with bark beetle mass attacks with kairomonal responses to bark beetle aggregation pheromones. The objectives of this study were to document the community of Coleoptera associated with the southern Ips (Ips avulsus, Ips calligraphus and Ips grandicollis) and to test the hypothesis that synchrony of insect associates with the southern Ips is mediated by kairomonal responses to aggregation pheromones. A large community of Coleoptera (109 species) was recorded from traps baited with southern Ips pheromones. A significant treatment effect was observed for the guilds of meristem feeders, natural enemies and woodborers. The southern Ips pheromone ipsenol was broadly attractive to meristem feeders, natural enemies and woodborers and in general blends were more attractive than individual compounds. These results demonstrate that a diverse community of Coleoptera is associated with the southern Ips and that several members of this community facilitate synchrony with kairomonal responses to southern Ips aggregation pheromones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aIps avulsus 3aIps calligraphus 3aIps grandicollis 3aPinus 3aaggregation pheromones 3abark beetles 3ahabitats 3anatural enemies 3aphloem 3atraps1 aMcKenney, Jessica L.1 aMiller, Daniel R.1 aGimmel, Matthew L.0 tJournal of insect behavior.g2013 May, v. 26, no. 3 p.321-335dSpringer-Verlagx0892-75537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-012-9349-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008600171300001400257520121700271592002801488650001901516650003001535650001901565650001901584650001101603650001301614650001401627650001801641650001901659650001601678700001601694700001701710773009401727856008701821852000901908655001201917IND60084096620221119082031.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008409662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJevrejeva, S.10aSea level projections to AD2500 with a new generation of climate change scenarios  ap. 14-20.  aSea level rise over the coming centuries is perhaps the most damaging side of rising temperature (Anthoff et al., 2009). The economic costs and social consequences of coastal flooding and forced migration will probably be one of the dominant impacts of global warming (Sugiyama et al., 2008). To date, however, few studies (Nicholls et al., 2008; Anthoff et al., 2009) on infrastructure and socio-economic planning include provision for multi-century and multi-metre rises in mean sea level. Here we use a physically plausible sea level model constrained by observations, and forced with four new Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) radiative forcing scenarios (Moss et al., 2010) to project median sea level rises of 0.57 for the lowest forcing and 1.10m for the highest forcing by 2100 which rise to 1.84 and 5.49m respectively by 2500. Sea level will continue to rise for several centuries even after stabilisation of radiative forcing with most of the rise after 2100 due to the long response time of sea level. The rate of sea level rise would be positive for centuries, requiring 200–400years to drop to the 1.8mm/yr 20th century average, except for the RCP3PD which would rely on geoengineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic costs 3aenvironmental engineering 3aglobal warming 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aplanning 3asea level 3asocial impact 3asocioeconomics 3atemperature1 aMoore, J.C.1 aGrinsted, A.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2012 Jan., v. 80-81 p.14-20dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014600170300001600316500001500332520105500347592002801402650001401430650001301444650002001457650001201477650003001489650002201519650002101541650000901562650001101571650001201582650001301594650001501607650001801622650001501640650001401655650002301669650001801692650001001710653001001720653002001730653002301750653003501773653003101808700001701839773008901856856008401945852000902029655001202038IND60086737120221119114341.0160903e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, Min-Kyeong10aInfluence of different types of nanomaterials on their bioaccumulation in a paddy microcosm: A comparison of TiO2 nanoparticles and nanotubes  ap. 166-172.  a2019-12-06  aWe investigated the environmental fate and bioaccumulation of TiO2 nanomaterials in a simplified paddy microcosm over a period of 17 days. Two types of TiO2 nanomaterials, nanoparticles (TiO2-NP) and nanotubes (TiO2-NT), were synthesized to have a negative surface charge. Ti concentrations in the environmental media (water, soil), crops (quillworts, water dropworts), and some lower and higher trophic organisms (biofilms, algae, plant-parasitic nematodes, white butterfly larva, mud snail, ricefish) were quantified after exposure periods of 0, 7, and 17 days. The titanium levels of the two nanomaterials were the highest in biofilms during the exposure periods. Bioaccumulation factors indicated that TiO2-NP and TiO2-NT were largely transferred from a prey (e.g., biofilm, water dropwort) to its consumer (e.g., nematodes, mud snail). Considering the potential entries of such TiO2 nanomaterials in organisms, their bioaccumulation throughout the food chain should be regarded with great concern in terms of the overall health of the ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsoetales 3atitanium 3abioaccumulation 3abiofilm 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aexposure duration 3atitanium dioxide 3asoil 3asnails 3apaddies 3aNematoda 3aecosystems 3ainsect larvae 3afood chain 3ananotubes 3aenvironmental fate 3ananoparticles 3acrops 0aAlgae 0aBioaccumulation 0aThe paddy food web 0aTitanium dioxide nanoparticles 0aTitanium dioxide nanotubes1 aNam, Dong-Ha0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 July, v. 178 p.166-172dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003100137245010400168300001800272520167500290592002801965650001201993650002202005650001302027650001702040650001602057650001302073650001402086650002002100650001802120650001802138650000902156650002102165650001502186650002302201650002002224650001702244650001702261650000902278653002402287653001602311653002002327700003302347700002902380700003202409773009902441856007102540852000902611655001202620IND60081709520221119052010.0141010s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008170952DNAL7 a10.1071/AN142142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez, Juan C.

Weekly milk yield (WMY) was recorded and individual samples of milk for chemical analysis were taken during 17 weeks from 45 dairy ewes of the following three genotypes: 15 East Friesian (EF), 15 EF × Suffolk (EF × SF) and 15 EF × Pelibuey (EF × PL) under organic management. For analysis of the lactation curve the Wood gamma model was used. The effect of genotype on the WMY was analysed using repeated-measures. The comparison of the least square means among genotypes for total milk yield (TMY), daily milk yield, protein content, protein yield, fat content, fat yield, non-fat solids concentration, non-fat solids yield, total solids yield and acidity was analysed using a general linear model. The genetic group influenced only in the ascent phase of the lactation curve, with values of the Parameter b of model Wood higher in EF (P = 0.01). There were no differences (P > 0.05) between genotypes in relation to the WMY, TMY, protein content and acidity; however, the effects of week of lactation trial and the interaction of genotype and week of lactation trial on WMY were significant (P < 0.05). The values of daily milk yield, fat yield, protein yield and total solids yield were higher (P < 0.005) in EF and EF × SF than EF × PL. Fat content was higher in EF × PL. EF × SF had similar values of TMY than EF and better chemical composition, which places this genotype as an option of crossbreeding in dairy sheep systems under organic management with similar agro climatic characteristics to the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3achemical analysis 3acrossing 3adairy breeds 3adairy sheep 3agenotype 3alactation 3alactation curve 3alinear models 3alipid content 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk yield 3aorganic production 3aprotein content 3asheep breeds 3atotal solids 3awood 0aewe milk production 0amilk yields 0aorganic farming1 aCastelán Ortega, Octavio A.1 aPerez, Aurora H.

Here, we investigated the risk factors associated with CDV exposure in domestic and wild carnivores from the Janos Biosphere Reserve (JBR), Mexico. METHODS: A cross‐sectional household questionnaire study was performed in four rural towns to investigate the risk factors associated with the presence of CDV in domestic and wild carnivores from the JBR, Mexico. In addition, we tested serum samples from 70 dogs and three wild carnivores, including one bobcat (Lynx rufus), one striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) and one gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) for CDV antibodies using immunochromatographic and viral neutralization assays. RESULTS: Overall, 62% of domestic dogs were seropositive for CDV, and the presence of antibodies was significantly higher in free‐roaming owned dogs than dogs with restricted movement. Among the wild carnivores, only the bobcat was seropositive. The rate of vaccination against CDV in dogs was low (7%), and there was a high rate of direct interactions between domestic dogs and wild carnivores. CONCLUSION: Our serological assays show that CDV is circulating in both domestic dogs and wild carnivores, suggesting cross‐species transmission. Our finding of low vaccination rates, high number of unrestrained owned dogs and direct interactions between wildlife and domestic animals reported in the region may be perpetuating the high prevalence of the virus and increasing the risk of CDV transmission between wild and domestic carnivores. Therefore, long‐term longitudinal studies are recommended in order to monitor infectious diseases at the domestic‐wildlife interface in this highly biodiverse region.  aPublisher supplied data  a179482cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT) (project  aFC 2016‐01‐1851)cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT) (project 3aCanine morbillivirus 3aLynx rufus 3aMephitis mephitis 3aUrocyon cinereoargenteus 3ablood serum 3aconservation areas 3ahuman population 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aneutralization 3apopulation growth 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3aseroprevalence 3askunks 3avaccination 3aviruses 3awildlife 3aMexico1 aLópez‐Pérez, Andrés M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5726-79431 aSarmiento, Rosa E.1 aSuzán, Gerardo0 tVeterinary record open.g2021 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.e7-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vro2.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016600163300001800329520140400347592002801751650002201779650001101801650001301812650002401825650001601849700001901865773015401884856008102038852000902119655001202128IND60624223820221123020957.0181202e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062422382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-7174-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhakhri, V.10aInvestigation of high-temperature plastic deformation using instrumented microindentation tests. Part IThe deformation of three aluminum alloys at 473 K to 833 K  ap. 2259-2270.  aConstant-load indentation tests were performed on wrought-2024, P/M-2024, and wrought-1100 aluminum alloys to assess the capability of the microindentation testing technique for measuring the high-temperature deformation rate controlling parameters of these alloys. The three alloys all display threshold indentation stress σₜₕ below which the indentation strain rate εᵢₙd approaches zero. The nominal inter-obstacle spacing, ℓ*, calculated from σₜₕ, increases with temperature in a way that is consistent with the known temperature dependence of the inter-particle spacing and dislocation cell size. The measured activation energy ΔGₒ of ɛᵢₙd increases with temperature but remains within the range that is typical of deformation that occurs by dislocation glide limited by weak particles or dislocation/dislocation interactions. The three alloys tested show different trends of ΔGₒ versus ℓ* and the trends are consistent with the known temperature dependence of the obstacles to dislocation glide.This study demonstrates that high-temperature indentation tests are sufficiently precise to detect changes in the operative deformation parameters between different alloys of the same general composition. This lays the groundwork for the use of this technique as a general tool for studying the local high-temperature deformation of a wide range of metal-based systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3aplastic deformation 3atemperature1 aKlassen, R.

It is characterized by dermal mucin deposits, increased numbers of fibroblasts, and variable fibrosis in the absence of thyroid disease. It is accompanied in 80% of cases by a monoclonal gammopathy. To date, scleromyxedema with systemic involvement has not been documented in domestic animals. This is the first report of a scleromyxedema-like syndrome in a cat, which had a substantial deposition of mucin in the dermis of the head and paws with a mild gammaglobulinemia of 2.25 g/dl (reference range, 1.39–2.22 g/dl). At necropsy, multiple nodules of connective tissue intermingled with mucin deposits were conspicuous on the surface of thoracic and abdominal organs. Such severe systemic accumulations of mucin have not been reported in human or veterinary medicine.  aThe authors declared that they received no financial support for their research and/or authorship of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3aconnective tissues 3anoninfectious diseases 3aglycosaminoglycans 3aprotein deposition 3afibrosis 3agamma-globulins 3ablood protein disorders 3ahistopathology 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxpathology 2aCats 2aFatal Outcome 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aScleromyxedemaxpathologyxveterinary. 2aSkin Diseasesxpathologyxveterinary. 0acat 0afibroblasts 0aglycosaminoglycans 0amucin 0ascleromyxedema 0askin 0asystemic disease1 aRüfenacht, S.1 aDi Palma, S.1 aHartmeier, G.1 aWelle, M.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 47, no. 2 p.346-350dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858093580393Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02445naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245016200160300001800322520121000340592002801550650002301578650002101601650002001622650002301642650001301665650001001678650001301688650000701701650001001708650001601718650001201734650001101746700002101757700002401778700002301802700002801825773010001853856007301953852000902026655001202035IND60408523120221119082801.0150905e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040852312DNAL7 a10.1111/are.124032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimi, Ruhollah10aImprovement in wild endangered Persian sturgeon, Acipenser persicus (Borodin, 1897) semen cryopreservation by 2‐hydroxypropyl‐beta‐cyclodextrin (HβCD)  ap. 2452-2456.  aIn this study, cryopreservation feasibility of Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus) and the effect of different doses of 2‐hydroxypropyl‐beta‐cyclodextrin on thawed spermatozoa quality (motility duration and motility percentage) were investigated. For freezing, semen of seven male individuals was pooled in equal volumes and diluted with 4°C [Tris‐HCl (100 mM), pH = 8, DMSO 10%] extenders containing 0, 5, 10, 15 mM of HβCD in a ratio of 1:1(semen/extenders). Then semen was filled into 0.5‐mL straws, and was frozen with vapour of liquid nitrogen at 4‐cm above surface of liquid nitrogen. After 3 min, straws were plunged in to liquid nitrogen. Thawing was performed at 40°C water baths for 15 s. Motility duration of the 10 mM HβCD treated spermatozoa at days 14 (228.98 ± 16.39) and 56 (199.66 ±21.78) were longer than other treatments. In day 56, the motility percentage in treatment with 10 mM was significantly higher (16.14 ± 2.54) (P < 0.05) compared with 5 mM treatment (8.75 ± 2.47) (P < 0.05). Therefore, it is recommended that 10 mM of HβCD can be used as an additive cryoprotectant for increasing cryopreserved spermatozoa quality in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser persicus 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afreezing 3amales 3anitrogen 3apH 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3athawing 3avapors1 aFarahmand, Hamid1 aMirvaghefi, Alireza1 aRafiee, Gholamreza1 aAbed Elmdoust, Amirreza0 tAquaculture research.g2015 Oct., v. 46, no. 10 p.2452-2456dBlackwell Sciencex1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.124033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245007900169300001600248520117900264592002801443653001501471653001501486653001901501653001301520700001601533773010301549856008701652852000901739655001201748IND60594112320221123025100.0180510e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059411232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiaming10aMultifunctional structural supercapacitor based on graphene and geopolymer  ap. 105-112.  aA novel multifunctional structural supercapacitor based on graphene and geopolymer infused with 2M KOH electrolyte was fabricated. Metakaolin-based geopolymers, which were first applied as structural separators in this paper, were prepared with metakaolin and different moduli of alkaline activator solution. The widespread pores in geopolymer matrix provide enough channels for ion storage and motion. The effects of alkaline activator solution modulus and curing age on the electrochemical properties were analyzed. The results revealed the ideal capacitive behavior of structural supercapacitor. The samples with modulus of 2.0 exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 36.5Fg⁻¹ at curing age of 28days. A possible mechanism was proposed to explain the factors that influence the specific capacitance of geopolymer-based structural supercapacitor. The result of multifuncitonality analysis showed that samples with modulus of 1.6 exhibited the best level of multifunctionality, with compressive strength of 33.85MPa and specific capacitance of 33.4Fg⁻¹ at curing age of 28 days. It achieved a balance between mechanical property and electrochemical performance.  aPublisher supplied data 0aStructural 0aGeopolymer 0aSupercapacitor 0aGraphene1 aZhang, Dong0 tElectrochimica acta.g2017 Jan. 10, v. 224 p.105-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001600163245008900179300001600268500001500284520043100299536009800730592002800828650001000856650002400866650001200890650001900902650002200921650002900943650001400972650001700986650001101003650004401014650001201058650002101070650004401091650001801135650003501153650003001188650001101218650002201229650000901251653001701260653002001277653002201297653001101319653002001330653002701350700001201377700001501389700001701404700001701421700001301438700001701451773010601468852000901574856008101583655001201664IND4434777720221118222200.0181003e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443477772DNAL7 a201102212pmid7 a10.1177/03009858093593192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuda, K.10aBronchogenic and Esophageal Cyst With Laryngeal Malformations in a Thoroughbred Foal  ap. 351-353.  a2019-12-04  aThis report documents an unusual case of congenital foregut cyst with dysphagia and stridor in a Thoroughbred foal.

The process leads to a clean nitrogen-terminated GaN surface that bonds well to the MoS₂ film revealing a 2 × 2 reconstruction at the interface observed in low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). Atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provide clear images of the GaN terraces through the MoS₂ overlayer confirming close adhesion and absence of oxygen and other contaminants. Density functional theory calculations predict the formation of the 2 × 2 superstructure at a clean interface. Transport measurements show diode behavior at an on/off ratio of ∼10⁵ for ±1 V with a forward direction for the positive voltage applied to the MoS₂ layer. Combining transport and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements with theory, we deduce a Fermi-level position in the MoS₂ gap consistent with interface charge transfer from MoS₂ to the substrate. The high performance of the MoS₂/Gan diode highlights the technological potential of devices based on GaN/MoS₂ interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3adensity functional theory 3adiodes 3aelectric potential difference 3agallium 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amolybdenum 3amolybdenum disulfide 3anitrides 3aoxygen 0aheterostructures 0a2D 0amaterials 0ainterface characterization 0atransport measurements 0alow-energy electron diffraction 0achemical vapor deposition 0aepitaxy1 aCoyle, Daniel J.1 aWurch, Michelle1 aYadav, Prachi R.1 aValentin, Michael D.1 aNeupane, Mahesh R.1 aAlmeida, Kortney1 aBartels, Ludwig1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3964-45380 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 14, v. 13, no. 29 p.35105-35112dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c073063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010900176300002000285520147000305592002801775650002201803650002301825650001801848650002001866650001301886650001601899650001301915650001701928650001401945653002201959653003401981653000902015653002502024653001602049700001902065700002002084700002902104700002302133700003402156700001902190700002102209700006202230700006602292773014602358856008602504852000902590655001202599IND60754861820221118021355.0211026e20211008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075486182DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c047702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgelund, Peter H. G.10aFmoc-Removal with Pyrrolidine Expands the Available Solvent Space in Green Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis  ap. 14202-14215.  aGreen binary solvent mixtures with a polarity and viscosity close to that of DMF perform similarly in solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). However, while coupling reactions readily proceed in solvents of significantly lower polarity than that of DMF, a high solvent polarity is essential for Fmoc-removal using piperidine, which limits the options for green SPPS solvents. Herein, we report our efforts to expand the available solvent polarity space for green SPPS. We identified pyrrolidine as an efficient base to enable Fmoc-removal in less polar solvent mixtures that also favor coupling reactions, such as dimethyl sulfoxide/ethyl acetate (1:9) and N-butylpyrrolidone/1,3-dioxolane (2:8 and 4:6). Employing less polar binary solvent mixtures in combination with pyrrolidine gave crude peptide purities comparable to or better than for DMF with piperidine in the SPPS of challenging peptide targets. An evaluation of base-dependent side reactions such as diketopiperazine (DKP) and aspartimide formation showed increased side-product formation when using pyrrolidine on DKP- and aspartimide-prone sequences. However, the scaled-up syntheses (5 and 7.5 mmol, respectively) of the peptide therapeutics dasiglucagon (29-mer) and bivalirudin (20-mer) gave good crude peptide purities and purity profiles amenable to SPPS optimization. Pyrrolidine therefore represents a useful alternative to piperidine for Fmoc-removal in an expanded solvent space for green SPPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiketopiperazines 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aethyl acetate 3agreen chemistry 3apeptides 3apiperidines 3asolvents 3atherapeutics 3aviscosity 0apeptide synthesis 0asolid-phase peptide synthesis 0aSPPS 0asolvent substitution 0apyrrolidine1 aJadhav, Sandip1 aMartin, Vincent1 aJohansson Castro, Henrik1 aRichner, Franziska1 aLe Quement, Sebastian Thordal1 aDettner, Frank1 aLechner, Carolin1 aSchoenleber, Ralph1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7055-09511 aSejer Pedersen, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3926-70470 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Oct. 08, v. 9, no. 42 p.14202-14215dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c047703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013400160300001100294500001900305520124600324592002801570650001301598650001601611650002101627650001901648650001101667650001901678650001901697650001901716700001601735700001401751700001501765700001701780773014801797856008201945852000902027655001202036IND60694131120221117185027.0210113e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069413112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-020-1251-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Jing10aUtilizing transparent and conductive SnO2 as electron mediator to enhance the photocatalytic performance of Z-scheme Si-SnO2-TiOx  ap. 72.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aZ-scheme photocatalysts, with strong redox ability, have a great potential for pollutants degradation. However, it is challenging to construct efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts because of their poor interfacial charge separation. Herein, by employing transparent and conductive SnO₂ as electron mediator to pass light through and promote interfacial charge transportation, a novel Z-scheme photocatalyst Si-SnO₂-TiOₓ (₁ < ₓ < ₂) was constructed. The Z-scheme photocatalyst displayed an order of magnitude higher photocurrent density and a 4-fold increase in open-circuit potential compared to those of Si. Moreover, the onset potential shifted negatively for approximately 2.2 V. Benefiting from these advantages, this Z-scheme Si-SnO₂-TiOₓ exhibited efficient photocatalytic performance toward phenol degradation and mineralization. 75% of the phenol was degraded without bias potential and 70% of the TOC was removed during phenol degradation. Other typical pollutants such as bisphenol A and atrazine could also be degraded without bias potential. Introducing a transparent and conductive electron mediator to construct Z-scheme photocatalyst gives a new sight to the improvement of photocatalytic performance in Z scheme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrazine 3abisphenol A 3aelectric current 3amineralization 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atransportation1 aYu, Hongtao1 aQuan, Xie1 aChen, Shuo1 aNiu, Junfeng0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2020 Aug., v. 14, no. 4 p.72-72dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-020-1251-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01699naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014700162300001800309520044300327592002800770650000800798650002400806650002700830650001300857650001800870650001400888650001900902650001900921650001900940650001300959650002100972650003100993700001801024700002101042700002001063773013401083856007501217852000901292655001201301IND60658931320221119213350.0190826e20110419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065893132DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10660k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosseler, Olivier10aEnhanced CO photocatalytic oxidation in the presence of humidity by tuning composition of Pd–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles supported on TiO₂  ap. 5331-5333.  aHere we put forward for the first time that the negative effect of humidity on CO photooxidation at room temperature can be overcome by adjusting the composition of Pd–Pt bimetallic particles supported on TiO₂.

Herein, we report a hydrogen-bonding-mediated strategy for selective hydrogenation of aryl ketones to either aryl alcohols or aryl alkanes at room temperature, which is achieved over Pd/C in imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) via altering the IL anions from [Cl]⁻ to [BF₄]⁻. 1-Butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium ([BMIm]⁺) ILs with [Cl]⁻ and [BF₄]⁻ anions show high performances, affording a series of aromatic alcohols or alkanes with 100% selectivity and high yields, respectively. Mechanism investigation indicates that the π–π interaction between the ILs and the aromatic ring of the ketones may inhibit the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring, and the dual H-bonding interaction of the IL cation and anion with the resultant alcohol from the ketone hydrogenation mediates the hydrogenation selectivity. This catalytic protocol is simple, highly efficient, and selective toward target products, which may have promising applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aambient temperature 3aaromatic compounds 3acations 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrogenation 0aionic liquids 0aselective hydrogenation 0aH2 0aroom temperature1 aWang, Yuepeng1 aZhao, Yanfei1 aZhang, Fengtao1 aZeng, Wei1 aTang, Minhao1 aXiang, Junfeng1 aZhang, Xiaoyu1 aHan, Buxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0440-809X1 aLiu, Zhimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7953-74140 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 9, no. 42 p.14216-14223dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c048763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016800159300001600327520108600343592002801429650001501457650002101472650002001493650001401513650001301527650004301540650000901583650001601592650000701608650001801615650001501633650002701648700001601675700001301691700001401704700001801718773012401736856007401860852000901934655001201943IND60656714220221122001939.0190814e20131205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065671422DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41588k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Ke-Jing10aUltra-trace determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using solid-phase extraction coupled with HPLC based on graphene-functionalized silica gel composites  ap. 194-201.  aA graphene (Gr) functionalized silica gel (Gr–SiO₂) sorbent was prepared and used as a new sorbent for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including naphthalene, acenaphthylene, fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene.

Under the optimized conditions, the present method showed a wide linear range (0.01–600 μg L⁻¹), acceptable repeatability of the extraction (RSDs of 1.7–8.2%, n = 3) and satisfactory detection limits (0.0029–0.052 μg L⁻¹). The recovery studies using this new sorbent were performed by three consecutive extraction steps of water and milk samples at three spiked levels. The average recoveries of the analytes in environmental water and milk samples were 89.0–115.4%, which demonstrated the applicability of the developed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3afluorenes 3agraphene 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amilk 3anaphthalene 3apH 3aphenanthrenes 3asilica gel 3asolid phase extraction1 aLiu, Yu-Jie1 aLi, Jing1 aGan, Tian1 aLiu, Yan-Ming0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Dec. 5, v. 6, no. 1 p.194-201dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41588k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009500167300001800262520071700280592002800997650001501025650002101040650001101061650001401072650003101086650001301117650001301130650001601143700002001159773012201179856008201301852000901383655001201392IND60624224720221122002516.0220515e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062422472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-011-5357-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaguchi, Isao10aUncatalyzed synthesis of polypyrrole with viologen side groups and its chemical properties  ap. 4582-4587.  aA substituted polypyrrole (PPr) with viologen side groups (polymer-1) was obtained from the reaction of N-aminopyrrole with 1-hexyl-1′-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-4,4′-bipyridinium dihalide (salt-1).

Herein, a 2D–2D SnS₂/TpPa-1-COF heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared via a one-step hydrothermal route to relieve the abovementioned shortcomings. The results show that the obtained 2D–2D SnS₂/TpPa-1-COF heterojunctions not only speed up the separation of photogenerated charge carriers but also facilitate the H₂ production kinetics and expand the range of visible light response to orange light (600 nm). Especially, the maximum photocatalytic H₂ production rate of the 2D–2D SnS₂/TpPa-1-COF heterojunction without the addition of cocatalyst Pt reaches 37.11 μmol h–¹, which is 21.7-fold and 2-fold higher than those of individual TpPa-1-COF and 3 wt % Pt/TpPa-1-COF, respectively. This work indicates that the synthesis of cheap COF-based photocatalysts for high-efficiency solar energy utilization is a feasible approach to boost the photocatalytic H₂ performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asolar energy 0acovalent organic frameworks 0atwo-dimensional materials 0aH2 production 0aheterojunction1 aLi, Di1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8052-926X1 aChen, Biyi1 aLuo, Bifu1 aHuang, Yuanyong1 aShi, Weidong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1123-81910 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 9, no. 42 p.14238-14248dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c051623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009600176300002000272520130500292592002801597650003101625650002301656650002501679650001801704650001801722650001901740650001801759650001601777650002001793650001901813650001801832650000901850650001401859650001301873653001601886653001701902700001901919700005601938773014601994856008602140852000902226655001202235IND60754862320221118021353.0211026e20211008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075486232DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c054532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, J.q(Jaehyun),10aMicrobial Bioprocess for Extracellular Squalene Production and Formulation of Nanoemulsions  ap. 14263-14276.  aSustainable production of natural resources requires a clean manufacturing process with clean raw materials due to the risk of environmental contaminations. Microbial cell factories have enabled the production of natural products including hydrophobic chemicals. However, the microbial cells limit the production titer because of the limited intracellular storage capacity and no transport across the cell membrane. Herein, we engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum to produce hydrophobic squalene as a model product. Notably, squalene was secreted in the defined culture medium without in situ extractions. As a result, the secreted squalene was related to the glycolipid association with synthesized squalene in the cell envelope and a facilitated secretion occurred during cell division. Protein engineering and pathway engineering of C. glutamicum enhanced the total squalene (tSQ) production, where fed-batch fermentation resulted in 1406 ± 16 mg/L tSQ production (32% tSQ in the medium). Promoting extraction with dodecane overlay, bio-squalene nanoemulsions were formulated and the creaming effects were analyzed for cosmetic application. Combining metabolic pathway engineering and facilitated secretion in microbial cells will be a good strategy to produce sustainable hydrophobic chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3abatch fermentation 3abiochemical pathways 3abioprocessing 3acell division 3acell membranes 3aculture media 3aglycolipids 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoemulsions 3arisk 3asecretion 3asqualene 0aMEP pathway 0ananoemulsion1 aKang, Dong Hun1 aWoo, Han Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8797-04770 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Oct. 08, v. 9, no. 42 p.14263-14276dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c054533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001300169245015400182300001600336520097700352592002801329650001601357650001701373650001901390650002301409650001501432650001501447650004701462650002601509650003801535650002001573650003301593650003001626650001501656650002901671651001001700653002201710653002901732653000901761653000901770653001201779700001401791700001101805773008901816856008401905852000901989655001201998IND60086737920221119114450.0160903e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673792DNAL7 a235583022pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, L.Y.10aCorrelation analysis of the urban heat island effect and the spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric particulates using TM images in Beijing  ap. 102-114.  aThis study combines the methods of observation statistics and remote sensing retrieval, using remote sensing information including the urban heat island (UHI) intensity index, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the difference vegetation index (DVI) to analyze the correlation between the urban heat island effect and the spatial and temporal concentration distributions of atmospheric particulates in Beijing.

The results proved the existence of three correlation types with regional and seasonal effects and revealed an interesting correlation between UHI and DVI, that is, if UHI is below 0.1, then DVI increases with the increase in UHI, and vice versa.

This view is credible if electricity price – fuel costs relation is stronger in restructured than in non-restructured states. We examine the validity of this view using panel data on for industrial, residential and commercial sectors in US states. The analysis accounts for cross-sectional dependency, cross-state heterogeneity, and interdependency of state fuel markets. The common correlated effects mean-group estimates suggest that (1) coal and natural gas costs Granger-cause electricity prices for industrial and commercial customers in both non-restructured and restructured states; (2) both fuel costs also Granger-cause electricity prices for residential customers in non-restructured states but only natural gas costs cause electricity prices in restructured states; (3) the long-run impacts of fuel costs on electricity prices are higher in non-restructured than restructured states; and (4) electricity prices exhibit lower persistence in non-restructured than in restructured states. These results are do not support the view of higher integration between input costs and electricity prices in restructured markets. Policymakers should be aware of the differences in electricity price response in alternative market structures when implementing new federal policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aconsumers (people) 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3anatural gas 3aUnited States 0aElectricity markets 0aFuel costs 0aDeregulation 0aCommon correlated effects 0aL9 0aQ41 aMohammadi, Hassan1 aLoomis, David G.0 tEnergy policy.g2020 July, v. 142 p.111559-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1115593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245010300208300001600311506007600327520143000403592002801833506003701861650002601898650001001924650001301934650001701947650001701964650001101981650002601992650001902018650001502037650001202052650002002064650001202084653002602096653000902122653001302131653001802144653003102162653001702193700001602210700002102226700001602247700001802263700001702281700001902298773014602317856008202463852000902545655001202554IND60628048020221207055858.0190129e20180602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062804802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0932doi7 aPMC59287832pmcid7 a296603312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Susmita10aBiophysical characterization of actin bundles generated by the Chlamydia trachomatis Tarp effector  ap. 423-428.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChlamydia trachomatis entry into host cells is mediated by pathogen-directed remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. The chlamydial type III secreted effector, translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp), has been implicated in the recruitment of actin to the site of internalization. Tarp harbors G-actin binding and proline rich domains required for Tarp-mediated actin nucleation as well as unique F-actin binding domains implicated in the formation of actin bundles. Little is known about the mechanical properties of actin bundles generated by Tarp or the mechanism by which Tarp mediates actin bundle formation. In order to characterize the actin bundles and elucidate the role of different Tarp domains in the bundling process, purified Tarp effectors and Tarp truncation mutants were analyzed using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Our data indicate that Tarp mediated actin bundling is independent of actin nucleation and the F-actin binding domains are sufficient to bundle actin filaments. Additionally, Tarp-mediated actin bundles demonstrate distinct bending stiffness compared to those crosslinked by the well characterized actin bundling proteins fascin and alpha-actinin, suggesting Tarp may employ a novel actin bundling strategy. The capacity of the Tarp effector to generate novel actin bundles likely contributes to chlamydia's efficient mechanism of entry into human cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydia trachomatis 3aactin 3abundling 3acrosslinking 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3amechanical properties 3amicrofilaments 3amicroscopy 3amutants 3aphosphoproteins 3aproline 0aChlamydia trachomatis 0aTarp 0aEffector 0aActin bundles 0aBending persistence length 0aCytoskeleton1 aPark, Jinho1 aThomas, Mitchell1 aCruz, Edgar1 aCardona, Omar1 aKang, Hyeran1 aJewett, Travis0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 June 02, v. 500, no. 2 p.423-428dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245008700167300001600254500002000270520177800290592002802068596012302096596008002219650001402299650001702313650002302330650000902353650001702362650002002379650003002399650002202429650001002451650002202461650001102483650001202494650001602506700002502522700002002547700006102567773012302628856007902751852000902830655001202839IND60631676120221123035108.0190312e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063167612DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.144612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAilavadi, Sukriti10aThermal Inactivation Kinetics of Tulane Virus in Cell‐Culture Medium and Spinach  ap. 557-563.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHuman noroviruses (HNoVs) cause significant gastrointestinal disease outbreaks worldwide. Tulane virus (TV) is a cultivable HNoV surrogate widely used to determine control measures against HNoVs. The objective of this study was to determine the heat inactivation kinetics (D‐ and z‐values) of TV in cell‐culture media and on spiked homogenized spinach using the first‐order and Weibull models. TV in cell‐culture media at approximately 7 log PFU/mL (PFU—plaque forming unit) in 2‐mL glass vials was heated at 52, 54, and 56 °C for up to 10 min in a circulating water bath. Survivors were enumerated using confluent host LLC‐MK2 cells in six‐well plates by plaque assay. Data from three replicate treatments assayed in duplicate were analyzed statistically. D‐values by the first‐order model for TV in cell‐culture media at 52, 54, and 56 °C were 4.59 ± 0.05, 2.91 ± 0.05, and 1.74 ± 0.07 min, respectively, with a z‐value of 9.09 ± 0.01 °C (R² = 0.997). The Weibull model showed td ₌ ₁ values of 2.53 ± 0.08, 1.99 ± 0.10, and 0.57 ± 0.64 min, respectively, at the same temperatures. The D‐values for TV in spinach were 7.94 ± 0.21, 4.09 ± 0.04, and 1.43 ± 0.02 min and the z‐value was 10.74 ± 0.01 °C (R² = 0.98) by the first‐order model and 4.89 ± 0.02, 3.21 ± 0.45, and 0.25 ± 0.38 min for the Weibull model at 50, 54, and 58 °C, respectively. In comparison to previously reported results for the cultivable HNoV surrogate, murine norovirus ‐1, TV in cell‐culture media and spiked on spinach homogenates showed lower D‐ and z‐values. TV may not be an ideal HNoV surrogate for heat inactivation studies in cell‐culture media or homogenized spinach in vacuum bags.  aPublisher supplied data  aAgriculture and Food Research Initiative Grant No. 2011‐68003‐20096cUSDA National Inst. of Food and Agriculture  aGrant No. 2016‐68003‐24840cUSDA National Inst. of Food and Agriculture 3aNorovirus 3aTulane virus 3aWeibull statistics 3abags 3acell culture 3acontrol methods 3adigestive system diseases 3adisease outbreaks 3aglass 3aheat inactivation 3amodels 3aspinach 3atemperature1 aDavidson, P.

In this study, succinic semialdehyde reductase (AKR7A5) was engineered for the conversion of levulinic acid to 4-hydroxyvaleric acid. Levulinic acid is a derivative of cellulosic biomass, and 4-hydroxyvaleric acid is a potential precursor to bio-polymers and fuels. Therefore, the enzymatic conversion of levulinic acid to 4-hydroxyvaleric acid is of special significance in that this conversion could provide a meaningful basis for the bio-production of useful chemicals from cellulosic biomass. In engineering the substrate specificity of the AKR7A5, a rational design approach with the aid of enzyme-substrate interatomic contact analysis was applied. The Met13 residue was selected as a key mutation site, and substitutions of the residue with six hydrophobic amino acids were applied. As a result, four mutants with enhanced catalytic activity toward levulinic acid were obtained, and the most improved mutant, Met13Trp, exhibited a 7.0-fold increase in catalytic efficiency. Additionally, the structural effects of the positive mutations were investigated to analyze the structural basis for the enzyme substrate specificity with the target substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abiomass 3abiopolymers 3acatalytic activity 3aengineering 3aenzyme substrates 3aenzymes 3afuels 3ahydrophobicity 3alevulinic acid 3amutants 3amutation 3asubstrate specificity 0aSubstrate specificity 0aSuccinic semialdehyde reductase 0aLevulinic acid 0a4-Hydroxyvaleric acid 0aRational design 0aInteratomic contact analysis1 aPark, Hyung-Yeon1 aYoo, Young Je0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 Sept. 20, v. 210 p.38-43dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.06.4043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008900153300001800242520107800260592002801338650002001366650001501386650002301401650002401424650001601448650002801464650002001492650002101512650002301533650001201556650001501568650001401583650000901597650002101606650001701627650001201644700001301656700001601669700001501685700001801700700001701718773012801735856007401863852000901937655001201946IND60701240420221120152629.0200710e20200709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070124042DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay00256a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fang13aAn aptasensor for the detection of ampicillin in milk using a personal glucose meter  ap. 3376-3381.  aAntibiotic residues in foods have aroused wide public concern because of their potential side-effects. It is imperative to develop a simple, accurate and reliable method for the detection of antibiotic residues in foods. In this paper, we report a novel, facile and sensitive method for the detection of ampicillin in milk using a commercial personal glucose meter (PGM). Magnetic beads (MBs) were employed as the platform, an ampicillin aptamer was used as the recognition element and streptavidin was utilized as the bridge to link invertase and the aptamer. After the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose, the concentration of glucose was quantitatively measured using the PGM. The difference of PGM signals with and without addition of ampicillin exhibits a good linear correlation with the logarithm of ampicillin concentrations in the range of 2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ mol L⁻¹ to 1.0 × 10⁻⁷ mol L⁻¹ with a detection limit of 2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ mol L⁻¹ (S/N = 3). Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied for the detection of ampicillin residue in milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aampicillin 3aanalytical methods 3aantibiotic residues 3aaptasensors 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3adetection limit 3adietary exposure 3afood contamination 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3amagnetism 3amilk 3aoligonucleotides 3astreptavidin 3asucrose1 aLi, Xixi1 aZhu, Nanwei1 aLi, Ruohan1 aKang, Huaibin1 aZhang, Qinpu0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 July 9, v. 12, no. 26 p.3376-3381dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00256a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01726naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009100169300001600260520071700276592002800993650001501021650001901036650001101055653002801066653002101094653002601115700001601141700001901157700001301176773011601189856008601305852000901391655001201400IND60781160520221119130433.0220623e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078116052DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2022.20578232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Pengyu12aA new registration method with improved phase congruency for application to GPR images  ap. 726-737.  aIn this letter, we propose an edge detection algorithm and a framework of points matching for ground penetrating radar (GPR) images to achieve the B-Scan image registration of GPR.

Despite this rich information, the complex composition of whole blood usually required multiple sample preparation steps to purify targeted analytes. Traditionally, whole blood preparation processes, including centrifugation, lysis, dilution, or staining, are usually manually operated by well-trained technicians using bench-top instruments. This preparation can require a large blood volume and cannot be directly integrated with detection systems. Recently, various studies have integrated microfluidics with electrical sensors for whole blood analysis, with a focus on cell-based analysis, such as cell type, number, morphology, phenotype, and secreted molecules. These miniaturized systems require less sample and shorter reaction times. Besides, the sample processing and analysis can be fully integrated and automated with minimal operations. We believe these systems can transfer the current whole blood analysis from hospitals or laboratories into clinics or home settings to enable real-time and continuous health condition monitoring in point-of-care settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aautomation 3ablood 3ablood volume 3acentrifugation 3ahematologic tests 3ahospitals 3ametastasis 3amicrofluidic technology 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 3apoint-of-care systems 3astaining 3atechnicians1 aHuang, Nien-Tsu0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 July 9, v. 12, no. 26 p.3318-3332dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00413h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245010100182300001800283520152600301592002801827650002001855650002201875650001701897650001301914650002101927650001501948650004401963650001502007650004302022650001602065650004702081650001702128650002102145650004102166650004102207650004402248650002502292650002802317650001402345650003402359650004002393650002702433650000902460650002202469700001702491700001402508700001302522700001702535700001702552773011502569856008102684852000902765655001202774IND50074379520221120225758.0150214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007437952DNAL7 a243057422pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-5424-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cheng10aNew insights into the structure and dynamics of actinomycetal community during manure composting  ap. 3327-3337.  aDespite advancing knowledge about the functional role of actinomycetes in degrading lignocellulosic materials, definitive knowledge concerning the diversity and dynamics of the actinomycetal community in composting is still lacking. In this study, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone library construction were applied to investigate actinomycetal diversity and dynamics in a pilot-scale composting. Quantitative real-time PCR data revealed that actinomycetes accounted for 18–86 % of bacteria and that the fraction peaked during the maturing phase, indicating that Actinobacteria were critical to the compost ecosystem. Qualitatively, actinomycetal communities displayed distinct temporal variations during composting. Fourteen distinct genera of actinomycetes and an unknown group were observed in manure composts. Redundancy analysis indicated that temperature exerted an influence over the actinomycetal communities. Specifically, pathogenic Corynebacterium species dominated in the initial phase, whereas the genera Saccharomonospora and Thermobifida were abundant in the thermophilic phase. In maturing composts, mesophilic Micrococcineae members were most prevalent. The dominant thermophiles along with Micrococcineae may jointly facilitate the degradation of lignocellulosic materials during composting. Together, our research revealed a more detailed ecological and potential functional role for actinomycetes in the compost ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium 3aSaccharomonospora 3aThermobifida 3abacteria 3acomposted manure 3acomposting 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aecosystems 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atemperature 2aActinomycetalesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBiodiversity 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDenaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis 2aManurexmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil 2aSoil Microbiology1 aGuo, Xiaohui1 aDeng, Hui1 aDong, Da1 aTu, Qiaoping1 aWu, Weixiang0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Apr., v. 98, no. 7 p.3327-3337dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5424-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008300161300001600244520170200260592002801962650001901990650001502009650002102024650001002045650001502055650002902070650001702099650001402116650002202130700002102152773009102173856004802264852000902312655001202321IND50069872220221120125641.0131018e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006987222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-013-0310-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoins, A.10aDrone “quality” and caste interactions in the honey bee, Apis mellifera L.  ap. 453-461.  aWe investigated the influence of drone size and potential reproductive quality on caste interactions by adding large drones reared in drone cells (DC drones; considered to be of higher quality) and small drones reared in worker cells (WC drones; of lower quality) to two observation colonies and monitoring worker–drone interactions and acceptance by workers. When initially introduced into the colonies more DC drones received trophallaxis, whereas more WC drones received aggression and eviction attempts from workers. Nevertheless, WC and DC drones were equally likely to be accepted by workers. For both drone types accepted individuals had slightly, but significantly greater weights than rejected males. Thus, workers discriminated between drones of different sizes and potential quality upon initial encounter, although these discriminations were not strongly associated with acceptance decisions. After drones were accepted, workers either showed no preference for interacting with WC or DC drones, or if a preference was shown it tended to favor WC drones. Compared to accepted DC drones, significantly more WC drones received grooming for longer periods of time and also spent more time engaged in all interactions with workers combined. DC and WC drones did not differ in the likelihood of receiving trophallaxis or the vibration signal, although for both interactions slightly more WC drones were recipients. Thus, workers may bias some interactions with accepted drones to favor smaller individuals with potential developmental deficiencies, in a manner that could contribute to the production of a greater total number of competitive males and increased colony reproductive output.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aaggression 3adrone honey bees 3amales 3amonitoring 3areproductive performance 3atrophallaxis 3avibration 3aworker honey bees1 aSchneider, S.

Several popular sample preparation methods were evaluated for their suitability to determine selenomethionine (SeMet) in selenized yeast by AF4-ICP-MS. These included water, methanesulfonic acid (MSA), formic acid (FA) and alkaline extractions. Alkaline extraction (using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer) provided the best recovery/determination conditions for SeMet based on analysis of NRC certified reference material (CRM) SELM-1 since it minimized hydrolysis of the protein peptide bonds optimally required for the AF4 separation. The analytical performance of three different AF4 membranes (5, 10 and 500 kDa regenerated cellulose) was also evaluated. No significant difference in the recovery of SeMet was observed when using 5 and 10 kDa RC membranes, whereas the 500 kDa membrane resulted in a significant loss. The proposed method presents appropriate instrument and intra-assay precisions of 4.4–9.2% and 3.8% RSD, respectively, a detection limit of 0.49 μg L⁻¹ SeMet as Se and good linearity with correlation coefficients (R) between 0.996 – 0.999. This is the first report of use of AF4-ICP-MS for species specific quantitation of SeMet in selenized yeast demonstrating its efficient use as an alternative method to other traditional chromatographic techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acellulose 3achemical speciation 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3aformic acid 3afractionation 3ahydrolysis 3apeptides 3areference standards 3aselenomethionine 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asulfonic acids 3ayeasts1 aNascimento, Ronaldo F.1 aLopes, Gisele S.1 aGrinberg, Patricia0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 July 9, v. 12, no. 26 p.3351-3360dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00658k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245013200171300001600303520166100319592002801980650001602008650001602024650001302040650001302053650001602066650002602082650002002108650001602128650002702144650002802171650001702199650001802216650001102234650001002245650001302255650001702268650001502285650002102300650000902321650000902330650002002339650002502359650003602384650003202420650002102452653001602473653001102489653002102500653001702521653001302538653000802551653000802559653000702567653000702574653000702581700006502588773014602653856008202799852000902881655001202890IND60628048320221121152040.0190129e20180602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062804832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadmanabha, Smitha10aFatty acids modulate the efficacy of lutein in cataract prevention: Assessment of oxidative and inflammatory parameters in rats  ap. 435-442.  aEffects of lutein (L) and fatty acids [linoleic acid (LA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and oleic acid (OA)] on oxidative stress and inflammation in cataract were assessed.Cataract was induced in male Wistar rat pups (11 days old) by giving a single dose of sodium selenite (25 μM/kg body weight) by IP. Lutein (1.3 μmol/kg body weight) was given one day before and five days after selenite injection as a micelle with 7.5 mM LA, or 7.5 mM EPA + DHA or 7.5 mM OA. Serum and lens oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters having a bearing cataract were assessed.Serum and lens nitric oxide, MDA and protein carbonyls were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in cataract compared to control and experimental groups. Catalase, SOD, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase activity and glutathione level in serum and lens of cataract group were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased. Serum eicosanoids (PGE2, LTB4, and LTC4) and cytokines (CRP, TNF-α, IL1-β, and MCP-1) were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in cataract. The activity of cPLA2 and Cox-2 in cataract lens was higher (p < 0.05) compared to other groups. EP-1, NOS-2 and NF-kB expression were higher (p < 0.05) in cataract. The ratio of water insoluble to water soluble protein was increased in cataract lens. Group administered with L + EPA + DHA exhibited highest cataract prevention compared to L + LA and L + OA. Pups given lutein with EPA + DHA had the highest amount of lutein in the lens.The anti-cataract activity of lutein was influenced by fatty acids and found to be highest with EPA + DHA compared to LA or OA.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acatalase 3acataract 3aeicosanoids 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3ainflammation 3alinoleic acid 3alutein 3amales 3amicelles 3anitric oxide 3aoleic acid 3aoxidative stress 3apups 3arats 3asodium selenite 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awater solubility 0aFatty acids 0aLutein 0aOxidative stress 0aInflammation 0aCataract 0aEPA 0aDHA 0aLA 0aOA 0aOS1 aVallikannan, Baskaran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0687-111X0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 June 02, v. 500, no. 2 p.435-442dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245008600174300001600260520103900276592002801315650001101343650002201354650002601376650001301402650001101415650001301426650001701439651000901456651002901465651001601494653002001510653001301530653002201543653002101565653001001586653001601596700002101612700003201633700001701665700001801682773010401700856008701804852000901891655001201900IND60552628120221119133153.0161021e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055262812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, Christina10aSeizures of doping substances at the Swiss Border — a descriptive investigation  ap. 359-368.  aThis retrospective study evaluates the content, the destination and the source of 960 postal items seized by the Swiss customs authorities at the Swiss border between 2013 and 2014. The packages were seized because they contained at least one prohibited doping product as identified by the Swiss law on encouraging sports and physical activity. A total number of 1825 different doping products were confiscated from these parcels, accounting for an average of 1.9 doping products per seized item. In 74% of the cases, where seizures were made, anabolic androgenic steroids, mostly testosterone esters, were discovered. An obvious trading channel for doping products was identified in this study. The seized compounds were predominately manufactured in Asian countries, but sent to Switzerland mostly via South Eastern Europe countries. Due to the unique collaboration between the Swiss customs authorities and the national anti-doping agency, this study uncovered an alarming trend of illegal doping product trafficked to Switzerland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aesters 3aphysical activity 3aretrospective studies 3aseizures 3asports 3asteroids 3atestosterone 3aAsia 3aSouthern European region 3aSwitzerland 0aDoping products 0aSeizures 0aAnabolic steroids 0aPeptide hormones 0aTrade 0aSwitzerland1 aKamber, Matthias1 aLentillon-Kaestner, Vanessa1 aKrug, Oliver1 aThevis, Mario0 tForensic science international.g2015 Dec., v. 257 p.359-368dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245012700167300001800294500002000312520177200332592002802104596002102132596004402153596004402197650002502241650001502266650001902281650002502300650001502325650002002340650001602360650001202376650002602388650001702414650002202431650001702453650001802470650002002488650001702508700002402525700002502549700003402574700002802608773013502636856007602771852000902847655001202856IND60786394420221118210054.0220803e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078639442DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.17000792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Christina M.10aComparative transcriptomics indicate changes in cell wall organization and stress response in seedlings during spaceflight  ap. 1219-1231.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plants will play an important role in the future of space exploration as part of bioregenerative life support. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on gene expression in plant development. METHODS: We analyzed the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware during Space Shuttle mission STS‐131. The bioinformatics methods used included RMA (robust multi‐array average), MAS5 (Microarray Suite 5.0), and PLIER (probe logarithmic intensity error estimation). Glycome profiling was used to analyze cell wall composition in the samples. In addition, our results were compared to those of two other groups using the same hardware on the same mission (BRIC‐16). KEY RESULTS: In our BRIC‐16 experiments, we noted expression changes in genes involved in hypoxia and heat shock responses, DNA repair, and cell wall structure between spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls. In addition, glycome profiling supported our expression analyses in that there was a difference in cell wall components between ground control and spaceflight‐grown plants. Comparing our studies to those of the other BRIC‐16 experiments demonstrated that, even with the same hardware and similar biological materials, differences in results in gene expression were found among these spaceflight experiments. CONCLUSIONS: A common theme from our BRIC‐16 space experiments and those of the other two groups was the downregulation of water stress response genes in spaceflight. In addition, all three studies found differential regulation of genes associated with cell wall remodeling and stress responses between spaceflight‐grown and ground control plants.  aPublisher supplied data  aNNX10AF44GcNASA  aDBI‐0421683cNSF Plant Genome Program  aIOS‐0923922cNSF Plant Genome Program 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA repair 3abioinformatics 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3agene expression 3aheat stress 3ahypoxia 3amicroarray technology 3amicrogravity 3aplant development 3aspace flight 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3awater stress1 aSubramanian, Aswati1 aPattathil, Sivakumar1 aCorrell, M.

Therefore, we investigated the dynamics of OC associated with aggregates along a Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) afforestation chronosequence in the Loess Plateau. Soil aggregate size distribution and OC dynamics in bulk soil were analyzed 10, 18, 28, and 42 years after RP afforestation at depths of 0–20 cm and 20–40 cm. Results showed that total macroaggregates (>0.25 mm), mean weight diameter, and geometric mean diameter increased significantly with stand age, after 42 years of afforestation, increased by 433.5%, 437.2%, 302.1% in the 0–20 cm depth, respectively, while microaggregate amounts decreased by 52.9%, and the proportions of silt + clay fraction showed no obvious changes. Long-term afforestation increased OC content and stock, both in bulk soil (245.6% and 222.9% in the 0–20 cm depth, respectively) and soil aggregates. The improvement of soil structure and enrichment of OC stocks were greater at the 0–20 cm depth than the 20–40 cm depth. In addition, small macroaggregates (2–0.25 mm) contained the highest OC content and microaggregates (<0.025 mm) had the highest OC stocks regardless of soil depth and stand age. Across the afforestation chronosequence, OC content and stock in bulk soil positively correlated with large macroaggregate (>2 mm) amounts and small macroaggregate (2–0.25 mm) associated OC dynamics (P < 0.01). These results indicated that changes in bulk soil OC dynamics mainly depend on changes in the proportion of large macroaggregates and in the OC dynamics associated with small macroaggregates after RP afforestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aafforestation 3achronosequences 3aclay fraction 3aenvironmental management 3amicroaggregates 3aorganic carbon 3asilt 3asoil depth 3asoil erosion 3asoil structure 3astand age 3aChina 0aAfforestation 0aAggregates 0aContribution 0aSoil structure 0aSoil depth 0aStand age 0aRobinia pseudoacacia 0asoil organic carbon 0amean weight diameter 0ageometric mean diameter 0amean residence time 0afarmland 0aSoil bulk density 0aturnover rate constant1 aZhong, Zekun1 aLi, Wenjie1 aLiu, Weichao1 aZhang, Xinyi1 aWu, Shaojun1 aRen, Zhaoxuan1 aWu, Qimeng1 aShen, Zhaoyang1 aRen, Chengjie1 aYang, Gaihe1 aHan, Xinhui0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 268 p.110558-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1105583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012000176300001400296520137600310592002801686650002201714650001601736650001901752650002301771650001301794650001301807650003701820650001101857650001901868650002601887650000901913650001801922650002001940650002201960650001301982653002201995653003002017653001902047653001602066700002202082700002402104700002602128700002102154700002402175700001802199773010602217856008602323852000902409655001202418IND60553027320221120140305.0170607e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055302732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, Israel D.10aFormation of carbonated hydroxyapatite films on metallic surfaces using dihexadecyl phosphate–LB film as template  ap. 31-40.  aHydroxyapatite serves as a bioactive material for biomedical purposes, because it shares similarities with the inorganic part of the bone. However, how this material deposits on metallic surfaces using biomimetic matrices remains unclear. In this study, we deposited dihexadecyl phosphate, a phospholipid that bears a simple chemical structure, on stainless steel and titanium surfaces using the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique; we employed the resulting matrix to grow carbonated hydroxyapatite. We obtained the calcium phosphate coating via a two-step process: we immersed the surfaces modified with the LB films into phosphate buffer, and then, we exposed the metal to a solution that simulated the concentration of ions in the human plasma. The latter step generated carbonated hydroxyapatite, the same mineral existing in the bone. The free energy related to the surface roughness and composition increased after we modified the supports. We investigated the film morphology by scanning electron and atomic force microscopies and determined surface composition by infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray. We also studied the role of the surface roughness and the surface chemistry on cell viability. The surface-modified Ti significantly increased osteoblastic cells proliferation, supporting the potential use of these surfaces as osteogenic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abiomimetics 3acell viability 3achemical structure 3acoatings 3acolloids 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahumans 3ahydroxyapatite 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aions 3aphospholipids 3astainless steel 3asurface roughness 3atitanium 0aBiomineralization 0aLangmuir–Blodgett films 0aHydroxyapatite 0aOsteoblasts1 aCruz, Marcos A.E.1 ade Faria, Amanda N.1 aZancanela, Daniela C.1 aSimão, Ana M.S.1 aCiancaglini, Pietro1 aRamos, Ana P.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 June 01, v. 118 p.31-40dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012900174300001400303520115700317592002801474650001201502650001301514650001101527650002401538650002601562650001101588650001801599650002301617650002301640650001001663650001301673650002201686650001601708650001701724650001901741650001001760650003201770650001001802650003101812651001101843700002301854700002901877773013801906856008102044852000902125655001202134IND60627251120221119133114.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062725112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-018-3137-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarabagias, Ioannis K.10aVolatile fingerprints of common and rare honeys produced in Greece: in search of PHVMs with implementation of the honey code  ap. 23-39.  aA non-targeted metabolomic methodology using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in combination with headspace solid-phase microextraction was applied for the identification of pharmaceutical honey volatile metabolites. Common and rare honeys (citrus, fir, honeydew, pine, thyme, asfaka, arbutus, chestnut, and cotton), in a total of 32 samples, were collected from different regions in Greece. Seventy-three volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified and semi-quantified using the internal standard method. Among volatiles, the norisoprenoid 3,4,6,6-tetramethylbicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-ene-2,8-dione, was identified for the first time to contribute to Greek honey aroma. Pharmaceutical VOCs of interest included: terpenes, norisoprenoids benzene derivatives/phenolic volatiles and other compounds. The content of such metabolites was affected by honey’s botanical origin (p < 0.05). The honey code was developed to construe differences among honey varieties with respect to semi-quantitative data of pharmaceutical volatile metabolites. The exploitation of natural organic compounds for the treatment of diseases is of great value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArbutus 3aCastanea 3aCitrus 3abenzene derivatives 3abotanical composition 3acotton 3afood research 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3ahoney 3ahoneydew 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anorisoprenoids 3aodors 3asolid phase microextraction 3athyme 3avolatile organic compounds 3aGreece1 aNikolaou, Christos1 aKarabagias, Vassilios K.0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2019 Jan., v. 245, no. 1 p.23-39dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-018-3137-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245012900153300001800282500002000300520148400320592002801804650001401832650002301846650001501869650001801884650000901902650001901911650002401930650001601954650001101970650001901981650001502000650001502015650002002030700001602050700001702066700001402083700001302097700001502110773013102125856007202256852000902328655001202337IND60653055320221121050425.0190713e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065305532DNAL7 a10.3390/w60926712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Nana10aInvestigation of Rainfall-Runoff Processes and Soil Moisture Dynamics in Grassland Plots under Simulated Rainfall Conditions  ap. 2671-2689.  aJournal Article  aThe characteristics of rainfall-runoff are important aspects of hydrological processes. In this study, rainfall-runoff processes and soil moisture dynamics at different soil depths and slope positions of grassland with two different row spacings (5 cm and 10 cm, respectively, referred to as R5 and R10) were analyzed, by means of a solution of rainfall simulation experiments. Bare land was also considered as a comparison. The results showed that the mechanism of runoff generation was mainly excess infiltration overland flow. The surface runoff amount of R5 plot was greater than that of R10, while the interflow amount of R10 was larger than that of R5 plot, although the differences of the subsurface runoff processes between plots R5 and R10 were little. The effects of rainfall intensity on the surface runoff were significant, but not obvious on the interflow and recession curve, which can be described as a simple exponential equation, with a fitting degree of up to 0.854–0.996. The response of soil moisture to rainfall and evapotranspiration was mainly in the 0–20 cm layer, and the response at the 40 cm layer to rainfall was slower and generally occurred after the rainfall stopped. The upper slope generally responded fastest to rainfall, and the foot of the slope was the slowest. The results presented here could provide insights into understanding the surface and subsurface runoff processes and soil moisture dynamics for grasslands in semi-arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3agrasslands 3aoverland flow 3arain 3arain intensity 3arainfall simulation 3arow spacing 3arunoff 3asemiarid zones 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3asubsurface flow1 aYu, Fuliang1 aLi, Chuanzhe1 aWang, Hao1 aLiu, Jia1 aMu, Wenbin0 tWater.g2014 Sept. 05, v. 6, no. 9 p.2671-2689dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w60926713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012200157300001800279520149200297592002801789650002301817650001501840650002801855650001401883650003801897650001301935650001801948650000901966650001001975650001801985650002402003650001302027650001402040650001502054650001002069700002402079700002502103700001702128773012802145856007402273852000902347655001202356IND60701240820221122010339.0200710e20200709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070124082DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay00787k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayan, Varij12aA proof-of-concept of lateral flow based luteinizing hormone detection in urine for ovulation prediction in buffaloes  ap. 3411-3424.  aWe present a method for the detection of luteinizing hormone (LH) in buffalo urine by using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with novel anti-peptide antibodies against LH (anti LHP) in lateral flow assay format. Buffalo LH is an important reproductive hormone and is a chemically complex glycoprotein. Its surge release precedes ovulation and therefore detecting LH has implications in identifying the ovulation event. Any sensor thus developed for sensing LH may have the potential for predicting ovulation and hence can assist herd managers in making decisions on the timing of artificial insemination. Recombinant LH production is time consuming, difficult and costly. Hence, we identified an epitope peptide sequence in buffalo LH and raised antibodies against it. The chemically synthesized peptide and antibodies were used for developing the sensor. The gold nanoparticles and conjugates were characterized through physicochemical methods which confirmed the binding of peptides and antibodies to the gold nanoparticles. A qualitative ELISA for sensing LH was developed based on competitive binding of gold nanoparticles conjugated with the epitope peptide and LH towards the anti-peptide antibodies against LH. We also further explored the detection of LH in buffalo urine using the gold nanoparticle-LHP conjugate (AuNP-LHP) in dipstick format. These experiments provided a proof-of-concept towards applicability of the LH based sensor for ovulation prediction in buffaloes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aantibodies 3aartificial insemination 3abuffaloes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3aglycoproteins 3agold 3aherds 3aluteinization 3aluteinizing hormone 3ananogold 3aovulation 3aprediction 3aurine1 aSinha, Eshu Singhal1 aOnteru, Suneel Kumar1 aSingh, Dheer0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 July 9, v. 12, no. 26 p.3411-3424dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00787k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009900162300001600261520157500277592002801852650002201880650000901902650001701911650001901928650001801947650001001965650001701975650001201992650002002004650001002024650001102034650001502045650001502060650001402075650001902089650001702108650002802125651001102153653003702164653002202201653002102223653003602244653002602280653001602306700001502322700001902337700001402356700001502370700001402385700001702399700001702416700001502433773012502448856008302573852000902656655001202665IND60532400720221116173548.0190318e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053240072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2014.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHavet, A.10aReview of livestock farmer adaptations to increase forages in crop rotations in western France  ap. 120-127.  aSince the 1960s there has been a global trend toward specializing and intensifying farming systems in order to produce more food. However, harmful environmental consequences have been recognized. Integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLS) are now being reconsidered as a means of improving farm and land sustainability. We suggest that understanding interrelations of ICLS to achieve sustainability requires scrutinizing the way farmers exploit them to adapt their farming system. We used six different case studies covering maritime and semi-maritime regions of France (beef and dairy+crop systems) to describe factors influencing production, environmental, and socio-economic considerations for change in farming practices. Farm surveys and analysis of farmers’ practices and farm time-course of change were framed within the European farming system approach. Transition in the medium-term pointed out new interactions at stake between crops and livestock when farmers developed adaptation to climate changes, introduced grassland in contrast to the general trend of specialization and enhanced feed self-sufficiency. In the medium- and short-term, multifunctionality of crops and crop rotation adjustments, as well as regulation of cropping systems by livestock classes are the main levers of system flexibility. We showed how ICLS increased sustainability and began to notice the positive effects of farm collaboration. Further research is needed in partnership with additional stakeholders to support sustainable development of agriculture at the landscape level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abeef 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3afarm surveys 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aforage 3agrasslands 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3aFrance 0aCrop–livestock farming systems 0aAdaptive capacity 0aSelf-sufficiency 0aCrop–livestock interrelations 0aDifferent time scales 0aFlexibility1 aCoquil, X.1 aFiorelli, J.L.1 aGibon, A.1 aMartel, G.1 aRoche, B.1 aRyschawy, J.1 aSchaller, N.1 aDedieu, B.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 June 01, v. 190 p.120-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012500169300001600294520105800310592002801368650002501396650002101421650002501442650000901467650001201476650001901488650001301507650000901520650001201529650001101541650002201552650001101574650001001585650002001595650001601615650001601631650002101647650002201668650001401690651000901704700002001713700001801733773008801751856008501839990002301924852000901947655001201956IND60092905820221119194740.0141103s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009290582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Young Ho10aLinarin isolated from Buddleja officinalis prevents hydrogen peroxide-induced dysfunction in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells  ap. 112-116.  aThe flowers and leaves buds of Buddleja officinalis MAXIM (Buddlejaceae) are used to treat eye troubles, hernia, gonorrhea and liver troubles in Asia. To elucidate the protective effects of linarin isolated from B. officinalis on the response of osteoblast to oxidative stress, osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were pre-incubated with linarin for 1h before treatment with 0.3mM H₂O₂ for 48h, and markers of osteoblast function and oxidative damage were examined. Linarin significantly (P<0.05) increased cell survival, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, collagen content, calcium deposition, and osteocalcin secretion and decreased the production of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL), protein carbonyl (PCO), and malondialdehyde (MDA) of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. These results demonstrate that linarin can protect osteoblasts against hydrogen peroxide-induced osteoblastic dysfunction and may exert anti-resorptive actions, at least in part, via the reduction of RANKL and oxidative damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBuddleja officinalis 3aScrophulariaceae 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abuds 3acalcium 3acell viability 3acollagen 3aeyes 3aflowers 3ahernia 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3asecretion 3aAsia1 aLee, Young Soon1 aChoi, Eun-mi,0 tCellular immunology.g2011, v. 268, no. 2 p.112-116dElsevier Inc.x0008-87497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245008200155300001800237500002000255520173900275592002802014650001102042650001502053650001602068650002502084650001302109650001102122650002002133650000902153650001602162650002302178650002002201650001802221650001502239650001502254651001102269700001602280700001902296700001602315700001702331773013202348856007202480852000902552655001202561IND60653055520221121102943.0190713e20140926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065305552DNAL7 a10.3390/w61028492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeh, Hsin-Fu10aIdentifying Seasonal Groundwater Recharge Using Environmental Stable Isotopes  ap. 2849-2861.  aJournal Article  aIn this study, the stable isotope values of oxygen and hydrogen were used to identify the seasonal contribution ratios of precipitation to groundwater recharge in the Hualien River basin of eastern Taiwan. The differences and correlations of isotopes in various water bodies were examined to evaluate the groundwater recharge sources for the Hualian River basin and the interrelations between groundwater and surface water. Proportions of recharge sources were calculated based on the results of the mass balance analysis of the isotope composition of hydrogen and oxygen in the basin. Mountain river water accounted for 83% and plain rainfall accounted for 17% of the groundwater recharge in the Huanlian River basin. Using the mean d-values, a comparison of d-values of precipitation and groundwater indicates the groundwater consists of 75.5% wet seasonal sources and 24.5% dry seasonal sources, representing a distinct seasonal variation of groundwater recharge in the study area. Comparisons between hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in rainwater showed that differences in the amount of rainfall resulted in depleted oxygen and hydrogen isotopes for precipitation in wet seasons as compared to dry seasons. The river water contained more depleted hydrogen and oxygen isotopes than was the case for precipitation, implying that the river water mainly came from the upstream catchment. In addition, the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the groundwater slightly deviated from the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic meteoric water line in Huanlian. Therefore, the groundwater in this basin might be a mixture of river water and precipitation, resulting in the effect of the river water recharge being greater than that of rainfall infiltration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adry season 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3aoxygen isotopes 3arain 3ariver water 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3asurface water 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aTaiwan1 aLin, Hung-I1 aLee, Cheng-Haw1 aXu, Guojin,1 aWu, Chi-Shin0 tWater.g2014 Sept. 26, v. 6, no. 10 p.2849-2861dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w61028493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245008400159300002000243520122700263592002801490650001801518650001001536650001701546650002101563650001001584650001901594650001001613650001301623650001301636653002801649653002501677653002401702653002801726653001801754700001301772700005501785773014201840856007901982852000902061655001202070IND60598294920221122060159.0190221e20180605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059829492DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b052132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Meng10aCovalent Organic Polymers for Rapid Fluorescence Imaging of Latent Fingerprints  ap. 21619-21627.  aRapid, simple and highly sensitive identification of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is an important issue related to national security and recognition of potential crimes. Here, we synthesize a series of covalent organic polymers (COPs) with colorful fluorescence (from blue to green, pale yellow, bright yellow, and red) and further investigate their performance for fluorescence imaging of LFPs. Results indicate that the COP materials can be used as fluorescence probes to rapidly visualize the precision substructure of LFPs within 5 s by simply spraying method, and tunable fluorescent color makes the COP probes have a high contrast and low interference for fluorescence imaging of LFPs on different substrates (including glass slides, paper, aluminum foil, plastic, ironware) in different backgrounds. We also further reveal the mechanism of COP probes for fluorescence imaging of LFPs. Importantly, the COP probes show high stability and could successfully achieve the fluorescence imaging for LFPs after aged for 45 days or washed by water. In short, this is the first report on the porous polymers for fluorescence imaging of LFPs and expected that it can be also applied to the fluorescence imaging of other fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum foil 3acolor 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aglass 3aimage analysis 3apaper 3aplastics 3aspraying 0aporous organic polymers 0afluorescence imaging 0alatent fingerprints 0abackground interference 0avisualization1 aGuo, Lin1 aCao, Dapeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6981-77940 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 June 05, v. 10, no. 25 p.21619-21627dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b052133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015400154300001800308520123400326592002801560650001601588650001701604650001901621650001801640650001101658650002601669650002701695650001501722650003301737650002601770650002801796650001001824700001301834700002001847700001901867700001501886773012801901856007402029852000902103655001202112IND60701241220221120125351.0200710e20200709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070124122DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay00859a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yule10aRapid and nondestructive determination of deoxynivalenol (DON) content in wheat using multispectral imaging (MSI) technology with chemometric methods  ap. 3390-3396.  aWheat is susceptible to contamination by deoxynivalenol (DON) which is regarded as a class III carcinogen. In this paper, a rapid and nondestructive method for DON content determination and contamination degree discrimination in wheat was developed by using a multispectral imaging (405–970 nm) system. Genetic algorithm (GA) and principal component analysis (PCA), as preprocessing methods, were used to obtain the best spectral characteristics. The determination model was established by combining preprocessing methods and chemometric methods including partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM) and back propagation neural network (BPNN). The best quantitative determination result was obtained based on GA-SVM with a correlation coefficient of prediction (Rₚ), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 0.9988, 365.3 μg kg⁻¹ and 8.6, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy of contamination degree classification was up to 94.29% in the prediction set by using the PCA-PLS model. The results showed that the combination of multispectral imaging technology and chemometrics was an effective and nondestructive method for the determination of DON in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogens 3achemometrics 3adeoxynivalenol 3aleast squares 3amodels 3amultispectral imagery 3anondestructive methods 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3asupport vector machines 3awheat1 aLiu, Wei1 aZhao, Pengguang1 aLiu, Changhong1 aZheng, Lei0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 July 9, v. 12, no. 26 p.3390-3396dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00859a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245009500163300001400258520079600272592002801068650002101096650001501117650002101132650001301153650001301166650002001179650001501199650002201214650002001236650001501256650002201271650001501293653002001308653004001328653002101368653001401389700001201403700001401415700001201429700001401441700001101455700001201466700001501478700001301493700001301506700001601519773010601535856008601641852000901727655001201736IND60553027920221120140414.0170607e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055302792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, J.12aA novel hydrogen peroxide biosensor based on hemoglobin-collagen-CNTs composite nanofibers  ap. 77-82.  aIn this paper, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were successfully incorporated in the composite composed of hemoglobin (Hb) and collagen using co-electrospinning technology.

However, little is known about cultivation of Spirogyra and even less about large-scale cultivations in closed growth systems. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to elaborate the growth kinetics of Spirogyra sp. in a commercially available and scalable photobioreactor. For this purpose, Spirogyra sp. was grown indoors in distinct flat-panel airlift photobioreactors equipped with culture-flow directing installations. Hereby, special attention was laid on light administration and specific light availability and it was found that Spirogyra sp., in combination with the photobioreactor in question, required high photon-flux densities (100 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ g DW⁻¹) for maximum proliferation which is in accordance with its abundance in epipelagial waters in nature. Applying photon-flux densities of up to 1400 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹, a maximum volumetric productivity and final biomass concentration of 1.15 gDW L⁻¹ day⁻¹ and 14.28 gDW L⁻¹ were achieved, respectively, the highest to be reported for the alga. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first report on the growth of Spirogyra in a flat-panel photobioreactor.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSpirogyra 3aalgae 3abiomass 3afreshwater 3agrowth models 3aphotobioreactors1 aBergmann, Peter1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0507-55300 t3 Biotech.g2018 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.6-6dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-1026-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012300169300001800292500002000310500000900330520150400339592002801843650002001871650001201891650001301903650000901916650002001925650001801945650001801963650001101981650001501992650001302007650002402020700002102044700002102065700001902086773013302105856008402238852000902322655001202331IND60665395720221120070013.0220513e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066539572DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2017.02.01122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaxter, Lisa L.10aStocker Beef Production on Low‐Water‐Input Systems in Response to Legume Inclusion: I. Forage and Animal Responses  ap. 2294-2302.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aThe imminent decline of the Ogallala Aquifer is encouraging producers in the Southern High Plains (SHP) to seek innovative alternatives to safeguard against dramatic losses of income when pumping capacity is insufficient for irrigated crops. Previous research demonstrated the success of perennial forage grasses in this region, but crude protein (CP) was the limiting factor in improving performance of grazing beef (Bos taurus L.) steers. Possible solutions include integrating legumes into existing warm‐season grass pastures and managing small areas of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) as a protein bank where irrigation resources can be concentrated. The objective of this research was to compare animal performance in a grass‐legume pasture system employing regionally novel forage combinations and grazing techniques to a grass‐only system in the water‐limited SHP. Three years of research concluded that inclusion of legumes increased CP (P < 0.01) and increased digestibility measures of forages in the grass‐legume system. Longer, less frequent rotations into the protein bank resulted in higher average daily gains in Years 2 and 3 (P < 0.05) compared with Year 1 of grass‐legume. This translated to higher seasonal liveweight gain per hectare in the grass‐legume system in each trial year (P < 0.01). The forage‐livestock systems created in this research will serve as alternatives for producers transitioning from irrigated row crops into more resource‐sustaining systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aaquifers 3abeef 3abeef production 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3aincome 3airrigation 3apastures 3awarm season grasses1 aWest, Charles P.1 aBrown, C.

This disease causes pod malformation due to hypertrophy of seed tissues; in addition, colonized cells filled with teliospores give seeds a smutted mass appearance. Incidence may reach up to 52% in commercial plots, with up to 35% yield losses. Cultural management strategies and chemical treatment have not been effective; therefore, growing resistant varieties is likely to be the most effective control method for this disease. This study is aimed to identify sources of resistance in wild Arachis and to develop pre‐breeding materials for transferring the trait to cultivated peanut. After 3 yr of field trials using a randomized complete block design, the seven accessions of wild species assayed were resistant to smut. An amphidiploid [A. correntina (Burkart) Krapov. & W.C. Greg. × A. cardenasii Krapov. & W.C. Greg.] × A. batizocoi Krapov. & W.C. Greg.)⁴× was obtained and subsequently crossed with and experimental line of A. hypogaea for the development of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (89 lines). The RIL population showed a high phenotypic variability for resistance to peanut smut. The amphidiploid and 22 RILs were highly resistant, illustrating the effective transmission of resistance to peanut smut from the wild diploids into A. hypogaea. The development of RILs with resistance derived from wild species is a significant step towards the development of new peanut cultivars with different sources of resistance to peanut smut.  aPublisher supplied data  cFundación Maní Argentino (Argentine Peanut Foundation)  cCONICET (National Scientific and Technical Research Council)  cUSDA‐ARS  cCriadero El Carmen (Nursery El Carmen)  cANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica)  cMINCyT Córdoba (Ministry of Science and Technology of Córdoba) 3aArachis hypogaea 3aThecaphora 3aabnormal development 3aamphidiploidy 3achemical treatment 3acontrol methods 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3ainbred lines 3aindustry 3aintrogression 3apeanuts 3aphenotypic variation 3asmut diseases 3ateliospores 3aArgentina1 aBressano, Marina1 aTeich, Ingrid1 aBalzarini, Mónica G.1 aArias, Renee S.1 aManifesto, María M.1 aCostero, Beatriz P.1 aOddino, Claudio1 aSoave, Sara J.1 aSoave, Juan A.1 aButeler, Mario I.1 aMassa, Alicia N.1 aSeijo, J.

This study aimed to explore the roles and mechanism of long noncoding RNA HAGLROS in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury in pneumonia. The HAGLROS expression in serum of patients with acute stage pneumonia was detected. To induce pulmonary injury, WI-38 human lung fibroblasts were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The HAGLROS expressions in LPS-treated WI-38 cells and the effects of HAGLROS knockdown on the viability, apoptosis, and autophagy of LPS-induced cells were detected. Moreover, the regulatory relationship between HAGLROS and miR-100 was explored as well as the functional targets of miR-100 were identified. Furthermore, the regulatory relationship between miR-100 and PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway was elucidated. LncRNA HAGLROS was higher expressed in serum of patients with acute stage pneumonia compared with that in serum of healthy control. LPS caused WI-38 cell injury and increased HAGLROS levels. Downregulation of HAGLROS alleviated LPS-induced cell injury via increasing cell viability, and inhibiting apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between HAGLROS and miR-100, and the effects of HAGLROS downregulation on LPS-induced apoptosis and autophagy in WI-38 cells were by regulation of miR-100. Furthermore, NFΚB3 was verified as a functional target of miR-100 and effects of miR-100 inhibition on LPS-induced WI-38 cell injury were alleviated by knockdown of NFΚB3. Besides, Knockdown of HAGLROS inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Our findings reveal that downregulation of HAGLROS may alleviate LPS-induced inflammatory injury in WI-38 cells via modulating miR-100/NF-κB axis. HAGLROS/miR-100/NF-κB axis may provide a new strategy for treating acute stage of pneumonia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3ablood serum 3acell viability 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3anon-coding RNA 3apathogens 3apatients 3apneumonia 0aPneumonia 0aHAGLROS 0amiR-100 0aPI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway1 aHan, Tao1 aShi, Shaomin1 aChen, Enqi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 June 07, v. 500, no. 3 p.589-596dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245011000166300001800276500002000294520187900314592002802193596001602221596007902237596007202316596001102388596002302399650002702422650001502449650001302464650001602477650001602493650000902509700002702518700002302545700002102568773013602589856007602725852000902801655001202810IND60786395220221118210756.0220803e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078639522DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.17002662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiguel, M.

We propose that seedlings emerging from seeds with a permanent pappus (dispersing seeds) are stronger competitors than those emerging from seeds without a pappus (nondispersing seeds) because dispersing seeds are larger and germinate faster than nondispersing seeds in Centaurea solstitialis. METHODS: We conducted a competition experiment with both seed morphs, in which we recorded emergence rate and proportion, estimated seed dispersal by wind (anemochory) and by mammals (exozoochory), and measured size and abundance of seed morphs. KEY RESULTS: We found that seedlings from pappus seeds had greater competitive abilities than those from non‐pappus seeds. Similarly, pappus seedlings emerged at much faster rates and larger proportions than non‐pappus seedlings. Pappus seeds were larger, were more numerous, and displayed improved exozoochory compared to non‐pappus seeds. Anemochory was poor for both seed morphs. CONCLUSIONS: We found support for our hypothesis, raising in turn the possibility that competition and colonization are positively associated in seed morphs of heterocarpic species with enhanced exozoochory of larger seeds. These findings are not consistent with those from heterocarpic species with enhanced anemochory of smaller seeds or slower‐germinating seeds. Our results additionally suggest that pappus and non‐pappus seeds of C. solstitialis display a task‐division strategy in which pappus morphs colonize and preempt unoccupied sites through improved dispersal and fast and large emergence of seedlings with increased competitive abilities, whereas non‐pappus morphs promote site persistence through delayed germination and dormancy. This strategy may contribute to the success of C. solstitialis in highly variable environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a203cUNLPam  aPIP 11420080100392cNational Council for Scientific and Technical Research  aPRH PICT 0287cNational Agency for Promoting Science and Technology  cUNLPam  cNSERC DG in Canada 3aCentaurea solstitialis 3aanemochory 3adormancy 3aepizoochory 3agermination 3awind1 aLortie, Christopher J.1 aCallaway, Ragan M.1 aHierro, José L.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Sept., v. 104, no. 9 p.1323-1333dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.17002663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011000170300001400280500001500294520114200309592002801451650000901479650001101488650001301499650001601512650001301528650001101541650001301552650000701565650001501572650001901587650001901606653001401625653001101639653001601650653001001666653001101676653001201687653001201699700001401711700001701725700002201742700001801764773010601782856008601888852000901974655001201983IND60553028320221120100526.0170607e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055302832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Xiaopeng10aInfluence of sulfate and phosphate on the deposition of plasmid DNA on silica and alumina-coated surfaces  ap. 83-89.  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of sulfate and phosphate on the deposition kinetics of plasmid DNA on solid surfaces was examined at a constant 300mM ionic strength in both NaCl–Na2SO4 and NaCl–NaH2PO4–Na2HPO4 mixing solutions with varied sulfate and phosphate concentrations at pH 6.0 by utilizing a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Two representative solid surfaces, both silica and alumina-coated surfaces, were concerned in this study. To better understand the effects of sulfate and phosphate on plasmid DNA deposition, QCM-D data were complemented by diffusion coefficients and zeta potentials of DNA as a function of examined solution conditions. The presence of sulfate and phosphate in solutions decreased the deposition efficiencies of plasmid DNA on both silica and alumina-coated surfaces. Moreover, the deposition efficiencies decreased with increasing concentrations of sulfate/phosphate. With sulfate/phosphate ions present in solutions, the deposition kinetics of plasmid DNA on both silica and alumina-coated surfaces were mainly controlled by classic Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aions 3amixing 3asulfates 3adiffusivity 3acolloids 3aquartz 3aplasmids 3apH 3aphosphates 3aionic strength 3azeta potential 0aPhosphate 0asilica 0aPlasmid DNA 0aQCM-D 0aSilica 0aSulfate 0aAlumina1 aHan, Peng1 aYang, Haiyan1 aKim, Hyŏn-jŏng,1 aTong, Meiping0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 June 01, v. 118 p.83-89dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.03.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245010200179300001600281520122000297592002801517650001901545650002201564650001701586650002101603650001501624650001101639650002201650650001301672650001101685650002301696650003101719650001401750650001701764650001501781650001101796650001001807650001701817653002001834653002901854653002301883653002901906653002701935653001601962700002101978700002001999700001802019700002402037773010402061856008502165852000902250655001202259IND60593304420221119043437.0190131e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059330442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.03.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayarsaikhan, Uranchimeg10aFate of leaf litter deposits and impacts on oxygen availability in bank filtration column studies  ap. 495-500.  aDegradation of particulate organic carbon (POC) such as leaf litter might deplete dissolved oxygen within the upper layers of bank filtration, an efficient and robust barrier for pathogens and for various organic micro-pollutants (OMP) in water supply systems worldwide. The degradation of OMP during bank filtration depends on the redox conditions. The present study aimed at identifying the impacts and fates of different local leaves on the oxygen consumption and the possible biological degradation of indicator OMP. Oxygen concentrations initially decreased within the columns from around 8 mg/L in the influent to low concentrations indicating extensive consumption within a short travel distance. Still a substantial oxygen consumption was observed after 250 days. OMP concentrations were not significantly affected by the microbial processes. A layer of calcium carbonate crystallites was observed on the POC layer. Some leaf fragments appeared to be persistant towards degradation and the carbon content relative to nitrogen and sulfur contents decreased within 250 days. The results demonstrate that trees at bank filtration sites might have a strong long-term impact on the subsurface redox conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acalcium carbonate 3acrystallites 3adissolved oxygen 3afiltration 3aleaves 3along term effects 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aparticulate organic carbon 3apathogens 3aplant litter 3apollutants 3asulfur 3atrees 3awater supply 0aBank filtration 0aManaged aquifer recharge 0aOxygen consumption 0aOrganic micro-pollutants 0aNatural organic matter 0aLeaf litter1 aFilter, Josefine1 aGernert, Ulrich1 aJekel, Martin1 aRuhl, Aki Sebastian0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 July, v. 164 p.495-500dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016700170300001500337520120100352592002801553650000801581650003501589650003601624650001301660650002101673650001601694653002201710653002101732653000801753653002301761653002401784700001601808700001801824700001601842700002201858773010701880856008601987852000902073655001202082IND60553028420221120100702.0170607e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055302842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, J.P.10aConformational changes of DNA in the presence of 12-s-12 gemini surfactants (s=2 and 10). Role of the spacer's length in the interaction surfactant-polynucleotide  ap. 90-100.  aA multifaceted study on the interaction of calf-thymus DNA with two different cationic gemini surfactants alkanediyl-α-ω-bis(dodecyldimethyl-amonium)bromide, 12-s-12,2Br− (with s=2, G2, and 10, G10) was carried out. The measurements were done at different molar ratios X=[surfactant]/[DNA]. Results show two different conformational changes in DNA: a first compaction of the polynucleotide corresponding to a partial conformational (not total) change of DNA from an extended coil state to a globular state that happens at the lower molar ratio X. A second change corresponds to a breaking of the partial condensation, that is, the transition from the compacted state to a new more extended conformation (for the higher X values) different to the initial extension. According to circular dichroism spectra and dynamic light scattering measurements, this new state of DNA seems to be similar to a ψ-phase. Measurements confirm that interactions involved in the compaction are different to those previously obtained for the analog surfactant CTAB. X values at which the conformational changes happen depend on the length of the spacer in the surfactant along with the charge of the polar heads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acolloids 3alight scattering 3asurfactants 0aGemini surfactant 0aDNA condensation 0aAFM 0aCircular dichroism 0aMelting temperature1 aMarrón, E.1 aMartín, V.I.1 aMoyá, M.L.1 aLopez-Cornejo, P.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 June 01, v. 118 p.90-100dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245008500211300001600296506007600312520209200388592002802480506003702508650005302545650001702598650001402615650001602629650001102645650001302656650002402669651001802693653001302711653002502724653002702749653001602776700002002792700002502812700002902837700001702866773010402883856008502987852000903072655001203081IND60593304520221207051427.0190131e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059330452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.03.0352doi7 aPMC59179442pmcid7 a296253412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodge, Laura E.10aMedications as a potential source of exposure to parabens in the U.S. population  ap. 580-584.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUse of paraben-containing medications has been shown to be associated with urinary paraben concentrations among couples undergoing fertility treatment, but it is unknown whether this association is also present among the general population.A list of prescription medications of interest was developed based on their likelihood of containing parabens and the ability to identify users in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); alendronate, escitalopram oxalate, fluoxetine, and olanzapine were chosen. Participants reported whether they had used each medication in the past month. Linear regression models were used to compare model-based mean urinary concentrations of each paraben among users and non-users of these four medications.A total of 10,302 respondents were included in the analysis, 265 (2.6%) of whom had reported using a paraben-containing prescription medication in the previous month. Users of alendronate had mean concentrations of ethyl paraben that were approximately three-fold higher than non-users (p ≥ 0.001 in unadjusted and adjusted models), which was likely due to three participants with very high concentrations. No other differences in paraben concentrations were found for any of the medications of interest (all p ≥ 0.13). Compared to non-users, a significantly greater proportion of alendronate users had butyl and ethyl paraben concentrations above the 95th percentile (17.8% and 12.3%, respectively) compared to non-users (5.0% and 5.0%, respectively; both p ≤ 0.01), despite ethyl paraben not being an expected ingredient in the brand name formulation of alendronate.Despite previous work showing that medications can be an important source of paraben exposure, there was no clear overall evidence of associations between the use of paraben-containing medications and increases in urinary paraben concentrations among participants in NHANES 2005–2012. These results highlight the difficulties inherent in proper assessment of exposures with short half-lives based on a single cross-sectional biologic sample.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3adrug therapy 3ahalf life 3aingredients 3amodels 3aoxalates 3aregression analysis 3aUnited States 0aParabens 0aEnvironmental health 0aEnvironmental exposure 0aMedications1 aChoi, Jee Woong1 aKelley, Katherine E.1 aHerńandez-D́iaz, Sonia1 aHauser, Russ0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 July, v. 164 p.580-584dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01481naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009400173300001400267520025600281592002800537650003000565650001000595650001100605650001100616650002500627653003000652653002900682700001800711700002100729700001800750700001700768700002300785700002100808700001700829700001700846700002200863773009200885856008500977852000901062655001201071IND60552127720221123023222.0161020e20151010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055212772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.06.4122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Hidetoshi10aComplete genome sequence of Bifidobacterium angulatum JCM 7096T isolated from human feces  ap. 10-11.  aBifidobacterium angulatum JCM 7096T was isolated from human feces.

The resulting protein glycoconjugates can serve important functions in biology. However, their vast complexity complicates the study of their structures, interactions, and functions. There is now a growing appreciation of the need to study glycans and proteins together as complete entities, as the sum of these two components can exhibit unique functions. In this review, we discuss the growing forestry toolbox to characterize the structure, interactions, and biological functions of protein glycoconjugates, as well as the potential payouts of understanding and controlling these enigmatic biomolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforestry 3aforests 3aglycoconjugates 3aglycoproteomics 3aglycosylation 3aleaves 3apolysaccharides 3aproteome 0aglycosylation 0aglycoproteomics 0aglycobiology 0aglycoconjugates1 aHassan, Abdullah A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7143-61221 aHuang, Mia L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9909-95540 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2022 June, v. 47, no. 6 p.492-505dElsevier LtdwJournal:6328x0968-00047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2022.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245015800168300001600326520096400342592002801306650004001334650002701374650002901401650001701430650001501447650002801462650000701490650001001497650001101507700002401518700001801542700001901560773011301579856005501692852000901747655001201756IND50067418020221120065345.0130626e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006741802DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01124.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYap, N.A.14aThe incidence of killer activity of non‐Saccharomyces yeasts towards indigenous yeast species of grape must: potential application in wine fermentation  ap. 381-389.  aFourteen killer yeasts were assayed for their ability to kill species of yeast that are commonly associated with fermenting grape must and wine.

At a pH value comparable with those of wine ferments, pH 3·5, the incidence of killer‐sensitive interactions was reduced by 70% across all the yeasts. Williopsis saturnus var. mrakii CBS 1707 exhibited the broadest killing range at the lower pH, killing more than half of the tester strains. Intraspecific variation in sensitivity to killer yeasts was observed in all species where more than one strain was tested.

Habitat quality may however prevail over the effects of fragment area and isolation, especially for mobile animals such as butterflies. To test this hypothesis we surveyed butterfly communities in 36 deciduous forest fragments embedded in a conifer plantation matrix, along two orthogonal gradients of fragment area and isolation. We also sampled eight deciduous riparian forests to compare the complete pool of forest butterflies, expected to be found in riparian forests, to the composition of deciduous fragments. We quantified the effects of deciduous woodland area, isolation and quality on total and forest butterfly richness, community composition and several Community-Weighted Mean traits known to mediate butterfly responses to habitat fragmentation. For the 36 fragments, forest butterfly richness and community composition were not affected by fragment area or isolation but by habitat quality, especially host-plant composition. Riparian forests had higher forest butterfly richness and hosted more habitat specialists, with higher sensitivity to temperature extremes, than deciduous forest remnants. We thus provide new evidence that habitat quality can prevail over fragment area and isolation in shaping the composition of butterfly communities in mosaic landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3abutterflies 3acommunity structure 3aconifers 3adeciduous forests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3alandscapes 3ariparian forests 3atemperature 3awoodlands 0aCommunity-Weighted Mean traits 0aForest patch area 0aLandscape matrix 0aLepidoptera Rhopalocera 0aPine plantation 0aWoodland connectivity1 aBarnagaud, Jean-Yves1 aJactel, Hervé1 aBarbaro, Luc0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 357 p.171-180dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245009200214520160000306592002801906650001901934650002001953650001001973650000901983650001201992650000902004653000802013653001102021653002902032653001502061653001802076653002402094653002402118700006902142700001802211700002202229700006102251700006102312700002302373700006602396700005902462700006502521700001702586700002002603773011702623856008702740852000902827655001202836IND60743720620221118224331.0210812e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074372062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2021.1053932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumpulainen, Pekka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4121-270710aDog behaviour classification with movement sensors placed on the harness and the collar  aDog owners’ understanding of the daily behaviour of their dogs may be enhanced by movement measurements that can detect repeatable dog behaviour, such as levels of daily activity and rest as well as their changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning methods utilising accelerometer and gyroscope data provided by wearable movement sensors in classification of seven typical dog activities in a semi-controlled test situation. Forty-five middle to large sized dogs participated in the study. Two sensor devices were attached to each dog, one on the back of the dog in a harness and one on the neck collar. Altogether 54 features were extracted from the acceleration and gyroscope signals divided in two-second segments. The performance of four classifiers were compared using features derived from both sensor modalities. and from the acceleration data only. The results were promising; the movement sensor at the back yielded up to 91 % accuracy in classifying the dog activities and the sensor placed at the collar yielded 75 % accuracy at best. Including the gyroscope features improved the classification accuracy by 0.7–2.6 %, depending on the classifier and the sensor location. The most distinct activity was sniffing, whereas the static postures (lying on chest, sitting and standing) were the most challenging behaviours to classify, especially from the data of the neck collar sensor.

The mean size and the surface morphology of both nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. The pH of the point of zero charge (pHₚzc) of both Fe₃O₄ and IL–Fe₃O₄ were obtained based on the experimental curves corresponding to the immersion technique. Experimental results were obtained under the optimum operational conditions of: 40 mg of nanoparticle and contact time of 10 minutes with an initial concentration of the vitamins of 20 mg L⁻¹. The isotherm evaluations revealed that the Freundlich model attained better fits to the equilibrium data than the Dubinin–Radushkevich model. The maximum obtained adsorption capacities of folic acid, riboflavin and ascorbic acid were 22.5, 4.8 and 6.9 mg per gram of adsorbent, respectively. The adsorption capacities of the vitamins were found to be dependent on their chemical structures, pH of the solution and temperature. The applicability of pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models was estimated on the basis of comparative analysis of the corresponding rate parameters, equilibrium adsorption capacity and correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both adsorption processes of folic acid and ascorbic acid were endothermic and vitamins could be desorbed from IL–Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles by using NaCl solution at pH 3.0 for recycling the nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aascorbic acid 3achemical structure 3aendothermy 3afolic acid 3aionic liquids 3airon oxides 3akinetics 3amagnetism 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3arecycling 3ariboflavin 3asodium chloride 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAsadi, Mozaffar1 aAbsalan, Ghodratollah0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 Jan. 17, v. 6, no. 3 p.798-806dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41543k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245008800191300001400279520098600293592002801279650001101307650002301318650001301341650001201354650001301366650001101379650001101390650001601401650001901417650000901436650001901445650001301464650003401477650001201511650002101523650005001544650003501594650003201629650002801661653001101689653002101700653002401721700002101745773008701766856008401853852000901937655001201946IND60086735720221121041919.0160903e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673572DNAL7 a234667352pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeindl, George A.14aThe effects of aluminum and nickel in nectar on the foraging behavior of bumblebees  ap. 78-81.  aMetals in soil are known to negatively affect the health of many groups of organisms, but it is unclear whether they can affect plant-pollinator interactions, and whether pollinators that visit plants growing on contaminated soils are at risk of ingesting potentially toxic resources. We address whether the presence of metals in nectar alters foraging behavior by bumblebees by manipulating nectar with one of two common soil contaminants (Al or Ni) in flowers of Impatiens capensis (Balsaminaceae). While the presence of Al in nectar did not influence foraging patterns by bumblebees, flowers containing Ni nectar solutions were visited for shorter time periods relative to controls, and discouraged bees from visiting nearby Ni-contaminated flowers. However, because bumblebees still visited these flowers, they likely ingested a potentially toxic resource. Our findings suggest that soil metals could cascade to negatively affect pollinators in metal contaminated environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aImpatiens capensis 3aaluminum 3aflowers 3aforaging 3anectar 3anickel 3apollinators 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3asoil pollution 3atoxicity 2aAluminumxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aAnimals 2aBeesxphysiology 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effects 2aNickelxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aPlant Nectarxchemistry 0aMetals 0aNectar chemistry 0aPollinator behavior1 aAshman, Tia-Lynn0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 June, v. 177 p.78-81dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010500158500001400263520125300277592002801530650001501558650002001573650001001593650002301603700001901626700001801645773011801663856007401781852000901855655001201864IND60704508720221120113648.0200724e20200512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070450872DNAL7 a10.3390/w120513642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Mengning 12aA Two-Stage LP-NLP Methodology for the Least-Cost Design and Operation of Water Distribution Systems  aNAL-light  aThis paper presents a two-stage method for simultaneous least-cost design and operation of looped water distribution systems (WDSs). After partitioning the network into a chord and spanning trees, in the first stage, a reformulated linear programming (LP) method is used to find the least cost design of a WDS for a given set of flow distribution. In the second stage, a non-linear programming (NLP) method is used to find a new flow distribution that reduces the cost of the WDS operation given the WDS design obtained in stage one. The following features of the proposed two-stage method make it more appealing compared to other methods: (1) the reformulated LP stage can consistently reduce the penalty cost when designing a WDS under multiple loading conditions; (2) robustness as the number of loading conditions increases; (3) parameter tuning is not required; (4) the method reduces the computational burden significantly when compared to meta-heuristic methods; and (5) in oppose to an evolutionary “black box” based methodology such as a genetic algorithm, insights through analytical sensitivity analysis, while the algorithm progresses, are handy. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using two WDSs case studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adetection limit 3awater 3awater distribution1 aHoush, Mashor 1 aOstfeld, Avi 0 tWater.g2020 May 12, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120513643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245012700209300001600336506007600352520101200428592002801440506003701468650001601505650002401521650002501545650001301570650003601583650001101619650003401630650001401664650001001678650001001688650001101698650001201709651001001721700002701731700002201758700001701780700001901797700002801816700002501844700001801869773011701887856007702004852000902081655001202090IND60690433220221207092031.0200426e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069043322DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.6.4.139122doi7 aPMC31423772pmcid7 a214120472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkar, Tuhin Subhra10aBiochemical characterization of compatible plant-viral interactionbA case study with a Begomovirus-Kenaf host-pathosystem  ap. 501-509.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aYellow vein mosaic disease of mesta, a compatible plant virus interaction poses a serious threat to mesta cultivation in India. Plants respond to invasion by pathogens with multi component defense responses particularly in incompatible interaction. With the aim of understanding, a biochemical approach was attempted to study the cellular redox status in early stages of yellow vein mosaic virus infection associated with different age’s plant of Hibiscus cannabinus. Comparative analysis of GSH and GSSG content in infected and control plant of different ages indicated that infected plants are under oxidative or nitrosative stress condition. A significant change was observed in Glutathione Reductase, Catalase and Ascorbate Peroxidase level in early stage of infection. We also showed microscopic evidence of nitrosylated thiols in infected leaves, stems and roots of H. cannabinus. Furthermore, we identified few defense related proteins in infected plant using MALDI TOF mass spectrometric analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBegomovirus 3aHibiscus cannabinus 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aleaves 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3apathogens 3aroots 3astems 3athiols 3aviruses 3aIndia1 aBhattacharjee, Arindam1 aMajumdar, Uddalak1 aRoy, Anirban1 aMaiti, Debasis1 aGoswamy, Achintya Mohan1 aGhosh, Subrata Kumar1 aGhosh, Sanjay0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 6, no. 4 p.501-509dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.4.139123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100002200159245009000181300001600271500000900287520170900296592002802005650001302033650000902046650001302055650002302068650002102091650001802112650001602130650002202146650001902168650001602187650001702203650001802220650001002238650002502248650001802273650001602291650002102307650001202328650001302340650001102353650001302364650003202377650002202409650001002431650002402441651001802465700001902483700002502502700002302527700002102550700002302571700002402594773019202618852000902810856007702819655001202896IND4433477720221121235816.0191028e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443347772DNAL7 a201768202pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2009.02832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBremer, Virgil R.10aEmissions Savings in the Corn-Ethanol Life Cycle from Feeding Coproducts to Livestock  ap. 472-482.  aepub  aEnvironmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from corn (Zea mays L.)-ethanol production require accurate assessment methods to determine emissions savings from coproducts that are fed to livestock. We investigated current use of coproducts in livestock diets and estimated the magnitude and variability in the GHG emissions credit for coproducts in the corn-ethanol life cycle. The coproduct GHG emissions credit varied by more than twofold, from 11.5 to 28.3 g CO₂e per MJ of ethanol produced, depending on the fraction of coproducts used without drying, the proportion of coproduct used to feed beef cattle (Bos taurus) vs. dairy or swine (Sus scrofa), and the location of corn production. Regional variability in the GHG intensity of crop production and future livestock feeding trends will determine the magnitude of the coproduct GHG offset against GHG emissions elsewhere in the corn-ethanol life cycle. Expansion of annual U.S. corn-ethanol production to 57 billion liters by 2015, as mandated in current federal law, will require feeding of coproduct at inclusion levels near the biological limit to the entire U.S. feedlot cattle, dairy, and swine herds. Under this future scenario, the coproduct GHG offset will decrease by 8% from current levels due to expanded use by dairy and swine, which are less efficient in use of coproduct than beef feedlot cattle. Because the coproduct GHG credit represents 19 to 38% of total life cycle GHG emissions, accurate estimation of the coproduct credit is important for determining the net impact of corn-ethanol production on atmospheric warming and whether corn-ethanol producers meet state- and national-level GHG emissions regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3abiofuels 3aethanol production 3agreenhouse gases 3agas emissions 3ameasurement 3awaste utilization 3acattle feeding 3abeef cattle 3adairy cattle 3aswine feeding 3aswine 3alaws and regulations 2aAir Pollution 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBiofuels 2aCattle 2aDairying 2aEthanolxchemical synthesis 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aSwine 2aZea maysxchemistry 3aUnited States1 aLiska, Adam J.1 aKlopfenstein, Terry,1 aErickson, Galen E.1 aYang, Haishun S.1 aWalters, Daniel T.1 aCassman, Kenneth G.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2010 Mar., v. 39, no. 2 p.472-482dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2009.02833Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03578naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009700166300001600263500001100279520226600290592002802556650001302584650001302597650001202610650001102622650001102633650000902644650001302653650001302666650001902679650001602698650001602714650001902730650001102749650000902760650001102769650002202780650001802802650002302820650001702843651001002860700001902870773011702889856008103006852000903087655001203096IND60515357320221116201438.0160313e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051535732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-015-9730-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Dipankar12aA decade of investigations on groundwater arsenic contamination in Middle Ganga Plain, India  ap. 315-337.  aReview  aGroundwater arsenic (As) load in excess of drinking limit (50 µg L⁻¹) in the Gangetic Plains was first detected in 2002. Though the menace was known since about two decades from the downstream part of the plains in the Bengal Basin, comprising of Lower Ganga Plain and deltaic plains of Ganga–Brahmaputra–Meghna River system, little thought was given to its possible threat in the upstream parts in the Gangetic Plains beyond Garo-Rajmahal Hills. The contamination in Bengal Basin has become one of the extensively studied issues in the world and regarded as the severest case of health hazard in the history of mankind. The researches and investigations in the Gangetic Plains during the last decade (2003–2013) revealed that the eastern half of the plains, also referred as Middle Ganga Plain (MGP), is particularly affected by contamination, jeopardising the shallow aquifer-based drinking water supply. The present paper reviews researches and investigations carried out so far in MGP by various research institutes and government departments on wide array of issues of groundwater As such as its spatio-temporal variation, mobilisation paths, water level behaviour and flow regime, configuration of contaminated and safe aquifers and their recharge mechanism. Elevated conc. of groundwater As has been observed in grey and dark grey sediments of Holocene age (Newer Alluvium) deposited in a fluvio-lacustrine environment in the floodplain of the Ganga and most of its northern tributaries from Himalayas. Older Alluvium, comprising Pleistocene brownish yellow sediment, extending as deeper aquifers in Newer Alluvium areas, is low in groundwater As. Similarities and differences on issues between the MGP and the Bengal Basin have been discussed. The researches point towards the mobilisation process as reductive dissolution of iron hydroxide coating, rich in adsorbed As, mediated by microbial processes. The area is marked with shallow water level (<8.0 m below ground) with ample monsoonal recharge. The infiltrated rainwater and percolating water from surface water bodies carry organic carbon from sediments (particularly from the clay plugs in abandoned channels), abetting microbial processes, spread of anoxic front and release of As.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvium 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3abasins 3acarbon 3aclay 3acoatings 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3afloodplains 3agroundwater 3ahealth hazards 3apeople 3arain 3arivers 3aspatial variation 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3awater supply 3aIndia1 aSahu, Sudarsan0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2016 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.315-337dSpringer Netherlandsx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-015-9730-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03826naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100005800187245013200245300001800377506007600395520244500471592002802916506003702944650001602981650001302997650002003010650001103030650004403041650002203085650001303107650001603120700002403136700005303160773013703213856008103350852000903431655001203440IND60616357720221207060411.0181020e20180913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061635772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b068782doi7 aPMC63146812pmcid7 a302115522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoos, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7062-785110aDetermination of Long-Range Distances by Fast Magic-Angle-Spinning Radiofrequency-Driven ¹⁹F–¹⁹F Dipolar Recoupling NMR  ap. 9302-9313.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNanometer-range distances are important for restraining the three-dimensional structure and oligomeric assembly of proteins and other biological molecules. Solid-state NMR determination of protein structures typically utilizes ¹³C–¹³C and ¹³C–¹⁵N distance restraints, which can only be measured up to ∼7 Å because of the low gyromagnetic ratios of these nuclear spins. To extend the distance reach of NMR, one can harvest the power of ¹⁹F, whose large gyromagnetic ratio in principle allows distances up to 2 nm to be measured. However, ¹⁹F possesses large chemical shift anisotropies (CSAs) as well as large isotropic chemical shift dispersions, which pose challenges to dipolar coupling measurements. Here, we demonstrate ¹⁹F–¹⁹F distance measurements at high magnetic fields under fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) using radiofrequency-driven dipolar recoupling (RFDR). We show that ¹⁹F–¹⁹F cross-peaks for distances up to 1 nm can be readily observed in two-dimensional ¹⁹F–¹⁹F correlation spectra using less than 5 ms of RFDR mixing. This efficient ¹⁹F–¹⁹F dipolar recoupling is achieved using practically accessible MAS frequencies of 15–55 kHz, moderate ¹⁹F radio frequency field strengths, and no ¹H decoupling. Experiments and simulations show that the fastest polarization transfer for aromatic fluorines with the highest distance accuracy is achieved using either fast MAS (e.g., 60 kHz) with large pulse duty cycles (>50%) or slow MAS with strong ¹⁹F pulses. Fast MAS considerably reduces relaxation losses during the RFDR π-pulse train, making finite-pulse RFDR under fast-MAS the method of choice. Under intermediate MAS frequencies (25–40 kHz) and intermediate pulse duty cycles (15–30%), the ¹⁹F CSA tensor orientation has a quantifiable effect on the polarization transfer rate; thus, the RFDR buildup curves encode both distance and orientation information. At fast MAS, the impact of CSA orientation is minimized, allowing pure distance restraints to be extracted. We further investigate how relayed transfer and dipolar truncation in multifluorine environments affect polarization transfer. This fast-MAS ¹⁹F RFDR approach is complementary to ¹⁹F spin diffusion for distance measurements and will be the method of choice under high-field fast-MAS conditions that are increasingly important for protein structure determination by solid-state NMR.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adispersions 3aisotropy 3amagnetic fields 3amixing 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein structure 3aproteins 3aradio waves1 aMandala, Venkata S.1 aHong, Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5255-58580 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 13, v. 122, no. 40 p.9302-9313dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b068783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012700166300001200293500001900305520135500324592002801679650004401707650002101751650001501772650001501787650001901802650001901821650002001840650001901860650001101879650000701890650002301897650001301920650001001933700003201943700002801975700003802003700001602041700006402057773013002121856008302251852000902334655001202343IND60718401520221121235859.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071840152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-020-01326-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKua, Tze Ling10aAquatic plant, Ipomoea aquatica, as a potential low-cost adsorbent for the effective removal of toxic methyl violet 2B dye  ap. 243.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIpomoea aquatica (IA) was investigated for its potential as a low-cost adsorbent to remove toxic methyl violet 2B (MV2B) dye in aqueous solutions. Optimising parameters such as the effects of contact time, medium pH and ionic strength (using NaCl, NaNO₃, KCl and KNO₃) were investigated. The results indicated that 150 min were sufficient for the adsorption to reach an equilibrium state and no adjustment of pH medium was necessary. Batch adsorption experiments such as adsorption isotherm, thermodynamics and kinetics were investigated and the experimental isotherm data were fitted to six isotherm models, namely Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Redlich-Peterson and Sips, with the latter being the best-fit isotherm model showing maximum adsorption capacity (qₘₐₓ) of 267.9 mg g⁻¹. Thermodynamics studies indicated adsorption of MV2B to be exothermic in nature, occurring spontaneously. The kinetics was best described by the pseudo-second-order model. Regeneration of IA pointed to its reusability, maintaining high adsorption capacity even up until Cycle 5 when treated with acid (HCl) and base (NaOH). Functional groups such as hydroxyl and amine groups which could be involved in the adsorption of MV2B were determined using FTIR spectroscopy, and the point of zero charge of IA was found to be at pH 6.81.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aIpomoea aquatica 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaquatic plants 3agentian violet 3aheat production 3aionic strength 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atoxicity 3awater1 aKooh, Muhammad Raziq Rahimi1 aDahri, Muhammad Khairud1 aZaidi, Nur Afiqah Hazirah Mohamad1 aLu, YieChen1 aLim, Linda Biaw Leng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4198-89620 tApplied water science.g2020 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.243-243dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-020-01326-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245013300207300001600340506007600356520106500432592002801497506003701525650001301562650000901575650001801584650001401602650004001616650001801656650001701674650002101691650002001712700002401732773011701756856007701873852000901950655001201959IND60690433320221207092031.0200426e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069043332DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.6.4.143052doi7 aPMC31423712pmcid7 a213643142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubois, Patrice G.10aTopology of a maize fieldbDistinguishing the influence of end-of-day far-red light and shade avoidance syndrome on plant height  ap. 467-470.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCorrelations were established between plant height and Cartesian position in a field of diverse maize (Zea mays) germplasm. The influence of the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS), a series of responses to lower photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and red to far-red light ratio (R:FR) at high planting density, was detected by a steep increase of plant height from the edge to interior rows of the field. In addition, a gradual increase in height was observed across the field from east to west. We attribute this result to a R:FR gradient caused by sunlight laterally penetrating the stand at dusk. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the increased height of west-positioned plants may be analogous to responses induced by end-of-day FR (EOD-FR) treatments used by photobiologists to induce SAS in controlled environments. While preliminary, these results nevertheless suggest that a plant’s position in a field will influence the impact of daily fluctuations in PAR and R:FR in modulating plant height and, potentially, other agronomically relevant traits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3acorn 3afar-red light 3agermplasm 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplant density 3aplant height 3aplanting density 3asolar radiation1 aBrutnell, Thomas P.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 6, no. 4 p.467-470dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.4.143053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245015000162520158800312592002801900650002201928650001601950650001701966650000901983650003101992650002002023650001502043650001402058650001602072650002202088650001202110650002102122650003402143650001502177650002002192650001802212650002002230650001302250653002102263653001102284653001502295700001202310700001702322700001402339700001502353700001602368700001902384773010002403856008402503852000902587655001202596IND60750001320221119015609.0211218e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075000132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1008382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xin10aTranscriptome analysis provides novel insights into the function of PI3K/AKT pathway in maintaining metabolic homeostasis of Chinese perch muscle  aSkeletal muscle exhibits significant dynamism and plasticity over the fish life cycle. However, the molecular mechanism of dynamic regulation of metabolic homeostasis in fish skeletal muscle remains unclear. PI3K/AKT signaling plays a central role in cellular physiology by mediating growth factor signals during organismal growth and critical cellular processes. In order to reveal the role of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in metabolic regulation of Chinese perch muscle, Illumina sequencing technology was preformed to mine the alterations of muscle transcriptome under PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) treatment. Total 619 unigenes were identified as significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control and LY294002 treatment groups. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were mostly associated with metabolic homeostasis, such as Biosynthesis of amino acids, Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, Glycerolipid metabolism process. Furthermore, the histological section analysis showed that the spaces between muscle fibers in LY294002 injection group were increased and the cytoplasmic contents were reduced, which was consistent with the characteristics of muscle atrophy. Together with the results, it was suggested that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of metabolism in fish muscle, which in turn ensures normal muscle physiology and growth. In addition, this study could provide a direction for the future research of elucidating the molecular mechanisms of metabolic homeostasis of PI3K/AKT signaling in fish muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiniperca chuatsi 3aaquaculture 3abiosynthesis 3afish 3agene expression regulation 3agluconeogenesis 3aglycolysis 3ahistology 3ahomeostasis 3amuscle physiology 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aplasticity 3askeletal muscle 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 0aPI3K/AKT pathway 0aMuscle 0aMetabolism1 aRen, Li1 aLiu, Jingjie1 aChen, Lin1 aCheng, Jia1 aChu, Wuying1 aZhang, Jianshe0 tAquaculture reports.g2021 Nov., v. 21 p.100838-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1008383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007200167300001600239520063900255592002800894650001200922650001000934650000900944650001400953650001100967650001200978653000900990653002500999653002501024653001901049700001801068700002201086700006101108773010301169856008501272852000901357655001201366IND60616139520221119210458.0190403e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061613952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2018.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehn, Simone10aSodium saccharin can be more acceptable to rats than pure saccharin  ap. 188-191.  aThe artificial sweetener saccharin is available in several forms, including pure saccharin (S) and saccharin sodium salt hydrate (SSSH).

Some of these introduced species are also more successful in their introduced than their native range, with increased growth and fecundity. We used a common garden experiment with 23 native and 27 introduced populations of common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) to test whether introduced populations are better adapted to low water, more responsive to N availability, more competitive, or faster-growing, than native populations. We also tested whether introduced mullein is less resistant to generalist herbivores in the introduced range. Results show that even though introduced mullein is not a better competitor, and is not better adapted to its drier introduced range, it grows larger in the absence of competition, and is better able to take advantage of high resource availability. Furthermore, invaders are also more resistant to a generalist herbivore. Synthesis: These results demonstrate the usefulness of examining evolutionary responses of introduced species to both abiotic and biotic variables. Together, fast-growth, strong responses to high water-availability, and low root:shoot suggest that mullein has evolved a fast-growing, weedy phenotype in its introduced range. At the same time, herbivory assays suggested that these traits were not evolved at the expense of resistance to generalist herbivores. 3aVerbascum thapsus 3abiological resistance 3aevolutionary adaptation 3afecundity 3agenetic traits 3aherbivores 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphenotype 3aplant adaptation 3aplant competition 3apopulation 3aroot shoot ratio 3asoil water deficit 3aweeds1 aHufbauer, Ruth A.1 aAlba, Christina1 aBlumenthal, Dana M.0 tJournal of ecology.g2013, v. 101 p.378-387wJournal:jnl44660x1365-27457nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/581903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12044  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Kumchick%20et%20al%202013%20-%20J%20Ecol%20-%20Evolution%20of%20fast-growing%20and%20more%20resistant%20phenotypes%20in%20introduced%20common%20mullein.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009400172300001400266520155400280592002801834650001101862650001901873650001601892650001001908650001201918650001401930650000901944650002001953650001401973650001601987653000902003653001602012653002802028653002002056653001902076700001702095700001502112700001502127700002102142700001902163773011302182856009002295852000902385655001202394IND50060302920221118232511.0190405e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006030292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores, M.J.10aLong-day photoperiod exposure in lactating goats to induce post-partum ovulatory activity  ap. 52-55.  aIn the present study, the continuous application of an artificial long-day photoperiod to induce a refractory state affecting the recovery of post-partum ovulatory activity in subtropical Creole does kidding in autumn, was investigated. For this purpose, a group of does was kept under a natural photoperiod from parturition up to 158 days of lactation (control group: n=16). The other group was subjected to an artificial long-day photoperiod (16h light:8h darkness; treated group: n=16) from day 10 to 158 of lactation. For the first 96 days postpartum, all does from both the control and treatment groups did not show ovulation. However, from day 108 to 156 post-partum, the proportion of does that exhibited ovulation was greater (P<0.01) in the treated group (11/16; 69%), than in the control group (2/16; 12.5%). In addition, the does in the treated group produced 15% more milk on average than the does in the control group at 60 and 90 days of lactation (P<0.001). The body weight and body condition were not affected by the photoperiod treatment (P>0.05). It could be concluded that, for subtropical lactating does that gave birth in autumn, continuous exposure to an artificial long-day photoperiod induces post-partum ovulatory activity after 150 days of exposure. This behaviour is probably attributable to the induction of a refractory state of the ovary, following continuous exposure to the artificial long days. Furthermore, this photoperiod treatment also increased the milk production level in goats at 60 and 90 days of lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abody condition 3abody weight 3agoats 3akidding 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk production 3aovulation 3aphotoperiod 0aGoat 0aPhotoperiod 0aPost-partum anovulation 0aMilk production 0aBody condition1 aFlores, J.A.1 aDuarte, G.1 aVielma, J.1 aDelgadillo, J.A.1 aHernández, H.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2013 Jan., v. 109, no. 1 p.52-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008500172300002000257520150600277592002801783650004401811650001201855650001101867650002101878650002001899650001501919650000901934650001201943650001401955650001001969650001001979650001201989650002202001650002102023650000902044700005502053700002402108700001902132700001902151700002802170773012202198856008702320852000902407655001202416IND60676851620221122034128.0191122e20191014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067685162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b024272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratiwi, Meiti10aProduction of Sustainable Diesel via Decarboxylation of Palm Stearin Basic Soaps  ap. 11648-11654.  aProduction of sustainable diesel was conducted via hydrogen-free decarboxylation of palm stearin basic soaps. Metal soaps are alkaline earth and transition-metal salts combined with carboxylic acids with 7–22 carbon atoms. Stearin basic soaps were prepared by direct reaction of palm stearin and mixed metal (Ca, Mg, and Zn) hydroxides. The stearin basic soaps were decarboxylated at 370 °C for 5 h to produce liquid crude bio-hydrocarbon, also known as sustainable diesel. The stearin basic soaps were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis, and the resulted liquid bio-hydrocarbons were analyzed by GC equipped with a flame ion detector. The hydroxyl band at 3678 cm–¹ observed from FTIR spectroscopy indicated that the Ca/Mg/Zn ions were associated with the −OH ions in the compounds. This proved that the soaps produced from this work were basic metal soaps. The thermal stability of the soaps was examined up to 1000 °C, and the decomposition of stearin basic soaps was observed in the range of 300–500 °C. The metal contained in the basic soaps affected their thermal characteristics. Liquid crude bio-hydrocarbon with carbon chain length between 8 and 20 has been obtained from decarboxylation of stearin basic soaps. In this study, the decarboxylation of stearin basic soaps resulted in sustainable diesel as the main product. This promising process is expected to open a plethora of opportunities in the production of sustainable diesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acarboxylic acids 3adecarboxylation 3ahydroxides 3aions 3aliquids 3amagnesium 3asalts 3asoaps 3astearin 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3azinc1 aMuraza, Oki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8348-80851 aNeonufa, Godlief F.1 aPurwadi, Ronny1 aPrakoso, Tirto1 aSoerawidjaja, Tatang H.0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Oct. 14, v. 33, no. 11 p.11648-11654dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b024273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245014300160300001600303520142400319592002801743650002001771650002001791650002001811650002901831650001801860650001901878650001801897650001101915650001101926650002301937650001301960650001201973650001701985650001302002650002302015650001402038650002402052650001802076650001802094650001502112650001302127651001702140700001702157700001502174700001502189700001902204700001402223700001802237700002002255700001602275700001702291773011702308856008102425852000902506655001202515IND60515357520221116201307.0160313e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051535752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-015-9738-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuan10aCharacteristics of residual organochlorine pesticides in soils under different land-use types on a coastal plain of the Yellow River Delta  ap. 535-547.  aThe residual levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were examined in soils covering five types of land use along a salinity gradient on the Yellow River Delta. The most prominent OCPs were dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (∑DDT, arithmetic mean = 5.11 μg kg⁻¹), hexachlorocyclohexane (∑HCH, 1.69 μg kg⁻¹) and ∑endosulfan (10.4 μg kg⁻¹). The spatial variability of OCPs composition shifted from γ-HCH and o,p′-DDT dominated pesticides in coastal soils to p,p′-DDE dominated pesticides in inland soils. In different land-use types, the percentages of β-HCH and p,p′-DDE are characterized by more recalcitrant components in decreasing order of vegetable fields, cereal fields, cotton fields, wetlands and tidal flats with increasing soil salinity. However, the less recalcitrant components, γ-HCH and o,p′-DDT, showed an opposite trend. Endosulfan sulfate predominated in all land-use types. Residual levels of β-HCH were affected by soil organic matter. The correlations between γ-HCH and clay content and between p,p′-DDE, o,p′-DDT and salinity might associate with the influence of sediment cotransport by the Yellow River and the density of anthropogenic activities in coastal region. Depth distribution of the OCPs in typical soil profiles also implied that local historical usage and sediment transport by the Yellow River both affected the OCPs residual in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclay fraction 3acoastal plains 3acoastal soils 3acoasts 3acotton 3aendosulfan sulfate 3aland use 3alindane 3ariver deltas 3asalinity 3asediment transport 3asediments 3asoil organic matter 3asoil profiles 3asoil salinity 3avegetables 3awetlands 3aYellow River1 aZhang, Haibo1 aLi, Qingbo1 aZhou, Qian1 aChen, Xiaobing1 aDu, Zhen,1 aLuo, Yongming1 aChristie, Peter1 aHu, Xuefeng1 aLi, Lianzhen0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2016 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.535-547dSpringer Netherlandsx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-015-9738-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012700168300001600295520119600311592002801507650002801535650002201563650001001585650001201595650002201607650003101629650001001660650001901670650002201689650004301711650000901754650002201763650001701785653000901802653002201811653002801833653007301861653003101934653003201965700003001997700003202027700002402059700003302083700001902116700003002135773014602165856008302311852000902394655001202403IND60581910020221116170205.0190415e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058191002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsci.2017.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaakre, Manjesh10aIdentification and Characterization of Genes Responsible for Drought Tolerance in Rice Mediated by Pseudomonas fluorescens  ap. 291-298.  aDrought is one of the major abiotic stresses which adversely affect crop plants limiting growth and yield potential. Structural and functional characterization of drought stress-induced genes has contributed to a better understanding of how plants respond and adapt to the drought stress. In the present study, differential display technique was employed to study the gene expression of rice plants at the reproductive stage that were subjected to drought stress by withholding water, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain (Pf1) treated plants subjected for drought stress by withholding water and control (well-watered). Differentially expressed cDNAs of six genes (COX1, PKDP, bZIP1, AP2-EREBP, Hsp20 and COC1) were identified, cloned and sequenced. Real-time qPCR analysis showed that all the six genes were upregulated in drought-stressed plants treated with Pf1. This revealed that the remarkable influence of Pf1 colonization leads to drought tolerance at the reproductive stage. These results showed that high levels of gene expression in plants lacking adequate water can be remarkably influenced by Pf1 colonization, which might be a key element for induced systemic tolerance by microbes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3acomplementary DNA 3acrops 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicroorganisms 3amolecular cloning 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3asequence analysis 3awater stress 0arice 0adrought tolerance 0aPseudomonas fluorescens 0adifferential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 0aquantitative real-time PCR 0atranscript derived fragment1 aBaburao, Thirthikar Meera1 aSalim, Abida Puthenpeedikal1 aFfancies, Rose Mary1 aAchuthan, Valasala Poothecty1 aThomas, George1 aSivarajan, Sajeevan Radha0 tRice science.g2017 Sept., v. 24, no. 5 p.291-298dElsevier B.V.aChina National Rice Research InstitutewJournal:J000000149x1672-63087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsci.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245005800168300001600226520216100242592002802403650001602431650002602447650001102473650002102484650002102505650001002526650001902536650003102555650002002586650001102606650001102617650001402628650004002642650001802682650002202700650002002722650001702742650001302759650001602772650001902788650001402807700001902821700002302840700002502863700002502888700002102913700002102934773011302955856008203068852000903150655001203159IND60549468120221119215114.0160908e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054946812DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-10-11-02942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Heather M.10aEffect of Solar Radiation on Severity of Soybean Rust  ap. 794-803.  aSoybean rust (SBR), caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi, is a damaging fungal disease of soybean (Glycine max). Although solar radiation can reduce SBR urediniospore survival, limited information is available on how solar radiation affects SBR progress within soybean canopies. Such information can aid in developing accurate SBR prediction models. To manipulate light penetration into soybean canopies, structures of shade cloth attenuating 30, 40, and 60% sunlight were constructed over soybean plots. In each plot, weekly evaluations of severity in lower, middle, and upper canopies, and daily temperature and relative humidity were recorded. Final plant height and leaf area index were also recorded for each plot. The correlation between amount of epicuticular wax and susceptibility of leaves in the lower, middle, and upper canopies was assessed with a detached leaf assay. Final disease severity was 46 to 150% greater in the lower canopy of all plots and in the middle canopy of 40 and 60% shaded plots. While daytime temperature within the canopy of nonshaded soybean was greater than shaded soybean by 2 to 3°C, temperatures recorded throughout typical evenings and mornings of the growing season in all treatments were within the range (10 to 28.5°C) for SBR development as was relative humidity. This indicates temperature and relative humidity were not limiting factors in this experiment. Epicuticular wax and disease severity in detached leaf assays from the upper canopy had significant negative correlation (P = 0.009, R = –0.84) regardless of shade treatment. In laboratory experiments, increasing simulated total solar radiation (UVA, UVB, and PAR) from 0.15 to 11.66 MJ m–² increased mortality of urediniospores from 2 to 91%. Variability in disease development across canopy heights in early planted soybean may be attributed to the effects of solar radiation not only on urediniospore viability, but also on plant height, leaf area index, and epicuticular wax, which influence disease development of SBR. These results provide an understanding of the effect solar radiation has on the progression of SBR within the soybean canopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aPhakopsora pachyrhizi 3acanopy 3adisease severity 3aepicuticular wax 3afungi 3agrowing season 3alaboratory experimentation 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3amodels 3amortality 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplanting date 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3asoybean rust 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3aurediniospores 3aviability1 aGeorge, Sheeja1 aNarváez, Dario F.1 aSrivastava, Pratibha1 aSchuerger, Andrew C.1 aWright, David L.1 aMarois, James J.0 tPhytopathology.g2012 Aug., v. 102, no. 8 p.794-803dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-10-11-02943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04395naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245021200165520244700377592002802824650001002852650001502862650002502877650001502902650002802917650001702945650001102962650003002973650002003003650002403023650002103047650002603068650000903094650002703103650002903130650003603159653001603195653002903211653002203240653002103262653001503283653000803298653000803306653000603314653000903320653000803329653000703337653000903344653000903353653000903362653000703371653000803378653000903386653000803395653000803403653000703411653000803418653000803426653001503434700001803449700001203467700001803479773009403497856008503591852000903676655001203685IND60625597120221122224826.0190620e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062559712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2018.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei10aPharmacokinetics comparison of 15 ginsenosides and 3 aglycones in Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma and Baoyuan decoction using ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry  aGinsenosides were considered as the main bioactive constituents in Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma (GRR). However, because of high polarity, ginsenosides were hard to be absorbed in human or animal gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Up to now, very few studies have been performed in the area of simultaneous pharmacokinetic analysis of multiple ginsenosides with similar structures.This research aimed to compare the different absorption characteristics of ginsenosides and aglycones between GRR and Baoyuan decoction (BYD), one of formulas containing GRR, with the same dosage.GRR and BYD extracts were prepared with same method. A single dose of GRR and BYD extracts were administrated to rats through gavage, respectively. A solid phase extraction method was used to purify the plasma samples. An ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) method was established and fully validated for quantitative analysis. In addition, an in vitro incubation of GRR extract with intestinal flora was conducted to confirm the influence of gut microbiota to the absorption of ginsenosides and aglycones.The results of incubation experiments showed that most high polar ginsenosides could transform to less polar ginsenosides via intestinal flora. The validated UFLC-MS/MS method was sensitive and precise to simultaneously analyze the pharmacokinetics of multiple ginsenosides. After oral administration of GRR and BYD extracts, the pharmacokinetic results showed that a total of 11 ginsenosides and 2 aglycones could be quantitatively determined in both groups of plasma. Besides, five compounds were only quantified in BYD extract group. In addition, another 21 ginsenosides could be qualitatively measured.The results indicated significant pharmacokinetic differences of ginsenosides and aglycones between two groups. For most less polar ginsenosides who had better bioactivity, the preparation was possessed of higher plasma concentrations. The comparative results indicated that some co-existing compounds in BYD might inhibit the exocytosis of ginsenosides. Moreover, what is worth mentioning, some ginsenosides and aglycones could only be detected and quantified a few hours later after administration to rats. Combining with the in vitro incubation experiments, the results demonstrated that transformation of ginsenosides in gastrointestinal tract via intestinal flora existed during absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3aabsorption 3abioactive properties 3aexocytosis 3agastrointestinal system 3aginsenosides 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajoints (animal) 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultrafast liquid chromatography 0aGinsenoside 0aGinseng Radix et Rhizoma 0aBaoyuan decoction 0aPharmacokinetics 0aUFLC-MS/MS 0aACN 0aBYD 0aG 0aG-CK 0aGRR 0aIS 0aLLOD 0aLLOQ 0aMeOH 0aNG 0aOLE 0aP-gp 0aPPD 0aPPT 0aQC 0aSPE 0aTCM 0aUFLC-MS/MS1 aLiu, Xiao-Yan1 aXu, Wei1 aYang, Xiu-Wei0 tPhytomedicine.g2019 June, v. 59 p.152775-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2018.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001500147245011700162300001600279500000900295520131600304592002801620650001301648650002301661650002601684650002301710650001401733650002301747650002401770650000901794650002401803650002801827650001001855650001601865650002601881650002301907650002201930650002101952651001201973700001701985773012102002852000902123856008402132655001202216IND4390297720221123014715.0191228e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439029772DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2006.07.04942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenkir, A.10aResponse to Recurrent Selection for Resistance to Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth in a Tropical Maize Population  ap. 674-682.  aepub  aStriga hermonthica (Del.) Benth is an obligate root parasite infecting maize (Zea mays L.) and causing considerable yield losses in Africa. Few studies have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of recurrent selection for improving resistance to S. hermonthica in maize. The objective of this study was to evaluate genetic gain achieved in a composite subjected to six cycles of selection under S. hermonthica infestation. The selection cycles and checks were evaluated with and without S. hermonthica infestation at two locations in Nigeria for 2 yr. Selection for improved performance under S. hermonthica infestation significantly increased grain yield by 24% cycle-1 and ears per plant by 9% cycle-1. At the same time, the gain per cycle was −7% for relative yield loss, −5% for host damage rating, −9% for emerged S. hermonthica plants, −4% for anthesis–silking interval, and −5% for ear aspect. Selection under S. hermonthica infestation was accompanied by a concomitant increase in grain yield and improvement in plant aspect and ear aspect without S. hermonthica infestation. The observed progress in performance under S. hermonthica infestation demonstrates the effectiveness of recurrent selection for increasing polygenetic resistance against the parasite in tropical populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aselection response 3apolygenic inheritance 3agenetic resistance 3acorn ears 3aStriga hermonthica 3agenetic improvement 3acorn 3arecurrent selection 3aplant genetic resources 3aweeds 3agrain yield 3acrop-weed competition 3aseedling emergence 3aseed productivity 3aparasitic plants 3aNigeria1 aKling, J.

This new type of plasmonic assemblies with a hollow cavity can play multifunctional roles as delivery carriers for anticancer drugs and SERS-active plasmonic imaging probes to specifically label targeted cancer cells and monitor intracellular drug delivery. We have shown that the pH-responsive disassembly of the plasmonic vesicle, stimulated by the hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transition of the hydrophobic brushes in acidic intracellular compartments, allows for triggered intracellular drug release. Because self-assembled plasmonic vesicles exhibit significantly different plasmonic properties and greatly enhanced SERS intensity in comparison with single gold nanoparticles due to strong interparticle plasmonic coupling, disassembly of the vesicles in endocytic compartments leads to dramatic changes in scattering properties and SERS signals, which can serve as independent feedback mechanisms to signal cargo release from the vesicles. The unique structural and optical properties of the plasmonic vesicle have made it a promising platform for targeted combination therapy and theranostic applications by taking advantage of recent advances in gold nanostructure based in vivo bioimaging and photothermal therapy and their loading capacity for both hydrophilic (nucleic acids and proteins) and hydrophobic (small molecules) therapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3agold 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anucleic acids 3aoptical properties 3aproteins 3atherapeutics1 aZhou, Jiajing1 aDuan, Hongwei0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 134, no. 32 p.13458-13469dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja305154a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245007400206300001600280506007600296520093700372592002801309506003701337650002501374650000801399650001701407650000801424650001501432650001401447650000901461650001801470650002101488650002001509650001001529650000801539650000901547650002701556700002201583700001601605700001801621700002301639773011701662856007701779852000901856655001201865IND60690433720221207093542.0200426e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069043372DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.6.4.146502doi7 aPMC31424042pmcid7 a216735152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakanashi, Hideki10aDCL2 is highly expressed in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis  ap. 604-606.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSmall RNAs are riboregulators that play critical roles in eukaryotic cells. They repress gene expression by acting either on DNA to guide sequence elimination and chromatin remodeling, or on RNA to guide cleavage and translation repression. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa contain four and six DICER-LIKE (DCL) genes with specialized functions in small RNA biogenesis for RNA interference-related processes. We recently profiled genome-wide gene expression in egg and synergid cells in rice. In this article, we show that OsDCL2, OsDCL4, and OsHEN1 are preferentially expressed in the egg cell. In addition, we revealed that AtDCL2 is also preferentially expressed in the Arabidopsis egg cell. These findings suggest that small RNA pathways are activated in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis. The activation of these pathways in the egg cell might be essential for egg cell maturation, fertilization, or embryogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3aOryza sativa 3aRNA 3abiogenesis 3achromatin 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3aova 3arice 3atranslation (genetics)1 aOhnishi, Takayuki1 aMogi, Mirai1 aHirata , Yuto1 aTsutsumi, Nobuhiro0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 6, no. 4 p.604-606dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.4.146503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245014600165300002000311520201900331592002802350650002102378650002802399650001202427650001402439650001302453650001302466650002002479700001702499700001302516700005502529773013802584856008002722852000902802655001202811IND60646808220221119040902.0190613e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064680822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b009442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dongxiao10aRational Design of Organic Magnets with Switchable Two-Way Couplers: Magnetic Modulation or Switching through Lactam–Lactim Tautomerization  ap. 14152-14163.  aLactam–lactim tautomerism, which features a typical prototropic process, has been widely applied to various functional processes. Here, we use it to design the magnetism-tunable organic magnets. Taking experimentally reported phenazine-N,N′-dioxide (PDO) as template in which two nitroxide groups act as spin sources and two ortho-phendiyl groups act as two couplers, we further modify one coupler through replacing a −C═C– unit of an ortho-phendiyl by an amide (−CONH−) at three different positions, forming three switchable molecular magnets. Calculations reveal intriguing magnetic modulation or switching phenomena through tautomerization. That is, all lactim structures and PDO exhibit extremely strong antiferromagnetic spin couplings with magnetic coupling constants J ranging from −2485.7 to −2732.4 cm–¹, while the lactam structures are diamagnetic or moderately strong antiferromagnetic with a J of −1703.6 cm–¹, depending on different locations of the introduced amide/imide units. Strong spin couplings (including excessive couplings in diamagnetic cases) in all six molecules and PDO can be interpreted by proximity of two nitroxide groups, good planarity, and conjugation, while the reason for the differences in magnetic characteristics of three lactam forms is that the destruction of aromaticity induces two types of rearrangement of chemical bonds, which leads to opposite changes of the spin coupling between two radical units. Besides, the role of each coupler, ring aromaticity, Mulliken spin densities, and molecular orbitals are analyzed for the understanding of magnetic regulation. Double lactam–lactim tautomerization through modifying two couplers with amide/imide units, different orientations of hydroxyl H in lactim structures, and tautomerization energetics assisted by solvent molecules are also discussed. This work provides a promising strategy for rational design of organic molecular magnetic switches with two switchable spin communication channels.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3aferrimagnetic materials 3alactams 3amagnetism 3amoieties 3asolvents 3atautomerization1 aDeng, Tiange1 aYang, Lu1 aBu, Yuxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6445-50690 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 123, no. 23 p.14152-14163dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b009443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245009700177520197000274592002802244650002502272650002802297650002002325650001302345650002002358650002502378650001302403650001402416650003202430650002202462650001502484650000902499650002002508650001302528651001802541653001102559653001402570653001302584653001802597653001402615700001602629773011102645856008802756852000902844655001202853IND60648453720221122012108.0190628e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064845372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.1048532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLara Johannsdottir,10aSystemic risk of maritime-related oil spills viewed from an Arctic and insurance perspective  aThere is a wish for economic development in the Arctic, especially in relation to the region's untapped marine and hydrocarbon resources. However, such developments are inherently risky, entailing the possibility of trade-offs and potentially jeopardizing a fragile and pristine natural environment which provides multiple sources of well-being to the Arctic's four million inhabitants. When the risks of economic development are evaluated, they are usually assessed on a micro (enterprise risk) and/or meso level (portfolio risk, such as an industry). Systemic risk is considered to a much lesser degree. There is also limited discussion about mitigation methods, including the role of insurance in dealing with the consequences of failures, such as oil spills. The aim of this study is, therefore, to explore the systemic risk of maritime-related oil spills in general and place the findings in an Arctic and insurance perspective. The study is based on secondary data relating to major maritime-related oil spills from drilling and shipping. Two analytical frameworks were employed, one explaining the scaling of risks, and another showing the interplay between subsistence and monetized economies in tandem with their institutional, environmental, social and cultural context. The findings suggest, if the worst-case scenario materializes, that maritime-related oil spills may have social/cultural, environmental, and economic impacts, in addition to security/policy implications, as well as affecting businesses involved in the disaster and their partners. This study has academic implications since there are, so far, limited studies carried out on systemic-level risk, but it also has policy relevance, for instance for local and regional authorities and international bodies, such as the Arctic Council, in terms of holistic risk-assessment and its recommended use of appropriate decision-making and evaluative frameworks such as ecosystem-based management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acoastal zone management 3adecision making 3adrilling 3aeconomic impact 3aecosystem management 3aindustry 3ainsurance 3ainternational organizations 3aissues and policy 3aoil spills 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ashipping 3aArctic region 0aArctic 0aInsurance 0aMaritime 0aSystemic risk 0aOil spill1 aCook, David0 tOcean & coastal management.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 179 p.104853-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.1048533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245019400160300001800354520144800372592002801820650002901848650002501877650002801902650001301930650002001943650001901963650002401982700005502006773013702061856008102198852000902279655001202288IND60616358120221119071549.0181020e20180913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061635812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b076142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiayu10aMechanical Unfolding Pathway of the High-Potential Iron–Sulfur Protein Revealed by Single-Molecule Atomic Force Microscopy: Toward a General Unfolding Mechanism for Iron–sulfur Proteins  ap. 9340-9349.  aHigh-potential iron–sulfur proteins (HiPIPs) are an important class of metalloproteins with a [4Fe–4S] cluster coordinated by four cysteine residues. Distinct from other iron–sulfur proteins, the cluster in HiPIP has a high reduction potential, making it an essential electron carrier in bacterial photosynthesis. Here, we combined single-molecule atomic force microscopy and protein engineering techniques to investigate the mechanical unfolding mechanism of HiPIP from Chromatium tepidum (cHiPIP). We found that cHiPIP unfolds in a two-step fashion with the protein sequence sequestered by the iron–sulfur center as a stable unfolding intermediate state. The rupture of the iron–sulfur center of cHiPIP proceeds in two distinct parallel pathways; one pathway involves the concurrent rupture of multiple iron–thiolate bonds, and the other one involves the sequential rupture of the iron–thiolate bonds. This mechanistic information was further confirmed by mutational studies. We found that the rupture of the iron–thiolate bonds in reduced and oxidized cHiPIP occurred in the range of 150–180 pN at a pulling speed of 400 nm/s, similar to that measured for iron–thiolate bonds in rubredoxin and ferredoxin. Our results may have important implications for understanding the general unfolding mechanism governing iron–sulfur proteins, as well as the mechanism governing the mechanical rupture of the iron–sulfur center.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermochromatium tepidum 3aamino acid sequences 3aatomic force microscopy 3acysteine 3ametalloproteins 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein engineering1 aLi, Hongbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7813-13320 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 13, v. 122, no. 40 p.9340-9349dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b076143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245010800175300001800283520155500301592002801856650001101884650001601895650002601911650001201937650001301949650004401962650002002006650001402026650002902040650001902069650003202088650002102120700002502141700002802166700002302194700002802217700002302245700002302268700002002291773010302311856008502414852000902499655001202508IND60586585720221121060437.0171214e20171212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058658572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.7b006682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Nadia
Sukusu10aMutation-Induced Deamidation of Corneal Dystrophy-Related Transforming Growth Factor β-Induced Protein  ap. 6470-6480.  aMutations in the transforming growth factor β-induced protein (TGFBIp) cause phenotypically diverse corneal dystrophies, where protein aggregation in the cornea leads to severe visual impairment. Previous studies have shown a relationship between mutant-specific corneal dystrophy phenotypes and the thermodynamic stability of TGFBIp. Using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we investigated correlations between the structural integrity of disease-related mutants of the fourth FAS1 domain (FAS1-4) and deamidation of TGFBIp residue Asn622. We observed a high rate of Asn622 deamidation in the A546D and A546D/P551Q FAS1-4 mutants that were both largely unstructured as determined by NMR. Conversely, the more structurally organized A546T and V624M FAS1-4 mutants had reduced deamidation rates, suggesting that a folded and stable FAS1-4 domain precludes Asn622 deamidation. Wild-type, R555Q, and R555W FAS1-4 mutants displayed very slow deamidation, which agrees with their similar and ordered NMR structures, where Asn622 is in a locked conformation. We confirmed the FAS1-4 mutational effect on deamidation rates in full-length TGFBIp mutants and found a similar ranking compared to that of the FAS1-4 domain alone. Consequently, the deamidation rate of Asn622 can be used to predict the structural effect of the many destabilizing and/or stabilizing mutations reported for TGFBIp. In addition, the deamidation of Asn622 may influence the pathophysiology of TGFBIp-induced corneal dystrophies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acornea 3adeamidation 3aliquid chromatography 3amutants 3amutation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apathophysiology 3aphenotype 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athermodynamics 3atransforming growth factors 3avision disorders1 aJuhl, Dennis Wilkens1 aPoulsen, Ebbe Toftgaard1 aLukassen, Marie V.1 aPoulsen, Emil Christian1 aRisør, Michael W.1 aScavenius, Carsten1 aEnghild, Jan J.0 tBiochemistry.g2017 Dec. 12, v. 56, no. 49 p.6470-6480dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.7b006683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245005000162300001800212520108900230592002801319650003701347650002301384650002201407650001301429650002301442650001301465650001201478650001301490653001601503653002101519653002401540653001401564653004201578653002201620653002101642700002201663700002301685700002301708700002001731700002001751700001801771700001601789700002401805773012701829856007801956852000902034655001202043IND60528884720170818000000.0160717e20160406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052888472DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b015962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJäckle, Sara10aUnveiling the Hybrid n-Si/PEDOT:PSS Interface  ap. 8841-8848.  aWe investigated the buried interface between monocrystalline n-type silicon (n-Si) and the highly conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which is successfully applied as a hole selective contact in hybrid solar cells. We show that a post-treatment of the polymer films by immersion in a suitable solvent reduces the layer thickness by removal of excess material. We prove that this post-treatment does not affect the functionality of the hybrid solar cells. Through the thin layer we are probing the chemical structure at the n-Si/PEDOT:PSS interface with synchrotron-based hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). From the HAXPES data we conclude that the Si substrate of a freshly prepared hybrid solar cell is already oxidized immediately after preparation. Moreover, we show that even when storing the sample in inert gas such as, e.g., nitrogen the n-Si/SiOₓ/PEDOT:PSS interface continues to further oxidize. Thus, without further surface treatment, an unstable Si suboxide will always be present at the hybrid interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical structure 3afilms (materials) 3anitrogen 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3asilicon 3asolvents 0asolar cells 0ahybrid materials 0aconducting polymers 0ainterface 0ahard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 0ainorganic/organic 0adevice stability1 aLiebhaber, Martin1 aNiederhausen, Jens1 aBüchele, Matthias1 aFélix, Roberto1 aWilks, Regan G.1 aBär, Marcus,1 aLips, Klaus1 aChristiansen, Silke0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Apr. 06, v. 8, no. 13 p.8841-8848dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b015963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013700172520132100309592002801630650001501658650001501673650001701688650001301705650001601718650001601734650002701750650001401777650001901791650001901810650000901829650001701838650001301855650001301868650002001881653002201901653003001923653002601953653003201979700001702011700006002028700005802088700002302146700005902169700006002228700001802288700002502306773010602331856008702437852000902524655001202533IND60671737620221118001450.0200210e20200120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067173762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1240502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaarji, Noamane10aPreparation of monodisperse O/W emulsions using a crude surface-active extract from argan by-products in microchannel emulsification  aIn this study, we evaluated the performance of a mildly derived extract from argan by-products in microchannel emulsification (MCE). Our aim is to produce stable monodisperse O/W emulsions using this extract as a sole emulsifier. Preliminary investigations about the characteristics of argan extract indicated the potential interaction between surface-active components (i.e. saponins, proteins), in bulk phase prior to adsorption at the oil/water interface, resulting in the formation of biogenic complexes with strong interfacial properties. This is important for successful MCE as this technique depends exclusively on dynamic interfacial tension reduction for droplet formation. Nevertheless, upon performance of emulsification experiments, we also found that the complex composition of this extract could counteract its emulsifying efficiency, by creating a hydrophobic, or slightly hydrophilic, layer on the MC array plate surface. This resulted in unsuccessful emulsification using short MCs but did not affect the emulsification behavior in longer ones. Using longer MCs, we could produce stable monodisperse O/W emulsions, with similar droplet size (∼ 36 μm) and droplet size distribution (Relative span factor <0.25) to those obtained using Tween 80, and for up to 10 h of continuous emulsification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abyproducts 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3apolysorbates 3aproteins 3asaponins 3asurface tension 0aArgan by-products 0aCrude emulsifying extract 0aMonodisperse emulsion 0aMicrochannel emulsification1 aVodo, Sekove1 aBouhoute, Meryem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7089-130X1 aKhalid, Nauman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8045-199X1 aHafidi, Abdellatif1 aKobayashi, Isao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9062-55541 aNeves, Marcos A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7159-549X1 aIsoda, Hiroko1 aNakajima, Mitsutoshi0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 585 p.124050-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1240503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245011000169300001600279520139900295592002801694650002701722650002801749650002401777650002501801650002901826650003001855650002101885650002501906650002001931650001801951650002501969650000701994650001402001650001602015700001402031700001802045700001302063700001702076700001602093700001402109773011702123856005502240852000902295655001202304IND4501388820221119181844.0150424e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450138882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.05087.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorissen, L.10aLinoleate isomerase activity occurs in lactic acid bacteria strains and is affected by pH and temperature  ap. 593-606.  aAims: To investigate the ability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to convert linoleic acid (LA) and Î±âlinolenic acid (Î±âLNA) to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and conjugated linolenic acid (CLNA), respectively. To assess pH and temperature influences on CLA and CLNA production by Lactobacillus sakei LMG 13558. Methods and Results: A screening of 48 LAB yielded one Lactobacillus curvatus, five Lactobacillus plantarum and four Lact.Â sakei strains displaying linoleate isomerase (LAI) activity. CLNA conversion percentages varied largely (1â60%). CLA conversion, occurring in three strains, was lower (2â5%). The LAI gene sequences of the ten LAIâpositive strains shared 75â99% identity with the LAI gene sequence of a Lact.Â plantarum AS1.555. At pH 6Â·2, CLA and CLNA production by Lact.Â sakei LMG 13558 was higher at 30Â°C than at 20 and 25Â°C. At pH 5Â·5 (30Â°C) or 37Â°C (pH 6Â·2), LA was not converted and Î±âLNA only slightly converted. Conclusions: LAB show strainâdependent LAI activity. Production of CLA and CLNA is affected by pH and temperature, as shown for Lact.Â sakei LMG 13558. Significance and Impact of the Study: Several LAB produce CLA and/or CLNA, as shown for Lact.Â sakei and Lact.Â curvatus for the first time. These findings offer potential for the manufacturing of fermented functional foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus curvatus 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aconjugated linolenic acid 3afunctional foods 3alactic acid bacteria 3aleaf area index 3amanufacturing 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3ascreening 3atemperature1 aWeckx, S.1 aVlaeminck, B.1 aRaes, K.1 aDe Vuyst, L.1 aDe Smet, S.1 aLeroy, F.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2011 Sept., v. 111, no. 3 p.593-606dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.05087.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245014100167500002000308520178300328592002802111596005702139596006102196650001102257650002502268650001902293650001202312650001102324650002502335650002002360650002202380650001502402650002002417650001202437650001602449650000902465650001502474650001502489650001902504650002102523651001502544700002102559700003002580700002302610700002202633700002102655700001902676700002302695700002302718773012702741856008402868852000902952655001202961IND60790406620221116160609.0220824e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079040662DNAL7 a10.1136/vetreco-2017-0002482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, Mahabub10aAssessment of transport stress on cattle travelling a long distance (≈648 km), from Jessore (Indian border) to Chittagong, Bangladesh  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of long‐distance transport on cattle health has not frequently been studied in Bangladesh. The current study investigated the health conditions, and the extent and pattern of cattle injuries, along with haemato‐biochemical and hormonal changes, before and after long‐distance transportation (≈648 km) from the market of origin to the market of destination. A total of 100 adult cattle were selected at the Benapole live cattle market, Bangladesh, for physical examination before and after transportation. Fifty of these cattle were randomly selected for additional haemato‐biochemical evaluation just before the start of transportation (0 hour), immediately after arrival at the destination market (13.8±0.9 hours after the start of transportation) and 24 hours after arrival at the destination market. The external health conditions and injuries were assessed. Animals were fasting in the vehicle during transportation and provided only with paddy straw and water before sale at the destination market. Before and after transportation, the overall frequency of cattle injuries varied significantly (26 per cent before v 47 per cent after transportation; P<0.001). Cattle health conditions diverged significantly (such as nasal discharge: 15 per cent v 28 per cent; P=0.03). The values of haemoglobin (P=0.01), total erythrocyte count (P=0.001), total leucocyte count (P<0.001), lymphocyte (P=0.005), neutrophil (P=0.01) and eosinophil (P=0.01) varied significantly. The values of serum total protein (P=0.006), creatine kinase (P<0.001), triglyceride (P=0.04), calcium (P=0.003), phosphorus (P<0.001) and alkaline phosphatase (P=0.04) significantly differed.

Here, enhanced spreading behavior of catanionic mixtures with magnetic liquid marbles were combined and a new approach to the phase separation, actuation and manipulation of liquids that could be important in many micro/macroscale operations is proposed. The magnetic liquid marbles containing catanionic surfactant mixture are prepared using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) decorated by non-covalently-bonded semifluorinated alcohol, which is used for a specific purpose that has never been used before. Besides its ability to increase the hydrophobicity of NPs, the autooscillation behavior of the fluorinated alcohol maintains the fast rupture of the marble and provides the convective flow that supports the rapid transformation of the oil phase into lens form which contributes to obtain a better phase separation. Semifluorinated ligand helps the nanoparticles to integrate into oil phase, allowing the actuation of oil droplets via a magnetic field for a target-directed control of phases. With this system, an innovative model that stands at the intersection of several fundamental concepts of colloid and interface science as well as materials science and engineering is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3adroplets 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3ahydrophobicity 3airon oxides 3aligands 3aliquids 3amagnetic fields 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3aseparation 3asurfactants 0aMagnetic liquid marbles 0aSemifluorinated alcohols 0aAutooscillation 0aCatanionic surfactant mixtures 0aPhase separation1 aAlp, Erdem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2894-19401 aAydogan, Nihal0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 585 p.124051-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1240513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245006300202300001800265506007600283520091400359592002801273506003701301650001401338650001001352650001701362650001201379650001101391650001301402700002701415700003401442700002401476700002601500773009301526856008201619852000901701655001201710IND4487155520221207103309.0120502e20111022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448715552DNAL7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.00692doi7 aPMC31589372pmcid7 a213890332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoube, Michael10aTrabecular bone scales allometrically in mammals and birds  ap. 3067-3073.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany bones are supported internally by a latticework of trabeculae. Scaling of whole bone length and diameter has been extensively investigated, but scaling of the trabecular network is not well characterized. We analysed trabecular geometry in the femora of 90 terrestrial mammalian and avian species with body masses ranging from 3 g to 3400 kg. We found that bone volume fraction does not scale substantially with animal size, while trabeculae in larger animals' femora are thicker, further apart and fewer per unit volume than in smaller animals. Finite element modelling indicates that trabecular scaling does not alter the bulk stiffness of trabecular bone, but does alter strain within trabeculae under equal applied loads. Allometry of bone's trabecular tissue may contribute to the skeleton's ability to withstand load, without incurring the physiological or mechanical costs of increasing bone mass.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aallometry 3abirds 3abone density 3amammals 3amodels 3askeleton1 aKłosowski, Michał M.1 aWiktorowicz-Conroy, Alexis M.1 aHutchinson, John R.1 aShefelbine, Sandra J.0 tProceedings.g2011 Oct. 22, v. 278, no. 1721 p.3067-3073dRoyal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.00693Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003300146245008800179300001800267500001900285520149600304592002801800650001501828650001401843650001701857650001801874650001301892650002401905650001901929650001101948650001901959650003201978650001302010650002302023650000902046700005802055773013602113856008002249852000902329655001202338IND60712065520221117224319.0201009e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071206552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c044422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlipoormazandarani, Niloofar10aInteraction Mechanism of Anionic Lignin and Cationic Soft Surface in Saline Systems  ap. 8678-8689.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLignin has a complicated three-dimensional structure that is different from other synthetic and bio-based materials. In this work, we first examined the physicochemical behavior, i.e., apparent hydrodynamic radius (Rₕ) and ζ-potential, of carboxymethylated lignin (CM) in a saline system. Then, the detailed interaction and adsorption behavior of CM on a cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC)-coated surface were investigated in a saline system by a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. The theoretical and experimental adsorption data revealed that CM made limited surface coverage at a low salt concentration via charge neutralization following an intrinsic compensation mechanism. At a higher salt concentration, the adsorption of CM was improved significantly following the extrinsic compensation mechanism and nonionic interaction (e.g., hydrophobic interaction). The adsorption affinity of CM in the urea environment revealed the contribution (10–30%) of hydrogen bonding in the adsorption of CM on the PDADMAC surface. Contrary to what was found for the CM, the adsorption of a linear poly(acrylic acid–acrylamide) (PAM) on the PDADMAC surface exhibited a dramatic decrease at higher salinity, possibly due to the absence of nonionic and hydrophobic interactions between PAM and the surface. The findings of this study showed the superior adsorption performance of the lignin-based polyelectrolytes to the synthetic ones in salt-containing systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achlorides 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3alignin 3aneutralization 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asalinity 3asalt concentration 3aurea1 aFatehi, Pedram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3874-50890 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 124, no. 39 p.8678-8689dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c044423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005200152245014300204520090800347592002801255650001601283650002201299650001801321650002201339650001401361650001901375650002101394650002601415653002101441653001901462653003001481700001401511700001601525700001701541700001401558700001601572700001701588700001601605700002001621773010601641856008701747852000901834655001201843IND60671737820221118001552.0200103e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067173782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1240522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4382-478510ap-BNMR/TiO2 hybrid materials with exposing the {001} facet for enhanced photocatalytic application in treatment of antibiotic contaminants  aPorous boron nitride microrods (p-BNMRs) and activated TiO₂ nanotablets with exposing {001} facets are combined to form p-BNMR/TiO₂ hybrid materials via solvothermal method. The activated TiO₂ nanotablets have a length of 150–200 nm and a thickness of about 20 nm. Additionally, the exposing ratios of the {001} facets and the morphologies of TiO₂ supported on the p-BNMRs surfaces can be adjusted by the volume of H₂O₂. The photocatalytic property of p-BNMR/TiO₂ hybrid materials for degrading antibiotics is improved compared with that of pure TiO₂ due to the composite of activated TiO₂ to p-BNMRs, which possess the capacity to absorb antibiotic molecules and transfer the photogenerated charge carriers. 99.8% of ofloxacin in aqueous solution is removed after 100 min of UV irradiation.

Earlier on, social innovation turned into a term used in EU policy strategies for addressing social issues and the self-empowerment of local people, as well as for tackling economic, social, or environmental challenges. The question of how the forest bioeconomy might profit from social innovation remains. The article examined the forest bioeconomy from the perspective of social innovation features: How is social innovation reflected in the forest bioeconomy? The forest sector is identified as one principal supplier sectors in the updated European Bioeconomy Strategy. In the strategies&rsquo; general objectives of job creation and employment through the green economy, we detected some links to social innovation. In contrast, the EU Social Innovation Initiative includes social aspects via addressing collective action, integration of vulnerable social groups, and rural and urban economic development, without mentioning explicitly the forest sector. In order to make use of both EU policy documents, it is necessary to enquire on the overlaps. This research focused on the communalities in their policy goals as a reference framework for systematically identifying specific forest bioeconomy activities fitting into both realms. With example of these activities, we showed how the forest bioeconomy plays a unique role in addressing hitherto unmet needs with the development of new types of services. There is rich potential in the forest bioeconomy for private forest owners and producers with activities that range from social biomass plants to collectively organized charcoal (biochar) production in remote rural areas. Most of these are service innovations, while some combine services with product innovations. Our findings challenge positions that regard economic and social issues as strictly separated. As a result, they are identified as two combined complementary sources of income for Europe&rsquo;s forest owners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiochar 3abioeconomics 3abiomass 3acollective action 3aeconomic development 3aemployment 3aforest industries 3aforest ownership 3aforests 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3apeople 3aprivate forestry 3arural areas 3asocial class 3aEurope1 aZivojinovic, Ivana 1 aHujala, Teppo 0 tForests.g2019 Oct. 06, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f101008783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245009900153300001400252500002000266520162400286592002801910650002201938650001501960650001401975650000801989650001801997650001402015650003502029650001302064650001802077650001402095650001702109650001302126650001602139651001402155651001702169700001802186700001602204700001502220773013102235856007202366852000902438655001202447IND60588541320221117233040.0180118e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058854132DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.32242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDainys, J.10aMortality of silver eels migrating through different types of hydropower turbines in Lithuania  ap. 52-59.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHydropower plants (HPP) are considered to be one of the major threats to the survival of European eels when they migrate downstream along inland water bodies during the early part of their annual journey to the spawning area in the Sargasso Sea. There are 98 HPPs in Lithuania and thousands throughout Europe. Numerous studies describe HPP induced mortality rates among European eels as variable depending on local, environmental, and technical factors. This heterogeneity in effect complicates theoretical extrapolation to eel mortality arising from specific types of HPP, necessary for effective management of local stocks. Silver eel mortality was estimated for 4 different HPPs in Lithuania. Mortality was estimated using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification, passive integrated transponders) tags and acoustic telemetry in a large HPP (>100 MW) with Kaplan turbines, a small HPP (<1 MW) with a Kaplan turbine and a fish passage, and for the first time in two small HPPs (<1 MW) with CINK turbines. The results supported a hypothesis that the mortality rate of migrating eels depends mainly on the type and size of the turbine. HPP induced mortality varied from 100% in a small CINK turbine down to 25% in the large HPP with Kaplan turbines. The importance of simple mitigation measures was highlighted by 34% of all tagged eels bypassing one of the HPP via an adjacent fish passage constructed for upstream migration of salmonids. The observed differences in mortality provide essential information for long term strategies designed to restore depleted eel populations in Lithuania and other European countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnguilla anguilla 3aSalmonidae 3aacoustics 3aeel 3ainland waters 3amortality 3aradio frequency identification 3aspawning 3asurface water 3atelemetry 3atransponders 3aturbines 3awater power 3aLithuania 3aSargasso Sea1 aStakėnas, S.1 aGorfine, H.1 aLožys, L.0 tRiver research and applications.g2018 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.52-59dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.32243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011400162300001800276520176800294592002802062650001002090650002002100650001602120650001702136650001902153650001202172650000902184650001702193650001802210650001902228650001402247650001402261653001102275653002602286653003202312653001302344653001302357653001502370700001702385700001402402700001702416700001602433700002002449700001602469700001802485773012302503856008002626852000902706655001202715IND60563478420221119085555.0170223e20170222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056347842DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b158312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Cuitian10aPeptide-22 and Cyclic RGD Functionalized Liposomes for Glioma Targeting Drug Delivery Overcoming BBB and BBTB  ap. 5864-5873.  aChemotherapy outcomes for the treatment of glioma remain unsatisfied due to the inefficient drug transport across BBB/BBTB and poor drug accumulation in the tumor site. Nanocarriers functionalized with different targeting ligands are considered as one of the most promising alternatives. However, few studies were reported to compare the targeting efficiency of the ligands and develop nanoparticles to realize BBB/BBTB crossing and brain tumor targeting simultaneously. In this study, six peptide-based ligands (Angiopep-2, T7, Peptide-22, c(RGDfK), D-SP5 and Pep-1), widely used for brain delivery, were selected to decorate liposomes, respectively, so as to compare their targeting ability to BBB or BBTB. Based on the in vitro cellular uptake results on BCECs and HUVECs, Peptide-22 and c(RGDfK) were picked to construct a BBB/BBTB dual-crossing, glioma-targeting liposomal drug delivery system c(RGDfK)/Pep-22-DOX-LP. In vitro cellular uptake demonstrated that the synergetic effect of c(RGDfK) and Peptide-22 could significantly increase the internalization of liposomes on U87 cells. In vivo imaging further verified that c(RGDfK)/Pep-22-LP exhibited higher brain tumor distribution than single ligand modified liposomes. The median survival time of glioma-bearing mice treated with c(RGDfK)/Pep-22-DOX-LP (39.5 days) was significantly prolonged than those treated with free doxorubicin or other controls. In conclusion, the c(RGDfK) and Peptide-22 dual-modified liposome was constructed based on the targeting ability screening of various ligands. The system could effectively overcome BBB/BBTB barriers, target to tumor cells and inhibit the growth of glioma, which proved its potential for improving the efficacy of chemotherapeutics for glioma therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3abrain neoplasms 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3amice 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3ascreening 3asynergism 0aglioma 0ablood−brain barrier 0ablood−brain tumor barrier 0aliposome 0ac(RGDfK) 0aPeptide-221 aDuan, Ziqing1 aYuan, Yan1 aLi, Ruixiang1 aPang, Liang1 aLiang, Jianming1 aXu, Xinchun1 aWang, Jianxin0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Feb. 22, v. 9, no. 7 p.5864-5873dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b158313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245009200159300001800251520109800269592002801367650002501395650002301420650001301443650001201456650001301468650001401481650002901495650002301524650001801547650001101565650001301576650001101589650001201600650001301612650001501625650001301640700001701653700002201670700002001692700001801712700001401730773016401744856008101908852000901989655001201998IND60613873420221117033137.0180917e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061387342DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-017-1568-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSen, S.10aPhycoremediation of cyanide from coke–oven wastewater using cyanobacterial consortium  ap. 2151-2164.  aOwing to the presence of several toxic pollutants such as cyanide, phenol, ammonium, coke–oven wastewater is being considered as hazardous stream and needs to be treated properly.

The growth kinetics was studied considering nitrate as substrate. Since consortium showed growth in cyanide solution, a model was proposed considering both nitrate and cyanide as substrates. The simulated data match quite well with experimental ones. Two coke–oven wastewater samples were collected—untreated one from equalization tank and another from secondary clarifier effluent and treated with consortium separately.

TA was used as the crossing-linking agent to improve the mechanical and barrier properties, and as the active substance to improve the anti-ultraviolet and antioxidant abilities of the chitosan/gelatin (CG) film. With the incorporation of TA from 0 to 1 wt%, the tensile strength of the CG film was increased while the water vapor and oxygen permeability of the film were decreased. The CG-TA films containing more than 0.5 wt% of TA could effectively block most of UV light. The DPPH radical scavenging assay significant increased to 89.3% when the concentration of TA reached 2 wt%. Finally, CG and CG-TA films, as an active packaging material, were used to preserve the cold-stored fresh-cut apples. Compared with CG film, the CG-TA films obtained better performance on decreasing weight loss, delaying browning degree, inhibiting the lipid oxidase activity and decreasing the malondialdehyde content during 10 d of storage under 4 °C. Therefore, CG-TA films were expected to be a new active packaging material for preserving fresh-cut apples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aantioxidants 3achitosan 3acold storage 3agelatin 3alipids 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidoreductases 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3atannins 3atensile strength 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater vapor 3aweight loss 0aChitosan 0aGelatin 0aTannic acid 0aActive food packaging 0aFresh-cut apples1 aYang, Zhikun1 aShi, Jiyong1 aXiaobo, Zou,1 aZhai, Xiaodong1 aHuang, Xiaowei1 aLi, Zhihua1 aHolmes, Melvin1 aDaglia, Maria1 aXiao, Jianbo0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 144 p.111223-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009500164300001600259520196400275592002802239650001202267650001202279650002002291650001802311650002202329650001102351650003302362650000902395650001902404651001402423651001702437700001702454700001502471700001302486700001502499773009702514856008102611852000902692655001202701IND60087618120221121013019.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008761812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2012.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForootan, E.10aIndependent patterns of water mass anomalies over Australia from satellite data and models  ap. 427-443.  aThe Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) products allow the quantification of total water storage (TWS) changes at global to regional scales. However, the quantity measured by GRACE represents mass signals integrated over vertical columns, requiring their separation into their original sources. Such a separation is vital for Australia, for which GRACE estimates are affected by leakage from the surrounding oceans. The independent component analysis (ICA) method that uses higher-order statistics, is implemented here to separate GRACE-derived water storage signals over the Australian continent from its surrounding oceans, covering from October 2002 to May 2011. The performance of ICA applied to GRACE is then compared to the ICA of WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) and the ICA of the Australian Water Resources Assessment (AWRA) system. To study the influence of rainfall variability on the derived independent patterns, use is made of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data set, from January 2000 to May 2011. Implementing ICA on GRACE-TWS showed a remarkable improvement in separating the continental hydrological signals from the surrounding oceanic anomalies, which was not achievable using a conventional principle component analysis. Reconstructing the continental TWS changes using only those independent components of GRACE that were located over the continent showed a high correlation with WGHM-TWS and AWRA-TWS. Mass concentrations over the oceans and particularly S2 semi-diurnal aliased pattern were separated as independent modes. Correlation analysis between the independent components of GRACE and climate teleconnections showed that the mass anomalies over the northern ocean, Gulf of Carpentaria and north-eastern parts of Australia were significantly correlated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, while those over south and south-eastern parts of Australia were mainly linked to the Indian Ocean Dipole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aglobal change 3ahydrologic models 3aoceans 3aprincipal component analysis 3arain 3aremote sensing 3aAustralia 3aIndian Ocean1 aAwange, J.L.1 aKusche, J.1 aHeck, B.1 aEicker, A.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2012 Sept., v. 124 p.427-443dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2012.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245015300158520178000311592002802091650002002119650001002139650001402149650000902163650001202172650001302184650002002197650001402217650002302231650001202254650001502266650001502281650001002296650002302306650001302329650001002342651001002352700002002362700002002382700001702402773011902419856007202538852000902610655001202619IND60648714120221120221720.0190701e20170727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064871412DNAL7 a10.3390/f80802682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dongsheng10aBiomass Modeling of Larch (<em>Larix</em> spp.) Plantations in China Based on the Mixed Model, Dummy Variable Model, and Bayesian Hierarchical Model  aWith the development of national-scale forest biomass monitoring work, accurate estimation of forest biomass on a large scale is becoming an important research topic in forestry. In this study, the stem wood, branches, stem bark, needles, roots and total biomass models for larch were developed at the regional level, using a general allometric equation, a dummy variable model, a mixed effects model, and a Bayesian hierarchical model, to select the most effective method for predicting large-scale forest biomass. Results showed total biomass of trees with the same diameter gradually decreased from southern to northern regions in China, except in the Hebei province. We found that the stem wood, branch, stem bark, needle, root, and total biomass model relationships were statistically significant (p-values < 0.01) for the general allometric equation, linear mixed model, dummy variable model, and Bayesian hierarchical model, but the linear mixed, dummy variable, and Bayesian hierarchical models showed better performance than the general allometric equation. An F-test also showed significant differences between the models. The R2 average values of the linear mixed model, dummy variable model, and Bayesian hierarchical model were higher than those of the general allometric equation by 0.007, 0.018, 0.015, 0.004, 0.09, and 0.117 for the total tree, root, stem wood, stem bark, branch, and needle models respectively. However, there were no significant differences between the linear mixed model, dummy variable model, and Bayesian hierarchical model. When the number of categories was increased, the linear mixed model and Bayesian hierarchical model were more flexible and applicable than the dummy variable model for the construction of regional biomass models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aLarix 3aallometry 3abark 3abiomass 3abranches 3aconifer needles 3aequations 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aroots 3astatistical models 3astemwood 3atrees 3aChina1 aHuang, Xingzhao1 aZhang, Shougong1 aSun, Xiaomei0 tForests.g2017 July 27, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80802683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013600169300001400305520219200319592002802511650002002539650001102559650002102570650002602591650001102617650001402628650001402642650001402656650002202670651000902692653002402701653003502725653002102760653001402781653002702795700002302822700002302845773009902868856008502967852000903052655001203061IND60635706620221121041812.0190529e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063570662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2018.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNosrati, Kazem10aFingerprinting sub-basin spatial sediment sources using different multivariate statistical techniques and the Modified MixSIR model  ap. 32-43.  aInformation on the relative contributions of sediment from different sources is needed to target sediment control strategies to prevent excess sediment delivery to receptors like dam reservoirs. The overarching scientific objective of this study was therefore to apportion sub-basin spatial source contributions to the supply of fine sediment in an erodible mountainous basin in north-eastern Iran to inform management. The technical objective was to satisfy the scientific objective using a source fingerprinting procedure based on composite signatures selected by different statistical tests. Nine potential geochemical tracers were measured on 21 sediment samples collected to characterise the three sub-basin spatial sediment sources and seven sediment samples collected at the outlet of the main basin. The statistical analysis employed to select three different composite fingerprints for discriminating the sub-basin sediment sources comprised: (1) the Kruskal–Wallis H test (KW-H), (2) a combination of KW-H and discriminant function analysis (DFA), and (3) a combination of KW-H and principal components & classification analysis (PCCA). A Bayesian un-mixing model was used to ascribe sub-basin source contributions using the three composite fingerprints. Using KW-H, the respective relative contributions from sub-basins 1, 2 and 3 were estimated as 45.6%, 3.8% and 50.6%, compared to 46.8%, 18.8% and 34.4% using KW-H and DFA, and 61%, 2.5% and 36.5% using KW-H and PCCA. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test pairwise comparisons of the distributions of predicted source proportions generated using different composite signatures confirmed statistically significant differences. The root mean square difference between the predicted source proportions based on different composite signatures was ~12%. This study therefore provides more evidence that source tracing studies should deploy a number of composite signatures selected using independent statistical tests to permit appraisal of the consistencies or otherwise in predicted source contributions based on the tracers used. The outputs of this preliminary study will be used to inform the spatial targeting of sediment mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3abasins 3adams (hydrology) 3adiscriminant analysis 3amodels 3amountains 3areceptors 3asediments 3atracer techniques 3aIran 0aGeochemical tracers 0aModified MixSIR Bayesian model 0aSediment tracing 0aSub-basin 0aStatistical techniques1 aCollins, Adrian L.1 aMadankan, Mohammad0 tCatena.g2018 May, v. 164 p.32-43dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01985naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245007400163300001800237500001500255520089600270592002801166650000901194650001101203650001101214650000801225650001101233650001401244653002501258653001701283653001901300653001301319653000801332653002601340700002001366773012401386856008001510852000901590655001201599IND60528885120221121225826.0160717e20160406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052888512DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b017752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Chan-Kyu,10aCsI as Multifunctional Redox Mediator for Enhanced Li–Air Batteries  ap. 8561-8567.  a2019-12-06  aWe introduce CsI as a multifunctional redox mediator to enhance the performance of Li–air batteries. CsI dissolved in the electrolyte is ionized into Cs⁺ and I–, which perform their roles in the Li anode and air electrode, respectively. The I– ions in the electrolyte facilitate the dissolution of Li₂O₂ in the air electrode as a redox mediator, which reduces the overpotential of the cell. The low overpotential also leads to the suppression of parasitic reactions occurring in the high-voltage range, such as the decomposition of the electrolyte and the reaction between Li₂O₂ and carbon. At the same time, the Cs⁺ ions act as an electrostatic shield at the sharp points of the Li anode, hindering the growth of Li dendrite. The combined effects of reduced parasitic reactions and hindered Li-dendrite growth successfully improve the cyclic performance of Li–air cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aions 3acesium 3acarbon 3aair 3aanodes 3abatteries 0aelectrostatic shield 0aelectrolytes 0aredox mediator 0acatalyst 0aCsI 0alithium−air battery1 aPark, Yong Joon0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Apr. 06, v. 8, no. 13 p.8561-8567dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b017753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011300173300001800286520156800304592002801872650002101900650001701921650001301938650001801951650001101969650001101980700002101991700002102012700002202033700002002055773010602075856008102181852000902262655001202271IND60121205220221121235349.0150217e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012120522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8450-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmboh, Markus Karamoy10aNon-stoichiometric curing effect on fracture toughness of nanosilica particulate-reinforced epoxy composites  ap. 7454-7461.  aNon-stoichiometric curing effects on the fracture toughness behaviors of nanosilica particulate-reinforced epoxy composites were experimentally investigated in this study by comparing them with bending strengths to take into consideration the effect of interaction between nanoparticles and network structures in matrix resins. The matrixes were prepared by curing them with an excess mixture of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A-type epoxy resin as the curing agent for the stoichiometric condition. The volume fractions of the silica particles with a median diameter of 240 nm were constantly 0.2 for all composites. The neat epoxy resins and the composites were cured non-stoichiometrically to change the crosslinking densities of the neat epoxy resins and the matrix resins of the composites within 2740–490 mol/m³. The fracture toughnesses and bending strengths of the composites and the neat epoxy resins strongly depended on the crosslinking densities in the resins. Although the fracture toughness decreased monotonously from that of the stoichiometrically cured resins as the crosslinking density decreased, the fracture toughnesses of composites were largest at a slightly lower crosslinking density of approximately 2490 mol/m³from the stoichiometric condition of 2740 mol/m³. The fracture toughness and the bending strength were improved for crosslinking densities higher than 2000 mol/m³by adding particles. At crosslinking density lower than 2000 mol/m³, the particles worked against the mechanical properties as defects in matrix resins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abending strength 3acrosslinking 3aepoxides 3ananoparticles 3aresins 3asilica1 aAdachi, Tadaharu1 aNemoto, Tadamasa1 aHiguchi, Masahiro1 aMajor, Zoltán,0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 Nov., v. 49, no. 21 p.7454-7461dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8450-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245014500204300001800349500001900367520134200386592002801728650003001756650001001786650002301796650001601819650001901835700002001854700006101874700005801935773013701993856008002130852000902210655001202219IND60712065820221117224326.0201009e20200907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071206582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c046232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Rikuri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0465-552810aMolecular Mechanism for the Actin-Binding Domain of α-Actinin Ain1 Elucidated by Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Mutagenesis Experiments  ap. 8495-8503.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, α-actinin Ain1 bundles F-actin into the contractile ring (CR) in the middle of the cell. Previous studies have proposed that a conformational change of the actin-binding domain (ABD) of Ain1 enhances the actin-binding activity. However, the molecular mechanism of the conformational change remains to be unveiled at an atomic resolution due to the difficulties of experimental techniques to observe them. In the present study, we performed a set of microsecond-order molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for ABD of Ain1. Our MD simulations for a pathogenic point mutation (R216E) in ABD did not result in large domain motions as previously expected. However, local motions of the loop regions were detected. Besides the three conventional actin-binding sites, we found characteristic electrostatic interactions with the N-terminal of actin. The mutagenesis experiment in fission yeast showed that collapses of the electrostatic interactions at the binding site abolished the proper localization of Ain1 to the CR. Furthermore, the MD simulation of F-actin with the Ain1 ABD R216E indicated that the stronger affinity is caused by a direct interaction of the point mutation. Our findings might be applicable to other highly conserved ABP family proteins to explain their binding affinities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aactin 3amolecular dynamics 3amutagenesis 3apoint mutation1 aNakano, Kentaro1 aShigeta, Yasuteru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3219-60071 aHarada, Ryuhei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7987-05400 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Sept. 07, v. 124, no. 39 p.8495-8503dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c046233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015700171300001800328520160700346592002801953650001301981650002201994650003502016650001302051650001702064650001302081650000902094650001902103650000902122650001302131650002202144650001902166653002202185653002902207653002002236653001402256653002802270653001002298700001902308773007902327856008902406852000902495655001202504IND60545378220221119173301.0160901e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054537822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Laiby10aBioenhanced dissolution of dense non-aqueous phase of trichloroethylene as affected by iron reducing conditions: Model systems and environmental samples  ap. 1113-1119.  aThe anaerobic biotransformation of trichloroethylene (TCE) can be affected by competing electron acceptors such as Fe (III). This study assessed the role of Fe (III) reduction on the bioenhanced dissolution of TCE dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL). Columns were set up as 1-D diffusion cells consisting of a lower DNAPL layer, a layer with an aquifer substratum and an upper water layer that is regularly refreshed. The substrata used were either inert sand or sand coated with 2-line ferrihydrite (HFO) or two environmental Fe (III) containing samples. The columns were inoculated with KB-1 and were repeatedly fed with formate. In none of the diffusion cells, vinyl chloride or ethene was detected while dissolved and extractable Fe (II) increased strongly during 60d of incubation. The cis-DCE concentration peaked at 4.0cm from the DNAPL (inert sand) while it was at 3.4cm (sand+HFO), 1.7cm and 2.5cm (environmental samples). The TCE concentration gradients near the DNAPL indicate that the DNAPL dissolution rate was larger than that in an abiotic cell by factors 1.3 (inert sand), 1.0 (sand+HFO) and 2.2 (both environmental samples). This results show that high bioavailable Fe (III) in HFO reduces the TCE degradation by competitive Fe (III) reduction, yielding lower bioenhanced dissolution. However, Fe (III) reduction in environmental samples was not reducing TCE degradation and the dissolution factor was even larger than that of inert sand. It is speculated that physical factors, e.g. micro-niches in the environmental samples protect microorganisms from toxic concentrations of TCE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abiotransformation 3adense nonaqueous phase liquids 3aethylene 3aferrihydrite 3aformates 3airon 3amicroorganisms 3asand 3atoxicity 3atrichloroethylene 3avinyl chloride 0aTrichloroethylene 0aReductive dechlorination 0aFe (III) oxides 0aDiffusion 0aBioenhanced dissolution 0aDNAPL1 aSmolders, Erik0 tChemosphere.g2015 Jan., v. 119 p.1113-1119dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012600174300001600300520105200316592002801368650002301396650001501419650001601434650001201450650001801462650002001480650001801500650001001518650001801528650001001546650002601556650001701582650001201599650002001611650002301631653002101654653005101675653001001726653003401736653001201770653001601782700002101798773010001819856008701919852000902006655001202015IND60542396220221120094610.0190402e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054239622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBharath Kumar, S.12aA study on starch profile of rajma bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) incorporated noodle dough and its functional characteristics  ap. 124-132.  aStarch profile reflects functional characteristics like digestibility and product quality. A study was aimed to incorporate rajma in noodle processing to improve product and nutritional quality and also to reduce starch digestibility. It is known that some of the pulses like Kidney beans have an isoforms of Starch-Branching-Enzyme (SBE) helps in converting amylose to amylopectin. Rajma flour was incorporated at 10%, 20% and 30% with Triticumdurum and subjected to rheological, physico-chemical and amylose/amylopectin determination using High-Performance-Size-Exclusion-Chromatography (HPSEC). Results revealed that rajma flour decreased peak-viscosity from 954 to 683BU and increased water absorption. Protein and dietary fiber content increased significantly. Sensory profile showed higher overall quality (>8.5). In vitro starch digestibility reduced from 65% to 49%. Starch profile from HPSEC showed changes in amylose:amylopectin peak, this may be because of the presence of SBE, further studies may be required to support the hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aabsorption 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3adietary fiber 3adietary protein 3adigestibility 3adough 3afiber content 3aflour 3afunctional properties 3akidney beans 3anoodles 3anutritive value 3asensory evaluation 0aStarch profiling 0aHigh Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography 0aRajma 0aIn vitro starch digestibility 0aAmylose 0aAmylopectin1 aPrabhasankar, P.0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 180 p.124-132dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01878naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245008300213300002000296520084800316592002801164653001901192653001501211653002401226653001501250653002901265773019401294856007901488852000901567655001201576IND60518027620221120220207.0160406e20151222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051802762DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15216511122doi7 aPMC46974352pmcid7 a266217502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasanova, Jean-Laurent10aSevere infectious diseases of childhood as monogenic inborn errors of immunity  ap. E7128-E7137.  aSignificance The key problem concerning pediatric infectious diseases, and more generally clinical diseases during primary infection, is their pathogenesis. A plausible and testable human genetic theory of primary infectious diseases has recently emerged, building on elegant studies in plants and animals. Three examples of monogenic resistance to common infections have been discovered. Moreover, a growing range of monogenic single-gene inborn errors of immunity, rarely Mendelian (with complete clinical penetrance) but more commonly non-Mendelian (with incomplete penetrance), have been found to underlie severe infectious diseases striking otherwise healthy children during primary infection. These findings provide a synthetic framework for inherited and infectious diseases and, more generally, for inborn and environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 0ahuman genetics 0aimmunology 0ainfectious diseases 0apediatrics 0aprimary immunodeficiency0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Dec. 22, v. 112, no. 51 p.E7128-E7137dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15216511123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015700173300001500330520146100345592002801806650001101834650001701845650002501862650002201887650001901909650002001928650002301948650001201971650001601983650001501999650002002014650001202034650002002046650001302066650000902079650002502088650001702113650002002130651001002150653002102160653001902181653002502200653002002225653002302245653002002268700002402288700002302312700002002335700002102355700001902376700002102395700001602416700002002432700002502452773009802477856008502575852000902660655001202669IND60537769220221120210745.0190416e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053776922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, Sheila M.W.10aFinding solutions to water scarcity: Incorporating ecosystem service values into business planning at The Dow Chemical Company’s Freeport, TX facility  ap. 94-107.  aWater scarcity presents a major risk to businesses, but it can be hard to quantify. Ecosystem service valuation methods may help businesses better understand the financial impacts of water shortages and identify solutions. At The Dow Chemical Company’s facility in Freeport, TX, we used natural capital asset valuation to assess the risk from future changes in industrial water supplies. We found that the value of industrial water rights may increase in the future with increased demand but that potential decreases in reliability of water rights due to demand growth and climate change could reduce their value. Using this information, experts identified 16 potential nature-based and collaborative (involving other water users) solutions to future water scarcity. We used multi-criteria analysis to select five of the 16 solutions for further analysis. Two solutions (marsh wastewater treatment, land management) were not cost-competitive and three solutions (reservoir flood pool reallocation/floodplain restoration, irrigation efficiency, municipal rebate program) were cost-competitive with the business-as-usual solution (expanding reservoir storage). However, these solutions have significant technical, legal, and political hurdles. We also found that these solutions provide substantial collective benefits to the public and biodiversity, suggesting that such solutions may be appropriate for implementation via multi-stakeholder collaboration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3abiodiversity 3abusiness enterprises 3abusiness planning 3aclimate change 3aeconomic impact 3aecosystem services 3aexperts 3afloodplains 3airrigation 3aland management 3amarshes 3anatural capital 3apolitics 3arisk 3awastewater treatment 3awater rights 3awater shortages 3aTexas 0aAsset management 0aClimate change 0aGreen infrastructure 0aNatural capital 0aProject evaluation 0aRisk management1 aMcDonald, Robert I.1 aS.

However, the release of protein molecules from the nanogels without damages to the structures and functionalities is quite a challenging research subject. In this research, responsive self-immolative linker dithioethyl carbamate bond is introduced to connect protein and polymer in the nanogel so that traceless release of protein occurs upon addition of glutathione (GSH) or dithiothreitol (DTT). Thermoresponsive polymer poly(di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate-co-2-(2-(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfanyl) ethyl methacrylate) was synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, and was modified with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate yielding polymer chains with pendant dithioethyl carbonate groups. The dithioethyl carbonate groups were reacted with amine groups of lipases resulting in the formation of dithioethyl carbamate bonds. Meanwhile, biohybrid nanogels were prepared by crosslinking the polymer chains with lipases. The immobilized lipase in the nanogels exhibited enhanced heat and acid resistance. Once the nanogels were treated with GSH or DTT, lipase could be released with no residual groups and most of its bioactivity was recovered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid tolerance 3abioactive properties 3acarbonates 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acrosslinking 3adithiothreitol 3aglutathione 3aheat 3amethyl ethers 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3apolymers 0aNanogel 0aSelf - immolative linker 0aProtein protection 0aTraceless release1 aZhang, Yue1 aNiu, Zhanghao1 aYang, Yongfang0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 184 p.110526-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.1105263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245010200211300001400313520199900327592002802326653000802354653001002362653001002372653000802382653000902390653000902399653001102408653000902419653002402428653001902452653000802471653002302479653001502502653000802517700001802525700001902543700002102562700002002583700002202603700002002625700001702645773007602662856008302738852000902821655001202830IND60555021820221119015530.0161026e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055502182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2014.11.0112doi7 aPMC43098522pmcid7 a255069252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumagai, Takeshi10aFunctional interaction between cyclooxygenase-2 and p53 in response to an endogenous electrophile  ap. 74-86.  aCyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is rapidly expressed by various stimuli and plays a key role in conversion of free arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. We have previously identified 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a lipid peroxidation-derived electrophile, as the potent Cox-2 inducer in rat epithelial RL34 cells and revealed that the HNE-induced Cox-2 expression resulted from the stabilization of Cox-2 mRNA that is mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In the present study, we investigated an alternative regulatory mechanism of Cox-2 expression mediated by a transcription factor p53. In addition, to characterize the causal role for Cox-2, we examined the effects of Cox-2 overexpression in RL34 cells. To examine whether the HNE-induced Cox-2 expression was mechanistically linked to the p53 expression, we analyzed changes in Cox-2 and p53 expression levels in response to HNE and observed that the Cox-2 levels were inversely correlated with the p53 levels. Down-regulation of p53 followed by the activation of a transcription factor Sp1 was suggested to be involved in the HNE-induced Cox-2 gene expression. To characterize the effect of Cox-2 expression in the cells, we established the Cox-2-overexpressing derivatives of RL34 cells by stable transfection with Cox-2 cDNA. An oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a dramatic down-regulation of the proteasome subunit RC1 in the Cox-2 overexpressed cells compared to the empty-vector transfected control cells. Consistent with the Cox-2-mediated down-regulation of proteasome, a moderate reduction of the proteasome activities was observed. This proteasome dysfunction mediated by the Cox-2 overproduction was associated with the enhanced accumulation of p53 and ubiquitinated proteins, leading to the enhanced sensitivity toward electrophiles. These results suggest the existence of a causal link between Cox-2 and p53, which may represent a toxic mechanism of electrophilic lipid peroxidation products.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCox 0aEMSAs 0aGAPDH 0aHNE 0aMAPK 0aRIPA 0aRT-PCR 0aTTBS 0a4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal 0aCyclooxygenase 0ap53 0aLipid peroxidation 0aProteasome 0aSp11 aUsami, Hiroko1 aMatsukawa, Nao1 aNakashima, Fumie1 aChikazawa, Miho1 aShibata, Takahiro1 aNoguchi, Noriko1 aUchida, Koji0 tRedox Biology.g2015 Apr., v. 4 p.74-86dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2014.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245014600209300001600355520185600371592002802227650001902255650001302274650001802287650002502305650001802330650002202348650002002370650001902390650001802409650001202427650001102439650002302450650001002473650001402483650002102497650002502518653001502543653001602558653001902574653002202593653001902615700001802634700001702652700002202669773012302691856008302814852000902897655001202906IND60739185720221120082201.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073918572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTemiz, Mehmet Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4680-302310aMixture of leaf and flower extract of Prunus spinosa L. alleviates hyperglycemia and oxidative stress in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats  ap. 145-151.  aDiabetes Mellitus is a global health problem that leads to various complications associated with hyperglycemia. In traditional medicine, herbal treatment is one of the alternative ways to cope with this type of disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the antidiabetic and hepato-pancreatic protective effects of the mixture of Prunus spinosa leaves and flowers (PSE) extract in streptozocin-induced diabetes mellitus. Seven random experimental groups of Wistar rats (n = 8) were created as followed; control, diabetic, PSE25, PSE50, insulin, metformin, and acarbose. α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of PSE were determined. Antioxidant enzymes activities and lipid peroxidation were analyzed in the liver tissue. Histopathological examination of liver and pancreas was also performed. α-amylase and α-glucosidase IC₅₀ inhibition values of PSE were found more efficient, comparing to those of standard acarbose. While blood glucose levels severely increased in all diabetic groups, PSE25 and PSE50 treatments were effective in regulating blood glucose levels. Moreover, administration of PSE25 and PSE50 improved insulin levels compared to the diabetic group. Although increased oxidative stress in the diabetes seriously suppressed antioxidant activities, PSE25 and PSE50 supplementation significantly recuperated liver antioxidant capacity. Despite severe degenerative and necrotic changes in diabetes, these findings alleviated with PSE administrations. Moreover, PSE treatments remarkably recuperated β-cells. These results reveal that there may be an alternative way to control high blood glucose levels, which is one of the most important complications of diabetes. Furthermore, PSE can provide a protection against oxidative stress, liver and pancreatic damage by augmenting antioxidant capacity in diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus spinosa 3aacarbose 3aalpha-amylase 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes mellitus 3aflower extracts 3ahistopathology 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3ametformin 3aoxidative stress 3atraditional medicine 0aα-amylase 0aAntioxidant 0aα-glucosidase 0aDiabetes mellitus 0aPrunus spinosa1 aOkumus, Emine1 aYaman, Turan1 aKeles, Omer Faruk0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 Sept., v. 141 p.145-151dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245015300153520187300306592002802179650002602207650002802233650001602261650002402277650002002301650001802321650001302339650001602352650001502368650002402383650001302407650001902420650001302439650002402452650001302476650001202489650002602501650002402527650001502551650002702566650001302593650001202606650001602618650001602634650001002650650001702660700001602677700001902693700001702712700001502729700001902744700001602763700001802779700001702797700001402814773011902828856007202947852000903019655001203028IND60648714420221120104640.0190701e20170728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064871442DNAL7 a10.3390/f80802642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aIn Vitro Tetraploid Induction from Leaf and Petiole Explants of Hybrid Sweetgum (<em>Liquidambar styraciflua</em> × <em>Liquidambar formosana</em>)  aLiquidambar is an important forestry species used to generate many commercial wood products, such as plywood. Inducing artificial polyploidy is an effective method to encourage genetic enhancements in forestry breeding. This report presents the first in vitro protocol for the induction of genus Liquidambar tetraploids based on the established in vitro regeneration system of hybrid sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua × Liquidambar formosana). The leaves and petioles from three genotypes were pre-cultured in woody plant medium (WPM) supplemented with 0.1 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ), 0.8 mg/L benzyladenine (BA), and 0.1 mg/L α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) for a variable number of days (4, 6 or 8 days), and exposed to varying concentrations of colchicine (120, 160, 200 mg/L) for 3, 4 or 5 days; the four factors were investigated using an orthogonal experimental design. Adventitious shoots were rooted in 1/2 WPM medium supplemented with 2.0 mg/L indole butyric acid (IBA) and 0.1 mg/L NAA. The ploidy level was assessed using flow cytometry and chromosome counting. Four tetraploids and nine mixoploids were obtained from the leaves. Pre-treatment of the leaves for 8 days and exposure to 200 mg/L colchicine for 3 days led to the most efficient tetraploid induction. Producing 11 tetraploids and five mixoploids from petioles, the best tetraploid induction treatment for petioles was almost the same as that with the leaves, except that pre-culturing was required for only 6 days. In total, 15 tetraploids were obtained with these treatments. This study described a technique for the induction of tetraploid sweetgum from the leaves or petioles of parental material. Based on the success of polyploid breeding in other tree species, the production of hybrid sweetgum allotetraploids constitutes a promising strategy for the promotion of future forestry breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiquidambar formosana 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aacetic acid 3aadventitious shoots 3aallotetraploidy 3abenzyladenine 3abreeding 3achromosomes 3acolchicine 3aexperimental design 3aexplants 3aflow cytometry 3aforestry 3agenetic improvement 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3ain vitro regeneration 3aindole butyric acid 3amixoploidy 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3apetioles 3aplywood 3atetraploidy 3athidiazuron 3atrees 3awoody plants1 aWang, Zewei1 aQi, Shuaizheng1 aWang, Xiaoqi1 aZhao, Jian1 aZhang, Jinfeng1 aLi, Bailian1 aZhang, Yadong1 aLiu, Xuezeng1 aYuan, Wei0 tForests.g2017 July 28, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80802643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245009400203300001600297506007600313520133500389592002801724506003701752650003101789650003301820650001401853650001401867650001001881650001901891650001301910650002101923650001901944650001801963650001501981650001101996650000902007650001102016653002102027653003002048653001702078700002202095700002102117700001902138700001702157700001902174700002602193773017002219856007902389852000902468655001202477IND60173662420221207111858.0150603e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017366242DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12065871102doi7 aPMC35381962pmcid7 a232482692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, Li-Yin13aIL-33 drives biphasic IL-13 production for noncanonical Type 2 immunity against hookworms  ap. 282-287.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aParasitic helminths are a major cause of chronic human disease, affecting more than 3 billion people worldwide. Host protection against most parasitic helminths relies upon Type 2 cytokine production, but the mechanisms that regulate interleukin (IL) 4 and 13 production from CD4 ⁺ T helper 2 cells (T H2) and innate lymphoid type 2 cells (ILC2s) remain incompletely understood. The epithelial cell-derived cytokines IL-25 and IL-33 promote Type 2 responses, but the extent of functional redundancy between these cytokines is unclear and whether Type 2 memory relies upon either IL-25 or IL-33 is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate a pivotal role for IL-33 in driving primary and anamnestic immunity against the rodent hookworm Nippostrongylus brasiliensis . IL-33–deficient mice have a selective defect in ILC2–derived IL-13 during both primary and secondary challenge infections but generate stronger canonical CD4 ⁺ T helper 2 cells responses (IL-4, IgE, mast cells, and basophils) than WT controls. Lack of IL-13 production in IL-33–deficient mice impairs resistin-like molecule beta (RELMβ) expression and eosinophil recruitment, which are two mechanisms that eliminate N. brasiliensis parasites from infected hosts. Thus, IL-33 is requisite for IL-13 but not IL-4–driven Type 2 responses during hookworm infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aNippostrongylus brasiliensis 3abasophils 3ahookworms 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-4 3amast cells 3amemory 3amice 3apeople 0amucosal immunity 0agastrointestinal nematode 0ainflammation1 aLewkowich, Ian P.1 aDawson, Lucas A.1 aDowney, Jordan1 aYang, Yanfen1 aSmith, Dirk E.1 aHerbert, De'Broski R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Jan. 2, v. 110, no. 1 p.282-287dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12065871103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009600162520123300258592002801491650001901519650001701538650001801555650001701573650001301590650001901603650001801622650002101640650002501661653002501686653001801711653004101729653000801770653001001778653000801788653000901796653001001805653001001815700001701825700001901842700001601861700001801877700001501895773012201910856008102032852000902113655001202122IND60729975920221120064210.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072997592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yujia10aPreparation and characterization of whey protein isolate nanoparticles in supercritical CO2  aProtein nanoparticles represent a promising system for the encapsulation and delivery of bioactive compounds or highly sensitive ingredients. In this study, whey protein isolate nanoparticles (WPINs) were prepared by using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO₂) treatment. The effects of scCO₂ on the size and stability of the WPINs were investigated. The average particle diameter ranged from 100 to 300 nm when the WPIN solution was treated with scCO₂ at 8–24 MPa and 45 °C for 30 min. ScCO₂-treated WPINs had more uniform size distribution and smaller particles than WPINs prepared without scCO₂. However, particle aggregation was observed during heating to 55–75 °C. Fluorescence and differential thermogravimetric analysis showed that CO₂ pressure did not cause secondary and tertiary structure changes or denaturation of WPINs. The change in WPINs size was likely caused by the high diffusibility of scCO₂, which could slightly modify WPINs local structure, affecting hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding within the molecule. These results indicate that the size of nano-particles can be modulated by adjusting CO₂ pressure, which may facilitate WPINs use in food and biomedical products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adenaturation 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3aparticle size 3athermogravimetry 3awhey protein isolate 0aWhey protein isolate 0aNanoparticles 0aSupercritical carbon dioxide process 0aDSC 0ascCO2 0aWPI 0aWPIN 0aα-la 0aβ-lg1 aKang, Naixin1 aCheng, Haiyang1 aChu, Xuebin1 aSun, Zhengwei1 aXi, Chunyu0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 144 p.111227-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245006700215300001800282520077500300592002801075650001001103650001101113650004401124650002301168700002401191773009401215856008501309990002301394852000901417655001201426IND60098250420221120104150.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009825042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.04.0042doi7 aPMC47936602pmcid7 a225221812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustina, Ahleah S.10aHERG potassium channel regulation by the N-terminal eag domain  ap. 1592-1598.  aHuman ether-á-go-go related gene (hERG, Kᵥ11.1) potassium channels play a significant role in cardiac excitability. Like other Kᵥ channels, hERG is activated by membrane voltage; however, distinct from other Kᵥ channels, hERG channels have unusually slow kinetics of closing (deactivation). The mechanism for slow deactivation involves an N-terminal “eag domain” which comprises a PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain and a short Cap domain. Here we review recent advances in understanding how the eag domain regulates deactivation, including several new Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) solution structures of the eag domain, and evidence showing that the eag domain makes a direct interaction with the C-terminal C-linker and Cyclic Nucleotide-Binding Homology Domain.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3ahumans 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apotassium channels1 aTrudeau, Matthew C.0 tCellular signalling.g2012 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.1592-1598dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.04.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245013300151520123400284592002801518650001801546650001301564650001101577650001901588650004301607650001701650650001301667650001101680650002101691650001601712650000901728650002601737650001001763700001401773700001301787700001601800700001701816700001801833700001401851773011901865856007201984852000902056655001202065IND60648714520221120123534.0190701e20170728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064871452DNAL7 a10.3390/f80802662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Qi10aVariation in the Concentrations of Major Secondary Metabolites in <em>Ginkgo</em> Leaves from Different Geographical Populations  aGinkgo biloba L. is a well-known relict tree species and an important medicinal plant. Ginkgo is rich in secondary metabolites (SMs), mainly including flavonoids, lactones, and ginkgolic acid. The aim of this study was to determine variations in the concentrations of these SMs in Ginkgo leaves from different geographical populations. The SMs in the leaves of 298 clones from 10 geographical populations grafted under the same conditions were extracted and measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that there were significant differences in concentrations of SMs in leaves from different populations (p < 0.01). The concentrations of both flavonoids and lactones were significantly negatively correlated with that of ginkgolic acid. Altitude and annual rainfall were important factors influencing the concentrations of lactones, and the frost-free period influenced the concentration of isorhamnetin. Population Yingdianjie (YDJ) was ideal for the plantations from which medicinal flavonoids and lactones are extracted, followed by populations Xiaopu (XP), Anlu (AL) and Wuchuan (WC). As variations within each population were found, attention should be paid to selection within populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGinkgo biloba 3aaltitude 3aclones 3aginkgolic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aisorhamnetin 3alactones 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3aplantations 3arain 3asecondary metabolites 3atrees1 aMu, Kemin1 aXu, Meng1 aMa, Xueying1 aNi, Zhouxian1 aWang, Jianwen1 aXu, Li-an0 tForests.g2017 July 28, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80802663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013200169520102300301592002801324650002401352650001201376650001101388650001901399650002201418650001701440650001301457650002301470650002601493650001301519650001901532650001401551653002401565653001001589653002801599653001501627653003301642700001801675700001401693700001801707773010601725856008701831852000901918655001201927IND60681570120221120212153.0201125e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068157012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1227962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yanguang10aEnhancing methanogenesis from anaerobic digestion of propionate with addition of Fe oxides supported on conductive carbon cloth  aIn this study, a Fe₂O₃ supported on conductive carbon cloth (FC) was prepared and supplemented into anaerobic digestion reactors to improve propionate degradation.

Various techniques such as the genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and dynamic programming (DP) have been employed to calculate reservoir operation rules. This paper implements the data mining techniques SVM and ANN to calculate the optimal release rule of hydropower reservoirs under “forecasting” and “non-forecasting” scenarios. The employment of data mining techniques accounting for data uncertainty to calculate optimal hydropower reservoir operation is novel in the field of water resource systems analysis. The optimal operation of the Karoon 3 reservoir, Iran, serves as a test of the proposed methodology. The upstream streamflow, storage records, and several lagged variables are model inputs. Data obtained from solving the reservoir optimization problem with nonlinear programming (NLP) are applied to train (calibrate) the SVM, and ANN, SVM, and ANN are executed in the “non-forecasting” scenario based on all inputs along with their time-lagged variables. In contrast, current parameters are removed from the set of inputs in the “forecasting” scenario. The results of the SVM model are compared with those of the ANN model with the correlation coefficient (R), the mean error (ME), and the root mean square error (RMSE). This paper’s results indicate performance of the SVM is better than that of the ANN model by 1.5%, 400%, and 10% with respect to the R, ME, and RMSE diagnostic statistics, respectively. In addition, SVM and ANN overcome data uncertainty (“forecasting” scenario) to produce optimal reservoir operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic programming 3ahydroelectric power 3aneural networks 3aplanning 3astream flow 3asupport vector machines 3auncertainty 3awater management 3aIran1 aAboutalebi, Mahyar1 aAshofteh, Parisa-Sadat1 aLoaiciga, Hugo A.,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Oct., v. 190, no. 10 p.594-594dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6970-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245009800159300001600257520130000273592002801573650001401601650001501615650001501630650001801645650001501663650002601678650001301704650002101717650002101738650001501759650001901774650001401793650001101807650003201818700002501850700001701875700001701892700002101909700002201930773012701952856007202079852000902151655001202160IND60663049020221121140414.0190909e20100305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066304902DNAL7 a10.1039/b920815a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarantola, Marco10aDynamics of human cancer cell lines monitored by electrical and acoustic fluctuation analysis  ap. 139-150.  aEarly determination of the metastatic potential of cancer cells is a crucial step for successful oncological treatment. Besides the remarkable progress in molecular genomics- or proteomics-based diagnostics, there is a great demand for in vitro biosensor devices that allow rapid and selective detection of the invasive properties of tumor cells. Here, the classical cancer cell motility in vitro assays for migration and invasion relying on Boyden chambers are compared to a real-time biosensor that analyzes the dynamic properties of adherent cells electro-acoustically with a time resolution on the order of seconds. The sensor relies on the well-established quartz crystal microbalance technique (QCM) that measures the shift in resonance frequency and damping of an oscillating quartz crystal when adsorption, desorption or changes in material properties close to the quartz surface occur. In addition, the QCM is capable of detecting the rather subtle fluctuations of the cell bodies as an indicator for their micromotility. QCM-based micromotility readings of three different cancer cell lines (HT-29, HSC-4, FaDu) are compared with the well-known electrical cell–substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) revealing collective stochastic motion that corresponds to the malignancy of the cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aadsorption 3abiosensors 3acell movement 3adesorption 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenomics 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro studies 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aquartz 3aquartz crystal microbalance1 aMarel, Anna-Kristina1 aSunnick, Eva1 aAdam, Holger1 aWegener, Joachim1 aJanshoff, Andreas0 tIntegrative biology.g2010 Mar. 5, v. 2, no. 2-3 p.139-150dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b920815a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245012800174520126700302592002801569650001501597650001601612650001001628650001101638650000701649650001501656650001101671650001201682650001801694650001601712650001201728650001901740653001601759653001701775653002801792653002401820653002901844700001901873700001701892700001701909700002101926773009901947856009002046852000902136655001202145IND60743632320221121200539.0210813e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074363232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7371282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Huanhuan10aEvaluation of dynamic stress level and physiological change for live salmon in waterless and low-temperature transportation  aLive fish waterless transportation is a low cost and promising strategy. But how to improve survival rate and reduce stress are challenging goal. This paper aims to explore the effect of ambient and stress indicators on fish state in waterless transportation. Multi-sensors ambient indicators and breath rate stress indicator monitoring system were designed and implemented in live salmon waterless transportation. Dynamic probing for fish stress changes in term of acceleration sensor-based that is a significant survey to get optimum temperature and improve fish survival rate.The critical indicators dynamic prediction and live salmon state diagnosis model were developed by using CNN-SVM algorithm. And stress level evaluation model is established based on ambient indicators and stress indicator by using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. After 10h waterless transportation, the quality indicators i.e. texture, color and pH changes were measured and evaluated. The results show that multi-sensors real-time monitoring are significant to improve survival rate and fish flesh. Quality properties of live salmon samples decreased more slowly than dead salmon. This will provide an effective and reliable survival evaluation and transportation management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaquaculture 3acolor 3amodels 3apH 3aprediction 3asalmon 3asurveys 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3atexture 3atransportation 0aLive salmon 0aMulti-sensor 0aStress level evaluation 0aSurvival prediction 0aWaterless transportation1 aZhang, Mengjie1 aZhang, Luwei1 aChen, Bingqi1 aZhang, Xiaoshuan0 tAquaculture.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 544 p.737128-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7371283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245015500154300001400309500002000323520121900343592002801562650001301590650001401603650001601617650002201633650001001655650001101665650002701676650002101703650001301724700001601737773013101753856007201884852000901956655001201965IND60588541920221117233100.0180118e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058854192DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.31852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGleeson, T.10aHow much groundwater can we pump and protect environmental flows through time? Presumptive standards for conjunctive management of aquifers and rivers  ap. 83-92.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGroundwater is a critically important source of water for river, wetland, lake, and terrestrial ecosystems, yet most frameworks for assessing environmental flows have ignored or not explicitly included the potential impacts of groundwater pumping on environmental flows. After assessing the processes and existing policies for protecting streamflow depletion from groundwater pumping, we argue that a new groundwater presumptive standard is critical as a placeholder to protect environmental flows in rivers lacking detailed assessments. We thus extend the previous presumptive standard to groundwater pumping, a different and important driver of changes to streamflow. We suggest that “high levels of ecological protection will be provided if groundwater pumping decreases monthly natural baseflow by less than 10% through time.” The presumptive standard is intended to be a critical placeholder only where detailed scientific assessments of environmental flow needs cannot be undertaken in the near term. We also suggest a new metric, the environmental flow response time, that allows water managers to quantify the timescales of the impacts of groundwater pumping on the loss or gain of environmental flows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abase flow 3agroundwater 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3arivers 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awater management 3awetlands1 aRichter, B.0 tRiver research and applications.g2018 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.83-92dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.31853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01945naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245008800160300001800248520069600266592002800962650001400990650001601004650001501020650001701035650001001052650001101062653001901073653002201092653002501114653001901139653002401158653002301182700001601205700001401221700001201235700001701247700001601264700001801280773012401298856008001422852000901502655001201511IND60528885520221121144152.0160717e20160406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052888552DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b029622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Chunyu10aGrowth of NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 Nanocolumn Arrays with Superior Pseudocapacitor Properties  ap. 8568-8575.  aThree-dimensional heterostructured NiCo₂O₄@MnMoO₄ nanocolumn arrays (NCAs) on Ni foam were first fabricated through an improved two-step hydrothermal process associated with a successive annealing treatment.

However, the mechanism by which metabolic enzymes control gene expression to optimize plant stress responses remains largely unknown in Arabidopsis thaliana. LOS2/ENO2 is a bifunctional gene transcribed a functional RNA that translates a full-length version of the ENO2 protein and a truncated version of the MBP-1 protein. Here, we report that eno2 negatively regulates plant tolerance to salinity stress. NaCl treatment caused the death of the mutant eno2/eno2 homozygote earlier than the wild type (WT) Arabidopsis. To understand the mechanism by which the mutant eno2 had a lower NaCl tolerance, an analysis of the expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset from the WT and mutant eno2 Arabidopsis was conducted. Firstly, the most identified up- and down-regulated genes are senescence-associated gene 12 (SAG12) and isochorismate mutase-related gene, which are associated with salicylic acid (SA) inducible plant senescence and endogenous SA synthesis, respectively. Secondly, the differentially regulated by salt stress genes in mutant eno2 are largely enriched Gene Ontology(GO) terms associated with various kinds of response to stimulations. Thirdly, in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping, we find that knocking out ENO2-influenced genes were most enriched into metabolite synthesis with extra plant-pathogen interaction pathway and plant hormone signal transduction pathway. Briefly, with the translation shifting function, LOS2/ENO2 not only influenced the genes involved in SA synthesis and transduction, but also influenced genes that participate in metabolite synthesis in cytoplasm and gene expression variation in nuclear under salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data  a31470399 and 31270365cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA 3acytoplasm 3adata collection 3adeath 3aenzymes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3ahomozygosity 3aknockout mutants 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aplant hormones 3asalicylic acid 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asignal transduction 3asodium chloride 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)1 aZhang, Yonghua1 aYe, Pan1 aMa, Xiaofeng1 aZheng, Chaoxing1 aZhang, Genfa0 tMolecular biology reports.g2018 Oct., v. 45, no. 5 p.1331-1338dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-018-4292-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012700159500001400286520130500300592002801605650001701633650001801650650001501668650001101683650002301694650001401717650001001731651001601741700002301757700002601780700002301806700002001829700002301849700002201872773011801894856007402012852000902086655001202095IND60704507220221120154654.0200724e20200509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070450722DNAL7 a10.3390/w120513452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChalov, Sergey 10aHydrodynamic Controls of Particulate Metals Partitioning Along the Lower Selenga River—Main Tributary of The Lake Baikal  aNAL-light  aIn this study, the downstream effects of pollutants spreading due to hydromorphological gradients and associated changes in sediment transport conditions along the braided-meandering and deltaic distributary reach of a large river downstream section are discussed. We demonstrate the significance of hydrodynamic control for sediment-associated metal partitioning along the river. Typically, the downward decline of the sediment and metals spreading towards Lake Baikal is observed due to buffer effects in the delta. During peak flow, the longitudinal gradients in heavy metal concentration along the distributary delta reach are neglected due to higher concentrations delivered from the upper parts of the river. In particular, significant variations of heavy metal concentrations associated with the river depth are related to sediment concentration and flow velocity profiles. Various particulate metal behavior in silt-sand delta channels and the sand–gravel Selenga main stem emphasize the importance of near-bottom exchange for particles spreading with the river flow. Using empirically derived Rouse numbers, we found quantitative relationships between the ratio of particulate metals sorting throughout depth in a single river channel and the hydrodynamic conditions of sediment transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheavy metals 3ahydrodynamics 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediments 3awater 3aLake Baikal1 aMoreido, Vsevolod 1 aSharapova, Ekaterina 1 aEfimova, Lyudmila 1 aEfimov, Vasyli 1 aLychagin, Mikhail 1 aKasimov, Nikolay 0 tWater.g2020 May 09, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120513453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03960naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245017000172300001400342520210300356592002802459650000802487650001202495650001302507650002202520650001402542650001502556650001202571650001502583650002002598650002702618650001302645650001102658650001302669650001802682650000902700650003502709651001002744653001302754653001302767653001302780653001102793653000802804653000802812653000802820653000802828653000802836653001002844653000702854653000802861653000802869653000802877653000802885653002602893653002202919653001202941653001402953653001702967653002202984700001603006700002203022700002803044773008603072856008303158852000903241655001203250IND60576090620221119083455.0180830e20171005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057609062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2017.07.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenugopal, Priyanka10aAssociation of microRNA-125a and microRNA-499a polymorphisms in chronic periodontitis in a sample south Indian population: A hospital-based genetic association study  ap. 10-15.  aPeriodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease, caused by interaction between periodontopathic bacteria and the host immune response. MicroRNAs are small, single-stranded molecules, which play a key role in the regulation of diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs function can lead to several diseases such as autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. The objective of the study was to determine the association between selected single nucleotide polymorphisms in miR-125a, miR-499 and LIN28 homology A with chronic periodontitis susceptibility in a sample population from south India. Genotyping of the single nucleotide polymorphisms in miR-125a (rs41275794, rs12976445, rs10404453 and rs12975333), miR-499 (rs3746444) and LIN28 homolog A (rs3811463) was performed in DNA from288 controls (individuals with healthy gingiva) and 262 cases (chronic periodontitis patients) by direct dye-terminator sequencing. Disease association analysis revealed a significant association of the variant alleles of the miR-499a polymorphism (rs3746444) in chronic periodontitis [OR=2.07; 95%CI (1.35–3.17)]. The risk associated C-allele frequency was found to be higher in chronic periodontitis subjects as compared to that of healthy individuals. Similar results were also observed in the dominant model [OR=2.42; 95% CI (1.67–3.51)]. The recessive model for miR-125a polymorphism (rs12976445) was also found to be statistically significant with OR=1.54 and 95% CI (1.03–2.30). The haplotype “GCGGCA” was found to be higher in chronic periodontitis subjects than in healthy individuals. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium analysis exhibited that the polymorphisms, rs41275794 and rs12976445 in miR-125a, were in strong linkage equilibrium (D′=0.97). Epistatic interaction by multifactorial dimensionality reduction analysis revealed that the genotypes of the polymorphisms of miR-125a (rs41275794, rs12976445, rs10404453), miR-499a (rs3746444) and LIN28 (rs3811463) were interacting significantly [OR=2.54 (1.65–3.92)], thereby contributing to the risk of chronic periodontitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalleles 3abacteria 3achemical elements 3aepistasis 3agenotyping 3agingiva 3ahaplotypes 3aimmune response 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3apatients 3aperiodontitis 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aIndia 0amiR-125a 0amiR-499a 0amiR-146a 0aLIN28A 0aTLR 0aCAL 0aPPD 0aOHI 0aMDR 0aANOVA 0aLD 0aCHB 0aGIH 0aITU 0aEUR 0aChronic periodontitis 0aAssociation study 0aGenetic 0amicroRNAs 0aPolymorphism 0aSingle nucleotide1 aLavu, Vamsi1 aRao, Suresh Ranga1 aVenkatesan, Vettriselvi0 tGene.g2017 Oct. 05, v. 631 p.10-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.07.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245006800160300001600228520143100244592002801675650001701703650004201720650002101762650001301783650001401796650001101810650001001821650002801831650001101859650001801870650001401888650001101902650001201913650001201925650001801937650001001955651001701965700001701982700001301999700001502012700002002027773013402047856008202181852000902263655001202272IND60593212020221119213638.0190816e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059321202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1384-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtto, M.10aBacterial canker of cherry trees, Prunus avium, in South Africa  ap. 427-438.  aIn the 1980’s the causal agents of bacterial canker of cherry trees in South Africa was reported to be Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and Pseudomonas syringae pv. morsprunorum. Subsequently, no further studies were undertaken on the disease or causal agents. The aim of the current study was to conduct field surveys to determine the current situation pertaining to bacterial canker in the major cherry producing areas of South Africa. Following isolations from infected trees, strains were characterized using biochemical as well as multilocus sequence analyses (MLSA). Pathogenicity tests were undertaken with immature cherry fruit as well as three different cherry cultivars. Although symptoms of bacterial canker were present in all areas surveyed, P. syringae isolates were only isolated from three sites in the Western Cape Province. The isolates collected in this study showed a hypersensitive response on tobacco leaves and were pathogenic on immature cherry fruit and cherry trees. The phenotypic tests and MLSA using four genes (cts, gapA, gyrB and rpoD) showed phenotypic and genetic identity with Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. Selected strains induced a hypersensitive response on tobacco leaves and were pathogenic on immature cherry fruit and green cherry tree shoots. The current study shows that P. syringae pv. syringae is responsible for bacterial canker in the Western Cape Province, South Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus avium 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. morsprunorum 3abacterial canker 3acherries 3acultivars 3afruits 3agenes 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 3apathogenicity 3aphenotype 3ashoots 3asurveys 3atobacco 3atree diseases 3atrees 3aSouth Africa1 aPetersen, Y.1 aRoux, J.1 aWright, J.1 aCoutinho, T.

For a better understanding of the possibility of β-CDs including PNIPAAm and the crystal structure of PPRs formed therefrom, the PNIPAAm homo- and copolymers were subjected to self-assembly with β-CDs in an aqueous solution at room temperature. The results revealed that when β-CDs meet thicker PNIPAAms, the self-assembly takes place, not only giving rise to PPRs by a manner of main-chain inclusion complexation but also presenting the PPRs a matched over-fit crystal structure different from those of either a matched tight-fit β-CD–PPG PPR or a mismatched over-fit γ-CD–PNIPAAm PPR. This is most likely due to the thicker PNIPAAm adapting its unfavorable main-chain cross-sectional area to fit into the cavity of β-CDs by changing the side-chain conformations. Based on the X-ray diffraction patterns, a monoclinic crystal system was created from these PPRs and the unit cell parameters calculated were as follows: a = 15.3 Å, b = 10.3 Å, and c = 21.2 Å; β = 110.3°; and space group P2. It suggested that this matched over-fit crystal structure would possess a Mosaic crystal structure rather than a typical channel-like one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomo 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3apropylene glycol1 aLu, Hang1 aYe, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6568-30201 aZhang, Ai-Ying1 aFeng, Zeng-Guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3886-71630 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 May 22, v. 123, no. 23 p.5004-5013dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b030053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245011800211520128300329592002801612650002101640650002301661650002501684650001601709650001601725650002001741653001901761653001501780653001501795653001901810653001501829653001401844700005801858700001901916700001701935700005901952773009602011856008702107852000902194655001202203IND60675615520221120073651.0200121e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067561552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1069762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVainio, Annukka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1348-271010aConsumer perceptions raised by the food safety inspection report: Does the smiley communicate a food safety risk?  aThe publication of inspection grades at food establishments has been introduced as a way to inform consumers about restaurants' food safety levels. This two-part study explored consumers' perceptions and behavioural intentions raised by the Finnish food safety inspection report Oiva. The first part of the study explored university students' (n = 98) spontaneous perceptions raised by the inspection grade, communicated with a smiley face. Perceptions related to food safety risk and one's own behaviour were most frequent. In the second part, these perceptions were used in testing the full food safety inspection report on a nationally representative sample of the 18–65 years old Finnish population (n = 1513) with a survey-experiment approach. Binary logistic and linear regressions revealed that lower inspection grades were directly associated with increased perceived food safety risk and a behavioural intention not to eat at the restaurant when the effect of perceived food safety risk was taken into account. Information about the risk type moderated the effect of lower inspection grades on perceived risk and behavioural intention. These results underline the importance of providing additional information to consumers about the type of food safety risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollege students 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer information 3afood safety 3arestaurants 3arisk perception 0aPerceived risk 0aDisclosure 0aInspection 0aGrading scheme 0aRestaurant 0aMediation1 aKaskela, Jenni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0550-59511 aFinell, Eerika1 aOllila, Sari1 aLundén, Janne,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7006-231X0 tFood control.g2020 Apr., v. 110 p.106976-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1069763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007200165300001600237520094500253592002801198650001501226650001601241650001301257650002001270650001201290650003501302651001201337700002001349700001901369700001701388700002101405700002001426700001701446700001701463700001901480773010901499856008101608852000901689655001201698IND60515355920221116201848.0160313e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051535592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-016-1075-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuslén, Aino10aApplication of the Red List Index as an indicator of habitat change  ap. 569-585.  aFor the first time ever, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Index for habitat types was calculated for an entire country, Finland. The RLIs were based on species threat assessments from 2000 and 2010 and included habitat definitions for all 10,131 species of 12 organism groups. The RLIs were bootstrapped to track statistically significant changes. The RLI changes of species grouped by habitats were negative for all habitat types except for forests and rural biotopes which showed a stable trend. Trends of beetles and true bugs were positive in rural and forest habitats. Other 16 observed trends of species group and habitat combinations were negative. Several trends observed were in accordance with studies focusing on particular taxa and habitats, and drivers for their change. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the RLI as a tool for observing habitat change based on species threat assessment data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aHeteroptera 3abiotopes 3aforest habitats 3aforests 3anatural resources conservation 3aFinland1 aPykälä, Juha,1 aKuusela, Saija1 aKaila, Lauri1 aKullberg, Jaakko1 aMattila, Jaakko1 aMuona, Jyrki1 aSaari, Sanna1 aCardoso, Pedro0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2016 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.569-585dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1075-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007900163300001600242500001900258520112600277592002801403650002201431650002501453650001201478650001801490650001501508650002201523650001401545650002301559650002101582653003201603653001401635700001901649700001401668773014701682856008101829852000901910655001201919IND60689329420221120110041.0200421e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068932942DNAL7 a10.1080/096374809030422792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Liya10aAntioxidant activities of extracts and subfractions from Inonotus Obliquus  ap. 175-184.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe ethanolic crude extracts and three subfractions (ethyl acetate fraction, n-butanol fraction, and aqueous fraction) from Inonotus Obliquus were obtained by sequential partitioning and their antioxidant activities were investigated in the present study. The methods of the total antioxidant capacity measured by the ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay, reducing power assay, scavenging activities towards DPPH, superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical employed in this study were established in in vitro systems. The amounts of total phenolics and total flavonoids were also determined by spectrophotometer. The results showed that the crude extracts and subfractions exhibited antioxidant activities in different evaluating system. The decreasing order of antioxidant activities is ethyl acetate fraction >n-butanol fraction >crude extract>aqueous fraction. A similar order of the amounts of phenolics and flavonoids in extract and subfractions was found.

We investigated different P fractions and their transformations in different land uses (primary forest and pasture) and soil textures (clayey and sandy) in Amazonian Oxisols using path analysis. Besides P fractionation, phosphatase activity and its correlation with soil carbon (C):organic P (Po) ratio was evaluated to correlate it with soil P nutritional status. After 15 years from forest slashing and burning, total P in pasture reaches to the forest levels in Amazonian soils, regardless of soil texture. Path analysis showed that land use conversion from forest to pasture decreased the diversity of the contribution of P pools to buffer P extracted by anion exchange resin. However, Po accounted for one-fourth of total P in our sites, it plays an important role as source of plant available P and contributed more in pasture compared to forest. Our results from P fractionation and C:Po ratio revealed that Amazonian pastures and forests are not P deficient. We also showed that with increasing C:Po ratio, plant-available P content became more dependent on P mineralization. Soil acid phosphatase activity can be used as an indicator for evaluating soil P nutritional status; however, its range changes according to the land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxisols 3aacid phosphatase 3aanion exchange resins 3aburning 3adeforestation 3aenzyme activity 3aforests 3afractionation 3aland use change 3amineralization 3anutritional status 3apastures 3apath analysis 3aphosphorus 3asoil carbon 3asoil texture 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aPath analysis 0aAcid phosphatase 0aC:Po ratio 0aSoil P transformation 0aHedley P fractionation1 ade Moraes, Moacir Tuzzin1 aCherubin, Maurício Roberto1 aAlvarez, Dasiel Obregón1 ade Souza, Leandro Fonseca1 aBieluczyk, Wanderlei1 aNavroski, Deisi1 aBettoni Teles, Ana Paula1 aPavinato, Paulo Sérgio1 aMartinelli, Luiz Antonio1 aTsai, Siu Mui1 ade Camargo, Plínio Barbosa0 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Nov., v. 194 p.104330-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.1043303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01320naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013300163300002000296520041400316592002800730650001500758650001500773650001300788700001400801700002100815773012300836856007400959852000901033655001201042IND60641656420221120090301.0190505e20170523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064165642DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04178k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamsabadi, André10aEnabling the facile conversion of acyl hydrazides into N-acyl carbamates via metal-free ionic-based rupture of the N–N linkage  ap. 27608-27611.  aHerein we report the one-pot transformation of readily synthesised/easily accessed acyl hydrazides into N-acyl carbamates via an alkylation-elimination reaction sequence.

The exogenous application of methyl jasmonate induced the accumulation of putative pathogenesis-related proteins, class I chitinase, leucin-rich repeat protein, NtPRp27-like protein and pectinesterase which were also found in suspension cultured cells of C. annuum elicited with methyl jasmonate. However, a germin-like protein, which has never been described in methyl jasmonate-elicited C. chinense suspension cultured cells, was found. The different effects described as being the result of exogenous application of signalling molecules like methyl jasmonate on the expression of germin-like protein suggest that germin-like proteins may play a variety of roles in protecting plants against pathogen attacks and different stresses. Further studies will be necessary to characterize the differential expression of these pathogenesis-related proteins and to throw light on the complexity of their regulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCapsicum annuum 3aCapsicum chinense 3acell culture 3achitinase 3aculture media 3acultured cells 3agene expression regulation 3amethyl jasmonate 3apathogens 3apectinesterase1 aAlmagro, Lorena1 aBelchí-Navarro, Sarai1 aBarceló , Alfonso Ros1 aPedreño, Maria Angeles0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 6, no. 3 p.440-442dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.3.144513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245015100165300002000316520119100336592002801527650001501555650001301570650002001583650002101603650001901624650001701643650001901660650001401679650001301693700005801706700001801764700001601782700001401798700001201812773012201824856008701946852000902033655001202042IND60676850320221120092148.0191122e20191008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067685032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b023062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Ke10aMechanism of Degrading Petroleum Hydrocarbons by Compound Marine Petroleum-Degrading Bacteria: Surface Adsorption, Cell Uptake, and Biodegradation  ap. 11373-11379.  aThe amount and biodegradability of oil-degrading bacteria in seawater should be augmented to improve the biodegradation of marine petroleum hydrocarbons. This study investigated the degradation of petroleum-degrading bacteria (P1) with biosurfactant-producing bacteria (B2) and its mechanism. Two groups of experiments that consist of P1 with and without B2 were designed. The degradation performance and surface characteristics of the bacteria and the degradation path of diesel were studied. The degradation rate in the group of P1 with B2 was 82.65%, which was higher than that without B2, after 12 days. The analysis of surface characteristics showed that a high hydrophobicity enabled diesel to be accessible to cells. Meanwhile, the addition of B2 increased the contact area between bacteria and diesel, which was favorable to bioaugmentation degradation. The diesel degradation paths included surface adsorption, cell uptake, and biodegradation. The first step of diesel degradation was a rapid surface adsorption followed by cell uptake. The velocities of the removal rate of diesel by biodegradation and cell uptake in the group of P1 with B2 were higher than those without B2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abacteria 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrophobicity 3apetroleum 3aseawater1 aXue, Jianliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7066-83511 aXiao, Xinfeng1 aQiao, Yanlu1 aWu, Yanan1 aGao, Yu0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Oct. 08, v. 33, no. 11 p.11373-11379dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b023063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011900167300001600286500001900302520098000321592002801301650002001329650002501349650001301374650001801387650001301405650001201418650001101430650001401441650001701455650001401472650000901486650001101495653002301506653002701529653001601556653001501572653000901587653001001596700001701606700002201623700001701645700002401662700001901686700002301705700002101728700002601749773014701775856008101922852000902003655001202012IND60689329620221120071117.0200421e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068932962DNAL7 a10.1080/096374809030670372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElfalleh, Walid10aPhysico-chemical properties and DPPH-ABTS scavenging activity of some local pomegranate (Punica granatum) ecotypes  ap. 197-210.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeels and fresh pomegranate extracts were used in the present study for the determination of the physic-chemical properties and DPPH-ABTS scavenging activities.

(Apicomplexa, Sarcocystidae) in the imported great blue turaco Corythaeola cristata (Aves, Musophagidae)  ap. 56.  aBACKGROUND: Species of Sarcocystis are parasitic protozoa in poikilothermic and homeothermic animals. Out of the 26 valid species in birds as intermediate hosts, none has been reported in those of the order Musophagiformes, such as the great blue turaco Corythaeola cristata (Vieillot, 1816), which is a bird endemic to Central and Western Africa. The examination of great blue turacos imported from the Central Africa Republic to Czech Republic allowed the morphological and molecular characterization of a new species of Sarcocystis. METHODS: Four turacos imported from the Central Africa Republic to a private breeder (Czech Republic) underwent parasitological examination for the presence of sarcocysts through wet mounts of breast, heart and leg muscles. Found parasites were molecularly and histologically studied by four loci (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, ITS1 and cox1) and haematoxylin and eosin staining, respectively. RESULTS: Three out of four examined birds harboured numerous sarcocysts in the breast and leg muscles. No macroscopic lesions where observed. Sarcocysts were microscopic, elongate and ribbon-shaped with a wall characterised by the presence of finger-shaped villar protrusions and filled with numerous elongate, banana-shaped bradyzoites, 11.87–14.84 × 2.05–2.92 µm in size. The new species was most closely related to Sarcocystis albifronsi, Sarcocystis anasi, Sarcocystis atraii, Sarcocystis chloropusae, Sarcocystis rileyi, Sarcocystis wenzeli and Sarcocystis sp. isolate from chicken in the four loci. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first species of Sarcocystis found in a musophagiform bird worldwide. Genetically, S. cristata sp. nov. represents a distinct species. Phylogenetic analyses are useful for predicting potential definitive hosts of the new Sarcocystis species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusophagidae 3aProtozoa 3aSarcocystis 3abradyzoites 3abreasts 3achickens 3aeosin 3aheart 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3asarcocysts 3aCentral Africa 3aCzech Republic 3aWestern Africa1 aGonzález-Solís, David0 tParasites & vectors.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.56-56dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04553-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245006500162300001600227520149600243592002801739650001501767650002901782650002301811650001701834650001301851650002001864650002501884650001701909650001901926650002201945650002201967650002401989650001502013650001402028650001402042650002102056650001802077650000902095650001502104650001402119653002302133653002402156653001802180653002302198653001902221700001902240700001902259700001602278700001602294773010602310856008202416961001302498852000902511655001202520IND60709333220221117010235.0210209e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070933322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2019.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeye, K.M.10aPoultry processing and the application of microbiome mapping  ap. 678-688.  aChicken is globally one of the most popular food animals. However, it is also one of the major reservoirs for foodborne pathogens, annually resulting in continued morbidity and mortality incidences worldwide. In an effort to reduce the threat of foodborne disease, the poultry industry has implemented a multifaceted antimicrobial program that incorporates not only chemical compounds, but also extensive amounts of water application and pathogen monitoring. Unfortunately, the pathogen detection methods currently used by the poultry industry lack speed, relying on microbiological plate methods and molecular detection systems that take time and lack precision. In many cases, the time to data acquisition can take 12 to 24 h. This is problematic if shorter-term answers are required which is becoming more likely as the public demand for chicken meat is only increasing, leading to new pressures to increase line speed. Therefore, new innovations in detection methods must occur to mitigate the risk of foodborne pathogens that could result from faster slaughter and processing speeds. Future technology will have 2 tracks: rapid methods that are meant to detect pathogens and indicator organisms within a few hours, and long-term methods that use microbiome mapping to evaluate sanitation and antimicrobial efficacy. Together, these methods will provide rapid, comprehensive data capable of being applied in both risk-assessment algorithms and used by management to safeguard the public.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aantimicrobial properties 3achemical compounds 3achicken meat 3achickens 3adata collection 3adisease surveillance 3afood animals 3afood pathogens 3afoodborne illness 3aindicator species 3amicrobial detection 3amicrobiome 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apoultry industry 3arapid methods 3arisk 3asanitation 3aslaughter 0apoultry processing 0afoodborne pathogens 0arapid methods 0amicrobiome mapping 0abioinformatics1 aThompson, D.R.1 aRothrock, M.J.1 aKogut, M.H.1 aRicke, S.C.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.678-688dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245016100163500001400324520139200338592002801730650001601758650001201774650002201786650002101808650001201829650002901841650001601870650001001886650002101896650001101917650001501928650001801943650001701961650001801978650002201996700002702018700002502045773011802070856007402188852000902262655001202271IND60704507520221120154836.0200724e20200509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070450752DNAL7 a10.3390/w120513482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzumińska, Danuta 10aChanges in Hydromorphological Conditions in an Endorheic Lake Influenced by Climate and Increasing Water Consumption, and Potential Effects on Water Quality  aNAL-light  aThe study aims to analyse changes in the morphological conditions of the endorheic Lake Borówno (39.06 ha) that occurred in the 20th century and early 21st century. The analysis was based on bathymetric measurements carried out in 2018 and cartographic materials, and performed using QGIS 3.10 and SAGA GIS 6.4 software. Moreover, changes in physical (temperature, transparency), chemical (dissolved oxygen, phosphorus, and nitrogen content) and biological (chlorophyll a, phytoplankton) parameters were analysed based on the results of measurements conducted by the Voivodeship Inspectorate of Environment Protection (VIEP) in Bydgoszcz in the period 1984–2017. It was found that Lake Borówno is subject to a constant reduction in surface area and volume, the rate of which increased in the second decade of the 21st century. The lake’s progressive disappearance results from the co-occurrence of hydrological drought over the last several years and an increase in the use of groundwater resources. A decrease in the maximum depth of the lake entails a change in temperature distribution in the vertical profile, which contributes to the tendency toward the lake transforming into an unstratified reservoir. The increase in water temperature affects oxygen content in the bottom water, improves water transparency, and influences the maximum occurrence of chlorophyll a in spring.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3adissolved oxygen 3adrought 3aenvironmental protection 3agroundwater 3alakes 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3asurface area 3awater quality 3awater temperature1 aCzapiewski, Sebastian 1 aGoszczyński, Jacek,0 tWater.g2020 May 09, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120513483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008400166520155100250592002801801650001601829650001701845650001101862650002101873650003301894650001901927650001501946650001501961650001701976650002001993650001302013651001002026653002402036653001902060653001502079653001302094700001202107700001602119700002002135773011202155856008402267852000902351655001202360IND60749999920221121221737.0211114e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074999992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e017972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Shuai10aSatellite derived coastal reclamation expansion in China since the 21st century  aSince 2000, many coastal land reclamation projects have been implemented in China to alleviate the shortage of coastal land resources with rapid urban sprawl and economic growth. As a result, both the length and proportion of artificial shoreline increased significantly. Meanwhile, coastal reclamation inevitably brings some negative environmental and ecological issues, such as biodiversity loss, water pollution, and wetland degradation. In this study, based on the GlobeLand30 product and the OpenStreetMap based coastline data, we tracked the coastal reclamation expansion in China in the 21st century. Specifically, we analyzed the coastal reclamation intensity and coastal reclamation types of all coastal provinces in China, and explored the relationship between reclamation intensity and GDP growth to understand the reclamation status of coastal areas during 2000–2020. Our results showed that the total area of reclaimed land along the coast in China was 5135.31 km², of which artificial land and aquaculture were two main land-use/land-cover (LULC) types, accounting for 71.89% of the total reclamation area. Among all coastal provinces, Tianjin exhibited the greatest reclamation intensity (i.e., 7.16 km² km⁻¹) and Zhejiang Province had the largest reclamation area (i.e., 1304.65 km²). We also found the positive correlation between economic development and coastal reclamation. In addition, the progress of coastal reclamation activities has been greatly slowed down owing to national policies released in recent years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3aland restoration 3aland use and land cover maps 3areclaimed land 3asatellites 3ashorelines 3aurbanization 3awater pollution 3awetlands 3aChina 0aCoastal reclamation 0aRemote sensing 0aLand cover 0aLand use1 aXu, Nan1 aLi, Zhichao1 aHuang, Conghong0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Oct., v. 30 p.e01797-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e017973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245008700204300001800291520178300309592002802092650002202120650001202142650003002154650001102184650001702195650002102212650002302233650001602256650001702272650001302289700005502302773013502357856008002492852000902572655001202581IND60646806820221119035635.0190613e20190516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064680682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b034642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Longteng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9316-188X10aNitration of Tyrosine Channels Photoenergy through a Conical Intersection in Water  ap. 4915-4928.  aNitration of tyrosine occurs under oxidative stress in vivo. The product, 3-nitrotyrosine (3NY), has a dramatically decreased quantum yield and can be used as a molecular ruler. In this study, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum calculations were implemented to elucidate the photoinduced relaxation processes of anionic 3NY in water. Upon 400 nm excitation into an excited electronic state with notable charge-transfer (CT) character, a barrierless nitro-twisting motion rapidly (<100 fs) guides the chromophore into an adjacent twisted intramolecular CT state, therein reaching a sloped S₁/S₀ conical intersection on the ∼100 fs time scale. Once in the hot ground state, excess energy is further released through vibrational cooling with biexponential time constants of ∼140 and 680 fs in water. Nitro back-twisting occurs on longer time scales (∼1.1 and 9 ps in water), returning the system to original ground state. Systematic evaluations of excited-state potential energies of anionic 3NY were performed by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations, showing that intersystem crossing (ISC) from the first singlet state (S₁) to the first or second triplet state (T₁ or T₂) is unlikely. Inclusion of an explicit water molecule in calculations leads to improved mapping of the excited-state energy ordering of the second singlet state (S₂) and T₂, further diminishing ISC probability from S₁ and favoring an ultrafast internal conversion to S₀. These results provide deep insights into the highly efficient nonradiative decay of anionic 3NY in aqueous solution, with nitro-site-specific information that can help infer the characterization and potential optogenetic control of 3NY in protein environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acooling 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aoptogenetics 3aoxidative stress 3aphysical chemistry 3aprobability 3aspectroscopy 3atyrosine1 aFang, Chong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8879-18250 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 May 16, v. 123, no. 23 p.4915-4928dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b034643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245012500209300002000334520125400354592002801608650002401636650001901660650001701679650001201696650001301708650003701721650000901758650001601767650001201783700001701795700001801812700002701830700001901857700001401876700001301890700005701903700001501960700005501975773012202030856008702152852000902239655001202248IND60676850420221120081839.0191122e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067685042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b023152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0861-496610aEffects of Flame Temperature on PAHs and Soot Evolution in Partially Premixed and Diffusion Flames of a Diesel Surrogate  ap. 11821-11829.  aIn this paper, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot formation in rich partially premixed flames and nonpremixed flames were studied using a blend of n-heptane and toluene. The flames were diluted with Ar, N₂, and CO₂ to control the flame temperature. Laser-induced fluorescence, laser-induced incandescence, and two-color pyrometry were used to study the effects of flame temperature on the PAHs and soot evolution. Results show that temperature distributions are similar for different gas dilutions at low flow rates. However, the high-temperature area increases dramatically in size at high flow rates and it depends on diluents in the order Ar > N₂ > CO₂ with regard to flame temperature. With an increase in the flow rate of Ar, the higher growth rate of flame temperature and bigger region of high-temperature region can lead to a higher growth rate from small to large PAHs and higher soot volume fraction. However, for CO₂ dilution, the increased flow rate results in the increase of formation of large PAHs, but soot formation is reduced due to the fact that lower flame temperature suppresses the soot formation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the evolution of PAHs and soot strongly depends on flame temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3acarbon dioxide 3afluorescence 3aheptane 3anitrogen 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoot 3atemperature 3atoluene1 aCui, Yanqing1 aChen, Beiling1 aKyritsis, Dimitrios C.1 aTang, Qinglong1 aFeng, Lei1 aWang, Yu1 aLi, Zhongshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0447-27481 aGeng, Chao1 aYao, Mingfa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7293-87140 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 33, no. 11 p.11821-11829dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b023153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010400164300001600268520088200284592002801166650001401194650001101208650002301219650002001242650001201262650001801274650001601292650002301308651001001331653002501341653001001366653001001376653001501386653002301401700002301424700002501447700001601472773011601488856008301604852000901687655001201696IND60581908720221116165735.0190415e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058190872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2017.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalleja, A.10aAcoustic and economic valuation of soundscape: An application to the ‘Retiro’ Urban Forest Park  ap. 272-278.  aUrban parks play an outstanding role in cities in protecting their inhabitants from the stress of daily life. However, these green areas might be affected by noise pollution, thus reducing their social function. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to characterize the soundscape of the Retiro Park, an urban forest park located in Madrid (Spain), and (ii) to estimate the willingness to pay for a noise reduction program. For that purpose, sound levels were measured in different areas in the park, and an on-site survey was conducted to monitor the visitor’s sound perception. The noise pollution in the park was not perceived as being high by the majority of the visitors, even though the measurements indicate values of LAeq>55dB(A) in 6 out of the 9 studied areas. Finally, visitors would be willing to pay 6.36€ once in a lifetime towards a noise reduction program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3acities 3aeconomic valuation 3anoise pollution 3asurveys 3aurban forests 3aurban parks 3awillingness to pay 3aSpain 0aContingent valuation 0aNoise 0aSound 0aUrban park 0aWillingness to pay1 aDíaz-Balteiro, L.1 aIglesias-Merchan, C.1 aSoliño, M.0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2017 Oct., v. 27 p.272-278dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2017.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024001700135024002100152024003500173024001100208040001800219100001800237245008300255300001100338506007600349506017300425520124200598592002801840506003701868650002301905650001601928650001301944650002501957650001501982650001501997650001202012650001902024650002002043650001002063650002802073650002102101650001302122650000902135650001902144650001102163650001002174650002102184650001002205700001702215773012802232856011202360856008202472956013802554961001302692852000902705655001202714IND60006135120221214225016.0200513e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000613512DNAL7 a262734322pmid7 aPMC45353972pmcid7 a3131042aris7 a10113/613512hdl7 a10.1186/s40104-015-0034-z2doi8 ans7949  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliver, W.

It functions as an antimicrobial agent by cleaving the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell walls, which leads to cell death. Antibiotics are also antimicrobials and have been fed at subtherapeutic levels to swine as growth promoters. These compounds benefit swine producers by minimizing production losses by increasing feed efficiency and decreasing susceptibility to bacterial infection and disease. This manuscript reviews the knowledge of the effects of lysozyme, as compared to traditional subtherapeutic antibiotics in swine feed, on pig performance and health. It is clear from decades of studies that antibiotic use in feeds increases pig performance, particularly in the nursery. Similarly, lysozyme, as a feed additive, increases growth and feed efficiency. While the mechanism by which antibiotics and lysozyme improve performance is not clearly understood, both of these feed additives improve gastrointestinal health, improve the metabolic profile, and alter the gastrointestinal bacteria ecology of swine. Therefore, lysozyme is a suitable alternative to growth-promoting subtherapeutic antibiotic use in swine feed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal performance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acell death 3acell walls 3aecology 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3afeeds 3agastrointestinal system 3agrowth promotion 3alysozyme 3amilk 3apeptidoglycans 3asaliva 3aswine 3aswine production 3atears1 aWells, J.

In Italy, the presence of MG or MS has been investigated especially in commercial poultry farms. To our knowledge, no systematic investigations on MG or MS presence using highly specific diagnostic assays have been performed in backyard poultry. The aim of this study was to detect and molecularly characterize MG and MS strains in 11 backyard poultry flocks located in different regions of Italy. Tracheal swabs were collected and DNA was extracted. For MS, a PCR targeting a vlhA gene fragment was performed, and typing and subtyping was attempted. The presence of MG was investigated by a screening PCR, then MG typing by gene-targeted sequencing (GTS). All the amplicons were sequenced, then MG and MS dendrograms were constructed. All the flocks examined resulted Mycoplasma positive: 5 out of 11 (45.45%) were MG and MS positive, 3 (27.27%) were MG positive, and the remaining 3 (27.27%) were MS positive. The MS detections were assigned to types C, D, and F. All strains of type D belonged to subtype D1 and 2 unknown subtypes were identified. A MS sequence showed peculiar characteristics, which did not allow assignment to a known MS type or subtype. MG GTS analysis identified 6 MG strains belonging to 5 subclusters circulating in Italian backyards chicken flocks. The results of this study provide evidence of a risk for commercial poultry farms, especially in areas where backyard and commercial farms are close, suggesting the implementation of biosecurity measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3aMycoplasma synoviae 3abiosecurity 3achickens 3acommercial farms 3afinancial economics 3aflocks 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apoultry industry 3arisk 3ascreening 3aItaly 0abackyard poultry 0aItaly 0aMycoplasma gallisepticum 0aMycoplasma synoviae1 aLupini, Caterina1 aMescolini, Giulia1 aSilveira, Flavio1 aGuerrini, Alessandro1 aCatelli, Elena1 aDi Francesco, Antonietta0 tPoultry science.g2020 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.719-724dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245015900203300001800362520138100380592002801761650001301789650002201802650001801824650001201842650001301854650002401867650001401891650001301905650001701918700002001935700001601955700001401971700001901985700002502004700002002029700002702049773013502076856008002211852000902291655001202300IND60646806920221119035646.0190613e20190516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064680692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b034772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKameda, Yasuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4534-401310aSolvation Structure of Li⁺ in Methanol and 2-Propanol Solutions Studied by ATR-IR and Neutron Diffraction with ⁶Li/⁷Li Isotopic Substitution Methods  ap. 4967-4975.  aNeutron diffraction measurements have been carried out on 10 mol % LiTFSA (TFSA: bis(trifluoromethylsulfonil)amide) solutions in methanol-d₄ and 2-propanol-d₈ to obtain information on the solvation structure of Li⁺. The detailed coordination structure of solvent molecules within the first solvation shell of Li⁺ was determined through the least-squares fitting analysis of the difference function between normalized scattering cross sections observed for ⁶Li/⁷Li isotopically substituted sample solutions. The nearest-neighbor Li⁺···O distance and coordination number determined for the 10 mol % LiTFSA–methanol-d₄ solution are rLᵢO = 1.98 ± 0.02 Å and nLᵢO = 3.8 ± 0.6, respectively. In the 2-propanol-d₈ solution, it has been revealed that 2-propanol-d₈ molecules within the first solvation shell of Li⁺ take at least two different coordination geometries with the intermolecular nearest-neighbor Li⁺···O distance of rLᵢO = 1.93 ± 0.04 Å. The Li⁺···O coordination number, nLᵢO = 3.3 ± 0.3, is determined. Ion-pair formation in the LiTFSA–methanol and LiTFSA–2-propanol solutions has been investigated by the attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopic method. Mole fractions of free, Li⁺-bound, and aggregated TFSA– are derived from the peak deconvolution analysis of vibrational bands observed for TFSA–.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aleast squares 3alithium 3amethanol 3aneutron diffraction 3asolvation 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy1 aSatō, Kōichi,1 aHasebe, Ryo1 aAmo, Yuko1 aUsuki, Takeshi1 aUmebayashi, Yasuhiro1 aIkeda, Kazutaka1 aŌtomo, T.q(Toshiya),0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 May 16, v. 123, no. 23 p.4967-4975dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b034773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014600171300001800317520169200335592002802027650001302055650002602068650000902094650001302103650001002116650001402126650001402140650002202154650002302176651001002199700002302209700001802232700002302250700002102273700002002294700002202314773009802336856008602434852000902520655001202529IND60089036720221116164636.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008903672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInomata, Yayoi10aInfluence of blocking effect of mountain and local front on two Asian-dust events observed at Mt. Haruna and Tsukuba in Kanto, Japan, in 2007  ap. 4429-4441.  aAerosol number concentrations were continuously measured at sites at Tsukuba and Mt. Haruna on the Kanto region of Japan by using optical particle counters (OPCs) from February to June 2007. Three specific dust events captured at the sites were analyzed by using lidar, backward trajectories, and model simulation in detail. The temporal variations in aerosol concentrations in the two Asian-dust events (K1 event: 31 March–3 April; K2 event: 25–28 May) were similar. Dust particles (≥2.0 μm in diameter) were transported in association with a synoptic-scale cold front, and they arrived at the Tsukuba site about 8 h after they were observed at the Mt. Haruna site, in association with the dissipation of a local front formed ahead of the cold front. However, the inflow patterns of dust particles differed between the K1 and K2 events. The K1 event flowed onto the Kanto Plain, detouring around the mountainous region, whereas the K2 event directly flowed across the mountains. The difference in inflow pattern was probably due to the blocking effects of the mountains and the formation of a stable layer near the surface. Preceding the dust plume arrival, an increase in the number concentration of small-aerosol particles (0.3–1.0 μm in diameter), which are considered to be spherical by lidar, was observed, but only at the Tsukuba site. This increase was possibly due to anthropogenic pollution transported over long distances from the continent and from domestic sources in the Kanto region. The third event was a local dust event, because it was observed only at the Tsukuba site (on 13 and 14 March) under dry conditions (<RH 20%) and strong winds (>10 m s⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acold 3acounters 3alidar 3amountains 3apollution 3asimulation models 3atemporal variation 3aJapan1 aIgarashi, Yasuhito1 aNaoe, Hiroaki1 aTakahashi, Hiroshi1 aShimizu, Atsushi1 aSugimoto, Nobuo1 aTanaka, Taichu Y.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2011 Aug., v. 45, no. 26 p.4429-4441dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007300167300001800240520144800258592002801706650001001734650002001744650001601764650001601780650004301796650001501839650001001854650001601864650000901880650000701889650002001896650001501916650001201931650001501943700002101958700003001979700002102009773011702030856008502147852000902232655001202241IND60120759920221119225651.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012075992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-7399-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao Dan,12aA method for the determination of D-kynurenine in biological tissues  ap. 9747-9754.  aD-Kynurenine (D-KYN), a metabolite of D-tryptophan, can serve as the bioprecursor of kynurenic acid (KYNA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine, two neuroactive compounds that are believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of several neurological and psychiatric diseases. In order to investigate the possible presence of D-KYN in biological tissues, we developed a novel assay based on the conversion of D-KYN to KYNA by purified D-amino acid oxidase (D-AAO). Samples were incubated with D-AAO under optimal conditions for measuring D-AAO activity (100 mM borate buffer, pH 9.0), and newly produced KYNA was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorimetric detection. The detection limit for D-KYN was 300 fmol, and linearity of the assay was ascertained up to 300 pmol. No assay interference was noted when other D-amino acids, including D-serine and D-aspartate, were present in the incubation mixture at 50-fold higher concentrations than D-KYN. Using this new method, D-KYN was readily detected in the brain, liver, and plasma of mice treated systemically with D-KYN (300 mg/kg). In these experiments, enantioselectivity was confirmed by determining total kynurenine levels in the same samples using a conventional HPLC assay. Availability of a sensitive, specific, and simple method for D-KYN measurement will be instrumental for evaluating whether D-KYN should be considered for a role in physiology and pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3adetection limit 3aenantiomers 3afluorometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akynurenine 3aliver 3ametabolites 3amice 3apH 3apathophysiology 3aphysiology 3atissues 3atryptophan1 aHorning, Kyle J.1 aNotarangelo, Francesca M.1 aSchwarcz, Robert0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 Dec., v. 405, no. 30 p.9747-9754dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-7399-73Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002700156245013700183300001800320520206800338592002802406650001102434650001002445650000902455650002102464650002102485650002202506650002502528650001402553700001802567700001902585773009702604856009002701990002302791852000902814655001202823IND60095816720221122154407.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009581672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldsborough, S. Scott12aA computationally efficient, physics-based model for simulating heat loss during compression and the delay period in RCM experiments  ap. 3476-3492.  aA computationally efficient, physics-based model is developed to account for the heat loss that occurs during the compression process and delay period in rapid compression machine (RCM) experiments. The model is formulated using multiple zones (MZs) and accounts for conductive losses in the main reaction chamber as well as convective losses in the piston crevice and ringpack regions. Blowby past the piston ringpack is also considered. The loss terms can be incorporated into the widely-utilized ‘adiabatic core’ model in order to perform ‘volumetric expansion’ calculations during chemical kinetic simulations that correct for pressure and temperature reductions resulting from these energy losses. An advantage of this approach over existing models and ‘ad-hoc’, or empirical methods is that the MZM constants are only a function of the machine geometry and therefore do not vary from experiment to experiment. As such, fewer experiments need to be conducted (e.g., non-reacting tests+reacting tests at each condition), while existing literature data can be more reliably utilized for kinetic model validation and improvement. This formulation also has the potential to account for effects of multi-stage ignition, as well as phase change that can occur during experiments with involatile, transportation-relevant fuels. The performance of the new MZM is validated here via comparisons with multi-dimensional RCM simulations as well as experiments employing non-reacting and reacting mixtures. Excellent agreement is demonstrated for the overall pressure decay experienced in the reaction chamber during the delay period, as well as the computed gas temperature and velocity behavior within the crevice. Predicted thermal stratification within the reaction chamber also agrees well when high pressure, low viscosity conditions are utilized, i.e., when no vorticular motion is present. Computed ignition delay times for H₂/O₂/diluent mixtures using the new model agree favorably with the reactive CFD simulations and experimental measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afuels 3aheat 3amodel validation 3aphase transition 3asimulation models 3atemperature profiles 3aviscosity1 aBanyon, Colin1 aMittal, Gaurav0 tCombustion and Flame.g2012 Dec., v. 159, no. 12 p.3476-3492dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03994naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245017000170520228600340592002802626650001202654650001302666650001102679650001402690650002502704650003102729650000902760650000902769650001102778650001802789650001102807650001102818650001002829650001102839650002202850650001302872650002102885650001502906650002602921650000902947653003802956653001402994653002203008653001503030653001603045700002803061700002003089700002203109700002403131700006703155773011103222856008603333852000903419655001203428IND60648452420221121235408.0190705e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064845242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1085182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtamaleki, Ali14aThe concentration of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the onion and tomato irrigated by wastewater: A systematic review; meta-analysis and health risk assessment  aNowadays, vegetable irrigation with wastewater in developing countries has become a serious issue. In this regard, the current investigation was performed to collect the related data regarding the concentration of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) including Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cd in onion and tomato samples irrigated with wastewater by the aid of a systematic review among the Scopus, Medline and Embase databases between 1/January/1983 to 31/January/2019. Also, the health risk assessment for consumers due to PTEs ingestion via the consumption of onion and tomato was estimated by using target hazard quotient (THQ). In this context, 35 articles with 64 studies out of 779 retrieved citations were included in the meta-analysis. The ranking of different parts of tomato based on Pb, Cd, and Cu concentration was shoot > root > leave > edible part; Fe, leave > shoot > root > edible part; Cr, root > leave > shoot > edible part; Zn, shoot > leave > root > edible part; and Ni, leave > edible part > root > shoot. Moreover, the ratio concentration of Pb, Cd, Cu, Fe, Cr, Zn and Ni in the edible part to leave of onion was 2.92, 6.01, 1.29, 4.17, 0.84, and 3.55, 10.10, respectively. According to findings, the rank order of PTEs in the onion was Fe (43.09 mg/kg-dry weight) > Zn (34.3 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Pb (18.54 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Cu (14.9 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Ni (11.92 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Cr (7.24 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Cd (0.23 mg/ kg-dry weight) and tomato; Fe (139.12 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Zn (29.81 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Cu (25.04 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Cr (14.28 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Pb (9.58 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Ni (9.23 mg/ kg-dry weight) > Cd (4.64 mg/kg-dry weight). However, the concentration of PTEs investigated in the edible part of onion was higher than leaves; their concentrations in the edible part of the tomato were lower than other parts. The health risk assessment indicated that consumers groups are at significant non-carcinogenic risk due to the ingestion of PTEs via consumption of the onion and tomato vegetable wastewater irrigated (THQ > 1). Therefore, the irrigation of vegetables with wastewater should be monitored and controlled by some prevention plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adatabases 3adeveloping countries 3ahealth effects assessments 3airon 3alead 3aleaves 3ameta-analysis 3anickel 3aonions 3aroots 3ashoots 3asystematic review 3atomatoes 3atoxic substances 3awastewater 3awastewater irrigation 3azinc 0aPotentially toxic elements (PTEs) 0aVegetable 0aSystematic review 0aWastewater 0aHealth risk1 aYazdanbakhsh, Ahmadreza1 aFakhri, Yadolah1 aMahdipour, Fayyaz1 aKhodakarim, Soheila1 aMousavi Khaneghah, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5769-00040 tFood research international.g2019 Nov., v. 125 p.108518-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1085183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009800174300001800272520191800290592002802208650001202236650002002248650001102268650001702279650001102296650001602307650001902323650001302342653002702355653001602382653001802398653002802416700005702444700001702501773010102518856008702619852000902706655001202715IND60642988620221119031312.0191024e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064298862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Donovan, Alan10aEnhanced performance of air-cooled thermal power plants using low temperature thermal storage  ap. 1673-1685.  aThis paper presents the essentials of low temperature thermal storage (LTTS), a novel technique whereby thermal energy storage is employed to achieve sub-ambient condensation in air-cooled Rankine cycle power plants. It summarises work which was undertaken to explore the potential and the range of application of LTTS. The technology is most effective at geographical locations with large average daily temperature ranges, and high summertime temperatures. Hourly normal temperature data was sourced for five potential deployment sites, which provided a representative sample of different climate types. A steam turbine, a condenser, an air-cooled heat exchanger, and a chilled water thermal energy storage tank formed the LTTS configuration – a techno-economic model of which was developed to simulate system behaviour. The size of the air-cooled heat exchanger, the fan speed of the air-cooled heat exchanger, and the hours of charge, discharge, and bypass of the thermal energy storage tank were all modelled as variables to determine the effects of component sizes and operating patterns. LTTS performance was benchmarked by comparison with a direct air-cooled condenser model. Results presented in this paper include daily plant output, annual power output, and payback period. This study shows that LTTS can deliver all the advantages of dry-cooling, without suffering the usual performance degradations. The inherent flexibility of LTTS allows for configurations to be customised to exploit the prevailing site climate, and capitalise on the local power demand pattern. There are also clear indications that, in suitable climatic settings, LTTS outperforms traditional air-cooled thermal power plants by offering up to 10% additional generating capacity. Coupled to this are payback periods as short as 2.5 years, ensuring LTTS can be considered a viable alternative to current air-cooling strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aheat exchangers 3amodels 3apower plants 3asummer 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3aturbines 0aThermal energy storage 0aAir-cooling 0aRankine cycle 0aThermodynamic modelling1 aGrimes, Ronan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3773-16381 aSikora, Paul0 tApplied energy.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 250 p.1673-1685dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04078naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245014000166300002000306520215300326592002802479650001302507650002502520650001702545650001902562650003202581650002002613650001802633650002302651650001002674650002202684650001602706650003502722650001002757650001102767650001402778650002202792650000902814650003002823650001102853650002602864650001602890650001602906650001302922650001302935653002902948653001102977653001802988653002203006653003503028653002003063700002703083700001603110700002503126700002503151700001903176700001803195773012603213856008003339852000903419655001203428IND60586584420221120022142.0171214e20171213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058658442DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b158452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivashanmugam, A.10aInjectable Shear-Thinning CaSO4/FGF-18-Incorporated Chitin–PLGA Hydrogel Enhances Bone Regeneration in Mice Cranial Bone Defect Model  ap. 42639-42652.  aFor craniofacial bone regeneration, shear-thinning injectable hydrogels are favored over conventional scaffolds because of their improved defect margin adaptability, easier handling, and ability to be injected manually into deeper tissues. The most accepted method, after autografting, is the use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2); however, complications such as interindividual variations, edema, and poor cost-efficiency in supraphysiological doses have been reported. The endogenous synthesis of BMP-2 is desirable, and a molecule which induces this is fibroblast growth factor-18 (FGF-18) because it can upregulate the BMP-2 expression by supressing noggin. We developed a chitin–poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) composite hydrogel by regeneration chemistry and then incorporated CaSO₄ and FGF-18 for this purpose. Rheologically, a 7-fold increase in the elastic modulus was observed in the CaSO₄-incorporated chitin–PLGA hydrogels as compared to the chitin–PLGA hydrogel. Shear-thinning Herschel–Bulkley fluid nature was observed for both hydrogels. Chitin–PLGA/CaSO₄ gel showed sustained release of FGF-18. In vitro osteogenic differentiation showed an enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression in the FGF-18-containing chitin–PLGA/CaSO₄ gel when compared to cells alone. Further, it was confirmed by studying the expression of osteogenic genes [RUNX2, ALP, BMP-2, osteocalcin (OCN), and osteopontin (OPN)], immunofluorescence staining of BMP-2, OCN, and OPN, and alizarin red S staining. Incorporation of FGF-18 in the hydrogel increased the endothelial cell migration. Further, the regeneration potential of the prepared hydrogels was tested in vivo, and longitudinal live animal μ-CT was performed. FGF-18-loaded chitin–PLGA/CaSO₄ showed early and almost complete bone healing in comparison with chitin–PLGA/CaSO₄, chitin–PLGA/FGF-18, chitin–PLGA, and sham control systems, as confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin and osteoid tetrachrome stainings. This shows that the CaSO₄ and FGF-18-incorporated hydrogel is a potential candidate for craniofacial bone defect regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aautografting 3abone formation 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acalcium sulfate 3acell movement 3acost effectiveness 3aedema 3aendothelial cells 3afibroblasts 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3amaterials science 3amice 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3aosteocalcin 3aosteopontin 3arheology 3astaining 0ashear-thinning hydrogels 0aFGF-18 0achitin−PLGA 0abone regeneration 0acraniofacial bone regeneration 0acalcium sulfate1 aCharoenlarp, Pornkawee1 aDeepthi, S.1 aRajendran, Arunkumar1 aNair, Shantikumar V.1 aIseki, Sachiko1 aJayakumar, R.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 13, v. 9, no. 49 p.42639-42652dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b158453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010600172300001800278520209600296592002802392650001302420650002302433650002602456650001202482650001302494650001202507650001202519650001402531650000902545650001502554650001102569650001902580650000902599650001202608650001902620650001302639650000702652650001402659650000902673650001302682650001102695650001602706651001102722700001902733773009802752856008602850852000902936655001202945IND60089036920221116164624.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008903692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheu, Guey-Rong10aMercury in cloud water collected on Mt. Bamboo in northern Taiwan during the northeast monsoon season  ap. 4454-4462.  aCloud water was sampled on Mt. Bamboo in northern Taiwan in January–March 2009 for total mercury (Hg) analysis. This was the first cloud water Hg measurement reported from the downwind region of East Asia, which is the major Hg emission source region globally. A total of 11 cloud events were encountered, and 129 and 316 cloud water samples were collected for Hg and major ion analyses, respectively. The mean cloud water pH was 4.14. Cl⁻ and Na⁺ were the major ions in cloud water. About 2/3 of the samples had molar ratios of Cl⁻/Na⁺ close to the seawater ratio of 1.12, demonstrating a significant impact of sea salt aerosols on cloud water chemistry. On the other hand, 90% of the measured SO₄ ²⁻ was non-sea-salt-SO₄ ²⁻ (nss-SO₄ ²⁻), highlighting the influence of human activities. Concentrations of Hg ranged between 0.5 and 165.5 ng L⁻¹, with a mean of 9.6 ng L⁻¹. Elevated Hg concentrations were usually associated with highly acidic samples. Hg concentrations were well correlated with major ion concentrations, especially with NO₃ ⁻, K⁺, nss-SO₄ ²⁻, and NH₄ ⁺. The results of element ratio calculations, correlation analyses and trajectory analyses indicated that, in addition to sea salt aerosols, coal combustion, industrial activities, and biomass/biofuel burning in the East Asian continent could have contributed to the measured Hg in the cloud water. The contribution of below-cloud scavenging to rainwater Hg was evaluated by comparing the cloud water Hg concentrations to the rainwater Hg concentrations sampled at a nearby mountain site and at an urban site. The mean rainwater Hg values at the mountain site (11.6 ng L⁻¹) and at the urban site (19.2 ng L⁻¹) were all higher than the cloud water value, demonstrating the below-cloud scavenging contribution. Nonetheless, the below-cloud scavenging contribution was more significant in the urban area than in the mountain area. About 28% and 91% of the rainwater Hg at the mountain and urban sites could be attributed to the below-cloud scavenging, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aammonium compounds 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abamboos 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aburning 3achlorides 3acoal 3acombustion 3ahumans 3ahydrochemistry 3aions 3amercury 3amonsoon season 3anitrates 3apH 3apotassium 3arain 3aseawater 3asodium 3aurban areas 3aTaiwan1 aLin, Neng-Huei0 tAtmospheric environment.g2011 Aug., v. 45, no. 26 p.4454-4462dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.05.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100010800150245010200258500002200360520094800382592002801330650001401358650001701372650002601389650001701415650001301432650001901445650001201464650000901476650002001485650001401505700003301519700009401552700009701646700002501743700002101768773009201789856008501881852000901966655001201975IND60675616020221120073426.0191121s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067561602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2019.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Tatenhove-Pel, Rinke J1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8291-5823 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8291-582310aMicrodroplet screening and selection for improved microbial production of extracellular compounds  aPre-press version  aMicroorganisms produce extracellular compounds that affect the final product quality in fermentation processes. Selection of overproducing mutants requires coupling of the extracellular product to the producer genotype, which can be achieved by single-cell compartmentalization. Emulsions contain up to billions of microdroplets/mL which significantly increases the screening throughput compared to microtiter-plate-based selections. Factors affecting the success of screening in microdroplets include the nature of the producing organism (robust, no invasive growth), the product (not soluble in oil) and the product assay (preferably fluorescence based). Together these factors determine the required microdroplet production technique and sorting set-up. Because microdroplets allow relatively inexpensive ultrahigh-throughput screening, they are likely to become a standard tool in the strain selection toolbox of the fermentation industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsions 3afermentation 3afermentation industry 3afluorescence 3agenotype 3amicroorganisms 3amutants 3aoils 3aproduct quality 3ascreening1 aHernandez-Valdes, Jhonatan A1 aTeusink, Bas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3929-0423 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3929-04231 aKuipers, O.

Yet, little is known on how these systems are coordinated. In a paper recently published in Plant Cell and Environment¹ we show that ROPs/RACs function synergistically with NH₄NO₃-modulated pH fluctuations to regulate root hair growth. Root hairs expand exclusively at their apical end in a strictly polarized manner by a process known as tip growth. The highly polarized secretion at the apex is maintained by a complex network of factors including the spatial organization of the actin cytoskeleton, tip-focused ion gradients and by small G proteins. Expression of constitutively active ROP mutants disrupts polar growth, inducing the formation of swollen root hairs. Root hairs are also known to elongate in an oscillating manner, which is correlated with oscillatory H⁺ fluxes at the tip. Our analysis shows that root hair elongation in wild type plants and swelling in transgenic plants expressing a constitutively active ROP11 (rop11Cᴬ) is sensitive to the presence of NH₄⁺ at concentrations higher than 1 mM and on NO₃⁻. The NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ ions did not affect the localization of ROP in the membrane but modulated pH fluctuations at the root hair tip. Actin organization and reactive oxygen species distribution were abnormal in rop11CA root hairs but were similar to wild type root hairs when seedlings were grown on medium lacking NH₄⁺ and / or NO₃⁻. These observations suggest that the nitrogen source-modulated pH fluctuations may function synergistically with ROP regulated signaling during root hair tip growth. Interestingly, under certain growth conditions, expression of rop11Cᴬ suppressed ammonium toxicity, similar to auxin resistant mutants. In this Addendum article we discuss these findings and their implications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-proteins 3aactin 3aammonium 3aauxins 3abiogeography 3acell walls 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3amicrofilaments 3amutants 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphysiological transport 3aprotons 3areactive oxygen species 3aroot hairs 3asecretion 3aseedlings 3atoxicity 3atransgenic plants1 aMonshausen, Gabriele1 aGilroy, Simon1 aYalovsky, Shaul0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 6, no. 3 p.426-429dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.3.145233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245010500177300001600282520178900298592002802087650001302115650001602128650001902144650002202163650001402185650001902199650002402218650002402242650000902266650001402275650001502289650000902304650000902313650002002322650001602342650001402358700002302372700001702395700002102412700001802433700002202451700002102473700002602494773013402520856008202654852000902736655001202745IND60593212720221119213512.0190816e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059321272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1394-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHjelkrem, Anne-Grete Roer10aHT-2 and T-2 toxins in Norwegian oat grains related to weather conditions at different growth stages  ap. 501-514.  aHigh concentrations of the mycotoxins HT-2 and T-2 (HT2 + T2), primarily produced by Fusarium langsethiae, have occasionally been detected in Norwegian oat grains. In this study, we identified weather variables influencing accumulation of HT2 + T2 in Norwegian oat grains. Oat grain samples from farmers’ fields were collected together with weather data (2004–2013). Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the HT2 + T2 contamination in oats at harvest and a range of weather summarisations within estimated phenological windows of growth stages in oats (tillering, flowering etc.). Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model to predict the risk of HT2 + T2 in oat grains. Our data show that adequate predictions of the risk of HT2 + T2 in oat grains at harvest can be achieved, based upon weather data observed during the growing season. Humid and cool conditions, in addition to moderate temperatures during booting, were associated with increased HT2 + T2 accumulation in harvested oat grains, whereas warm and humid weather during stem elongation and inflorescence emergence, or cool weather and absence of rain during booting reduced the risk of HT2 + T2 accumulation. Warm and humid weather immediately after flowering increased the risk, while moderate to warm temperatures and absence of rain during dough development, reduced the risk of HT2 + T2 accumulation in oat grains. Our data indicated that HT2 + T2 contamination in oats is influenced by weather conditions both pre- and post-flowering. These findings are in contrast with a previous study examining the risk of deoxynivalenol contamination in oat reporting that toxin accumulation was mostly influenced by weather conditions from flowering onwards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3acorrelation 3adeoxynivalenol 3adough development 3aflowering 3agrowing season 3amathematical models 3ameteorological data 3aoats 3aphenology 3aprediction 3arain 3arisk 3astem elongation 3atemperature 3atillering1 aAamot, Heidi Udnes1 aBrodal, Guro1 aStrand, Einar C.1 aTorp, Torfinn1 aEdwards, Simon G.1 aDill-Macky, Ruth1 aHofgaard, Ingerd Skow0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 June, v. 151, no. 2 p.501-514dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1394-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012800159300002000287520107300307592002801380650001801408650001801426650001701444650002201461650002201483650003201505650000901537650003401546650001601580650001301596700001701609700001201626700001301638700001501651700001401666700001801680700001201698773012301710856007401833852000901907655001201916IND60641657120221120104159.0190505e20170516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064165712DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04261b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiumeng10aDiscovery of new BTK inhibitors with B cell suppression activity bearing a 4,6-substituted thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine scaffold  ap. 26060-26069.  aA series of 4,6-substituted thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivatives as Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors are designed, synthesized and evaluated for their enzymatic inhibition and immunosuppressive activities. These derivatives exhibit varying inhibitory activities against BTK in vitro. Compound 8 is a novel potent BTK inhibitor which has an IC₅₀ value of 29.9 nM, exerts excellent immunosuppressive activity by inhibiting the proliferation of B cells (IC₅₀ = 284 nM), and shows low cytotoxicity (CC₅₀ = 53 632 nM) on murine splenocytes. In addition, compound 8 displays considerable selectivity between T cells (IC₅₀ > 10 μM) and B cells. Furthermore, enzymatic assays on more than twenty kinases confirm that compound 8 is more selective than the reference compound Olmutinib. In summary, the results suggest that compound 8 is a potential BTK inhibitor for further evaluation and modification of the C-4 and C-6 position of the thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine scaffold, which could be considered a new strategy in the development of BTK inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aimmunosuppression 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amice 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3asplenocytes 3atyrosine1 aZhang, Luyao1 aYu, Jie1 aLi, Heng1 aHe, Shijun1 aTang, Wei1 aZuo, Jianping1 aLu, Wei0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 16, v. 7, no. 42 p.26060-26069dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04261b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007400166300001600240520151000256592002801766650001701794650001301811650001101824650001701835650000901852650000901861650001001870650000901880650001701889650002501906650001601931650002701947651001401974651002301988651001102011653001602022653002202038653002302060653002502083653002102108653002502129653002302154653002502177700001702202700002002219773014402239856008302383852000902466655001202475IND60581909020221116165849.0190415e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058190902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crvi.2017.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei-Jen10aGymnocranius obesus, a new large-eye seabream from the Coral Triangle  ap. 520-530.  aTwo previously recorded new species of the large-eye seabream genus Gymnocranius (Gymnocranius sp. D and Gymnocranius sp. E) remain undescribed. Here we describe Gymnocranius sp. E as Gymnocranius obesus sp. nov. This new species is morphologically distinct from all other known species under Gymnocranius by the following combination of characters: relatively deep body, with ratio of standard length to body depth 2.2–2.4; protruding large eye, with eye diameter about equal to or slightly larger than inter-orbital width; caudal fin moderately forked; no blue spots or wavy blue lines on cheek and snout in adults; fourth transversal dark bar on flank running from the sixth spine of the dorsal fin to the origin of the anal fin; anal, caudal and dorsal fins drab with yellowish to yellow margins. Gymnocranius obesus sp. nov. is distinct from G. griseus, with which it has been previously confused by a relatively larger head, scales above lateral line without dark basal patch, and a smaller number of front scales on the dorsal side of the head. Gymnocranius obesus sp. nov. is genetically distinct from its closest known relative, Gymnocranius sp. D by 104 diagnostic nucleotide characters, which translates into a 9.6% sequence divergence at the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Gymnocranius obesus sp. nov. reaches a length of at least 295mm. Its distribution, from the Ryukyu Islands to Bali, including Taiwan and the Flores Sea, mostly coincides with the western half of the Coral Triangle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGymnocranius 3aSparidae 3aadults 3acytochrome b 3aeyes 3afins 3agenes 3ahead 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3anew species 3atranslation (genetics) 3aIndonesia 3aRyukyu Archipelago 3aTaiwan 0aNew species 0aIndo-West Pacific 0aGymnocranius sp.

During animal evolution, fish was situated at a transition point on the phylogenetic spectrum between species possessing only innate immunity (i.e., invertebrates) and species depending heavily on adaptive immunity (i.e., mammals). Previous studies reported that fish and mammals significantly differ in pIgR. This review summarized the differences in pIgR structure, function, and transcriptional regulation between fish and mammals. A model of the transcriptional regulation of the pIgR gene was suggested. In this model, microbes could activate Toll-like receptor, trigger the cascade reactions in the signaling pathway, and then activate transcription factors that regulate pIgR expression through combining with the pIgR promoter. This review provides some suggestions for further studies on the function and regulatory mechanism of pIgR in fish and other animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptors 3aadaptive immunity 3aepithelial cells 3afish 3agenes 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainnate immunity 3ainvertebrates 3amammals 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aPolymeric immunoglobulin receptor 0aTranscriptional expression 0aFish 0aMammal1 aWang, Li1 aPei, Chao1 aZhang, Jie1 aZhao, Xianliang1 aLi, Li0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2018 Aug., v. 202 p.63-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2018.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245004500172300001800217520175700235592002801992650001302020650002602033650001102059650001502070650001402085650002302099650002202122650002102144650001702165650003702182650002002219650001202239650002502251651001602276700002902292700002702321700002902348700002602377773009802403856008602501852000902587655001202596IND60089037020221116164644.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008903702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAncelet, Travis10aCarbonaceous aerosols in an urban tunnel  ap. 4463-4469.  aParticulate matter in the Mount Victoria Tunnel, an urban road tunnel 623 m in length with an average traffic volume of 2070–2300 vehicles per hour located in Wellington, New Zealand, was studied to gain an understanding of carbonaceous species emitted from motor vehicles. The average PM₂.₅ concentration during peak hours in the tunnel was found to be 67.6 ± 19.4 μg m⁻³. Analysis of carbonaceous species present (OC, EC, TC) was performed by both the NIOSH and IMPROVE thermal/optical protocols and carbonaceous species were found to make up 63–73% of the total PM in the tunnel. Comparison of TC concentrations obtained from each protocol revealed that no significant difference was present between the two protocols. Black carbon (BC), also used as a measure of EC, was determined using light reflection and BC values did not differ significantly from EC concentrations determined using the NIOSH and IMPROVE protocols. TC was also determined using EA/IRMS and it was found that TC concentrations from EA/IRMS directly correlated with TC results obtained using the NIOSH protocol. Stable isotope analysis of the PM₂.₅ yielded δ¹³C values from −24.7 to −28.3‰, typical of motor vehicles. Analysis of particle-phase PAHs by thermal desorption GC/MS revealed an average total PAH concentration of 70.0 ± 4.1 ng m⁻³ and PAHs were found to contribute 0.10% of total PM₂.₅ in the tunnel. PAH emissions in the tunnel were found to be enriched in low molecular weight PAHs, indicative of emissions from diesel-fueled vehicles. Analysis of individual particle composition and morphology revealed that most particles were carbonaceous species that formed large, amorphous agglomerates made up of smaller spherules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon 3adesorption 3aemissions 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aparticulates 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3astable isotopes 3atraffic 3avehicles (equipment) 3aNew Zealand1 aDavy, P.

Nearly all ray-finned fishes are teleosts, which include most commercially important fish species, several model organisms for genomics and developmental biology, and the dominant component of marine and freshwater vertebrate faunas. Despite the economic and scientific importance of ray-finned fishes, the lack of a single comprehensive phylogeny with corresponding divergence-time estimates has limited our understanding of the evolution and diversification of this radiation. Our analyses, which use multiple nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with 36 fossil age constraints, result in a well-supported phylogeny of all major ray-finned fish lineages and molecular age estimates that are generally consistent with the fossil record. This phylogeny informs three long-standing problems: specifically identifying elopomorphs (eels and tarpons) as the sister lineage of all other teleosts, providing a unique hypothesis on the radiation of early euteleosts, and offering a promising strategy for resolution of the “bush at the top of the tree” that includes percomorphs and other spiny-finned teleosts. Contrasting our divergence time estimates with studies using a single nuclear gene or whole mitochondrial genomes, we find that the former underestimates ages of the oldest ray-finned fish divergences, but the latter dramatically overestimates ages for derived teleost lineages. Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals that much of the diversification leading to extant groups of teleosts occurred between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, identifying this period as the “Second Age of Fishes.”  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMegalopidae 3aage determination 3aeel 3afossils 3afreshwater 3agenes 3agenomics 3amitochondrial genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3atree crown 0aActinopterygii 0amolecular clock 0aspecies tree 0aTeleostei 0aPercomorpha1 aEytan, Ron I.1 aDornburg, Alex1 aKuhn, Kristen L.1 aMoore, Jon A.1 aDavis, Matthew P.1 aWainwright, Peter C.1 aFriedman, Matt1 aSmith, W.

Monthly and daily Thornthwaite Water Balance models using landscape configuration (contagion-adjusted curve numbers, CON-adjusted CNs) derived from the most current (2011) land cover/land use (LC/LU) dataset out-performed original CN watershed simulations over the 5-year (60-month and 1826-day) period from January 2009 to December 2013. This was based upon evaluation from several statistically-based, hydrologic model performance predictors. At the reclassified level (urban; forest; and agricultural), configurational metrics related to CON known as the aggregation index (AI) and clumpiness index (CI) indicated greater landscape heterogeneity that may lead to complex flow patterns difficult to simulate within a HUC-10 streamflow model. On the other hand, these related metrics also indicated higher levels of clumping within these reclassified LC/LUs may allow for improved accuracy in simulating streamflow-generating processes across landscapes within a HUC-10 streamflow model. Results also inferred that localized landscape configuration within the largest sub-watershed (HUC-12) of a HUC-10 watershed could have a disproportionate impact on runoff and should be prioritized within regional U.S. watershed management plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aforests 3ahydrologic models 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodel validation 3arunoff 3astream flow 3asubwatersheds 3awatershed management 3aGeorgia 3aYellow River 0aAtlanta 0aCurve number 0aLandscape configuration 0aHUC-10 0aStreamflow 0aThornthwaite Water Balance0 tInternational journal of ecohydrology & hydrobiology.g2017 Nov., v. 17, no. 4 p.254-263dElsevier Sp. z o.o.aEuropean Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of ScienceswJournal:2195x1642-35937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2017.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04012naa a2200961 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245014000176300001600316520160500332592002801937650003001965650002501995650001302020650001302033650001602046650001502062650001002077650002202087650001602109650002002125650001702145650001502162650001102177650002202188650003502210650001102245650001902256650001802275650002102293653001502314653001302329653001802342653001802360653003802378653002102416653001102437653000802448653000702456653000802463653000902471653001002480653001002490653000702500653001102507653000902518653000902527653000802536653001102544653000702555653001002562653000902572653000802581653000802589653001002597653000802607653000902615653000702624653000902631653001002640653000702650653000802657653001102665653000802676653001102684653000902695653000902704653000902713653000902722653000902731653000802740700002102748700002202769700005702791773009102848856009002939852000903029655001203038IND60601821520221120215349.0190613e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060182152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajewska, Monika10aPhytotoxic activity of diclofenac: Evaluation using a model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with atrazine as a reference substance  ap. 989-997.  aHuman activities have caused increasing inputs of pharmaceuticals to the environment and diclofenac (DF) is one of the most commonly detected in freshwater systems. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of DF on a freshwater green alga as a non-target organism. For DF toxicity evaluation, its effects on a model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were compared with effects caused by the herbicide atrazine (AT). EC50 values were about 135 mg/L for DF and 78 mg/L for AT, respectively. Both toxicants enhanced H2O2 production by the cells (144% and 178% of control for AT and DF, respectively) and stimulated catalase activity (≈200% of control). Activity of ascorbate peroxidase was elevated in AT-cells but not in DF-treated cells. DF did not influence dark respiration of the cells, whereas AT inhibited this process by about 50% compared to the control. Both toxicants caused photosynthesis inhibition. Analysis of parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence in vivo showed diminishment of a performance index (PI) in both DF- and AT-treated cells (≈50% of control), but the reasons for the changes detected were different. AT diminished the efficiency of electron transport between PS II and PS I without significant inhibition of PS II or PS I reaction centers (RCs). In contrast to AT, DF seemed to influence directly PS II RCs. The fraction of active PS II RCs was lowered in DF-treated cells, but energy flux per active RC increased. Our study indicates that DF phytotoxicity results mainly from photosynthesis inhibition due to “silencing” of a fraction of PS II RCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aatrazine 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3adiclofenac 3adrugs 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy flow 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amedian effective concentration 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3atoxic substances 0aDiclofenac 0aAtrazine 0aPhytotoxicity 0aChlamydomonas 0aChlorophyll fluorescence in vivo 0aOxidative stress 0aABS/RC 0aAPX 0aAT 0aCAT 0aCECs 0aCOX-1 0aCOX-2 0aDF 0aDI0/RC 0aDMSO 0aEC50 0aEQS 0aET0/RC 0aEU 0aFV/F0 0aGLRs 0aHSM 0aMDA 0aNSAID 0aOEC 0aOJIP 0aPI 0aPS I 0aPS II 0aRC 0aRCM 0aRE0/RC 0aROS 0aTR0/RC 0aδR0 0aφD0 0aφE0 0aφP0 0aφR0 0aψ01 aHarshkova, Darya1 aGuściora, Monika1 aAksmann, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4766-24340 tChemosphere.g2018 Oct., v. 209 p.989-997dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.1563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012200156300001600278500002000294520137200314592002801686650002701714650001901741650001001760650001301770650001101783650001501794650001301809650002101822650002201843651001301865700002601878700001601904700001601920700001601936700001401952773012801966856007402094852000902168655001202177IND60589384420221120113459.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058938442DNAL7 a10.1111/aab.124152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaleem, M.F.10aRemoval of early fruit branches triggered regulations in senescence, boll attributes and yield of Bt cotton genotypes  ap. 224-235.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPremature senescence, unopened and rotted bolls are the primary constrictions hampering the accomplishment of yield potential in Bt cotton. An experiment was conducted with the objectives to delay senescence, enhance boll opening and reduce the boll rotting. The experiment was conducted at two randomly selected sites of University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Pakistan, during 2015 and repeated in 2016. Each experiment was laid out in randomised complete block design with two by two factorial arrangement structure and replicated five times. Treatments were comprised of R₀ = no fruit removal; R₁ = removal of early fruit branches (REFB) and two genotypes, viz. V₁ = FH‐142 and V₂ = MNH‐886. Genotypes were selected on the basis of abiotic stress tolerance (FH‐142) and susceptibility (MNH‐886). Nodes above cracked bolls, monopodial branches, opened bolls per plant and seed cotton yield were enhanced by 23, 12, 13 and 17%, respectively, under the influence of REFB over no fruit branch removal, while the REFB‐mediated decrease in boll rotting was 27%. Moreover, the response of MNH‐886 was more remarkable than FH‐142 for all studied variables. Conclusively, REFB increased the number of nodes above a cracked boll, monopodial branches, opened bolls per plant and seed cotton yield while decreased rotted bolls per plant in both genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aabiotic stress 3abolls 3abranches 3acotton 3acrop yield 3agenotype 3astress tolerance 3atransgenic plants 3aPakistan1 aMoshtaghzadeh, Majid,1 aShakoor, A.1 aWahid, M.A.1 aAnjum, S.A.1 aAwais, M.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2018 Mar., v. 172, no. 2 p.224-235dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46323x0003-47467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aab.124153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03605naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245009700202300001600299520192200315592002802237596008002265596007702345596005902422596012802481650001502609650002302624650001102647650001302658650002302671650001402694650002202708650002502730650001602755650002902771650001202800650001802812650003302830650001102863651001002874700001402884700001802898773012702916856008303043852000903126655001203135IND60779596320221122032940.0220611e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077959632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-022-05343-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0230-033310aSoil microbes influence nitrogen limitation on plant biomass in alpine steppe in North Tibet  ap. 395-409.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: An increase in nitrogen deposition is expected to increase the phosphorus-limited primary productivity of grassland ecosystems. However, it remains unclear as to whether the primary productivity of grasslands is co-limited by nitrogen and phosphorus, or only by one or the other. METHODS: Nitrogen and phosphorus addition experiments were conducted at an alpine steppe site in North Tibet from 2013 to 2017. The biomass of plant community, the N and P content of plant leaf, soil chemical property, and changes in abundance and function and composition of bacterial and fungal community with N and P treatment were analyzed after five years. RESULTS: Results from analyzing the response ratios of shoot biomass and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations to nitrogen and phosphorus addition suggested that nitrogen is the main limiting factor for the biomass of alpine steppe. Based on the ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry, plants must increase their phosphorus absorption following nitrogen addition. From the results of a structural equation model, plants and fungi both promoted the activity of phosphatase. The abundance of fungi and the saprotrophic group associated with decomposition increased following nitrogen addition, and more substrate is provided by the plants, which will accelerate the organic phosphorus cycle. These results suggest that the phosphorus deficit of plants owing to nitrogen addition will be alleviated. On the contrary, phosphorus did not limit the biomass, but its addition did increase the absorption of nitrogen by plants. Although the activity of urease was enhanced by soil microbes and plants, there was little substrate for microbes because the plant biomass was limited by nitrogen. CONCLUSIONS: The biomass is mainly limited by nitrogen and soil microbes will influence the effect of nitrogen on biomass in alpine steppe.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019QZKK04040102cSecond Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research  a2016YFC0502002cKey Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province  a41401072cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aHNKJ20-H23cthe Optimization and Integration of Vegetation Restoration Techniques for Hydropower Stations in Alpine Regions 3aabsorption 3afungal communities 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aorganic phosphorus 3aphytomass 3aplant communities 3aprimary productivity 3asaprotrophs 3asoil chemical properties 3asteppes 3astoichiometry 3astructural equation modeling 3aurease 3aChina1 aZhao, Hui1 aWang, Xiaodan0 tPlant and soil.g2022 May, v. 474, no. 1-2 p.395-409dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05343-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245004200151300001600193500002000209520111800229592002801347650002401375650001301399650001901412650001401431650002501445650001301470650001301483650001401496650001301510650001101523650001401534650001401548650001001562651001001572700001301582700001701595773012801612856007401740852000901814655001201823IND60589384520221120113439.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058938452DNAL7 a10.1111/aab.124082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, M.10aPecan phenology in Southeastern China  ap. 160-169.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPecan (Carya illinoensis) is heterodicogamous, which often leads to unstable yield of its nut crops. Relating pecan orchard management to the phenological stage of the trees is the key to increasing yields; however, describing morphology alone does not lead to an orchard management system that is simple and practical. In this work, we extend the BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie) coding method to describe the morphology of the protogynous Mahan pecan cultivar over two consecutive years in southern China. Eight main growth stages, from vegetative bud dormancy to fruit harvest, were described and each phenological period was photographed. Pecan orchard management activities were listed for each stage in pecan BBCH scale to allow orchard managers to better manage their trees. This codification will facilitate breeding, conservation of genetic resources and general orchard management of this commercial crop. As well, recording the dates of various morphological stages over time will allow the influence of global climate change on pecan development to be tracked.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarya illinoinensis 3abreeding 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3adormancy 3amanagers 3anut crops 3aorchards 3apecans 3aphenology 3aprotogyny 3atrees 3aChina1 aPeng, F.1 aMarshall, P.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2018 Mar., v. 172, no. 2 p.160-169dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46323x0003-47467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aab.124083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245018400209300001600393520186400409592002802273650001502301650002802316650001602344650001602360650000902376650001602385650001202401650001702413650001002430653001902440653001802459653001902477700002602496700003002522773010202552856008202654852000902736655001202745IND60754517020221120140100.0211123e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075451702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2021.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoura, Rafael Rios1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7911-473410aDon't put all your eggs in small baskets: Ineffective guardians, incidence of parasitoids and clutch size of Latrodectus geometricus (Araneae, Theridiidae) along an urban gradient  ap. 120-125.  aMaternal care is common in spiders, but the effects of egg protection by mothers on offspring survival remains understudied for most species, especially against parasitoids. Parasitoid incidence can also be modulated by host clutch size (since larger egg masses provide the opportunity of producing larger clutches for the parasitoids) and urbanization (by creating conditions that may restrict the occurrence of less tolerant species). In this study, we conducted field experiments with the brown widow spider Latrodectus geometricus to investigate the following hypothesis: (1) females are effective in the defense of eggs against parasitoids; (2) large clutch sizes are attacked more often by parasitoids than the smaller ones; and (3) the incidence of parasitoids in egg sacs decreases in a gradient from a preserved area to an urbanized one. The presence of caring females reduced by three times the incidence of two parasitoids, Baeus latrodecti (Hymenoptera, Scelionidae) and an unidentified Eulophidae wasp, compared to unattended egg sacs, but this distinction did not differ from a random distribution. Parasitoids were most often found in egg sacs containing few eggs. The incidence of B. latrodecti in egg sacs was highest in the area with an intermediate degree of urbanization, but Eulophidae wasps were unaffected by the urbanization gradient. We concluded that (1) females are generally ineffective at protecting their egg sacs against parasitoids, that (2) egg sacs containing small clutch sizes are usually more vunerable to parasitoid attacks, and that (3) urbanization does not reduce the incidence of the egg parasitoids identified here. Our study provides an important step towards our understanding of the interactions between spiders with parental care and egg parasitoids, suggesting new aspects to be investigated in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEulophidae 3aLatrodectus geometricus 3aScelionidae 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3aparasitoids 3aprogeny 3aurbanization 3awasps 0aEgg parasitism 0aMaternal care 0aEgg attendance1 aTozzo Neto, Agostinho1 aGonzaga, Marcelo Oliveira0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2021 Nov., v. 295 p.120-125dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2021.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011000171300001600281520131300297592002801610650001601638650001101654650001801665650002501683650002101708650001501729650001701744650001101761650001901772650001801791650001301809650001801822650001701840650001601857700002301873700002001896700001901916700002001935700001801955700001801973700002001991700001802011773008602029856008402115852000902199655001202208IND60599015920221119072525.0180702e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059901592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chuanfang10aHighly porous carbon spheres for electrochemical capacitors and capacitive flowable suspension electrodes  ap. 155-164.  aIn flowable and conventional electrochemical capacitors, the energy capacity is largely determined by the electrode material. Spherical active material, with high specific surface area (SSA) represents a promising material candidate for film and flow capacitors. In this study, we synthesized highly porous carbon spheres (CSs) of submicrometer size to investigate their performance in film and suspension electrodes. In particular, we studied the effects of carbonization and activation temperatures on the electrochemical performance of the CSs. The CSs activated at optimum conditions demonstrated narrow pore size distribution (<3nm) with high SSA (2900m²/g) and high pore volume (1.3cc/g), which represent significant improvement as compared to similar materials reported in literature. Electrochemical tests of CSs in 1M H2SO4 solution showed a specific capacitance of 154 F/g for suspension electrode and 168 F/g for film electrode with excellent rate performance (capacitive behaviors up to 100mV/s) and cycling performance (95% of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles). Moreover, in the film electrode configuration, CSs exhibited high rate performance (78 F/g at 1000mV/s) and volumetric power density (9000W/L) in organic electrolytes, along with high energy density (21.4Wh/L) in ionic liquids.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aionic liquids 3aporosity 3asulfuric acid 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aHatzell, Kelsey B.1 aBoota, Muhammad1 aDyatkin, Boris1 aBeidaghi, Majid1 aLong, Donghui1 aQiao, Wenming1 aKumbur, Emin C.1 aGogotsi, Yury0 tCarbon.g2014 Oct., v. 77 p.155-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013400167500001900301520128100320592002801601650002001629650002301649650001101672650001101683650002201694650001101716650002801727650001201755651001001767653004801777653002501825653002201850653002401872700001701896700001601913700001601929700001301945700001801958700001901976700001301995773009002008856008502098852000902183655001202192IND60724225020221118021434.0210305e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072422502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongli10aChinese grid investment based on transmission and distribution tariff policy: An optimal coordination between capacity and demand  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Transmission and Distribution (T&D) tariff reform has constrained the revenue and increased the operating pressure of the China’s power grid companies. The contradiction between investment demand and investment capacity is increasingly prominent. It is urgent to carry out relevant research on how to alleviate the negative impact of the reform of transmission and distribution prices and realize the sustainable development of power grid enterprises. In order to provide reference for the investment decision-making and operation management of China’s power grid companies, and to achieve the goal of coordinating investment demand and investment capacity as much as possible, this paper analyzed the specific content and impact of the T&D tariff reform, constructed a power grid investment capacity calculation model, and established the coordination and optimization model of grid investment capacity and investment demand is developed. Then, an empirical analysis was carried out by taking two provincial grid companies in different situations as examples to determine a reasonable investment scale, verify the validity of the model, and put forward investment strategies and policy recommendations that adapt to the reform of transmission and distribution prices.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aempirical research 3aenergy 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3asustainable development 3atariffs 3aChina 0aTransmission and distribution tariff reform 0aOptimal coordination 0aInvestment demand 0aInvestment capacity1 aZhou, Minhan1 aZhang, Fuli1 aZhang, Yuli1 aMa, Yuze1 aDong, Huanran1 aZhang, Danyang1 aLiu, Lin0 tEnergy.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 219 p.119589-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011300159300001800272520167800290592002801968650001901996650001502015650002202030650002202052650001702074650003902091650002302130650001302153650001302166650002002179650001002199650001102209700001602220700001802236700002002254700002102274700001202295700002002307700002002327773012102347856007502468852000902543655001202552IND60560085720221120103905.0161220e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056008572DNAL7 a10.1021/jp510095p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaikowski, Lori10aCharge Transfer Fluorescence and 34 nm Exciton Diffusion Length in Polymers with Electron Acceptor End Traps  ap. 7231-7241.  aPhotoexcitation of conjugated poly-2,7-(9,9-dihexylfluorene) polyfluorenes with naphthylimide (NI) and anthraquinone (AQ) electron-acceptor end traps produces excitons that form charge transfer states at the end traps. Intramolecular singlet exciton transport to end traps was examined by steady state fluorescence for polyfluorenes of 17–127 repeat units in chloroform, dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and p-xylene. End traps capture excitons and form charge transfer (CT) states at all polymer lengths and in all solvents. The CT nature of the end-trapped states is confirmed by their fluorescence spectra, solvent and trap group dependence, and DFT descriptions. Quantum yields of CT fluorescence are as large as 46%. This strong CT emission is understood in terms of intensity borrowing. Energies of the CT states from onsets of the fluorescence spectra give the depths of the traps which vary with solvent polarity. For NI end traps, the trap depths are 0.06 (p-xylene), 0.13 (THF), and 0.19 eV (CHCl₃). For AQ, CT fluorescence could be observed only in p-xylene where the trap depth is 0.27 eV. Quantum yields, emission energies, charge transfer energies, solvent reorganization, and vibrational energies were calculated. Fluorescence measurements on chains >100 repeat units indicate that end traps capture ∼50% of the excitons, and that the exciton diffusion length is LD = 34 nm, which is much larger than diffusion lengths reported in polymer films or than previously known for diffusion along isolated chains. The efficiency of exciton capture depends on chain length but not on trap depth, solvent polarity, or which trap group is present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthraquinones 3achloroform 3adimethylformamide 3afilms (materials) 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atetrahydrofuran 3atraps 3axylene1 aMauro, Gina1 aBird, Matthew1 aKarten, Brianne1 aAsaoka, Sadayuki1 aWu, Qin1 aCook, Andrew R.1 aMiller, John R.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 June 18, v. 119, no. 24 p.7231-7241dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp510095p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011400165300001600279520123900295592002801534650003201562650001601594650001801610650001101628650001501639651001001654653004001664653003001704653001501734653003401749700001701783700001601800700001801816700002001834773009001854856008501944852000902029655001202038IND60610997220221118161316.0190725e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061099722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.05.1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lifeng10aUsing a novel multi-variable grey model to forecast the electricity consumption of Shandong Province in China  ap. 327-335.  aThe electricity consumption forecasting problem is especially important for policy making in developing region. To properly formulate policies, it is necessary to have reliable forecasts. Electricity consumption forecasting is influenced by some factors, such as economic, population and so on. Considering all factors is a difficult task since it requires much detailed study in which many factors significantly influence on electricity forecasting whereas too many data are unavailable. Grey convex relational analysis is used to describe the relationship between the electricity consumption and its related factors. A novel multi-variable grey forecasting model which considered the total population is developed to forecast the electricity consumption in Shandong Province. The GMC(1,N) model with fractional order accumulation is optimized by changing the order number and the effectiveness of the first pair of original data by the model is proven. The results of practical numerical examples demonstrate that the model provides remarkable prediction performances compared with the traditional grey forecasting model. The forecasted results showed that the increase of electricity consumption will speed up in Shandong Province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aenergy policy 3amodels 3aprediction 3aChina 0aElectricity consumption forecasting 0aMulti-variable grey model 0aPopulation 0aFractional order accumulation1 aGao, Xiaohui1 aXiao, Yanli1 aYang, Yingjie1 aChen, Shucheng,0 tEnergy.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 157 p.327-335dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.05.1473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007200150245005100222300001400273500001900287520111600306592002801422650000801450650001601458650001501474650001201489650001901501650000901520650001001529650001601539650001101555650001001566650001701576650001301593650001301606650001501619653001201634653000901646653001001655653000701665653000801672653000801680653000801688653001001696653001001706653000801716653000901724653001201733653003301745653002201778653001501800653001101815653001401826653002101840653002101861653001001882700002801892700002101920700001201941700002001953773009101973856008502064852000902149655001202158IND60693685120221119041228.0201124s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069368512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2017.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aḤasanayn, Nāṣir Jalāl,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6160-098810aBisphenol A (BPA) the mighty and the mutagenic  ap. 76-84.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most widely used synthetic compounds on the planet. Upon entering the diet, its highest concentration (1–104 ng/g of tissue) has been recorded in the placenta and fetus. This accumulation of BPA can have many health hazards ranging from the easy to repair single strand DNA breaks (SSBs) to error prone double strand DNA breaks (DSBs). Although the Human liver can efficiently metabolize BPA via glucuronidation and sulfation pathways, however the by-product Bisphenol-o-quinone has been shown to act as a DNA adduct. Low doses of BPA have also been shown to interact with various signaling pathways to disrupt normal downstream signaling. Analysis has been made on how BPA could interact with several signaling pathways such as NFκB, JNK, MAPK, ER and AR that eventually lead to disease morphology and even tumorigenesis. The role of low dose BPA is also discussed in dysregulating Ca²⁺ homeostasis of the cell by inhibiting calcium channels such as SPCA1/2 to suggest a new direction for future research in the realms of BPA induced disease morphology and mutagenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abisphenol A 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3acarcinogenesis 3adiet 3afetus 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aliver 3amutagenicity 3amutagens 3aplacenta 3atoxicology 0aGC–MS 0aHPLC 0aELISA 0aMS 0aLLE 0aSPE 0aDES 0aSPCA1 0aIGF1R 0aFDA 0aEFSA 0aFAO/WHO 0aBISPHENOL A (BPA) CCID: 6623 0aBisphenol A (BPA) 0aDNA damage 0aCancer 0aMutations 0aCa2+ homeostasis 0aSPCA1 inhibition 0aIGF1R1 aSurendranath, Austin R.1 aPathak, Janak L.1 aYu, Shi1 aChung, Chang Y.0 tToxicology reports.g2018, v. 5 p.76-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2017.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04227naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010600173300001500279520188200294592002802176650002302204650001502227650003002242650001302272650001502285650001602300650001602316650001402332650002302346650001002369650002402379650002402403650001502427650002102442650001502463650002002478650001002498650002002508650003002528650001802558650000902576650002602585650001102611650001002622650001502632650001402647650002302661650001402684650001802698650002802716653000702744653000702751653000702758653000902765653000802774653000802782653000802790653000802798653000802806653000702814653000802821653000802829653000902837653000802846653000902854653000702863653001702870653002102887653002802908653001402936653003802950700005402988700001603042700002003058700002503078700002103103773011803124856008603242852000903328655001203337IND60581822220221118013456.0180831e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058182222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonk, Jennifer M.10aNavy and black bean supplementation primes the colonic mucosal microenvironment to improve gut health  ap. 89-100.  aCommon beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are enriched in non-digestible fermentable carbohydrates and phenolic compounds that can modulate the colonic microenvironment (microbiota and host epithelial barrier) to improve gut health. In a comprehensive assessment of the impact of two commonly consumed bean varieties (differing in levels and types of phenolic compounds) within the colonic microenvironment, C57Bl/6 mice were fed diets supplemented with 20% cooked navy bean (NB) or black bean (BB) flours or an isocaloric basal diet control (BD) for 3 weeks. NB and BB similarly altered the fecal microbiota community structure (16S rRNA sequencing) notably by increasing the abundance of carbohydrate fermenting bacteria such as Prevotella, S24–7 and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, which coincided with enhanced short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production (microbial-derived carbohydrate fermentation products) and colonic expression of the SCFA receptors GPR-41/-43/-109a. Both NB and BB enhanced multiple aspects of mucus and epithelial barrier integrity vs. BD including: (i) goblet cell number, crypt mucus content and mucin mRNA expression, (ii) anti-microbial defenses (Reg3γ), (iii) crypt length and epithelial cell proliferation, (iv) apical junctional complex components (occludin, JAM-A, ZO-1 and E-cadherin) mRNA expression and (v) reduced serum endotoxin concentrations. Interestingly, biomarkers of colon barrier integrity (crypt height, mucus content, cell proliferation and goblet cell number) were enhanced in BB vs. NB-fed mice, suggesting added benefits attributable to unique BB components (e.g., phenolics). Overall, NB and BB improved baseline colonic microenvironment function by altering the microbial community structure and activity and promoting colon barrier integrity and function; effects which may prove beneficial in attenuating gut-associated diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aPrevotella 3aRuminococcus flavefaciens 3abacteria 3abiomarkers 3ablack beans 3ablood serum 3acadherins 3acell proliferation 3acolon 3acommunity structure 3adietary supplements 3aendotoxins 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afermented foods 3aflour 3agene expression 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amicrobial communities 3amucins 3amucus 3anavy beans 3aoccludins 3aphenolic compounds 3areceptors 3aribosomal RNA 3ashort chain fatty acids 0aAB 0aBB 0aBD 0aBCFA 0aFDR 0aGPR 0aH&E 0aJAM 0aLAL 0aNB 0aOTU 0aPAS 0aPCoA 0aRDP 0aSCFA 0aZO 0aCommon beans 0aFecal microbiota 0aShort-chain fatty acids 0aEndotoxin 0aColonic mucosal barrier integrity1 aLepp, Dion1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3740-47061 aWu, Wenqing1 aPauls, K.

The diversity of livestock systems comes from the diversity of breeds (dairy or beef), ages and gender (bulls, steers, heifers, cull cows) used to produce either mainly beef or beef and milk. In addition, there are factors linked to farming practices (including diet, especially grazing) which significantly influence the sensory, nutritional, technological and extrinsic (such as image) quality attributes of meat. These can become factors of positive differentiation when controlled by the application and certification of technical specifications. Finally, preslaughter (such as stress), slaughter (such as the chilling and hanging method of carcasses) and postslaughter (such as ageing, packaging and cooking) conditions have a strong influence on the microbiological, sensory, technological and image quality attributes of beef. In this review, potential synergisms or antagonisms between the different quality attributes are highlighted. For example, finishing cattle on grass, compared to indoor fattening on a high concentrate diet, has the advantage of producing leaner meat with a higher proportion of omega-3 fatty acids while exhibiting superior oxidative stability, but with the consequence of a darker meat colour and lower productivity, as well as higher seasonality and land surface requirements. Moreover, the control of on-farm factors is often guided by productivity (growth rate, feed conversion ratio) and carcass quality attributes (weight, conformation and fatness). Genetic selection has often been oriented in this direction, without taking other quality attributes into account. Finally, the interactions between all these factors (and especially between on-farm and slaughter or processing factors) are not considered in the quality grading schemes in European countries. This means that positive efforts at farm level may be mitigated or even eliminated by poor slaughtering or processing conditions. All these considerations explain why between-animal variability in quality can be high, even when animals come from the same farming system. The ability to predict the sensory and nutritional properties of meat according to production factors has become a major objective of the supply chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abeef carcasses 3acarcass quality 3acertification 3acolor 3adiet 3afarms 3afeed concentrates 3afeed conversion 3agenetic selection 3agrasses 3ameat quality 3amilk 3aoxidative stability 3aslaughter 3asupply chain 0aBeef quality 0aCarcass characteristics 0aCattle 0aConsumer perception 0aFarming systems1 aEllies-Oury, M.P.1 aHocquette, J.F.1 aGuillier, L.1 aSanté-Lhoutellier, V.1 aPrache, S.0 tAnimal.g2022 Feb., v. 16 p.100426-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2021.1004263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013600166300001600302520166300318592002801981650002502009650002802034650001002062650002402072650001502096650001402111650001302125650002202138700002102160700002202181773009202203856004802295852000902343655001202352IND50062853120221118154329.0130323e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006285312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-012-9830-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCross, Paul C.10aUnderestimating the effects of spatial heterogeneity due to individual movement and spatial scale: infectious disease as an example  ap. 247-257.  aMany ecological and epidemiological studies occur in systems with mobile individuals and heterogeneous landscapes. Using a simulation model, we show that the accuracy of inferring an underlying biological process from observational data depends on movement and spatial scale of the analysis. As an example, we focused on estimating the relationship between host density and pathogen transmission. Observational data can result in highly biased inference about the underlying process when individuals move among sampling areas. Even without sampling error, the effect of host density on disease transmission is underestimated by approximately 50 % when one in ten hosts move among sampling areas per lifetime. Aggregating data across larger regions causes minimal bias when host movement is low, and results in less biased inference when movement rates are high. However, increasing data aggregation reduces the observed spatial variation, which would lead to the misperception that a spatially targeted control effort may not be very effective. In addition, averaging over the local heterogeneity will result in underestimating the importance of spatial covariates. Minimizing the bias due to movement is not just about choosing the best spatial scale for analysis, but also about reducing the error associated with using the sampling location as a proxy for an individual’s spatial history. This error associated with the exposure covariate can be reduced by choosing sampling regions with less movement, including longitudinal information of individuals’ movements, or reducing the window of exposure by using repeated sampling or younger individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease transmission 3aepidemiological studies 3ahosts 3ainfectious diseases 3alandscapes 3apathogens 3asampling 3asimulation models1 aCaillaud, Damien1 aHeisey, Dennis M.0 tLandscape ecology.g2013 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.247-257dSpringer-Verlagx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-012-9830-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300002000295520217900315592002802494596005902522596007202581650001502653650001302668650003002681650001202711650001302723650002202736650001502758650001502773650001502788700001602803700001402819700001502833773015402848856008303002852000903085655001203094IND60776446220221118020349.0220506e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077644622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18457-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaoying10aUsing HYDRUS-2D model to simulate the water flow and nitrogen transport in a paddy field with traditional flooded irrigation  ap. 32894-32912.  aIn recent years, agricultural non-point source pollution (ANPSP) has become increasingly prominent, and nitrogen plays an important role in ANPSP. Therefore, we carried out traditional flooded irrigation (TFI) experiments in the paddy field, and applied HYDRUS-2D model to simulate the nitrogen transport in this study. Three observation points A1, A2, and A3 were arranged on the diagonal of the paddy field. We observed ponding water depth on soil surface and nitrogen concentrations in ponding water and soil water at 0.1 m, 0.2 m, and 0.3 m below soil surface. HYDRUS-2D model was proved to be effective in simulating the ponding water depth with root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.717 cm and Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) = 0.805 for the simulated and measured ponding water depth. The simulated and measured NH₄⁺–N concentrations at different depths below soil surface at point A1 basically had the same trend, and the simulated NH₄⁺–N concentrations in ponding water had better agreement with the measured data with RMSE = 1.323 mg/L, and NSE = 0.958. The measured NH₄⁺–N concentrations at depths of 0.1 m, 0.2 m, and 0.3 m below soil surface at point A2 were larger than the simulated values, but they had the same trend on the whole. The simulated NH₄⁺–N concentrations at different depths below soils’ surface at point A3 did not fit well with the measured values. The overall trend of the simulated and measured NO₃⁻–N concentrations in ponding water on soil surface at point A1 was consistent, but the peak values of the simulated NO₃⁻–N concentrations were larger than the measured ones. The simulated and measured NO₃⁻–N concentrations at different depths below soil surface at points A2 and A3 did not agree well although they had the same trend, which became worse with the increase of soil depth. This indicated that the HYDRUS-2D model was effective in simulating water flow and nitrogen transport in TFI paddy fields. Sensitivity analysis suggested different simulated nitrogen concentrations in different water depths at different time were sensitive to different model parameters.  aPublisher supplied data  a42072271cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2652018179cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3airrigation 3anitrogen 3anonpoint source pollution 3apaddies 3aresearch 3asimulation models 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3awater flow1 aTong, Juxiu1 aLiu, Cong1 aMa, Yanbao0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 May, v. 29, no. 22 p.32894-32912dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18457-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245016500183300001600348500001500364520134000379592002801719650001901747650004001766650000801806650001101814650002801825650002301853650001201876650002001888650002501908650001301933653001801946700002601964700001701990773011102007856008202118852000902200655001202209IND60082473020221121091140.0191108e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008247302DNAL7 a251892292pmid7 a10.1007/s12041-014-0382-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOTA, SWATHI10aPprA, a pleiotropic protein for radioresistance, works through DNA gyrase and shows cellular dynamics during postirradiation recovery in Deinococcus radiodurans  ap. 349-354.  a2019-12-06  aPprA, a pleiotropic protein involved in radioresistance of Deinococcus radiodurans was detected in multiprotein DNA processing complex identified from this bacterium. pprA mutant expressing GFP-PprA could restore its wild type resistance of γ radiation. Under normal conditions, GFP-PprA expressing cells showed PprA localization on both septum trapped nucleoids (STN) and nucleoids located elsewhere (MCN). Cell exposed to 4 kGy γ radiation showed nearly 2 h growth lag and during this growth arrest phase, the majority of the cells had GFP-PprA located on MCN. While in late phase (∼120 min) PIR cells, when cells are nearly out of growth arrest, PprA was maximally found with STN. These cells when treated with nalidixic acid showed diffused localization of PprA across the septum. gyrA disruption mutant of D. radiodurans showed growth inhibition, which increased further in gyrA pprA mutant. Interestingly, gyrA mutant showed ∼20-fold less resistance to γ radiation as compared to wild type, which did increase further in gyrA pprA mutant. These results suggested that PprA localization undergoes a dynamic change during PIR, and its localization on nucleoid near septum and functional interaction with gyrase A might suggest a mechanism that could explain PprA role in genome segregation possibly through topoisomerase II.  aPublisher supplied data 3analidixic acid 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aDNA 3agenome 3aDeinococcus radiodurans 3agrowth retardation 3amutants 3agamma radiation 3aradiation resistance 3abacteria 0agrowth arrest1 aCHARAKA, VIJAYA KUMAR1 aMISRA, H.

Macroinvertebrates are the most sensitive indicators of disturbance and they are used as a cost-effective tool for bioassessment at catchment and site scales. The focus of our study was to identify the key drivers from three classes of environmental variables (geophysical landscape, land use, and site habitat) that influence macroinvertebrate richness in different aquatic ecological function regions (AEFRs) of the Liaohe River Basin. We sampled macroinvertebrate assemblages, extracted geophysical and climate variables from geospatial data, and quantified physical and chemical habitats from 407 randomly distributed sites that belong to the three level-I AEFRs. We analyzed our data through multiple linear regression models by using the three classes of predicted variables alone and in combination. The models that were constructed in the first level-I AEFR explained similar amounts of macroinvertebrate richness and had the maximum ability to explain how macroinvertebrate richness distributed (denoted &ldquo;explaining ability&rdquo;; geophysical landscape: R<inf>GL</inf>2 &asymp; 60%, land use and site habitat: R<inf>LU</inf>2 and R<inf>SH</inf>2 &asymp; 50%, and combined: R<inf>CB</inf>2 &asymp; 75%). The explaining abilities for the third level-I AEFR were as follows: R<inf>GL</inf>2 &asymp; 11%, R<inf>LU</inf>2 &asymp; 14%, R<inf>SH</inf>2 &asymp; 25%, and R<inf>CB</inf>2 &asymp; 38%. The explaining abilities for the 4th level-I AEFR were as follows: R<inf>GL</inf>2 &asymp; 30%, R<inf>LU</inf>2 &asymp; 7%, R<inf>SH</inf>2 &asymp; 40%, and R<inf>CB</inf>2 &asymp; 55%. We conclude that: (1) all of the combined models explained more interaction as compared with the single models; (2) the environmental variables differed among different level-I AEFRs; and, (3) variables in the site habitat scale were the most robust explainers when analyzing the relationship between environmental variables and macroinvertebrate richness and they can be recommended as the optimal candidate explainer. These results may provide cost-effective tools for distinguishing and identifying the drivers of sensitive aquatic organisms at regional scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3abiodiversity 3abiological assessment 3aclimatic factors 3acost effectiveness 3aecological function 3afauna 3ageophysics 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amacroinvertebrates 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aspatial data 3awatersheds1 aJia, Xiaobo 1 aLin, Jianing 1 aQian, Chang 1 aGao, Xin 1 aDing, Sen 0 tWater.g2019 July 26, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110815503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245016800207520130800375592002801683650001101711650001801722650001801740650001601758650000901774650000701783650001501790650002501805653003401830653001301864653001401877653003801891653002701929653000801956700005901964700005802023773010202081856008602183852000902269655001202278IND60778547320221119031140.0220621e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077854732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1078162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Beibei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8167-153X10aRheological fingerprinting and tribological assessment of high internal phase emulsions stabilized by whey protein isolate: Effects of protein concentration and pH  aThe effects of protein concentration and pH on the rheological and lubrication behavior of high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs), stabilized by whey protein isolate (WPI), were investigated by combining large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) and tribology characterizations. All HIPEs showed predominantly solid-like behavior with greater stiffness at higher protein concentration. Emulsions at lower protein concentrations experienced extensive intracycle shear thinning with increased energy dissipation, indicating less resistance to large deformations and ready alignment in the shear flow. Increasing pH from 3 to 7 resulted in greater fragility with easier yielding to nonlinear behavior and faster transition to Newtonian fluid dissipation. This is likely due to the greater interfacial elasticity of oil droplets at neutral pH. In addition, tribological testing showed that increasing protein concentration resulted in a transition to the hydrodynamic regime. Emulsions at pH 3 had better mixed lubrication than those at pH 7, which can be attributed to easier entrainment of more deformable oil droplets. The findings of this study provide insights into the design potential of HIPEs with tunable textural properties and better prediction of structural transformations during food processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrodynamics 3alubrication 3aoils 3apH 3aprediction 3awhey protein isolate 0aHigh internal phase emulsions 0aRheology 0aTribology 0aLarge amplitude oscillatory shear 0aInterfacial properties 0aWPI1 aDrusch, Stephan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8777-75141 aHogan, Sean A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3161-95700 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Oct., v. 131 p.107816-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1078163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009400160300001800254520094900272592002801221650002801249650001501277650001301292650001301305650001801318650001601336650001101352650001901363650001401382650002201396650002801418700001501446700001701461700001301478700001701491700001501508773013001523856007501653852000901728655001201737IND60753447520221122022813.0211015e20211012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075344752DNAL7 a10.1039/d1bm01139a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guiqiang10aSelf-adjuvanting photosensitizer nanoparticles for combination photodynamic immunotherapy  ap. 6940-6949.  aCombination cancer immunotherapy that synergizes the advantages of multiple therapeutic agents has shown great potential in tumor treatment. Herein, we report the one-step assembly of therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) to co-deliver photosensitizers and adjuvants for combination photodynamic therapy (PDT) and immunotherapy. The NPs are obtained via self-assembly of chlorin e6 (Ce6) and imidazoquinoline-based TLR7 agonists (IMDQ), which results in a high loading efficacy of 72.2% and 27.8% for Ce6 and IMDQ, respectively. Upon laser irradiation, the resulting NPs could not only effectively induce photodynamic immunogenic cancer cell death, but also elicit robust antitumor immunity, leading to significant inhibition of both primary and distant tumors in a bilateral tumor model. This study demonstrates the potential of self-assembled NPs in co-delivering multiple therapeutics for potential immunotherapy to enhance the antitumor efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acell death 3achlorins 3aimmunity 3aimmunotherapy 3airradiation 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents1 aWang, Ning1 aSun, Haifeng1 aFu, Xiao1 aZhai, Shumei1 aCui, Jiwei0 tBiomaterials science.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 9, no. 20 p.6940-6949dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1bm01139a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245011700178300001600295520130100311536014101612592002801753596001501781650001701796650002201813650001501835650001501850650003001865650001401895650001201909650001601921650001301937650002101950650001701971650000901988650001701997650001302014653001902027653001602046653002702062700002602089700003802115700002802153700003002181773013902211856008502350852000902435655001202444IND60746384920221121040519.0210803e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074638492DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2021.19363862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso, Felipe Gimenes10aPotential of Egeria densa and Pistia stratiotes for the phytoremediation of water contaminated with saflufenacil  ap. 644-649.  aSaflufenacil is an herbicide that is leachable in soil and has the potential to contaminate groundwater, besides having moderate toxicity to aquatic organisms. Some macrophyte species may interfere with the availability of herbicides in water, increasing dissipation in this environment. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the absorption and dissipation of ¹⁴C-saflufenacil in water by Egeria densa and Pistia stratiotes. Dissipation was performed with ¹⁴C-saflufenacil applied directly in water and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry (LSS). The evaluation times were 0, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after application (HAA) for E. densa and 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 84 and 108 HAA for P. stratiotes. Absorption was analyzed through plant combustion in a biological oxidizer. The presence of the macrophytes increased the dissipation of ¹⁴C-saflufenacil in water. The half-life time (DT₅₀) of the herbicide decreased by 82.6% in the presence of E. densa at 96 HAA. For P. stratiotes, the reduction in DT₅₀ was 94.8% at 108 HAA. The absorption of ¹⁴C-saflufenacil was low for both macrophytes during the evaluated time. However, the macrophytes E. densa and P. stratiotes showed potential for the phytoremediation of water contaminated with saflufenacil.  aWe would like to tanks the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), process 18/25065-1, for financial support.  aPublisher supplied data  a18/25065-1 3aEgeria densa 3aPistia stratiotes 3aabsorption 3acombustion 3agroundwater contamination 3ahalf life 3aliquids 3amacrophytes 3aoxidants 3aphytoremediation 3asaflufenacil 3asoil 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 0aBioremediation 0adissipation 0aradiolabeled herbicide1 aMielke, Kamila Cabral1 aBrochado, Maura Gabriela da Silva1 aMendes, Kassio Ferreira1 aTornisielo, Valdemar Luiz0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2021 Aug. 3, v. 56, no. 7 p.644-649dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2021.19363863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012700158300001800285520171900303592002802022650001202050650002002062650002802082650002202110650001302132650001602145650002602161650001702187650001902204650001902223650001802242650001502260650002402275650001302299650002102312700001702333700002002350773013002370856007502500852000902575655001202584IND60753447620221122023134.0211015e20211012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075344762DNAL7 a10.1039/d1bm01169c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Sungjin10aPhenylboronic acid-based core–shell drug delivery platform clasping 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds by a coordinate interaction  ap. 6851-6864.  aAlong with the successful commercialization of chemotherapeutics, such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel, numerous natural compounds have been investigated for clinical applications. Recently, curcumin (CUR), a natural compound with various therapeutic effects, has attracted attention for cancer immunotherapy. Most chemotherapeutics, however, have poor water solubility due to their hydrophobicity, which makes them less suited to biomedical applications; CUR is no exception because of its low bioavailability and extremely high hydrophobicity. In the present study, we developed an easy but effective strategy using the interaction between the 1,3-dicarbonyl groups of drugs and phenylboronic acid (PBA) to solubilize hydrophobic drugs. First, we verified the coordinate interaction between 1,3-dicarbonyl and PBA using 3,5-heptanedione as a model compound, followed by CUR as a model drug. A PBA-grafted hydrophilic polymer was used to form a nanoconstruct by coordination bonding with CUR, which then made direct administration of the nanoparticles possible. The nanoconstruct exhibited remarkable loading capability, uniform size, colloidal stability, and pH-responsive drug release, attributed to the formation of core–shell nanoconstructs by coordinate interaction. The therapeutic nanoconstructs successfully showed both chemotherapeutic and anti-PD-L1 anticancer effects in cellular and animal models. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of this technique to other 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds. Overall, our findings suggest a facile, but expandable strategy by applying the coordinate interaction between 1,3-dicarbonyl and PBA, which enables high drug loading and stimuli-responsive drug release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abioavailability 3abiocompatible materials 3acommercialization 3acurcumin 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug therapy 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunotherapy 3apaclitaxel 3aphenylboronic acids 3apolymers 3awater solubility1 aLee, Junseok1 aKim, Wŏn-jong,0 tBiomaterials science.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 9, no. 20 p.6851-6864dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1bm01169c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013600171300001600307520161300323592002801936650002101964650001901985650002402004650002402028650002202052650001102074650002702085650001402112650001602126653002602142653000802168653001802176653002202194653002302216700002402239700001802263700001702281700002202298700002402320700002002344773013002364856008402494852000902578655001202587IND50071056120221118154330.0190412e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007105612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2012.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeneses, Nicolás10aModelling of polyphenoloxidase inactivation by pulsed electric fields considering coupled effects of temperature and electric field  ap. 126-132.  aThermal effects can strongly influence the impact of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment on enzyme inactivation. Most of the kinetic models found in literature, do not distinguish between PEF and thermal effects.A batch PEF treatment chamber with temperature control was used in order to allow performance of PEF treatments at quasi-isothermal conditions. An empirical model describing the PEF polyphenoloxidase (PPO) inactivation as a function of the electric field strength, temperature, treatment time, residence time and synergistic effects of electric field strength and temperature was developed.Experimental data showed that PPO was not inactivated by PEF treatments at temperatures below 55°C and thermal inactivation seems to be significant at temperatures between 59 and 67°C.However, PPO activity decreased down to 60% when PEF treatments were applied at temperatures in the range of 55 to 59°C.The synergistic effect of PEF and temperature was described by a kinetic model at different treatment temperatures.Kinetic models to describe the inactivation of enzymes as a function of PEF parameters, such as electric field strength and treatment time have already been developed. However, these models do not consider the temperature as a variable within the kinetic model. In the present study, a kinetic model was developed, which includes the synergistic effect between temperature and electric field strength. This allows quantifying the PPO inactivation under different processing temperatures and may serve as a base to set up experimental trials whereas a certain temperature is desired.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatechol oxidase 3aelectric field 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzyme inactivation 3aheat inactivation 3amodels 3apulsed electric fields 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aPulsed electric field 0aPPO 0aKinetic model 0aThermal treatment 0aSynergistic effect1 aSaldaña, Guillermo1 aJaeger, Henry1 aRaso, Javier1 aAlvarez, Ignacio,1 aCebrián, Guillermo1 aKnorr, Dietrich0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2013 Oct., v. 20 p.126-132dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2012.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009300173300001600266520101900282592002801301650000801329650001301337650002101350650001401371650000901385650001201394650004301406650002001449650001901469650001101488650001101499651001601510653002501526653001801551653000901569653001401578653001801592653001201610700001901622700002401641700002301665700001901688700002001707700001601727700002301743700002001766700001701786700002401803773011201827856008201939852000902021655001202030IND60581822520221118013346.0190411e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058182252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2017.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchöneberg, Torsten,10aOccurrence of Fusarium species and mycotoxins in Swiss oats—Impact of cropping factors  ap. 123-132.  aBetween 2013 and 2015, 325 samples of commercially grown oats were collected in Switzerland along with data on respective cropping factors. The incidence of different Fusarium species was determined using a seed health test and quantitative PCR was used to measure the amount of F. poae and F. langsethiae DNA. Mycotoxins were quantified by LC–MS/MS. Among all Fusarium species, F. poae was found to be dominant whereas T-2/HT-2 toxins were the major mycotoxins. Samples from fields with the previous crop cereal showed the highest concentrations of T-2/HT-2. Higher amounts of nivalenol (NIV) and T-2/HT-2 were detected in samples from fields with reduced tillage compared with samples from ploughed fields. Furthermore, we observed a higher contamination with NIV and T-2/HT-2 in winter sown varieties compared with spring sown varieties. Results from the current study are highly valuable to develop recommendations for optimised cropping systems that reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination of oat grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aFusarium 3acropping systems 3anivalenol 3aoats 3aplowing 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areduced tillage 3arisk reduction 3aspring 3awinter 3aSwitzerland 0aFusarium langsethiae 0aFusarium poae 0aOats 0aMycotoxin 0aPrevious crop 0aTillage1 aJenny, Eveline1 aWettstein, Felix E.1 aBucheli, Thomas D.1 aMascher, Fabio1 aBertossa, Mario1 aMusa, Tomke1 aSeifert, Keith A.,1 aGräfenhan, Tom1 aKeller, Beat1 aVogelgsang, Susanne0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2018 Jan., v. 92 p.123-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2017.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245016000181300001600341520100400357592002801361650001601389650001701405650001701422650002001439650001201459650001201471650001001483650001101493650002101504650003001525650001901555650001101574650000901585651001201594651001201606653001901618653001301637653001701650653001001667653001801677700001901695773012501714856005101839852000901890655001201899IND50075523620221120113507.0140410e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007552362DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2012.7385212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtungwu, Jonathan Jeremiah10aPreponderance and distribution of plant-parasitic nematodes in Nassarawa State, North Central Nigeria: Consequences for healthy tuber production and export  ap. 261-272.  aOne of the most cosmopolitan pests responsible for considerable negative economic impacts on yam is the plant-parasitic nematodes. They are also capable of facilitating fungal, bacterial and viral infections of yams. In order to produce healthy yam seeds to meet local demand and tubers for export, there is a need to identify nematode-free areas in Nassarawa, one of the hubs of yam production in Nigeria. To this end, 30 major yam growing communities of the state were surveyed to identify nematode-free areas. Structured questionnaires were administered to three farmers in each of the 10 local government areas selected. Results showed that 97% of the study areas investigated was seriously infested with the three key genera of plant-parasitic nematodes namely Scutellonema, Pratylenchus and Meloidogyne. Incidence and severity of tuber deterioration in transit threatened acceptability of the tubers when it eventually reached England. Healthy yams would attract more income than damaged ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne 3aPratylenchus 3aScutellonema 3aeconomic impact 3aexports 3afarmers 3afungi 3aincome 3alocal government 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aquestionnaires 3atubers 3ayams 3aEngland 3aNigeria 0aDioscorea spp. 0aeelworms 0aexport crops 0atrade 0ayam nematodes1 aAyodele, Maria0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 46, no. 3 p.261-272dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2012.738521  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245011700181300001600298520145300314592002801767650002301795650002301818650001401841650001001855650001601865650000901881650003001890650001201920650002801932650002101960700001701981700002001998773011102018856008202129852000902211655001202220IND60082473320221121120500.0191108e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008247332DNAL7 a251892322pmid7 a10.1007/s12041-014-0385-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Min,10aQuantitative trait loci mapping and genetic dissection for lint percentage in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)  ap. 371-378.  aLint percentage is an important character of cotton yield components and it is also correlated with cotton fibre development. In this study, we used a high lint percentage variety, Baimian1, and a low lint percentage, TM-1 genetic standard for Gossypium hirsutum, as parents to construct a mapping populations in upland cotton (G. hirsutum). A quantitative trait locus/loci (QTL) analysis of lint percentage was performed by using two mapping procedures; composite interval mapping (CIM), inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) and the F₂:₃ populations in 2 years. Six main-effect QTL (M-QTL) for lint percentage (four significant and two suggestive) were detected in both years by CIM, and were located on chr. 3, chr. 19, chr. 26 and chr. 5/chr. 19. Of the six QTL, marker intervals and favourable gene sources of the significant M-QTL, qLP-3(2010) and qLP-3(2011) were consistent. These QTL were also detected by ICIM, and therefore, should preferentially be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of lint percentage. Another M-QTL, qLP-19(2010), was detected by two mapping procedures, and it could also be a candidate for MAS. We detected the interaction between two M-QTL and environment, and 11 epistatic QTL (E-QTL) and their interaction with environment by using ICIM. The study also found two EST-SSRs, NAU1187 and NAU1255, linked to M-QTL for lint percentage that could be candidate markers affecting cotton fibre development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3achromosome mapping 3aepistasis 3agenes 3alint cotton 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3aparents 3aquantitative trait loci 3ayield components1 aLi, Chengxi,1 aWang, Qinglian,0 tJournal of genetics.g2014 Aug., v. 93, no. 2 p.371-378dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-014-0385-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016100158520143100319592002801750650001901778650001101797650003501808650002401843650002001867650001501887650001701902650001301919650001401932651001001946700002301956700002001979700002701999700002702026700002102053773011902074856007302193852000902266655001202275IND60660574120221122042626.0190823e20190726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066057412DNAL7 a10.3390/w110815522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPepe, Giacomo 10aInvestigation on Farmland Abandonment of Terraced Slopes Using Multitemporal Data Sources Comparison and Its Implication on Hydro-Geomorphological Processes  aThis paper presents a quantitative multi-temporal analysis performed in a GIS environment and based on different spatial information sources. The research is aimed at investigating the land use transformations that occurred in a small coastal terraced basin of Eastern Liguria from the early 1950s to 2011. The degree of abandonment of cultivated terraced slopes together with its influence on the distribution, abundance, and magnitude of rainfall-induced shallow landslides were accurately analysed. The analysis showed that a large portion of terraced area (77.4%) has been abandoned over approximately sixty years. This land use transformation has played a crucial role in influencing the hydro-geomorphological processes triggered by a very intense rainstorm that occurred in 2011. The outcomes of the analysis revealed that terraces abandoned for a short time showed the highest landslide susceptibility and that slope failures affecting cultivated zones were characterized by a lower magnitude than those which occurred on abandoned terraced slopes. Furthermore, this study highlights the usefulness of cadastral data in understanding the impact of rainfall-induced landslides due to both a high spatial and thematic accuracy. The obtained results represent a solid basis for the investigation of erosion and the shallow landslide susceptibility of terraced slopes by means of a simulation of land use change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabandoned land 3abasins 3ageographic information systems 3ainformation sources 3aland use change 3alandslides 3aspatial data 3aterraces 3aterracing 3aItaly1 aMandarino, Andrea 1 aRaso, Emanuele 1 aScarpellini, Patrizio 1 aBrandolini, Pierluigi 1 aCevasco, Andrea 0 tWater.g2019 July 26, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110815523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024001900128040001800147072000900165100001700174245014900191300001600340500002400356500001500380520184000395650002302235650001502258650001002273650002302283650001802306650001902324650001402343650002002357650001102377650002002388650002202408650001902430650002002449651001502469653002502484653002202509653001602531653001402547700001602561773011902577852000902696856011002705856008602815930003302901945002502934946001302959961001302972655001202985IND4375478120221120132453.0051024e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437547812DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-34.3.6042doi7 a10113/4472hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aKnight, A.L.10aDose-response of codling moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) to ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate in apple orchards treated with sex pheromone dispensers  ap. 604-609.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStudies were conducted in apple, Malus domestica Borkhausen, orchards to evaluate the attractiveness of the kairomone, ethyl (E, Z)-2,4-decadienoate (pear ester), loaded at various rates into gray halobutyl septa, to adult codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. All studies were conducted in orchards treated with sex pheromone mating disruption. Lure loadings from 0.01 microgram to 50.0 mg were evaluated in 12 orchard plots in 1999. Lures loaded with 1.0-50.0 and 0.1-50.0 mg caught significantly more male and female moths than the blank control, respectively. Field dose-response studies were repeated with five lure rates (0.1-40.0 mg) of pear ester during four periods during the 2000 season. Significant seasonal date and rate effects were found for the capture of males and female moths. The 0.1-mg lure caught significantly fewer males than the 1.0-, 3.0-, and 40.0-mg lures. The 40.0-mg lure caught significantly fewer female moths than the 1.0- and 3.0-mg lures. The 3.0-mg lure caught a higher proportion of virgin females than the 10.0- and 40.0-mg lures. The attractiveness of the 1.0 and 3.0 mg pear ester loadings were compared with a sex pheromone lure during a 10-wk trial in 2002. Both pear ester lures caught significantly fewer moths than the sex pheromone lure during the first 4 wk of the study and over the entire 10-wk period. However, no difference among lures occurred during week 5, and the 3.0-mg lure caught significantly more moths than the sex pheromone lure during week 6. The 3.0-mg lure caught a significantly higher proportion of female moths and a higher proportion of virgin female moths than the 1.0-mg lure. These studies suggest that the optimal loading of pear ester for capture of codling moth in mating disrupted apple orchards likely depends on the specific objectives of the monitoring program. 3atemporal variation 3akairomones 3abaits 3ainsect attractants 3adose response 3asex pheromones 3asex ratio 3apheromone traps 3aesters 3aMalus domestica 3amating disruption 3avirgin females 3aCydia pomonella 0aWashington 0afemale mating status 0alure loading rate 0apear esters 0acodlemone1 aLight, D.M.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2005 June, v.  34, no.  3 p.604-609dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/4473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-34.3.6043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070622b20070702c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/11/08  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02527naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245009100192300001600283520131600299592002801615650001501643650001101658650001201669650001101681650001101692650001901703650001801722650002301740650002001763650002601783650002101809650001501830700001901845700002701864700002401891773011101915856008202026852000902108655001202117IND60082473420221121120429.0191108e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008247342DNAL7 a251892332pmid7 a10.1007/s12041-014-0386-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSINGH, SALAM HEROJEET10aRoles of the troponin isoforms during indirect flight muscle development in Drosophila  ap. 379-388.  aTroponin proteins in cooperative interaction with tropomyosin are responsible for controlling the contraction of the striated muscles in response to changes in the intracellular calcium concentration. Contractility of the muscle is determined by the constituent protein isoforms, and the isoforms can switch over from one form to another depending on physiological demands and pathological conditions. In Drosophila, a majority of the myofibrillar proteins in the indirect flight muscles (IFMs) undergo post-transcriptional and post-translational isoform changes during pupal to adult metamorphosis to meet the high energy and mechanical demands of flight. Using a newly generated Gal4 strain (UH3-Gal4) which is expressed exclusively in the IFMs, during later stages of development, we have looked at the developmental and functional importance of each of the troponin subunits (troponin-I, troponin-T and troponin-C) and their isoforms. We show that all the troponin subunits are required for normal myofibril assembly and flight, except for the troponin-C isoform 1 (TnC1). Moreover, rescue experiments conducted with troponin-I embryonic isoform in the IFMs, where flies were rendered flightless, show developmental and functional differences of TnI isoforms and importance of maintaining the right isoform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aadults 3acalcium 3aenergy 3aflight 3aflight muscles 3ametamorphosis 3amuscle development 3amuscle strength 3amyofibrillar proteins 3aprotein isoforms 3atroponin T1 aKUMAR, PRABODH1 aRAMACHANDRA, NALLUR B.1 aNONGTHOMBA, UPENDRA0 tJournal of genetics.g2014 Aug., v. 93, no. 2 p.379-388dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-014-0386-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010100165300001200266500001900278520157100297592002801868650001501896650000801911650001201919650001801931650000901949650001501958650001701973650002601990650000902016650001502025650001902040650002302059650002302082650001702105650001602122650001002138700005602148700001602204773014002220856008302360852000902443655001202452IND60694652120221119225143.0200703e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069465212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-04624-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanka, P.

The choice of the materials was influenced by their large surface area, abundance of functional groups as well as their availability in the local environment. Rice and corn husks were pyrolyzed at 500, 600, and 700 °C to make biochars that were used to treat low-quality industrial wastewater. Initial metal ion levels in wastewater and residual levels after the application of biochars were measured using an atomic adsorption spectrophotometer. Carbonization of rice husks at 600 °C produced the best removal efficiencies for Cr (65%), Fe (90%), and Pb (> 90%). The carbonization of corn husks at 600 °C produced the worst removal efficiencies for Cr (only 20%) and Pb (slightly > 35%). Regardless of the carbonization temperature, rice husk biochars performed better than corn husk biochars. Experimental data fitted well the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models (R² values ranging between 0.82 and 0.99). The Langmuir separation factor, RL, had negative values, probably due to the low initial concentration of the adsorbates in the raw wastewater. All the biochars showed a relatively short contact time (20 to 30 min) to attain maximum adsorption efficiencies and are a promising feature for future industrial applications. The studied biochar materials from rice and corn husk have the potential to remove heavy metal ions from industrial wastewater; rice husk biochar showed higher removal capacity than corn husk biochars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3abiochar 3acarbonization 3acorn 3acorn husks 3aheavy metals 3aindustrial wastewater 3arice 3arice hulls 3asoil pollution 3asorption isotherms 3aspectrophotometers 3asurface area 3atemperature 3awater1 aRwiza, M.

This study has been done to investigate the effects of methyl jasmonate (100 μM) and silver nitrate (50 and 100 μM) individually and simultaneously on the production of mentioned important medicinal alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, ajmalicine, vindoline and catharanthine) and the expression profile of related regulatory and biosynthetic genes in micropropagated shoots of C. roseus. The effects of these treatments are also investigated on non-enzymatic defensive metabolites (total phenolics, flavonoids and carotenoids) and antioxidant enzymes activities (peroxidase, EC 1.11.1.7, catalase, EC 1.11.1.6 and superoxide dismutase, EC 1.15.1.1). Changes of dry weight, quantity of lipid peroxidation, and photosynthetic pigments contents have been measured as well. The results showed increased contents of alkaloids and expression levels of investigated regulatory (Mitogen-activated protein kinase3 and Octadecanoid-responsive Catharanthus AP2-domain3) and biosynthetic (strictosidine synthase, geissoschizine synthase, deacetylvindoline acetyltransferase and peroxidase1) genes under the employed treatments. The maximum yields of these alkaloids and the highest levels of the mentioned genes expression were observed under 100 μM methyl jasmonate in combination with 100 μM of AgNO₃ after seven days. The employed treatments induced increased lipid peroxidation, higher levels of enzymatic antioxidants activities and more production of non-enzymatic defensive metabolites which shows activity of plant defensive system. The results suggest that silver nitrate and methyl jasmonate signalling pathways may have cross talks and their simultaneous application make an effective combination for elicitation of medicinal alkaloids biosynthesis in C. roseus micropropagated shoots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aacetyltransferases 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3aflavonoids 3agenes 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolites 3amethyl jasmonate 3amicropropagation 3aperoxidase 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotosynthesis 3ashoots 3asignal transduction 3asilver nitrate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avinblastine 3avincristine 0aCatharanthus roseus 0aMethyl jasmonate 0aSilver nitrate 0aTerpenoid indole alkaloids 0aDeacetylvindoline acetyltransferase 0aGeissoschizine synthase 0aMalondialdehyde 0aMetyl jasmonat 0aCatharanthus roseus Mitogen-activated protein kinase3 0aMitogen-activated protein kinases 0aNitric oxide 0aOctadecanoid-responsive Catharanthus AP2-domain3 0aCatharanthus roseus Peroxidase1 0aSalicylic acid 0aReactive oxygen species 0aStrictosidine synthase 0aTerpenoid indole alkaloids 0aTranscription factor1 aKarimi, Farah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3279-70881 aRazavi, Khadijeh0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Nov., v. 132 p.623-632dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245005800157300001600215520104600231592002801277650004401305650002301349650002801372650001401400650001001414650001601424650002001440650001101460650001301471650002101484650004401505650001001549650002001559650001501579650001401594650002601608650001601634700001901650700001501669700001701684700001401701700001801715773012201733856007401855852000901929655001201938IND60639804320221119145910.0190503e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063980432DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc02180d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jingyu10aReduction of lignin color via one-step UV irradiation  ap. 695-699.  aThe dark color of industrial lignin is the main obstacle for their high value-added use in areas such as sunscreen or dyestuff dispersants. Here, a one-step method for reducing the color of lignin is presented and the structural changes of the whitened lignin are characterized by UV, FTIR, NMR, GPC, DLS, AFM, HS-GC and potentiometric titration. The results show that the content of aromatic ring, methoxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the alkali lignin (AL) decreases, while the content of carboxylic groups increases when it is exposed to UV in THF. AL experiences a darkening process before it is gradually whitened. The blue shift of the UV spectrum and the decrease in size and molecular weight indicate AL is not only intermolecular and intramolecular disaggregated, but also partially depolymerized when light colored lignin is obtained. This simple but efficient whitening method is successfully practised in bleaching. The white degree of raw paper increases from 0.438 to 0.917 after being irradiated under sunshine for 3 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaromatic compounds 3aatomic force microscopy 3ableaching 3acolor 3adispersants 3agreen chemistry 3alignin 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apaper 3asolar radiation 3asunscreens 3atitration 3aultraviolet radiation 3avalue added1 aDeng, Yonghong1 aQian, Yong1 aQiu, Xueqing1 aRen, Yuan1 aYang, Dongjie0 tGreen chemistry.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 18, no. 3 p.695-699dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5gc02180d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245019000168500002200358520117900380592002801559650001101587650000901598650001501607650002901622650004101651650001901692650002501711650001701736650002701753650003701780650003301817650000901850650002001859650001101879650001401890650001801904651001001922653003001932653001701962653002601979653001902005653002002024700001702044700001702061700001402078773006802092856008402160852000902244655001202253IND60570644020221118060953.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057064402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiamei10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the water-SPM-sediment system from the middle reaches of Huai River, China: Distribution, partitioning, origin tracing and ecological risk assessment  aPre-press version  aThe polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations in the water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediment from the middle reaches of Huai River were analyzed by a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The mean concentrations for the sum of 16 PAHs (∑16 PAHs) in the water, SPM and sediment were 1204 ng/L, 3192 ng/g (dry weight; dw), and 7955 ng/g (dw), respectively. Along the vertical profiles of water columns, higher ∑16 PAHs levels were seen in surface and bottom water layers and co-located SPM. The PAHs distribution in water and SPM is found to be controlled by organic carbon. Based on the statistic correlations of the organic carbon normalized partition coefficients (lgKOC) and octanol-water partition coefficient (lgKOW), we observed that the calculated partition coefficients do not increase as large as that would be expected from the increase of hydrophobicity. The principal component analysis suggests that coal combustion and the petroleum refinery were the primary PAHs contributors in the studied water-SPM-sediment system. The high ecological risks of PAHs in studied system highlight the urgent needs for remedial actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenvironmental assessment 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrophobicity 3aoil and gas industry 3aparticulates 3apartition coefficients 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3aspectrometers 3aChina 0aWater-SPM-sediment system 0aDistribution 0aPartition coefficient 0aOrigin tracing 0aRisk assessment1 aLiu, Guijian1 aWang, Rujing1 aHuang, He0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006900171300002000240520172000260592002801980596006702008596004502075596003302120596004402153596004202197596003902239650003002278650002202308650002002330650001902350650001802369650001902387650001902406650001802425650002102443650002202464650001302486650001302499650001302512650002002525700001702545700002802562700002802590700002102618700002102639700005702660773015402717856008302871852000902954655001202963IND60776446920221118015943.0220506e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077644692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-17745-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoppola, Francesca14aThe influence of salinity on the toxicity of remediated seawater  ap. 32967-32987.  aMercury (Hg) is one of the most hazardous pollutants, due to its toxicity, biological magnification and worldwide persistence in aquatic systems. Thus, new efficient nanotechnologies (e.g. graphene oxide functionalized with polyethyleneimine (GO-PEI)) have been developed to remove this metal from the water. Aquatic environments, in particular transitional systems, are also subjected to disturbances resulting from climate change, such as salinity shifts. Salinity is one of the most relevant factors that influences the distribution and survival of aquatic species such as mussels. To our knowledge, no studies assessed the ecotoxicological impairments induced in marine organisms exposed to remediate seawater (RSW) under different salinity levels. For this, the focus of the present study was to evaluate the effects of seawater previously contaminated with Hg and remediated with GO-PEI, using the species Mytilus galloprovincialis, maintained at three different salinities (30, 20 and 40). The results obtained demonstrated similar histopathological and metabolic alterations, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in mussels under RSW treatment at stressful salinity conditions (20 and 40) in comparison to control salinity (30). On the other hand, the present findings revealed toxicological effects including cellular damage and histopathological impairments in mussels exposed to Hg contaminated seawater in comparison to non-contaminated ones, at each salinity level. Overall, these results confirm the high efficiency of GO-PEI to sorb Hg from water with no noticeable toxic effects even under different salinities, leading to consider it a promising eco-friendly approach to remediate contaminated water.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFRH/BD/118582/2016cfundação para a ciência e a tecnologia  aUIDB/50017/2020 + UIDP/50017/2020ccesam  aUID/QUI/50006/2013crequimte  aUIDB/00481/2020 + UIDP/00481/2020ctema  aPOCI-01-0145-FEDER- 028425cbispecial  aPTDC/NAN- MAT/30513/2017ch20value 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aaquatic organisms 3abioaccumulation 3aclimate change 3aecotoxicology 3agraphene oxide 3ahistopathology 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apolyethyleneimine 3aresearch 3asalinity 3aseawater 3awater pollution1 aRusso, Tania1 aSoares, Amadeu M.

Series of soil columns experiments were conducted for investigating the application effects of date palm biochar and compost on evaporation, moisture distribution, infiltration, sorptivity (Sp), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛₐₜ) and water holding capacity (WHC) at application rates of 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% (10, 20, 30 and 40 g kg⁻¹). The columns were filled manually with air-dried soil with 35 cm depth and the thickness of surface amended layer was 10 cm (T10) and 20 cm (T20) from soil surface at bulk density of 1400 kg m⁻³. The results showed that the behavior of soil moisture distribution was influenced by application of biochar, compost and biochar-compost mixture. Moreover, in the amended layer T10, applying biochar at rate of 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% reduced significantly cumulative evaporation by 5.8%, 10.8%, 12.8% and 16.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, the reduction for the biochar-compost mixture at application rates of 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% was 10%, 12.2%, 14.5% and 20%, respectively. In layer T20, applying biochar at rate of 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% reduced cumulative evaporation by 10.24%, 13.0%, 18.3% and 21.5% but this reduction amounted to 18.2%, 21%, 23% and 24% for the biochar-compost mixture, respectively. It was generally observed that the highest application rate (4%) for applied amendments was the most effective impact on Sp, Kₛₐₜ and WHC compared with other rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aair drying 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3abulk density 3acomposts 3aevaporation 3aloamy sand soils 3asandy soils 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil water 3awater holding capacity 0aDate palm waste biochar 0ainfiltration 0asorptivity 0aWHC1 aIbrahim, Alaa1 aAlharbi, Abdulaziz0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2019 Oct. 28, v. 50, no. 19 p.2442-2456dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.16673713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245010900180300001600289520129000305536054001595592002802135650001702163650001502180650002102195650001202216650001302228650001302241650002402254650002402278650001202302650001002314650001102324650001102335650001502346651001102361653001702372653001602389653001902405653002002424653001202444700001902456700003402475700002302509700003602532700003702568700003102605700002602636700002802662700002102690700001802711700003302729773013902762856008502901852000902986655001202995IND60746385420221116214333.0210803e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074638542DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2021.19432572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValese, Andressa Camargo10aQuantification of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Senecio brasiliensis, beehive pollen, and honey by LC-MS/MS  ap. 685-694.  aThis article presents the determination of eight pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) by LC-MS/MS in honeys, pollen, and Senecio brasiliensis (Asteraceae) samples, all from Santa Catarina state, Brazil. In addition, the Box-Behnken design was used to perform an optimized sample preparation on pollens and S. brasiliensis parts. Senecionine and its N-oxide, besides retrorsine N-oxide, were determined in six of the seven honeys samples. Pollen from species of the Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Boraginaceae families were found with greater predominance in three of the seven honeys samples. In these three honeys samples were also found the highest PAs levels. In beehive pollen, flower, and leaf of S. brasiliensis, the total levels of PAs and their N-oxides reached 221, 14.1 × 10⁴, and 14.8 × 10⁴ mg kg⁻¹, respectively. In honeys, these compounds are chemical contaminants and therefore undesirable when the sum exceeds 71 µg kg⁻¹, according to EFSA. On the other hand, although PAs are naturally present in plant and pollen of some species (Senecio, Crotalaria, Bacharis, Ecchium, Mimosa scabrella, Vernonia), it is important to monitor their levels in plants but also in honeys, and other beehive products since these compounds are transferred to the final product.  aThis study was financed in part by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnologico (CNPq) (No. 431881/2016-2).

Our results show that the sandstones are mainly lithic feldspathic, with clay content varying from 4.1 to 42.5 vol. % (average 13.7 vol. %). These sandstones have low contents of Na₂O, MgO, Al₂O₃, K₂O, CaO and TiO₂, with the average contents of 2.14 wt%, 0.78 wt%, 7.96 wt%, 2.11 wt%, 6.14 wt% and 0.15 wt%, respectively. The total content of major elements is < 30 wt%, indicating that the pore water was in an alkaline environment with high pressure, so that the decarboxylation reaction of the organic matter took place to generate a large amount of carbon dioxide with a loss of ¹³C. Consequently, the δ¹³C of the carbonate cement is negatively biased to − 6.4‰; the deep high temperature environment and the external fresh water leaching make the δ¹⁸O value of the carbonate cement gradually lose, reaching − 13.19‰, according to its precipitation temperature (78–108 °C) and pore water salinity (104–110), it is judged that carbonate cement is mainly formed in the middle diagenetic stage and early diagenetic stage. The rare earth elements are mainly authigenic by the results of ∑REE and Y/Ho, and the deposition characteristics of trace elements such as Zn, Th, U, Ni, Co, Cr, Sr/Cu, Ceₐₙₒₘ, Ce/La, ∑REE, Eu/Eu*, La/Yb, V/(V + Ni) and the transformation of later diagenesis, combining the characteristic of the global climate and the influence of uplifting of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, indicate that the lower Xiaganchaigou formation was in a dry, cold and anoxic reducing environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aY304RC1SGQcthe CAS Light of West China Program  a1308RJZA310cthe Nature Science Foundation of Gansu Province  a1309RTSA041cthe Key Laboratory Project of Gansu Province 3aEocene epoch 3aOligocene epoch 3abasins 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acement 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aclimate 3acold 3adecarboxylation 3adiagenesis 3afreshwater 3aorganic matter 3atectonics 3atemperature 3awater salinity 3aChina1 aSun, Guoqiang1 aWang, Yetong1 aWu, Jie1 aJiang, Yun1 aWang, Meng1 aLi, Jiasi0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2020 May, v. 79, no. 10 p.220-220dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-08969-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245008100205300001400286520169200300592002801992650001702020650001302037650001302050650002002063650001102083650001102094650001902105650001402124650001002138650001502148650001302163650001602176650001902192650001402211650002002225650003102245650002502276650002102301650001602322650001602338653001002354653001302364653000902377653001602386653001502402653001502417700001902432700001602451700001202467700001302479700001702492700001702509700001502526773012202541856008502663852000902748655001202757IND60618058020221118040024.0190410e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061805802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Hongju1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0196-504210aGenome duplication improves the resistance of watermelon root to salt stress  ap. 11-21.  aSalinity is a major abiotic stress factor that affects crop productivity. Roots play an important role in salt stress in plants. Watermelon is a salt-sensitive crop; however, tetraploid watermelon seedlings are more tolerant to salt stress than their homogenotype diploid ancestors. To obtain insights into the reasons underlying the differences in salt tolerance with respect to the ploidy of plants, self-grafted and cross-grafted diploid and tetraploid watermelon seedlings were exposed to 300 mM NaCl for 8 days. After the treatment, the tetraploid rootstock-grafted watermelon plants showed higher salt stress tolerance than the diploid plants. There were no significant differences in the physiological effects between the rootstocks with the same ploidy. The tetraploid rootstock-grafted watermelon plants exhibited higher net photosynthetic rate, leaf stomatal conductance and transpiration rate than the diploid rootstock-grafted watermelon plants throughout the salt treatment process. The activities of antioxidant enzymes and contents of osmoregulatory compounds in the roots were higher in the tetraploid rootstock-grafted watermelon plants than in the diploid plants during the entire salt response process. Higher Na+/K+ ratio was found in all parts of diploid rootstock-grafted watermelon, especially in the roots, K+ and Na+ were preferentially accumulated in the aerial parts (leaves and stem) than in the roots, which might be driven by the Na+/H+ antiporter, as evidenced by the higher transcript levels for SOS, PMA1, HKT1 and NHX1 in the roots. Taken together, our results suggest that genome duplication improves the resistance of watermelon root to salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial parts 3aancestry 3adiploidy 3aenzyme activity 3agenome 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3aroots 3arootstocks 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3asodium-hydrogen antiporter 3astomatal conductance 3astress tolerance 3atetraploidy 3awatermelons 0aGraft 0aIon flux 0aRoot 0aSalt stress 0aTetraploid 0aWatermelon1 aZhao, Shengjie1 aLu, Xuqiang1 aHe, Nan1 aGao, Lei1 aDou, Junling1 aBie, Zhilong1 aLiu, Wenge0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Dec., v. 133 p.11-21dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04181naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245007900155520324000234592002803474650001803502650003103520650002503551700002003576700001903596700001703615700002503632700002103657773011903678856007303797852000903870655001203879IND60660574620221121233748.0190823e20190727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066057462DNAL7 a10.3390/w110815562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chang 10aHydrodynamic Features of an Undular Bore Traveling on a 1:20 Sloping Beach  aThe hydrodynamic characteristics, including local and convective accelerations as well as pressure gradient in the horizontal direction, of the external stream of an undular bore propagating on a 1:20 sloping beach are experimentally studied. A bore with the water depth ratio of 1.70 was generated downstream of a suddenly lifted gate. A high-speed particle image velocimetry was employed to measure the velocity fields during the run-up and run-down motions. The time series of free surface elevation and velocity field/profile of the generated bore, comprising a pure bore accompanied by a series of dispersive leading waves, are first demonstrated. Based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) techniques, the free surface elevation of leading waves and the counterpart of pure bore are acquired separately at a specified measuring section (SMS), together with the uniform horizontal velocity of the pure bore. The effect of leading-wave-induced velocity shift on the velocity profiles of the generated bore are then evaluated at the SMS. To understand the calculation procedure of accelerations and pressure gradient, three tabulated forms are provided as illustrative examples. Accordingly, the relationships among the partially depth-averaged values of the non-dimensional local acceleration, convective acceleration, total acceleration and pressure gradient of the generated/pure bore acquired at the SMS versus the non-dimensional time are elucidated. The trends in the non-dimensional accelerations and pressure gradient of the external stream of generated bore are compared with those of the pure bore. During the run-up motion from the instant of arrival of the bore front to the moment of the peak level at the SMS, continuous decrease in the onshore uniform horizontal velocity, and successive deceleration of the pure bore in the onshore direction are evidenced, exhibiting the pure bore under the adverse pressure gradient with decreasing magnitude. However, the pure bore once ridden by the leading waves is decelerated/accelerated spatially and accelerated/decelerated temporally in the onshore direction during the rising/descending free surface of each leading wave. This fact highlights the effect of pre-passing/post-passing of the leading wave crest on the velocity distribution of generated bore. It is also found that, although the leading waves have minor contribution on the power spectrum of the free surface elevation as compared with that of the pure bore, the leading waves do play an important role on the magnitudes of both accelerations and pressure gradient. The largest magnitude of the acceleration contributed by the leading waves is around 26 times the counterpart contributed by the pure bore. Further, during the run-down motion right after the moment for the peak level of the bore, a linear increase in the magnitude of the offshore uniform horizontal velocity and a constant local acceleration with increasing time are both identified. The partially depth-averaged value of the non-dimensional pressure gradient is equal to a small negative constant (&minus;0.0115) in the offshore direction, indicating that the bore is subject to a constant favorable pressure gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3aparticle image velocimetry 3atime series analysis1 aWong, Wei-Ying 1 aKao, Ming-Jer 1 aYang, James 1 aRaikar, Rajkumar  V.1 aYuan, Juan-Ming 0 tWater.g2019 July 27, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110815563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008800169300001600257520099400273592002801267650004401295650001201339650001401351650002201365650002201387650001901409650001401428650000701442650001501449650001601464700001601480700001801496700001801514700001601532700002001548773009601568856008501664852000901749655001201758IND60087949220221120232938.0141102e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008794922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xinliang12aA kinetic model for oxidative degradation of bagasse pulp fiber by sodium periodate  ap. 218-223.  aIn this paper, some key parameters, such as the system pH, the periodate concentration, and the reaction temperature, on the influence of the bagasse fiber degradation were studied based on the oxygenant of periodate. And the feasible reaction mechanism was also discussed through the FTIR characterization for bagasse fiber before and after the oxidizing reaction. As the results shown, the crystallinity of bagasse fiber decreased with the oxidation level increasing. It was interesting that the aldehyde content of the reaction system rose gradually along with cellulose degradation. Based on this result, the selective oxidation kinetics was constructed by introducing of variable factor R (the ratio of aldehyde content to the degradation of cellulose fiber), and the results shown that there was a better correlation between the dynamic model and the experimental data, so the oxidation degree of bagasse fiber oxidized by periodate can be quantitative evaluated based on this model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abagasse 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3acrystal structure 3adynamic models 3aoxidation 3apH 3apulp fiber 3atemperature1 aWang, Lijun1 aSong, Xueping1 aSong, Hainong1 aZhao, Joe R1 aWang, Shuangfei0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 90, no. 1 p.218-223dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245009200188300001600280500001500296520095800311592002801269650002201297650001501319650001201334650002001346650003901366650000901405650001701414650002101431650001201452650007201464650002401536650003001560650002501590650002501615650002201640650002201662650008001684650002401764650002201788651001201810651001301822653003901835700002401874700002701898700002601925700003301951773009701984856004802081852000902129655001202138IND4469598020221121220618.0121003e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446959802DNAL7 a216145412pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2468-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolstenkov, Oleg O.14aThe neuro-muscular system in fresh-water furcocercaria from Belarus.

Consequently, its use in coal-fired thermoelectric for power production generates a lot of waste. The construction sector is the largest consumer of coal ash, but it cannot absorb the entire amount generated. Thus, other applications for coal ash should be studied in aim to optimize the use of this industrial waste. This research had as focus to synthesize potassic zeolite from of the coal ash into on potassium fertilizer for the grown wheat plant. In this work, it was used a subbituminous coal from Mina do Leão (RS, Brazil) presenting 48.7% ash content on a dry basis. Concerning the synthesis of potassic zeolite, it was adopted the conventional method of hydrothermal treatment with potassium hydroxide. A schedule of experiments was conducted in order to define the optimum condition of zeolite synthesis that was then used an alkaline solution of 5M KOH with a reaction time of 24h at 150°C. According to this procedure, it was obtained a zeolite with a single crystalline phase, identified through X-ray diffraction as Merlinoite. Subsequently, it was performed a set of tests using potassic zeolite asa fertilizer for plants in a greenhouse. The synthesized potassic zeolite showed a good potential for its use as fertilizer in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aash content 3acoal 3agreenhouses 3ahot water treatment 3aindustrial wastes 3apotassium fertilizers 3apotassium hydroxide 3awaste management 3awheat 3azeolites 3aBrazil 0aPotassic zeolites 0aCoal ash 0aFertilizer 0aAgriculture1 aSchneider, Helena1 aMarcilio, Nilson Romeu1 aFerret, Lizete1 aOliveira, João Carlos Pinto0 tWaste management.g2017 Dec., v. 70 p.263-271dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245013500163520148600298592002801784650004401812650001401856650001701870650000901887650001301896650001801909650001301927650001901940650002401959650001201983650003101995650001602026653002602042653001602068653001902084653001702103653002702120653001902147700005802166700001302224700001702237700005402254773010202308856008602410852000902496655001202505IND60778548120221119031205.0220621e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077854812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1078242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jie10aDevelopment of soy protein isolate emulsion gels as extrusion-based 3D food printing inks: Effect of polysaccharides incorporation  aSoy protein isolate (SPI) emulsion gel inks with polysaccharides of guar gum (GG) or xanthan gum (XG) for extrusion-based three-dimensional (3D) printing were investigated. The effects of the polysaccharide type and concentration on the printability, rheological properties, and microstructure of inks were discussed. Results indicated that the 3D printed products of SPI-GG₀.₅ inks demonstrated low dimensional printing deviation with great self-supporting capability and smooth and slightly flawed surface texture, while SPI-XG₀.₅ inks had the highest hardness and rough surface texture. The results of small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) test proved that SPI-XG₀.₅ inks exhibited the maximal gel strength, providing its 3D printed products with highest hardness. Secondary loops of Lissajous plots wouldn't emerge in SPI-XG₀.₅ inks, indicating decreased network flexibility and slightly larger dimensional printing deviation. The microstructure and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis suggested the interaction of SPI with XG was stronger than that of GG due to hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. When the XG concentration reached 0.5%, the network structure of the inks was changed, resulting in a rough surface texture of the 3D printed product. There are few studies on 3D printing of SPI emulsion gels, and this research offers more possibilities for the development of 3D printing inks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aemulsions 3agel strength 3agels 3aguar gum 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen 3amicrostructure 3asoy protein isolate 3atexture 3athree-dimensional printing 3axanthan gum 0aSPI emulsion gel inks 0a3D printing 0aPolysaccharide 0aPrintability 0aRheological properties 0aMicrostructure1 aWang, Xue-ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8583-53191 aLi, Dong1 aWang, Li-jun1 aWang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3744-912X0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Oct., v. 131 p.107824-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1078243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001900166245005700185300001600242520193700258592002802195650002502223650001902248650002202267650001202289650001502301650001302316650002302329650004902352650005502401650002202456650003802478650003702516700001702553700003202570773010202602856008302704852000902787655001202796IND4457282920221121220711.0141111e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445728292DNAL7 a211126662pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2010.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFavre, Patrick10aAccession-dependent action potentials in Arabidopsis  ap. 653-660.  aPlant excitability, as measured by the appearance and circulation of action potentials (APs) after biotic and abiotic stress treatments, is a far lesser and more versatile phenomenon than in animals. To examine the genetic basis of plant excitability we used different Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. APs were induced by wounding (W) with a subsequent deposition (D) of 5μL of 1M KCl onto adult leaves. This treatment elicited transient voltage responses (APs) that were detected by 2 extracellular electrodes placed at a distance from the wounding location over an experimental time of 150min. The first electrode (e1) was placed at the end of the petiole and the beginning of the leaf, and the second (e2) electrode was placed on the petiole near the center of the rosette. All accessions (Columbia (Col), Wassilewskija (Ws) and Landsberg erecta (Ler)) responded to the W & D treatment. After W & D treatment was performed on 100 plants for each accession, the number of APs ranged from 0 to 37 (median 8, total 940), 0 to 16 (median 5, total 528) and 0 to 18 (median 2, total 296) in Col, Ws and Ler, respectively. Responding plants (>0 APs) showed significantly different behaviors depending on their accessions of origin (i.e., Col 91, Ws 83 and Ler 76%). Some AP characteristics, such as amplitude and speed of propagation from e1 to e2 (1.28mms⁻¹), were the same for all accessions, whereas the average duration of APs was similar in Col and Ws, but different in Ler. Self-sustained oscillations were observed more frequently in Col than Ws and least often in Ler, and the mean oscillation frequency was more rapid in Col, followed by Ws, and was slowest in Ler. In general, Col was the most excitable accession, followed by Ws, and Ler was the least excitable; this corresponded well with voltage elicited action potentials. In conclusion, part of Arabidopsis excitability in AP responses is genetically pre-determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabiotic stress 3aaction potentials 3aanimals 3aelectrodes 3apetioles 3apotassium chloride 2aAction Potentialsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aElectrophysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aPotassium Chloridexpharmacology1 aGreppin, H.,1 aDegli Agosti, R.q(Robert),0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2011 May 1, v. 168, no. 7 p.653-660dElsevier GmbHx0176-16177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2010.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013100158300001800289520153400307592002801841650002201869650000801891650001901899650001301918650001101931650001401942650001101956650001701967650002201984650002002006650001302026650001102039650001102050650001102061650001502072650001502087650001702102650001402119650001602133650001202149650003702161700002802198700001602226700001502242700002002257700001602277700001902293773012502312856007402437852000902511655001202520IND60639804820221119145838.0190503e20160329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063980482DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc02188j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerenguer, A.10aEvaluation of transition metal phosphides supported on ordered mesoporous materials as catalysts for phenol hydrodeoxygenation  ap. 1938-1951.  aA series of transition metal phosphides (Ni₂P, Co₂P and MoP) have been synthesized by temperature programmed reduction of the corresponding metal phosphate precursors loaded over mesostructured Al-SBA-15, mesoporous γ-Al₂O₃ (m-Al₂O₃) and ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3). Both the dispersion and metal phosphide phases attained are strongly influenced by the support features, such as their acidic and textural properties. XRD, TEM and H₂ chemisorption results revealed that the MoP phase was probably formed but it underwent a fast re-oxidation in air. On the other hand, metal phosphide formation was hindered over m-Al₂O₃ as only metallic Ni and Co were detected. All the materials prepared have been evaluated as catalysts in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) using phenol as a bio-oil model compound. The highest phenol conversions were attained with the catalysts based on the acidic supports (Al-SBA-15 and m-Al₂O₃). Nevertheless, Co₂P/Al-SBA-15, Ni₂P/m-Al₂O₃ and Co₂P/m-Al₂O₃ yielded cyclohexanol as the main product denoting very low HDO efficiency. In contrast, Ni₂P/Al-SBA-15 showed remarkable catalytic properties, being the only catalyst that provided almost full phenol conversion and extremely high HDO efficiency, with cyclohexane selectivity higher than 90%.

The effects of proportion (5%, 15%, 30%), compost type (sewage sludge (SS), tomato stem waste (TSW), municipal solid waste (MSW), kitchen waste (KW), cabbage waste (CW), peat (P), chicken manure (CM), dairy cattle manure (DCM)) and the black soil (CK). Their initial biochemical composition (carbon, nitrogen, C:N ratio) on carbon (C) mineralization in soil amended compost have been investigated. The CO2-C production of different treatments were measured to indicate the levels of carbon (C) mineralization during 50d of laboratory incubation. And the one order E model (M1E) was used to quantify C mineralization kinetics. The results demonstrated that the respiration and C mineralization of soil were promoted by amending composts. The C mineralization ability increased when the percentage of compost added to the soil also increased and affected by compost type in the order CM>KW, CW>SS, DCM, TSW>MSW, P>CK at the same amended level. Based on the values of C0 and k1 from M1E model, a management method in agronomic application of compost products to the precise fertilization was proposed. The SS, DCM and TSW composts were more suitable in supplying fertilizer to the plant. Otherwise, The P and MSW composts can serve the purpose of long-term nutrient retention, whereas the CW and KW composts could be used as soil remediation agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeat 3asoil organic carbon 3adairy manure 3aMSW composts 3awaste management 3atomatoes 3acabbage 3amineralization 3asoil quality 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3anutrient retention 3apoultry manure 3aclimate change 3asoil 3asoil remediation 3anitrogen 3asewage sludge 3akitchen waste 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 0aMineralization kinetic 0acarbon 0aAmended soil 0aOrganic waste compost 0aCarbon mineralization1 aZhao, Yue1 aZhu, Longji1 aCui, Hongyang1 aJia, Liming1 aXie, Xinyu1 aLi, Jiming1 aWei, Zimin0 tWaste management.g2017 Dec., v. 70 p.30-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010300167300001600270520199900286592002802285650001602313650002902329650001102358650001102369650002202380650000902402650001602411650002902427650001502456650001702471650002202488650002302510650001102533650001102544650001502555650001102570651001002581653000902591653001002600653003002610653001502640653003202655653001002687700001202697700001702709700001602726700001602742700001402758773008902772856008402861852000902945655001202954IND60570644520221118061038.0170708e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057064452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.06.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Qingyu10aSpatio-temporal variability of particulate matter in the key part of Gansu Province, Western China  ap. 189-198.  aTo investigate the spatial and temporal behaviors of particulate matter in Lanzhou, Jinchang and Jiayuguan during 2014, the hourly concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were collected from the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) in this study. The analysis indicated that the mean annual PM10 (PM2.5) concentrations during 2014 were 115 ± 52 μg/m3 (57 ± 28 μg/m3), 104 ± 75 μg/m3 (38 ± 22 μg/m3) and 114 ± 72 μg/m3 (32 ± 17 μg/m3) in Lanzhou, Jinchang and Jiayuguan, respectively, all of which exceeded the Chinese national ambient air quality II standards for PM. Higher values for both PM fractions were generally observed in spring and winter, and lower concentrations were found in summer and autumn. Besides, the trend of seasonal variation of particulate matter (PM) in each city monitoring site is consistent with the average of the corresponding cities. Anthropogenic activities along with the boundary layer height and wind scale contributed to diurnal variations in PM that varied bimodally (Lanzhou and Jinchang) or unimodally (Jiayuguan). With the arrival of dust events, the PM10 concentrations changed dramatically, and the PM10 concentrations during dust storm events were, respectively, 19, 43 and 17 times higher than the levels before dust events in Lanzhou, Jinchang and Jiayuguan. The ratios (PM2.5/PM10) were lowest, while the correlations were highest, indicating that dust events contributed more coarse than fine particles, and the sources of PM are similar during dust storms. The relationships between local meteorological parameters and PM concentrations suggest a clear association between the highest PM concentrations, with T ≤ 7 °C, and strong winds (3–4 scale). However, the effect of relative humidity is complicated, with more PM10 and PM2.5 exceedances being registered with a relative humidity of less than 40% and 40–60% in Lanzhou, while higher exceedances in Jinchang appeared at a relative humidity of 80–100%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aanthropogenic activities 3aautumn 3acities 3adiurnal variation 3adust 3adust storms 3aenvironmental protection 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3arelative humidity 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awind speed 3awinter 3aChina 0aPM10 0aPM2.5 0aSpatio-temporal variation 0aDust storm 0aThe Silk Road Economic Belt 0aChina1 aCai, Ao1 aWang, Feifei1 aYang, Liqin1 aXu, Chuanqi1 aLiu, Zeyu0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Nov., v. 230 p.189-198dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.06.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245023400200300001600434520105300450592002801503650002601531650001101557650001301568650001901581650001801600650001201618650002901630650001301659650001301672650003701685650001501722653002901737653002101766653002701787653000801814653002601822700005701848700005701905700005701962773013702019856007602156852000902232655001202241IND60615556920221118222206.0181011e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061555692DNAL7 a10.4001/003.026.05222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassal, T.T.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3628-593610aInsect Juvenoids: Structural Qualifications and Structure-Activity Relationships of Alkylphenoxy-Substituted Terpenes as Insect Growth Disruptors Against Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) – Revisited†  ap. 522-535.  aInsect growth disruptors of the aryl terpenoid ether type including 185 compounds derived from 10 basic olefinic, epoxidised and alkoxidised type-structures were tested against the prepupae of the Mediterranean brocade, Spodoptera littoralis. The potent decenyl compounds are mainly derivatives of 4,8-dimethyl-3,7-decadiene and the epoxides of its external olefinic bond. The potent nonenyl compounds are mainly derivatives of either 4,8-dimethyl-3,7-nonadiene and the epoxides of its external olefinic bond or 3,7-dimethyl 6,7-epoxy-2-nonene. The phenyl group of the potent compounds have either methylenedioxy (3,4-), ethyl or methyl groups (4- or 3-). The presence of an alkoxy group on the terpenoid side chain, and/or the phenyl group does not lead to formation of a potent compound. The addition of one terminal carbon atom to some nonenyl derivatives leads to activity in the resulting decenyl compound. Continuing studies on synthetic juvenile hormone analogues may provide novel potent compounds for more benign insect control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3acarbon 3aepoxides 3ainsect control 3ainsect growth 3ainsects 3ajuvenile hormone analogs 3amoieties 3aprepupae 3astructure-activity relationships 3aterpenoids 0ainsect growth disruptors 0aphenoxy terpenes 0abiorational pesticides 0aSAR 0aSpodoptera littoralis1 aShaaban, M.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3013-18481 aMohamed, A.A.1https://orcid.org/0000/0003-2788-55341 aAlmadiy, A.A.1https://orcid.org/0000/0003-4892-14770 tAfrican entomology.g2018 Sept., v. 26, no. 2 p.522-535dEntomological Society of Southern AfricawJournal:jnl50015x1021-35897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4001/003.026.05223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010300157300001800260520073300278592002801011650001401039650002001053650001601073650002101089650001701110650001101127650002001138650001401158650001301172650002401185650002101209650001401230650001901244700001801263700002401281700002101305700015001326700003001476700001701506700002101523700002001544700002401564700003301588773012501621856007401746852000901820655001201829IND60639805120221119145847.0190503e20160316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063980512DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc02196k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeljo, Pekka10aAll-vanadium dual circuit redox flow battery for renewable hydrogen generation and desulfurisation  ap. 1785-1797.  aAn all-vanadium dual circuit redox flow battery is an electrochemical energy storage system able to function as a conventional battery, but also to produce hydrogen and perform desulfurization when a surplus of electricity is available by chemical discharge of the battery electrolytes. The hydrogen reactor chemically discharging the negative electrolyte has been designed and scaled up to kW scale, while different options to discharge the positive electrolyte have been evaluated, including oxidation of hydrazine, SO₂ and H₂S.

Robin10aNumerical Investigation of a Hydropower Tunnel: Estimating Localised Head-Loss Using the Manning Equation  aThe fluid dynamics within a water tunnel is investigated numerically using a RANS approach with the k- &epsilon; turbulence model. The computational model is based on a laser scan of a hydropower tunnel located in G&auml;vunda, Sweden. The tunnel has a typical height of 6.9 m and a width of 7.2 m. While the average cross-sectional shape of the tunnel is smooth the local deviations are significant, where some roughness elements may be in the size of 5 m implying a large variation of the hydraulic radius. The results indicate that the Manning equation can successfully be used to study the localised pressure variations by taking into account the varying hydraulic radius and cross-sectional area of the tunnel. This indicates a dominant effect of the tunnel roughness in connection with the flow, which has the potential to be used in the future evaluation of tunnel durability. ANSYS-CFX was used for the simulations along with ICEM-CFD for building the mesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3adurability 3aequations 3amodels 3aroughness 3aturbulent flow 3awater power 3aSweden1 aHellström, J.

It acts either through distinct signaling pathways or in concert with other growth hormones. Its biological functions are adjusted by modulating biosynthesis, conjugate formation, and polar transport and distribution. Several tryptophan-dependent and -independent auxin biosynthetic pathways have been proposed. Recent studies have shown that a few flavin monooxygenase enzymes contribute to the tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Here, we show that activation of a flavin monooxygenase gene YUCCA7 (YUC7), which belongs to the tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthetic pathway, enhances drought resistance. An Arabidopsis activation-tagged mutant yuc7-1D exhibited phenotypic changes similar to those observed in auxin-overproducing mutants, such as tall, slender stems and curled, narrow leaves. Accordingly, endogenous levels of total auxin were elevated in the mutant. The YUC7 gene was induced by drought, primarily in the roots, in an abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent manner. The yuc7-1D mutant was resistant to drought, and drought-responsive genes, such as RESPONSIVE TO DESSICATION 29A (RD29A) and COLD-REGULATED 15A (COR15A), were up-regulated in the mutant. Interestingly, whereas stomatal aperture and production of osmoprotectants were not discernibly altered, lateral root growth was significantly promoted in the yuc7-1D mutant when grown under drought conditions. These observations support that elevation of auxin levels in the roots enhances drought resistance possibly by promoting root growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3aauxins 3abiochemical pathways 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenes 3aleaves 3amutants 3aplant development 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asomatotropin 3astems 3astomatal movement 2aAcclimatizationxgenetics 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDroughts 2aFlavinsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxmetabolism 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & development 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aTranscriptional Activation 2aWaterxmetabolism1 aChŏng, Chae-hun,1 aHan, Doo-Yeol1 aSeo, Pil Joon1 aPark, Woong June1 aPark, Chung-Mo0 tPlanta.g2012 May, v. 235, no. 5 p.923-938dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-011-1552-3  aDNAL 7aarticle01508naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245004100164520068100205592002800886650001300914650001200927650001600939650001100955650001100966650002100977700001900998773011901017856007301136852000901209655001201218IND60660575320221122123208.0190823e20190729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066057532DNAL7 a10.3390/w110815632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorillo, Francesco 10aHydraulic Behavior of Karst Aquifers  aThe objective of this Special Issue, &ldquo;Hydraulic Behavior of Karst Aquifers&rdquo;, is to focus on recent advances in karst hydrogeology in different areas of the world, focusing on topics dealing with the peculiar characteristics of karst aquifers.

Porcine orthorubulavirus (PRV) is the etiological agent, and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) is characterized as the best antigen for serological tests, although other structural proteins, including the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix (M) protein, have been investigated during the infection of members of the Paramyxoviridae family, generating promising results. Herein, for the first time, we successfully produced and characterized both the NP and M proteins of PRV by using a recombinant strategy in the E. coli heterologous system. The ORF of the NP and M genes were cloned in-frame with the pET-SUMO expression vector. Recombinant proteins proved to be a sensitive target to detect seroconversion at 7 days until 28 days in vaccinated mice (BALB/c) by indirect ELISAs. Immunoreactivity was also tested using porcine serum samples, in which antibodies were recognized from early stages to a persistence of PRV infection, which is indicative that these proteins contain properties similar to native antigens. The predicted tertiary structure showed that both proteins have a conserved structure that resembles those found in others Paramyxovirus. Our results pave the way for developing biotechnological tools based on these proteins for the control and prevention of BED.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPorcine orthorubulavirus 3aRespirovirus 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aetiological agents 3aeye diseases 3agenetic vectors 3aimmune response 3anucleoproteins 3apork industry 3aprediction 3aseroconversion 3aswine 3aMexico1 aCerriteño-Sánchez, José Luis1 aMendoza-Elvira, Susana 1 aGarcía-Cambrón, José Bryan1 aCastañeda-Montes, María Azucena1 aPérez-Aguilar, José Manuel1 aCuevas-Romero, Julieta Sandra0 tViruses.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140919463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245008800168300001800256520174200274592002802016650001202044650001402056650002202070650001302092650002302105650001902128650002302147650001502170650000902185650001602194650001302210650001702223700001902240700001902259773012102278856008202399852000902481655001202490IND60560082420221121033808.0161220e20150611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056008242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b010922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenner, Steven
W.10aSimulation Study of Hydrophobically Modified Chitosan as an Oil Dispersant Additive  ap. 6979-6990.  aHydrophobically modified chitosan (HMC) is being considered as a possible oil dispersant additive to reduce the volume of dispersant required in oil spill remediation. We present the results of discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations intended to determine how the HMC architecture affects its ability to prevent oil aggregation. The HMCs have a comb copolymer architecture with hydrophobic side chains (modification chains) of various lengths (5–15 spheres) to represent alkane chains that are attached to the chitosan backbone. We calculated the oil’s solvent accessible surface area (SASA), aggregate size distribution, and aggregate asymmetry at various values of the HMC modification chain length, modification density, and concentration to determine HMC efficacy. HMCs with long modification chains result in larger oil SASA than HMCs with short modification chains. For long modification chains, there is no increase in oil SASA with increasing modification density above a saturation value. The size distribution of the oil aggregates depends on the modification chain length; systems with long modification chains lead to large aspherical aggregates, while systems with short modification chains lead to small tightly packed aggregates. A parametric analysis reveals that the most important factor in determining the ability of HMCs to prevent oil aggregation is the interaction between the HMC’s modification chains and the oil molecules, even when using short modification chains. We conclude that HMCs with long modification chains are likely to be more effective at preventing oil aggregation than HMCs with short modification chains, and that long modification chains impede spherical oil droplet formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aasymmetry 3achemical elements 3achitosan 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular dynamics 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aremediation 3asolvents 3asurface area1 aJohn, Vijay T.1 aHall, Carol K.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 June 11, v. 119, no. 23 p.6979-6990dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b010923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001900191245007300210300001600283520115800299592002801457650001901485650001801504650001701522650001101539650001401550650001401564650001401578650001801592650001101610650002801621650002901649650002301678650002601701650002401727650003601751700001801787700002301805773009801828856008401926990002302010852000902033655001202042IND60092110220221122225155.0141103e20120828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009211022DNAL7 a223067022pmid7 aPMC32853982pmcid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2012.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarang, Shikha10aMucins and Toll-like receptors: Kith and kin in infection and cancer  ap. 110-119.  aInflammation is underlying biological phenomenon common in infection and cancer. Mucins are glycoproteins which establish a physical barrier for undesirable entry of foreign materials through epithelial surfaces. A deregulated expression and an anomalous glycosylation pattern of mucins are known in large number of cancers. TLRs are class of receptors which recognize the molecular patterns of invading pathogens and activate complex inflammatory pathways to clear them. Aberrant expression of TLRs is observed in many cancers. A highly orchestrated action of mucins and TLRs is well evolved host defence mechanism; however, a link between the two in other non-infectious conditions has received less attention. Here we present an overview as to how mucins and TLRs give protection to the host and are deregulated during carcinogenesis. Further, we propose the possible mechanisms of cross-regulation between them in pathogenesis of cancer. As both mucins and TLRs are therapeutically important class of molecules, an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms connecting the two will open new avenues for the therapeutic targeting of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3aglycosylation 3ainflammation 3amucins 3aneoplasms 3apathogens 3areceptors 2aGlycosylation 2aHumans 2aInfectionsxmetabolism. 2aInflammationxmetabolism 2aMucinsxmetabolism 2aNeoplasmsxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aToll-Like Receptorsxphysiology1 aKumar, Sushil1 aBatra, Surinder K.0 tCancer letters.g2012 Aug. 28, v. 321, no. 2 p.110-119dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2012.01.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003500152245017100187506011700358506007600475520143200551592002801983506003702011650002002048650001802068650001602086650001102102650001502113650001402128650001602142650001802158650001102176650001802187650001502205650001602220650001702236650002302253650001402276650001802290650002902308650002602337650001602363650001102379653002602390653000902416653001802425653001302443653001502456653002502471700002502496700002602521700002002547700003302567700002702600700001602627773009802643856008702741852000902828655001202837IND60777831920221207133608.0220621e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077783192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1113262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalma, Carolina Falcato Fialho10aMetabolic changes in cucumber leaves are enhanced by blue light but differentially affected by UV interactions with light signalling pathways in the visible spectrum.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUltraviolet radiation (UV, 280–400 nm) as an environmental signal triggers metabolic acclimatory responses. However, how different light qualities affect UV acclimation during growth is poorly understood. Here, cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus) were grown under blue, green, red, or white light in combination with UV. Their effects on leaf metabolites were determined using untargeted metabolomics. Blue and white growth light triggered increased levels of compounds related to primary and secondary metabolism, including amino acids, phenolics, hormones, and compounds related to sugar metabolism and the TCA cycle. In contrast, supplementary UV in a blue or white light background decreased leaf content of amino acids, phenolics, sugars, and TCA-related compounds, without affecting abscisic acid, auxin, zeatin, or jasmonic acid levels. However, in plants grown under green light, UV induced increased levels of phenolics, hormones (auxin, zeatin, dihydrozeatin-7-N-dihydrozeatin, jasmonic acid), amino acids, sugars, and TCA cycle-related compounds. Plants grown under red light with UV mainly showed decreased sugar content. These findings highlight the importance of the blue light component for metabolite accumulation. Also, data on interactions of UV with green light on the one hand, and blue or white light on the other, further contributes to our understanding of light quality regulation of plant metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucumis sativus 3aabscisic acid 3aacclimation 3aauxins 3ablue light 3acucumbers 3agreen light 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3alight quality 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aphenolic compounds 3ared light 3asugar content 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aultraviolet radiation 3awhite light 3azeatin 0aUltraviolet radiation 0aLEDs 0aLight quality 0aCucumber 0aMetabolome 0aMetabolic regulation1 aCastro-Alves, Victor1 aMorales, Luis Orlando1 aRosenqvist, Eva1 aOttosen, C.-O.q(Carl-Otto),1 aHyötyläinen, Tuulia,1 aStrid, Åke0 tPlant science.g2022 Aug., v. 321 p.111326-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1113263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245014400169300001400313520174400327592002802071650002802099650001602127650001302143650000902156650001202165650001202177650001102189650001902200650001802219650001302237650001102250650002002261651001802281653000902299653002802308653001902336700002102355700002402376773009402400856008002494852000902574655001202583IND60691366420200616000000.0200429e20090301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069136642DNAL7 a10.2752/175303708X3904642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Stephen C.10aComparison of the Effect of Human Interaction, Animal-Assisted Therapy, and AIBO-Assisted Therapy on Long-Term Care Residents with Dementia  ap. 43-57.  aThe number of elderly people in the United States is projected to more than double to 80 million by the year 2050, which will likely result in an increased incidence of dementia. Although AAT programs have been instituted as therapeutic activities for residents of long-term care facilities, there is little research documenting their effectiveness, especially in patients with dementia, who have difficulty maintaining contact with the external world. In addition, some long-term care facilities may be reluctant to include AAT in their facilities due to concerns about infection, injury, animal care, or cleanliness. The use of Sony's computerized, or robotic, “pet” called AIBO, may be a means of stimulating social interaction in residents with dementia without the drawbacks associated with live animal visitation. This study compares the effects of visitation by a person, a person accompanied by a live dog, and a person accompanied by an AIBO, on behavioral indicators of social interaction among female nursing home residents with dementia. All three types of visits stimulated residents to initiate conversation, touches, and looks at other individuals (human, dog, and AIBO) and provided contacts with the outside world. Both the live dog and AIBO stimulated resident social interaction beyond that stimulated by the visitor alone. The AIBO induced longer looks and more resident-initiated conversation than the live dog and provided a positive source of social interaction. While all three types of visits stimulated nursing home resident social interaction, the success of the robotic dog in stimulating social interaction by dementia residents suggests that it may provide a viable alternative to live animal visitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal assisted therapy 3aanimal care 3adementia 3adogs 3aelderly 3afemales 3ahumans 3along term care 3anursing homes 3apatients 3arobots 3asocial behavior 3aUnited States 0aAIBO 0aanimal-assisted therapy 0along-term care1 aFriedmann, Erika1 aBernstein, Penny L.0 tAnthrozoös.g2009 Mar. 1, v. 22, no. 1 p.43-57dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/175303708X3904643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245010200182520139900284592002801683650001801711650001801729650001501747650001701762650001601779650001301795650001201808650000901820650001501829650001101844650002101855650001301876650001501889650002601904650002001930650001801950650002901968653001801997653001602015653001502031653001302046653001702059653002602076700002002102700002002122700002002142700001902162700001902181700002602200700002302226773009802249856008702347852000902434655001202443IND60777832020221122144705.0220621e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077783202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1113272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastander-Olarieta, Ander10aThermopriming-associated proteome and sugar content responses in Pinus radiata embryogenic tissue  aImproving the capacity of plants to face adverse environmental conditions requires a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing stress response and adaptation. Proteomics, combined with metabolic analyses, offers a wide resource of information to be used in plant breeding programs. Previous studies have shown that somatic embryogenesis in Pinus spp. is a suitable tool not only to investigate stress response processes but also to modulate the behaviour of somatic plants. Based on this, the objective of this study was to analyse the protein and soluble sugar profiles of Pinus radiata embryonal masses after the application of high temperatures to unravel the mechanisms involved in thermopriming and memory acquisition at early stages of the somatic embryogenesis process. Results confirmed that heat provokes deep readjustments in the life cycle of proteins, together with a significant reduction in the carbon-flux of central-metabolism pathways. Heat-priming also promotes the accumulation of proteins involved in oxidative stress defence, in the synthesis of specific amino acids such as isoleucine, influences cell division, the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell-walls, and modifies the levels of free soluble sugars like glucose or fructose. All this seems to be regulated by proteins linked with epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus radiata 3acell division 3acell walls 3acytoskeleton 3aepigenetics 3afructose 3aglucose 3aheat 3aisoleucine 3amemory 3aoxidative stress 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asomatic embryogenesis 3astress response 3asugar content 3atranscription (genetics) 0aCarbohydrates 0aHeat stress 0aMetabolism 0aProteins 0aRadiata pine 0aSomatic embryogenesis1 aPereira, Cátia1 aMendes, Vera M.1 aCorreia, Sandra1 aManadas, Bruno1 aCanhoto, Jorge1 aMontalbán, Itziar A.1 aMoncaleán, Paloma0 tPlant science.g2022 Aug., v. 321 p.111327-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1113273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007100173520060000244592002800844653001100872653002300883653002700906653001300933700002300946700002100969700002100990773010201011856008501113852000901198655001201207IND60754514120221120125101.0220118e20220119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075451412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1534962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamkian, Adrian E.10aSome unusual transformations of a highly reactive α-bromocaranone  aThe facile synthesis of a highly reactive α-bromocaranone from (+)-carene is reported.

Water-stable MOFs are green and recyclable materials to eliminate the environmental impacts caused by the hazardous heavy metal ions and radionuclides in water. This paper presents a systematical review on the current status of water-stable MOFs that capture and convert a wide range of heavy metal ions (e.g., As(III)/As(V), Pb(II), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Cr(III)/Cr(VI)) and radionuclides (e.g., U(VI), Se(IV)/Se(VI) and Cs(I)) in aqueous solution. Water-stable MOFs and MOF-based composites exhibit the superior adsorption capability for these metal species in water. Significantly, MOFs show high selectivity in capturing target metal ions even in the presence of multiple water constituents. Mechanisms involved in capturing metal ions are described. MOFs also have excellent catalytic performance (photocatalysis and catalytic reduction by formic acid) for Cr(VI) conversion to Cr(III). Future research is suggested to provide insightful guidance to enhance the performance of the MOFs in capturing target pollutants in aquatic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaquatic environment 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acesium 3achromium 3acoordination polymers 3aenvironmental impact 3aformic acid 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3ametal ions 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3aradionuclides 3aselenium 3auranium 0aHeavy metals 0aRadionuclides 0aMetal-organic frameworks 0aAdsorption 0aPhotocatalytic reduction 0aPollution remediation1 aZhang, Peng1 aZhou, Hong-Cai1 aSharma, Virender K.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Oct., v. 209 p.783-800dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245016000177300001800337520136400355592002801719596025801747650001802005650002202023650002202045650002102067650002702088650002702115650004802142650001602190650001802206650001902224650002002243650001602263650001002279650001302289650001402302650001302316650002002329650002602349650004102375650001702416700003202433700002702465700002502492700007102517773013802588856008302726852000902809655001202818IND60779593520221123003219.0220611e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077959352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-021-00806-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreena, Prasannan Geetha10aQuick hassle-free detection of cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2) in goldfish using recombinase polymerase amplification-lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) assay  ap. 1211-1220.  aCyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2) is the etiological agent of herpesviral hematopoietic necrosis disease (HVHND), which causes severe mortality in ornamental goldfish (Carassius auratus), crucian carp (Carassius auratus), and gibel/prussian carp (Carassius gibelio). Quick and hassle-free point-of-care detection of CyHV-2 is vital for the maintenance of ornamental fish health. In this manuscript, we describe the development of a rapid and sensitive RPA (recombinase polymerase amplification) assay, coupled with lateral flow dipsticks (LFD), that can achieve sensitive diagnosis of CyHV-2 in goldfish within 20 min at 36 °C with the satisfactory detection limit of 10² gene copies per reaction. This is the first report wherein major capsid protein (MCP) of CyHV-2 was targeted for RPA-LFD assay development. The assay did not show any cross-reactivity with other viral pathogens like cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3), spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), and viral nervous necrosis virus (VNNV). Furthermore, screening of CyHV-2 infection in CyHV-2-infected goldfish did not yield any false positive/negative results. In short, the RPA-LFD assay developed in this study presents a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for point-of-care diagnosis of CyHV-2, especially under resource-limited conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aICAR letter no F.

In this paper, we provide one more argument to support magnetic cooling technology, which is the superior energy saving potential under part load conditions. Therefore, magnetic cooling system may not compete with vapor compression under full load nominal condition, but its seasonal or annual overall efficiency could be better when part load characteristics are taken into account. To show the operation feasibility under part load condition, a feedback control strategy is proposed and incorporated into a magnetic cooling system model in Simulink first. The robust control quality is then revealed by numerical simulation studies for five different variable part load profiles. Furthermore, the transient accumulated energy performances are compared with those estimated based on the quasi-steady state condition to simplify the calculation on the overall energy efficiency benefit. Finally, a case study is carried out for unitary air-conditioning application, revealing that the overall energy efficiency is almost twice of the energy efficiency evaluated under full load condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aambient temperature 3acase studies 3acooling 3acooling systems 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3amagnetism 3amathematical models 3avapors 0aNot-in-kind cooling 0aSolid-state cooling 0aMagnetocaloric cooling 0aEfficiency 0aPart load performance 0aSimulation1 aYuan, Lifen1 aYu, Jianlin1 aYan, Gang0 tEnergy.g2018 June 15, v. 153 p.763-775dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03819naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001300169245011400182300001200296520167100308592002801979650001802007650001602025650001502041650002002056650001102076650001702087650001402104650002002118650001502138650001702153650001302170650001202183650005102195650005102246650001102297650005302308650003402361650001802395650005202413650003402465650005202499650002602551650005402577650004902631650000902680650003902689653001402728653001102742653001402753653002302767653001702790653002002807700001602827700002002843700001702863700001502880700002102895773013502916856008503051852000903136655001203145IND50068122320221119112754.0190318e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006812232DNAL7 a238201162pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, S.10aDisparate effects of LPS infusion and carbohydrate overload on inflammatory gene expression in equine laminae  ap. 1-8.  aAlthough clinical evidence of endotoxemia has been associated with the development of acute laminitis in hospitalized horses with gastrointestinal diseases and endotoxins have been detected in the circulation of horses with experimentally-induced laminitis, it is unclear what role, if any, endotoxins have play the pathogenesis of the disease.

Horses were divided into 4 groups: Control (water placebo, n=7), endotoxin infusion (LPS, n=6), CHO/Developmental (30% decrease in central venous pressure, n=6) and CHO/Lame (Obel grade I laminitis, n=7). Horses in the LPS group developed clinical signs consistent with systemic inflammation, had rapid increases in plasma concentrations of both TNF-α and IL-10, and leukopenia, but did not have any changes in laminar tissue expression of the genes associated with inflammation. In contrast, horses administered CHO developed clinical signs consistent with systemic inflammation, had more delayed increases in TNF-α, IL-10 and total leukocyte counts, and had marked increases in laminar tissue expression of the genes associated with inflammation. Only the horses administered CHO developed clinical signs of laminitis, providing additional credence to the concept that factors other than endotoxin are responsible for the changes in laminar tissue gene expression that occur during the development of acute equine laminitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3aendotoxemia 3aendotoxins 3agene expression 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3alaminitis 3aleukocyte count 3aleukopenia 3apathogenesis 3aplacebos 2aAnimals 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aEndotoxemiaxgeneticsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFoot Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHoof and Claw 2aHorse Diseasesxetiologyxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHorsesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aInflammationxgeneticsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aInterleukin-10xblood 2aLameness, Animalxetiologyxgeneticsximmunology. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxblood 0aLaminitis 0aEquine 0aEndotoxin 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aCarbohydrate 0aGene expression1 aMoore, J.N.1 aRobertson, T.P.1 aHurley, D.J.1 aWagner, B.1 aVandenplas, M.L.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 155, no. 1-2 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009500175300001600270520095700286592002801243650001101271650002101282650001401303650002301317650001301340650001501353650001001368650001301378650001101391650002501402650001601427700002301443700002001466700002101486700002601507700002101533773008701554856008401641852000901725655001201734IND60599012820221119072151.0180702e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059901282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.04.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesforges, Alexandre10aImprovement of carbon nanotube stability by high temperature oxygen/chlorine gas treatment  ap. 275-284.  aCarbon nanotubes are interesting for applications in numerous fields. Nevertheless the as-produced samples prepared from bulk synthesis methods contain impurities and remain entangled if neither mechanical nor chemical treatment is applied. Such treatments are known to damage the carbon nanotube structure and to reduce their stability which induces drastic diminution of their properties. We have developed a purification method based on the use of a gas-phase treatment under an oxygen/chlorine mixture at high temperature (around 1000°C). We were able to efficiently remove metal-based impurities from catalyst residue without damaging carbon nanotubes. We show that their stability is improved thanks to the presence of chlorine-containing functional groups at the carbon nanotube surface. Under the used conditions, the functionalization level remains low preserving the SWCNT structure and efficiently protects SWCNTs from combustion by oxygen.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3achemical treatment 3achlorine 3acombustion 3agases 3amoieties 3aoxygen 3apurification methods 3atemperature1 aMercier, Guillaume1 aHérold, Claire1 aGleize, Jérôme1 aNormand, François Le1 aVigolo, Brigitte0 tCarbon.g2014 Sept., v. 76 p.275-284dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.04.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245005100162520128600213592002801499650002301527650005201550650001501602650002001617650001801637650000901655650002001664650001201684650001501696650002501711700002101736700002101757700002101778700002201799700002101821700002301842700002001865700002101885700002401906700002501930700001901955700002101974700002401995700002602019700002302045773012202068856007402190852000902264655001202273IND60794362020221121175500.0220922e20220902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079436202DNAL7 a10.3390/v140919502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanssens, Raphael 10aSARS-CoV-2 Surveillance in Belgian Wastewaters  aWastewater-based surveillance was conducted by the national public health authority to monitor SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the Belgian population. Over 5 million inhabitants representing 45% of the Belgian population were monitored throughout 42 wastewater treatment plants for 15 months comprising three major virus waves. During the entire period, a high correlation was observed between the daily new COVID-19 cases and the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater corrected for rain impact and covered population size. Three alerting indicators were included in the weekly epidemiological assessment: High Circulation, Fast Increase, and Increasing Trend. These indicators were computed on normalized concentrations per individual treatment plant to allow for a comparison with a reference period as well as between analyses performed by distinct laboratories. When the indicators were not corrected for rain impact, rainy events caused an underestimation of the indicators. Despite this negative impact, the indicators permitted us to effectively monitor the evolution of the fourth virus wave and were considered complementary and valuable information to conventional epidemiological indicators in the weekly wastewater reports communicated to the National Risk Assessment Group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3amonitoring 3apopulation size 3apublic health 3arain 3arisk assessment 3aviruses 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aHanoteaux, Sven 1 aMaloux, Hadrien 1 aKlamer, Sofieke 1 aLaisnez, Valeska 1 aVerhaegen, Bavo 1 aLinard, Catherine 1 aLahousse, Lies 1 aDelputte, Peter 1 aTerwagne, Matthieu 1 aMarescaux, Jonathan 1 aPype, Rosalie 1 aDidy, Christian 1 aDierick, Katelijne 1 aVan Hoorde, Koenraad 1 aLesenfants, Marie 0 tViruses.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140919503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245020700167506010400374506007600478520151200554592002802066506003702094650001902131650001402150650003202164650001802196650001102214650001302225650002102238650001202259653001902271653002802290653002102318653002902339653001902368653000802387653000802395700002102403700002202424700002602446700002102472700002102493700006202514773011202576856008402688852000902772655001202781IND60777832520221207122256.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077783252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2022.1537292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Pankaj10aPhloem connectivity and transport are not involved in mature plant resistance (MPR) to Potato Virus Y in different potato cultivars, and MPR does not protect tubers from recombinant strains of the virus  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aims of this study were: i) to investigate mature plant resistance (MPR) against four strains of Potato virus Y (PVYᴼ, PVYᴺ, PVYᴺᵀᴺ and PVYᴺ⁻ᵂⁱ) in potato cultivars that differ in maturity (e.g. early or maincrop) at different developmental stages, and ii) to determine whether phloem translocation of photoassimilates at different stages including the source-sink transition influences MPR. The data showed that MPR was functional by the flowering stage in all cultivars, and that the host-pathogen interaction is highly complex, with all three variables (potato cultivar, virus strain and developmental stage of infection) having a significant effect on the outcome. However, virus strain was the most important factor, and MPR was less effective in protecting tubers from recombinant virus strains (PVYᴺᵀᴺ and PVYᴺ⁻ᵂⁱ). Development of MPR was unrelated to foliar phloem connectivity, which was observed at all developmental stages, but a switch from symplastic to apoplastic phloem unloading early in tuber development may be involved in the prevention of tuber infections with PVYᴼ. Recombinant virus strains were more infectious than parental strains and PVYᴺᵀᴺ has a more effective silencing suppressor than PVYᴼ, another factor that may contribute to the efficiency of MPR. The resistance conferred by MPR against PVYᴼ or PVYᴺ may be associated with or enhanced by the presence of the corresponding strain-specific HR resistance gene in the cultivar.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPotato virus Y 3acultivars 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3amature plants 3aphloem 3apotatoes 3aresistance genes 3aviruses 0aPotato virus Y 0aMature plant resistance 0aPhloem transport 0aPotato tuber development 0aVirus movement 0aPVY 0aMPR1 aCowan, Graham H.1 aSquires, Julie N.1 aHackett, Christine A.1 aTobin, Alyson K.1 aTorrance, Lesley1 aRoberts, Alison G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1270-16670 tJournal of plant physiology.g2022 Aug., v. 275 p.153729-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2022.1537293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245007900161300001600240520174200256592002801998596005902026596005902085596005902144650002802203650003302231650001502264650002002279650003202299650003302331650002102364650002402385650002302409650001502432650001002447650002302457650001402480650002202494651001002516700001402526700001202540700001602552700001802568700002802586700005202614773012702666856008302793852000902876655001202885IND60779593820221123020207.0220831e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077959382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-022-00928-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Min10aArtificial ponds as hotspots of nitrogen removal in agricultural watershed  ap. 283-301.  aSmall waters, like ponds, are the most abundant freshwater environments, and are increasingly recognized for their function in ecosystem service delivery. In agricultural watershed, artificial ponds play an essential role in reducing nitrogen pollution. However, until now artificial ponds remain the least investigated part of water environments. The importance of microbial activities has seldom been discussed, which makes the microbial pathways and processes rates in nitrogen removal poorly understood. To illustrate the role of artificial ponds in microbial nitrogen removal in agricultural watersheds, 21 pond sediments and 11 soils are collected in an agricultural watershed of China. Results show that surface sediments in ponds carry significantly higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen (9.1–21.9 mg/kg) and total organic matter (64.8–113.0 g/kg) compared to the surrounding agricultural soils. High rates of microbial nitrogen removal in ponds (12.4–25.5 nmol N g⁻¹ h⁻¹) are observed, which are 2–9 times higher than those in dryland soils. In pond sediments, denitrification dominates (> 90% N-loss) the microbial nitrogen removal process with only a minor contribution of anaerobic ammonium oxidation. A high potential of N₂O production (up to 9.4 nmol N g⁻¹ h⁻¹) occurs in ponds along with the rapid nitrogen removal. For denitrifier genes, nir gene are always more abundant than nosZ gene. Additionally, the nirS gene is more abundant under flooded conditions, while nirK gene prefers higher dissolved oxygen and NO₃⁻ in drylands. These findings highlight the ecosystem function of ponds in agricultural watersheds, and provide new ideas on pollution control and global nitrogen cycling.  aPublisher supplied data  a41977153cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51908145cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31870100cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aagricultural watersheds 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3aarid lands 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3adissolved oxygen 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3afreshwater 3agenes 3amicrobial nitrogen 3apollution 3apollution control 3aChina1 aLi, Shuai1 aYe, Fei1 aHong, Yiguo1 aLü, Mingquan1 aOp den Camp, Huub J.

Previous studies suggested that the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit known as D1/RGA1 in rice was involved in deactivation function of the G protein. However, so far no partner has been analyzed the spatial structure change acting with D1. In this study, a dwarf mutant designated Mu101 was obtained in M₂population of rice indica cultivar M804 treated with⁶⁰Co γ-ray. Genetic analysis of Mu101 indicated that the dwarf phenotype was controlled by a single dwarf gene, and the dwarf mutant was insensitive to gibberellin (GA), which was named dwarf 89 (d89). Using a large F₂population derived from a cross between the d89 and a japonica rice variety, Taigeng16, the D89 gene was fine mapped into a 62.13 kb physical distance on chromosome 5, where eight open reading frames were predicted. Sequence analysis indicated that only one bp substitution (A-G) was found in LOC_Os05g26890 between M804 and the d89 mutant. The rice GA insensitive dwarf mutant DWARF1 gene was in this locus. The modeling analysis showed amino acid threonine to alanine mutation was likely to make the alpha helix short, and led to the G protein deactivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3adwarfing 3agenes 3aloci 3amutants 3amutation 3aopen reading frames 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3arice 3asequence analysis 3athreonine1 aZheng, Xiang-hua1 aCheng, Chao-ping1 aWang, Wen-da1 aXing, Deng-hui1 aLu, Li-bin1 aLiu, Chen-de1 aYe, Ning1 aZeng, Mei-juan1 aYe, Xin-fu0 tEuphytica.g2014 May, v. 197, no. 1 p.145-159dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-014-1071-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245015400197500002000351520219300371592002802564650002002592650002002612650002002632650003002652650001502682650002102697650001402718650001502732650001102747650001402758650001902772650001302791651001302804700002502817700001802842773012202860856007502982852000903057655001203066IND60788567720221120113448.0220815e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078856772DNAL7 a10.1002/wlb3.010182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGebo, Berhanu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3876-094810aKnowledge, attitude and practice of the local people towards human–carnivore coexistence in Faragosa–Fura Landscape, Gamo Zone, southern Ethiopia  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLocal people knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) have played an important role in human‐wildlife coexistence and have received increased attention in biodiversity conservation. However, studies on the KAP of local people towards human‐carnivore coexistence (HCC) are scarce, species‐specific or limited to the protected areas. Therefore, we investigated the local people KAP towards carnivore coexistence with humans, the problem of livestock and mitigation practices in a human‐dominated landscape of southern Ethiopia. We collected the data from 352 households interviews using a semi‐structured questionnaire and photographic sampling. The respondents mentioned 13 carnivores coexisting with local people belonging to six families. Eighty‐five percent of the respondents perceived carnivores as problematic species and expressed a negative attitude towards them, primarily due to the damage they caused to their livestock. Respondents who had better knowledge of carnivores also showed a positive attitude towards carnivores. The cluster analysis showed that the spotted hyena, serval, leopard, common genet and black‐backed jackal were grouped under a high‐threat cluster. Chickens and goats were the most threatened livestock reported by respondents. The main predation control methods reported were guarding and fencing for larger livestock and keeping chickens indoors during the night. The regression models predicted that males and literate respondents had better knowledge of carnivores than females and illiterates. The respondents who owned more livestock experienced more damage to livestock, and females showed a negative attitude towards carnivores. Although the study area is the critical conservation value of the 13 carnivore species, livestock predation by carnivores, the local people's negative attitude towards carnivores and lethal predation control methods practiced by local people were affecting HCC in the area. The findings call for conservation actions such as conservation education to raise awareness and develop a positive attitude and non‐lethal predation mitigation measures to promote HCC in consultation with the local community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis mesomelas 3aCrocuta crocuta 3aGenetta genetta 3abiodiversity conservation 3acarnivores 3acluster analysis 3aeducation 3alandscapes 3apeople 3apredation 3aquestionnaires 3awildlife 3aEthiopia1 aTakele, Serekebirhan1 aShibru, Simon0 tWildlife biology.g2022 Mar., v. 2022, no. 2 p.e01018-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wlb3.010183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013200168300001600300520105200316592002801368650002301396650001001419650001601429650001401445650001701459650000901476650001501485650001101500650002001511650001501531650003101546650001101577650001101588650001601599650001101615653001401626653003101640653002601671653002101697653001501718700001801733700001901751700001801770700001901788773009001807856008501897852000901982655001201991IND60610994820221118160901.0191031e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061099482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jongkeun10aHydrothermal carbonization of lipid extracted algae for hydrochar production and feasibility of using hydrochar as a solid fuel  ap. 913-920.  aIn this study, hydrothermal carbonization was conducted to convert lipid extracted algae (Chlorella vulgaris) from the algal biodiesel process to produce hydrochar, while evaluating its feasibility for use as a solid fuel. Hydrothermal carbonization was conducted at a relatively low temperature range, owing to the energy consumption during the process. Based on the results, the properties of lipid extracted algae as a solid fuel improved during hydrothermal carbonization, being comparable to the low-ranked coals. The hydrochars thus produced showed stable combustion characteristics at high temperature. Moreover, the sulfur and ash content in the lipid extracted algae decreased through devolatilization during hydrothermal carbonization, allowing the hydrochar (low sulfur and ash content) to be considered as a clean energy source. Thus, a sustainable integration process, combining the hydrochar production from lipid extracted algae with the algal biodiesel process, seems to be feasible for solid fuel production and disposal of waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aalgae 3aash content 3abiodiesel 3aclean energy 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenergy 3afuel production 3ahydrochars 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3alipids 3asulfur 3atemperature 3awastes 0aHydrochar 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aLipid extracted algae 0aRenewable energy 0aSolid fuel1 aLee, Kwanyong1 aSohn, Donghwan1 aKim, Young Mo1 aPark, Ki Young0 tEnergy.g2018 June 15, v. 153 p.913-920dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245011900183300001600302520155900318592002801877650002501905650001001930650001501940650001201955650002701967650001501994650001302009650002302022650000702045650001502052650001502067650002102082653001902103653001302122653001302135653001302148653002202161700002802183700003102211700006502242700002802307773009102335856009002426852000902516655001202525IND60601819820221117193640.0190613e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060181982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Tamara Daiane de10aKinetics of arsenic absorption by the species Eichhornia crassipes and Lemna valdiviana under optimized conditions  ap. 866-874.  aThis work aimed to study the kinetics of arsenic absorption by Eichhornia crassipes and Lemna valdiviana under pre-established conditions of pH phosphate and nitrate in the nutrient solution. Additional aims were to evaluate the conversion kinetics between As(III) and As(V), and the effect of arsenic concentrations on development of the species. The plants were cultivated in nutrient solutions containing different arsenic concentrations: 0, 0.56, 0.89 and 1.38 mg L−1 for the water-hyacinth, and 0, 0.13, 0.48, 0.99 and 1.4 mg L−1 for Lemna. Monitoring of arsenic removal by the plants was performed by sampling at intervals of 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 96, 144, 192 and 240 h for the water hyacinth, and 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 96, 144 and 168 h for Lemna. The samples were submitted to analysis of total arsenic, As(III), As(V) and phosphorus. The first-order kinetics was fit to the arsenic removal kinetics by the plants, and it was observed that the decay coefficient (k) decreased with the increase of its initial concentration in the nutrient solution. For the, absorption was observed after 96 h of culture, the time coinciding with the greatest As(V) concentrations. For Lemna, the metal was only absorbed by the plant after decay of the phosphate levels of the medium, which occurred at 48 h. Concentrations above 1 mg L−1 implied deleterious effects in both plant species and in the phytoremediation process, and the bioaccumulation factor decreased for concentration above this for both E. crassipes and L. valdiviana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aLemna 3aabsorption 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation factor 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anutrient solutions 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphytoremediation 0aWater-hyacinth 0aDuckweed 0aArsenate 0aArsenite 0aDecay coefficient1 aBorges, Alisson Carraro1 aMatos, Antonio Teixeira de1 aVeloso, Renato Welmer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2318-33511 aBraga, Amanda Fernandes0 tChemosphere.g2018 Oct., v. 209 p.866-874dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009900166520129100265592002801556650001301584650001001597650001501607650001301622650002501635650001101660650001101671650001901682650001201701653001601713653001501729653002401744653002201768653001901790773009501809856008401904852000901988655001201997IND60777832720221122061040.0220816e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077783272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2022.1060862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeda, Haruka14aThe norms and practices of eating well: In conflict with contemporary food discourses in Japan  aIn contemporary society, numerous food discourses are being constructed and promoted regarding how and what people should eat. However, such expositions are often too nutrition-centred and contradict each other, leaving contemporary eaters at a loss rather than rescuing them from their gastro-anomic situations. It is therefore necessary to seek an understanding of what ‘eating well’ means to contemporary people and to navigate current food discourses based on such a social consensus. Using a combined method of ethics (capability approach) and the sociology of food, the aim of this study was to arrive at an understanding of the total – spatial to temporal, quality, structural and aesthetic – dimensions of eating well through a web-based questionnaire survey conducted in Japan (n = 973). The norms and practices across all the dimensions were identified, facilitating the creation of a social standard that indicates the parameters of their capability to eat well. Some findings are in conflict with current discourses, in which particular meal structures have been idealised and solo eating has been stigmatised. The analysis also highlights the absence of socio-cultural values in people's dietary mindsets as a consequence of the nutrition-centred food discourses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aJapan 3aaesthetics 3aappetite 3acontemporary society 3aethics 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 0aEating well 0aWell-being 0aCapability approach 0aSociology of food 0aFood discourse0 tAppetite.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 175 p.106086-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2022.1060863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011000170300001600280520125000296592002801546650002301574650001101597650002101608650002701629650001901656650001501675650001601690650002301706700003501729700003001764700002501794773008701819856008401906852000901990655001201999IND60599013120221119072200.0180702e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059901312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.04.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBounos, Giannis10aEvaluation of multi-walled carbon nanotube concentrations in polymer nanocomposites by Raman spectroscopy  ap. 301-309.  aA new Raman spectroscopic methodology is proposed to monitor the weight fraction of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) in polymeric nanocomposites. In order to disentangle the parameters affecting the frequency of the Raman bands and their intensity, this methodology involves the acquisition of sets of Raman spectra as a function of MWCNTs loading, excitation laser power and temperature. In the specific case of isotactic polypropylene (iPP), any interaction of the carbon nanotubes with the polymeric host has minimal effect on the frequency of the MWCNTs G band (∼1584cm⁻¹); the same holds for the influence of residual stresses acting on the MWCNTs. The parameter that primarily alters the CNTs Raman bands frequency is temperature, determined by the excitation laser intensity, the MWCNTs concentration and the thermal properties of the polymer matrix. This is demonstrated by confocal micro-Raman spectra collected from agglomerates and from micro-Raman spectra of samples containing either poorly or well dispersed MWCNTs. A direct correlation of the G band frequency with the effective MWCNT wt% loading in the nanocomposites is confirmed after careful and systematic experiments performed on prototype well-dispersed samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolypropylenes 3aprototypes 3atemperature 3athermal properties1 aAndrikopoulos, Konstantinos S.1 aKarachalios, Theodoros K.1 aVoyiatzis, George A.0 tCarbon.g2014 Sept., v. 76 p.301-309dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.04.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011000169300001600279520111700295592002801412650002501440650001501465650002301480650001501503650002101518650001301539650002501552650001601577653002001593653003001613653002601643653004901669653002401718700001501742773011301757856008401870852000901954655001201963IND60601465320221120165756.0180706e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060146532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoh, Chun Heng10aFabrication of PVDF hollow fiber membranes: Effects of low-concentration Pluronic and spinning conditions  ap. 130-141.  aDue to the unique properties of amphiphilic Pluronic block copolymers, they have been blended with other polymers such as PVDF to prepare membranes. Considering the stability issue, the strong pore-forming ability of Pluronic F127, and the mechanical strength of the resultant membranes, Pluronic/LiCl mixed additive consisting of a very low concentration of Pluronic has been used in this study. The effects of spinning conditions on PVDF hollow fiber fabrication have also been studied. It is found that the use of merely 0.2wt% of Pluronic is sufficient to impose significant impacts on the morphology, filtration performance, and mechanical properties of the resultant fibers. Hollow fibers spun using higher coagulant temperature, higher take-up speed, and water as the bore fluid exhibit better mechanical properties and filtration performance. PVDF hollow fiber membranes with PWP of 1180L/m²hMPa and MWCO of 5kDa were obtained when spun with optimized spinning conditions and using 3wt% of LiCl and 0.2wt% of Pluronic as the mixed additive. The fibers can withstand a pressure of 0.55MPa from the lumen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acoagulants 3acomposite polymers 3afiltration 3alithium chloride 3aspinning 3astrength (mechanics) 3atemperature 0aPhase inversion 0aPoly(vinylidene fluoride) 0aHollow fiber membrane 0aPoly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide) 0aMechanical strength1 aWang, Rong0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 466 p.130-141dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014200168520103200310592002801342650001501370650002701385650002001412650001101432650002101443650001901464650002101483650001101504650002101515650001401536650001301550650000901563650002001572650000901592650001701601650001901618653003801637653001501675653001401690653002001704653002501724700001501749700001701764700001301781700001701794700001601811700001801827773010001845856008701945852000902032655001202041IND60724222820221118021326.0220606e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072422282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1291372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yiran10aSource, transportation, bioaccumulation, distribution and food risk assessment of perfluorinated alkyl substances in vegetables: A review  aContamination of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in agricultural products have attracted more and more attentions recently. In this review, relationship between PFASs and vegetables is summarized comprehensively. PFASs could transfer to cultivation soils by irrigation water, bio-amended soil, and atmospheric deposition mainly from industrial emissions. Carbon chain length of PFASs, species of vegetables and so on are key factors for PFASs migration and bioaccumulation in soils, plants and vegetables. Studies on food risk assessment of PFOA and PFOS show low consumption risk for most vegetables, however researches on other substances are lacking. In the future, we need to pay more attention on novel pollution pathway in cultivation, traceability research for considerable contamination, dietary exposure levels for different vegetables and more substances, as well as more exact and scientific food risk assessments. Additionally, effective means for PFASs adsorption in soil and removal from soil are also expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aatmospheric deposition 3abioaccumulation 3acarbon 3adietary exposure 3afood chemistry 3airrigation water 3alength 3aperfluorocarbons 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3atraceability 3atransportation 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) 0aVegetables 0aMigration 0aBioaccumulation 0aFood risk assessment1 aZhou, Ziyu1 aLian, Yujing1 aSun, Xin1 aWu, Yongning1 aQiao, Luqin1 aWang, Minglin0 tFood chemistry.g2021 July 01, v. 349 p.129137-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1291373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245012200201500002000323520116800343592002801511650001401539650001201553650001501565650001301580650001001593650001901603650001301622650002201635650001101657650001501668650002101683650001401704650001301718650001301731651001301744700002501757700002301782700002101805700002201826773012201848856007501970852000902045655001202054IND60788567920221120093709.0220815e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078856792DNAL7 a10.1002/wlb3.010162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarley, Edward B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6862-711510aInfluence of water level management on vegetation and bird use of restored wetlands in the Montezuma Wetlands Complex  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aActive water management of wetlands promotes seed and tuber production to feed migrating waterfowl, but few assessments exist to determine how management actions influence wetland structure, vegetation and bird response throughout the year. We identified effects of full water drawdown, partial water drawdown and passive wetlands (no active dewatering during the growing season) on plant communities and bird abundance in wetlands of the Montezuma Wetlands Complex, New York, May–October 2016–2018 and February–April 2017–2019. We detected few differences in the plant community during June, but during September we detected greater vegetative forage quality index for waterfowl, annual plant cover and seed density in full and partial drawdowns than passive wetlands. Bird abundance was greater in June–July in passive wetlands and greater in September–October in full drawdowns. During spring migration, duck densities were greater in full and partial drawdowns. Our results indicate that wetland managers should use a mix of full drawdowns and passive wetlands to provide habitat for the greatest diversity and number of birds throughout the year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThespesia 3aannuals 3adewatering 3adrawdown 3aducks 3aforage quality 3ahabitats 3aplant communities 3aspring 3avegetation 3awater management 3awaterfowl 3awetlands 3awildlife 3aNew York1 aSchummer, Michael L.1 aLeopold, Donald J.1 aColuccy, John M.1 aTozer, Douglas C.0 tWildlife biology.g2022 Mar., v. 2022, no. 2 p.e01016-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wlb3.010163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245011900186300001600305520144000321592002801761650001801789650002301807650002001830650001301850650001801863650001401881650001201895650001301907650001101920650001001931650001201941650001401953650001601967650001501983650001601998650000902014650001202023650005202035650003502087650001102122650002602133650001302159650003102172650001802203650002802221650002602249650003802275700002102313700001902334700002702353773008502380856004802465852000902513655001202522IND50070011820221119162723.0131020e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007001182DNAL7 a236246722pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-013-2660-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŁukasik, Piotr14aThe diversity and fitness effects of infection with facultative endosymbionts in the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae   ap. 985-996.  aMutualisms with facultative, non-essential heritable microorganisms influence the biology of many insects, and they can have major effects on insect host fitness in certain situations. One of the best-known examples is found in aphids where the facultative endosymbiotic bacterium Hamiltonella defensa confers protection against hymenopterous parasitoids. This symbiont is widely distributed in aphids and related insects, yet its defensive properties have only been tested in two aphid species. In a wild population of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, we identified several distinct strains of endosymbiotic bacteria, including Hamiltonella. The symbiont had no consistent effect on grain aphid fecundity, though we did find a significant interaction between aphid genotype by symbiont status. In contrast to findings in other aphid species, Hamiltonella did not reduce aphid susceptibility to two species of parasitoids (Aphidius ervi and Ephedrus plagiator), nor did it affect the fitness of wasps that successfully completed development. Despite this, experienced females of both parasitoid species preferentially oviposited into uninfected hosts when given a choice between genetically identical individuals with or without Hamiltonella. Thus, although Hamiltonella does not always increase resistance to parasitism, it may reduce the risk of parasitism in its aphid hosts by making them less attractive to searching parasitoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidius ervi 3aEphedrus plagiator 3aSitobion avenae 3abacteria 3aendosymbionts 3afecundity 3afemales 3agenotype 3agrains 3ahosts 3ainsects 3amutualism 3aoviposition 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3arisk 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxmicrobiologyxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aEnterobacteriaceaexphysiology 2aFemale 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aGenotype 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aLinear Models 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aSymbiosisxphysiology 2aWaspsxpathogenicityxphysiology.1 aDawid, Maciej A.1 aFerrari, Julia1 aGodfray, H.

Papers were obtained from MEDLINE and PsycInfo using a systematic approach incorporating defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-one papers linking mastication and sustained attention were reviewed. Meta-analysis detected a weak, but statistically significant, improvement in levels of sustained attention when chewing with low between-study heterogeneity (mean Cohen's d = −0.1479 standard deviations, 95% CI [−0.2913, −0.0045], p = 0.043 & I2 = 0.00%), and a tendency for feelings of alertness to decrease less during cognitive demanding tasks when chewing (mean Cohen's d = 0.3797 standard deviations, 95% CI [−0.0053, 0.7647], p = 0.052 &I2 = 70.94%). To better understand the effects of mastication on sustained attention and alertness, further research is required which refines existing protocols, eliminates confounding effects such as gum formulation and constituents, and investigates the effects of contiguity, rate, and intensity of chewing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acognition 3amastication 3ameta-analysis 3aprotocols 3astandard deviation 3asystematic review 0aChewing 0aCognition 0aSustained attention1 aHaddou, Mohamed Ben1 aDay, Jon E.L.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 202 p.101-115dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245016000175300001600335520179500351592002802146650002102174650002602195650001302221650002602234650001502260650001702275650001002292650001102302650001302313650001502326653002502341653001802366653001502384653001802399653001502417653001702432700001902449700001602468773012202484856008302606852000902689655001202698IND60777833020221120232051.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077783302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2022.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Hani S.H Mohammed10aIsolation, characterization, and in vitro antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxicity studies of flavonoids isolated from galls of Pistacia integerrima Stewart  ap. 666-671.  aPistacia integerrima galls are traditionally applied for the treatment of various diseases pathological conditions and diseases. The aim of the present study was to explore the phytochemical and pharmacological importance of galls of Pistacia integerrima. The phytochemical study of the galls of Pistacia integerrima led to the purification of flavonoids namely 3,5,7,4/-tetrahydroxy-flavanone (1), naringenin (2), 3,5,4/-trihydroxy,7-methoxy-flavanone (3) and sakuranetin (4). The extracts, various fractions, and purified compounds were evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal sensitivity. The methanolic and chloroform fraction exhibited excellent activity against K. pneumonia, E. coli, B. subtilis, and S. aureus with an inhibitory zone of 16-24 mm. The isolated flavonoids (1-4) were screened for antibacterial properties. Among tested samples compounds 1 and 2 exhibited significant effect against S. aureus E. coli, and B. subtilis, S. epidermis with inhibitory zone 20 to 31 mm followed by compound 3 compared to the maximum effect of Imipenem with the zone of inhibition of 29 mm. Similarly, the extract and flavonoids (1-4) were also assessed for antifungal activity, among tested samples the chloroform and methanolic extracts exhibited the promising activity against tested fungal species. The n-hexane fraction was found least active among the entire samples. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited promising effects against F. solani, M. canis, T. logifusus, and C. glabrata (18-58 mm) followed by compounds 3, and 4 also showed good sensitivity against F. solani, M. canis, T. logifusus and C. glabrata (22-46). Interestingly no substantial cytotoxicity was detected in the case of the MTT screening test, thus our results indicate the safety profile of the extracts and flavonoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPistacia 3aantifungal properties 3achloroform 3acytotoxicity 3afungi 3ahexane 3aimipenem 3anaringenin 0aPistacia integerrima 0aAnacardiaceae 0aFlavonoids 0aAntibacterial 0aAntifungal 0aCytotoxicity1 aAnwar, Yāsir,1 aRauf, Abdur0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 Aug., v. 148 p.666-671dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2022.05.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009400165520177600259592002802035650001402063650000802077650001602085650002002101650002302121650001402144650002202158650001102180650001302191650002202204700002102226700002102247773012202268856007402390852000902464655001202473IND60794362720221120182806.0220922e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079436272DNAL7 a10.3390/v140919592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafforgue, Guillaume 10aAnalysis of the Contribution of Intrinsic Disorder in Shaping Potyvirus Genetic Diversity  aIntrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are abundant in the proteome of RNA viruses. The multifunctional properties of these regions are widely documented and their structural flexibility is associated with the low constraint in their amino acid positions. Therefore, from an evolutionary stand point, these regions could have a greater propensity to accumulate non-synonymous mutations (NS) than highly structured regions (ORs, or ‘ordered regions’). To address this hypothesis, we compared the distribution of non-synonymous mutations (NS), which we relate here to mutational robustness, in IDRs and ORs in the genome of potyviruses, a major genus of plant viruses. For this purpose, a simulation model was built and used to distinguish a possible selection phenomenon in the biological datasets from randomly generated mutations. We analyzed several short-term experimental evolution datasets. An analysis was also performed on the natural diversity of three different species of potyviruses reflecting their long-term evolution. We observed that the mutational robustness of IDRs is significantly higher than that of ORs. Moreover, the substitutions in the ORs are very constrained by the conservation of the physico-chemical properties of the amino acids. This feature is not found in the IDRs where the substitutions tend to be more random. This reflects the weak structural constraints in these regions, wherein an amino acid polymorphism is naturally conserved. In the course of evolution, potyvirus IDRs and ORs follow different evolutive paths with respect to their mutational robustness. These results have forced the authors to consider the hypothesis that IDRs and their associated amino acid polymorphism could constitute a potential adaptive reservoir.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotyvirus 3aRNA 3aamino acids 3adata collection 3adirected evolution 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3aproteome 3asimulation models1 aMichon, Thierry 1 aCharon, Justine 0 tViruses.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140919593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245012200201500002000323520132100343592002801664650001901692650001001711650001001721650001701731650000901748650002401757650001001781650001401791650001301805650002401818651001101842651001301853700002101866773012201887856007502009852000902084655001202093IND60788568220221120093612.0220815e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078856822DNAL7 a10.1002/wlb3.010012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Matthew B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2215-319014aThe effect of a ban on the use of lead ammunition for waterfowl hunting on duck and goose crippling rates in Illinois  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGlobally, there is increasing effort to transition away from the use of lead ammunition to mitigate its known risks to wildlife and human health. Whenever this transition is stated hunters frequently cite concerns about the effectiveness of non‐lead ammunition, how it will result in greater crippling rates, and associated animal welfare costs. This area has been little studied, but recent studies have found no differences in crippling rates using lead and steel ammunition. Using segmented linear regression we evaluated 37 years of waterfowl harvest data in Illinois, United States, overlapping the transition to non‐lead shot for waterfowl hunting in order to assess how crippling rates changed following the ban. The average crippling rate prior to the lead shot ban was 23% for both ducks and geese and reduced to an average of 15% and 11% for ducks and geese (respectively) following the ban. In addition, the annual trend in the proportion of ducks and geese crippled reversed following the ban, from a significant annually increasing to a significant annually decreasing trend. We offer hypotheses on behavioural and technological changes which may explain these changes and predict that crippling losses will not increase in Europe following a ban on the use of lead ammunition over wetlands in 2023.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aducks 3ageese 3ahuman health 3alead 3aregression analysis 3asteel 3awaterfowl 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aEurope 3aIllinois1 aMiller, Craig A.0 tWildlife biology.g2022 Mar., v. 2022, no. 2 p.e01001-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wlb3.010013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013600166300001600302520111200318592002801430650002101458650001701479650003101496650001701527650001301544650001901557650001001576650002201586650001701608650001101625653001601636653001001652653001201662653001101674653001001685653001701695700001601712700002101728700001801749700001401767700001301781700001801794700001901812700001101831700001601842773008701858856008601945852000902031655001202040IND60754515120221120125050.0211106e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075451512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2021.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Kaikai10aIdentification of a lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network to explore the effects of ricin toxin-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells  ap. 129-138.  aRicin toxin (RT) is a ribosome-inactivating protein derived from the beans of the castor oil plant. Our previous studies have reported that RT can induce the production of inflammatory cytokines and cause inflammatory injury in RAW264.7 cells. In order to explore the various biological processes that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), circular RNA (circRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA) as endogenous non-coding RNAs (ceRNAs) may participate in the pro-inflammatory mechanism, RT (20 ng/mL) treated and normal RAW264.7 cells were firstly sequenced by RNA-seq. By comparing the differentially expressed genes, we obtained 10 hub genes and enriched the inflammatory-related signaling pathways. Based on our results, we concluded a lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. Finally, we verified the key genes and pathways by qRT-PCR, WB and ELISA. From the experiment results, an opening MAPK signaling pathway in TNF signaling pathway via TNFR2 was found involved in RT-induced inflammation. This work provides a reference for searching for ceRNA targets or therapeutic drugs in RT-induced inflammatory injury in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRicinus communis 3acircular RNA 3agene expression regulation 3ainflammation 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aricin 3asequence analysis 3atherapeutics 3atoxins 0aRicin toxin 0aceRNA 0acircRNA 0alncRNA 0amiRNA 0aInflammatory1 aYu, Haotian1 aWang, Yingshuang1 aDong, Mingxin1 aWang, Yan1 aZhao, Na1 aZhang, Jianxu1 aSun, Chengbiao1 aXu, Na1 aLiu, Wensen0 tToxicon.g2021 Nov., v. 203 p.129-138dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2021.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014900156520173500305592002802040650001902068650001502087650001802102650001802120650006602138650001402204650002202218650001202240700001902252700002602271700002202297773012202319856007402441852000902515655001202524IND60794362820221120193458.0220922e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079436282DNAL7 a10.3390/v140919582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIles, Ray K.12aA How to Guide: Clinical Population Test Development and Authorization of MALDI-ToF Mass Spectrometry-Based Screening Tests for Viral Infections  aApplying MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry as a clinical diagnostic test for viruses is different from that of bacteria, fungi and other micro-organisms. This is because the systems biology of viral infections, the size and chemical nature of specific viral proteins and the mass spectrometry biophysics of how they are quantitated are fundamentally different. The analytical challenges to overcome when developing a clinical MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry tests for a virus, particularly human pathogenic enveloped viruses, are sample enrichment, virus envelope disruption, optimal matrix formulation, optimal MALDI ToF MS performance and optimal spectral data processing/bioinformatics. Primarily, the instrument operating settings have to be optimized to match the nature of the viral specific proteins, which are not compatible with setting established when testing for bacterial and many other micro-organisms. The capacity to be a viral infection clinical diagnostic instrument often stretches current mass spectrometers to their operational design limits. Finally, all the associated procedures, from sample collection to data analytics, for the technique have to meet the legal and operational requirement for often high-throughput clinical testing. Given the newness of the technology, clinical MALDI ToF mass spectrometry does not fit in with standard criteria applied by regulatory authorities whereby numeric outputs are compared directly to similar technology tests that have already been authorized for use. Thus, CLIA laboratory developed test (LDT) criteria have to be applied. This article details our experience of developing a SAR-CoV-2 MALDI-ToF MS test suitable for asymptomatic carrier infection population screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3abiophysics 3acarrier state 3adata analysis 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3apathogens 3aspectral analysis 3aviruses1 aIles, Jason K.1 aZmuidinaite, Raminta 1 aRoberts, Michael 0 tViruses.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140919583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100001700195245010200212506007600314506003100390520104500421592002801466596004501494506003701539650002001576650002101596650001701617650001901634650001601653650001101669650001901680650001801699650002101717650001101738650001301749650000901762650001801771650001901789650001201808653001301820653002101833653002001854653001301874653002101887653001901908653001401927653001501941700002901956773010001985856008702085852000902172655001202181IND60724223120221207140714.0220606e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072422312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1291482chorus7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1291482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Yunbing10aImproving the bioavailability of oil-soluble vitamins by optimizing food matrix effects: A review  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe potency of oil-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E and K) in fortified foods can be improved by understanding how food matrices impact their bioavailability. In this review, the major food matrix effects influencing the bioavailability of oil-soluble vitamins are highlighted: oil content, oil composition, particle size, interfacial properties, and food additives. Droplet size and aggregation state in the human gut impact vitamin bioavailability by modulating lipid digestion, vitamin release, and vitamin solubilization. Vitamins in small isolated oil droplets typically have a higher bioavailability than those in large or aggregated ones. Emulsifiers, stabilizers, or texture modifiers can therefore affect bioavailability by influencing droplet size or aggregation. The dimensions of the hydrophobic domains in mixed micelles depends on lipid type: if the domains are too small, vitamin bioavailability is low. Overall, this review highlights the importance of carefully designing food matrices to improve vitamin bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioavailability 3adigestive system 3adroplet size 3afood chemistry 3afood matrix 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid content 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3amicelles 3aoils 3aparticle size 3asolubilization 3atexture 0aVitamins 0aBioaccessibility 0aBioavailability 0aDelivery 0aGastrointestinal 0aNanotechnology 0aDigestion 0aAbsorption1 aMcClements, David Julian0 tFood chemistry.g2021 June 30, v. 348 p.129148-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1291483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011200211300001800323520144000341592002801781650000901809650002901818650001401847650001701861650001601878650002001894650001601914650001101930650001601941650001601957650001201973650001301985650001201998653001802010653001602028653001702044653001902061653002002080653002102100700006302121700005902184773012402243856008302367852000902450655001202459IND60777833220221123000722.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077783322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2022.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinnaar, Jessica J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9954-325310aSelf-compatibility provides little reproductive assurance in the summer-flowering Aloe reitzii var. reitzii  ap. 1164-1170.  aFloral adaptations, notably floral design and display, enable plants to govern their mating opportunities through pollinator attraction and pollen dispersal. However, large floral displays, together with multiple simultaneously open flowers in an hermaphroditic plant, increase the potential for geitonogamous self-pollination. Many angiosperms have evolved self-incompatibility that prevents self-fertilization, instead requiring outcrossing by pollen vectors for successful seed set. We investigated the reliance of the summer-flowering Aloe reitzii var. reitzii on pollinators for reproduction and by using controlled hand-pollination experiments to determine whether Aloe reitzii var. reitzii is self-compatible. Contrary to most aloes, Aloe reitzii var. reitzii is shown here to be partially self-compatible, but reliant on pollinators to transfer pollen between flowers within the same raceme or plant, as well as to other plants. Aloe reitzii var. reitzii appears incapable of autonomous self-pollination and pollinator-mediated geitonogamy causes reduced fecundity in Aloe reitzii var. reitzii. However, hand-selfed treatments produced viable seeds capable of germinating, suggesting that the partial self-compatibility in Aloe reitzii var. reitzii does provide some reproductive advantage and may have evolved due to its restricted distribution and increasing population fragmentation – possibly due to anthropogenic change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe 3aanthropogenic activities 3afecundity 3afloriculture 3ageitonogamy 3ahermaphroditism 3aoutcrossing 3apollen 3apollen flow 3apollinators 3aracemes 3aseed set 3aselfing 0aAsphodelaceae 0aGeitonogamy 0aMixed mating 0aOrnithophilous 0aSelf-compatible 0aSelf-pollination1 aPayne, Stephanie L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1493-15061 aCron, Glynis V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9552-09190 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 July, v. 147 p.1164-1170dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2022.05.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008200171300001600253520110300269592002801372650002201400650001601422650001301438650001901451650001301470700001701483700002001500700002301520700002201543773008701565856008401652852000901736655001201745IND60599013820221119072545.0180702e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059901382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.04.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGambhir, Sanjeev10aAnhydrous organic dispersions of highly reduced chemically converted graphene  ap. 368-377.  aA straightforward, systematic approach to the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) that affords dispersions of chemically converted graphene (CCG) in anhydrous organic solvents with decreasing basal plane defects is reported. The extent of reduction can be controlled and optimized, resulting in highly reduced dispersible chemically converted graphene (hrCCG) having an O1S/C1S ratio of 0.06, which approaches that of graphite. The hrCCG dispersion in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) was stable for several months at a concentration of 0.5–0.6mgmL⁻¹. This process was found to be easily scalable and could be exploited for the large scale production of hrCCG in DMF and its dispersion in other anhydrous organic solvents. This study demonstrates that the stability of the graphene dispersion is critically dependent on the exfoliation process. The improved elimination of basal defects and the restoration of aromaticity, while maintaining dispersion stability on a large scale in an anhydrous organic solvent, greatly increase the potential of this material for a wide variety of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adimethylformamide 3adispersions 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3asolvents1 aMurray, Eoin1 aSayyar, Sepidar1 aWallace, Gordon G.1 aOfficer, David L.0 tCarbon.g2014 Sept., v. 76 p.368-377dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.04.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01595naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245008000154300001600234500002000250520065500270592002800925650002000953650001600973650001000989700001700999700001601016700002001032700001701052773013101069856007201200852000901272655001201281IND60589382720221122135441.0180219e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058938272DNAL7 a10.1002/ffj.34152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Yifeng10aEnantioselective syntheses and sensory properties of 2‐Alken‐4‐olides  ap. 166-172.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA series of optically active 2‐alken‐4‐olides of C₆‐C₁₁ were obtained with 89–97% enantiomeric excess (ee) values by the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD) of methyl (E)‐3‐alkenoates, followed by elimination via mesylates.

In the hydrographic network, lakes also act as biogeochemical reactors, controlling both nutrient retention and fluxes. This work aimed to examine the coupling of Si, N and P cycling, together with their stoichiometry in a deep meromictic subalpine lake (Lake Iseo, Northern Italy). Si, N and P mass budgets were calculated by quantifying loads in the inlets and in the outlet over a period of 30 months (May 2016−October 2018), in-lake sedimentation rates and net nutrients accumulation in the water body. Lake Iseo acts as a biogeochemical filter, which differentially retains the external Si, N and P loads. Retention of Si and P was similar (75–79%), but considerably higher than N (45%), evidencing a decoupling of their fate due to in-lake processes. This differential retention is likely to be exacerbated by meromixis which enhances Si and P accumulation in the monimolimnion, while impairing denitrification, thus limiting N removal. Such decoupling resulted in an increase of the N:Si and N:P ratios in both the epilimnion and in the outlet compared to the inlets, whereas the ratios decreased in the monimolimnion. As a result, there may be a stronger Si and P limitation of the photic zone, leading to a shift towards more oligotrophic conditions. This transient equilibrium could be impaired in the case of water overturn produced by extreme climate events—a highly relevant issue, considering that a growing number of deep lakes are turning from holo-oligomictic to meromictic as a result of combined eutrophication and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-0241cfondazione cariplo 3abiogeochemistry 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adenitrification 3aeuphotic zone 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3anitrogen 3anutrient retention 3aphosphorus 3asilica 3astoichiometry 3asurface water 3aItaly1 aNizzoli, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4731-98041 aHupfer, Michael1 aValerio, Giulia1 aPilotti, Marco1 aViaroli, Pierluigi0 tBiogeochemistry.g2022 July, v. 159, no. 3 p.371-392dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-022-00933-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245014900152520204300301592002802344650002402372650001502396650001502411650000902426650001102435650002202446650002202468650000902490650001702499650001602516651001002532700001702542700001902559773012002578856007402698852000902772655001202781IND60784247620221119170352.0220726e20220721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078424762DNAL7 a10.3390/w141422712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jia 10aSpatiotemporal Variation and Driving Factors of Water Supply Services in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China Based on Supply-Demand Balance  aWater supply services (WSSs) are critical to human survival and development. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model enables an integrated, dynamic, and visual assessment of ecosystem services at different scales. In addition, Geodetector is an effective tool for identifying the main driving factors of spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services. Therefore, this article takes the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), the most prominent strategic reserve of freshwater resources in China, as the study area and uses the InVEST model to simulate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the supply-demand balance of WSSs and freshwater security patterns in 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018, and explores the key driving factors of freshwater security index (FSI) with Geodetector. The total supply of WSSs in the TGRA decreased by 1.05% overall between 2005 and 2018, with the head and tail areas being low-value regions for water yield and the central part of the belly areas being high-value regions for water yield. The total demand for WSSs in the TGRA increased by 9.1%, with the tail zones and the central part of the belly zones being the high water consumption areas. In contrast, the head zones are of low water consumption. The multi-year average FSI of the TGRA is 0.12, 0.1, 0.21, and 0.16, showing an upward trend. The key ecological function areas in the TGRA are high-value FSI regions, while the tail zones in the key development areas are low-value FSI regions. Industrial water consumption significantly impacts FSI, with a multi-year average q value of 0.82. Meanwhile, the q value of industrial and domestic water consumption on FSI in 2018 increased by 43.54% and 30%, respectively, compared with 2005. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variation of WSSs and detects the drivers in the natural-economic-social perspective and innovation in ecosystem services research. The study results can guide water resource security management in other large reservoirs or specific reservoir areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3ahead 3ahumans 3asimulation models 3aspatial variation 3atail 3awater supply 3awater yield 3aChina1 aZhao, Yiqiu 1 aWen, Chuanhao 0 tWater.g2022 July 21, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141422713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245009800181300001200279520192800291592002802219596006002247650001002307650001202317650001902329650001502348650001602363650001102379650001402390650001102404650001502415650001902430650002102449651001302470700005902483700001702542773015102559856008302710852000902793655001202802IND60779594620221120152949.0220831e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077959462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-10116-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aA Rahman, Amy Rose Aeriyanie10aResponse of algal biomass and macrophyte communities to internal or external nutrient loading  ap. 491.  aNutrient input from internal and external sources could regulate the variability and abundance of algal and macrophytes in freshwater lakes. This study explores the response of algal and macrophyte growth in relation to internal and external nutrient loading. This study was conducted over a 12-month period in a eutrophic shallow urban lake known as Slim River Lake, which located in Perak state, Malaysia. The internal nutrient loading was calculated during five identified dry periods. Meanwhile, external nutrient loading was measured from stormwater runoff after storm events. Algal biomass was measured twice a month, while total macrophyte abundance was measured once in a month. In this lake, internal nutrient loading could contribute up to 7538.33 kg total phosphorus and 42.23 kg total nitrogen during dry periods. Meanwhile, external nutrient loading quantified from the stormwater runoff contributed up to 401,500 kg total phosphorus and 4611.67 kg total nitrogen. The highest monthly mean for algal biomass and total macrophyte abundance was recorded as 60,343.75 cells/mL and 821.50, respectively. Based on the Pearson correlation analysis, algal biomass was significantly correlated with the internal total phosphorus loading (r = 0.54, p < 0.05). In addition, algal biomass also shows an inverse relationship with the external total phosphorus loading (r = − 0.44, p < 0.05). In contrast, total macrophyte abundance was significantly correlated with the external total phosphorus loading (r = 0.50, p < 0.05) and external total nitrogen loading (r = 0.44, p < 0.05). These results suggest that variation of nutrient sources triggers a different response by algal and macrophytes in the study lake. In implications, these findings show that a combination approach in reducing nutrients from sediment and anthropogenic sources is required for potential lake restoration.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017-0078-101-02cMalaysia Ministry of Higher Education 3aalgae 3abiomass 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3amacrophytes 3arivers 3asediments 3astorms 3astormwater 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3aMalaysia1 aSinang, Som Cit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3502-54701 aNasir Nayan,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 July, v. 194, no. 7 p.491-491dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10116-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00971naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245008400165520016900249592002800418650001100446650001500457650002100472700002100493773012000514856007400634852000900708655001200717IND60784247720221119162808.0220726e20220721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078424772DNAL7 a10.3390/w141422742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuig-Bargués, Jaume 10aApplications of Agro-Hydrological Sensors and Models for Sustainable Irrigation  aIn the last two decades, research on water resource monitoring and management has mainly been aimed at reducing irrigation water volume and energy consumption [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3airrigation 3airrigation water1 aRallo, Giovanni 0 tWater.g2022 July 21, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141422743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011100168520143200279592002801711650001501739650002201754650001801776650001701794650001201811650003001823650001801853650002301871650001501894650002301909650001601932650001601948650001001964650002201974650001301996650001402009650001502023650001302038650000902051650001302060653001602073653001802089653002902107700001702136700001802153700001502171700001402186700001702200700001602217700005902233773009702292856008502389852000902474655001202483IND60754515420221120125215.0211129e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075451542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2021.1177752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Minghui10aAqueous photodegradation of the benzophenone fungicide metrafenone: Carbon-bromine bond cleavage mechanism  aMetrafenone (MF), as a new type of benzophenone fungicide, has been widely used in agriculture and is persistent in the environment. Understanding its photochemical fate is essential for the comprehensive evaluation of its ecological risk. In the present work, we reported a detailed study on the photochemical transformation of MF in aqueous solution under irradiation (at λ > 290 nm using a high pressure mercury lamp). MF was relatively photo-reactive showing a low polychromatic quantum yield of photolysis (1.06 × 10⁻⁴, 20 µM) counterbalanced by a significant light absorption above 290 nm. A series of photoproducts were identified by high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) analysis, and three different pathways, including oxidation of the methyl group, debromination and replacement of bromine by hydroxyl group were proposed. Among them, debromination was identified as the dominating process that could be achieved via homolytic C-Br bond cleavage from singlet and triplet MF, as confirmed by laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Toxicity assessment revealed that photochemical degradation reduced the ecotoxicity of MF efficiently. Nitrate ions and humic acid promoted the MF photolysis, while bicarbonate exhibited no effect. Results obtained in this work would increase our understanding on the environmental fate of MF in sunlit surface waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abenzophenones 3abicarbonates 3abromine 3adensity functional theory 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental fate 3afungicides 3ahomolytic cleavage 3ahumic acids 3airradiation 3alamps 3amass spectrometry 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3aphotolysis 3aresearch 3arisk 3atoxicity 0aMetrafenone 0aDebromination 0aBond dissociation energy1 aYang, Xuerui1 aZhang, Xuewei1 aJi, Yuefei1 aZhou, Lei1 aXiu, Guangli1 aNi, Zhigang1 aRichard, Claire1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6520-54940 tWater research.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 206 p.117775-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1177753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012100163520117400284592002801458650004201486650001101528650001701539650001201556650001901568650002101587650003501608650001901643650001101662650001201673650001001685650001801695650001501713651001601728651001001744700001901754700002201773773012101795856007401916852000901990655001201999IND60753261320221122144124.0211012e20210928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075326132DNAL7 a10.3390/w131926792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerteni, Francesca 10aApplication of the MUSLE Model and Potential Effects of Climate Change in a Small Alpine Catchment in Northern Italy  aThe evaluation of sediment yield by water erosion taking into consideration the possible impact of climate change is the object of this work, concerning the use of the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) in an Italian case study. This empirical model was implemented in a Geographical Information System, taking into account Alpine hydrology and geomorphological and climate parameters, which are crucial in the analysis of the intensity and variability of sediment yield production processes. The case study is the Guerna Creek basin, a small-sized mountain watershed placed in Lombardy, in the South-Central Alps (Northern Italy). In recent decades it has been hit at the same time by floods and erosive phenomena, showing its hydraulic-hydrological weakness. Three future climate change scenarios from 2041 to 2060, around the middle of this century, were built according to CORDEX data referring to three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5). The findings showed that in the future climate, the sediment yield at the basin scale might change by 24–44% for a single heavy storm in the middle of the current century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aModified Universal Soil Loss Equation 3abasins 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aempirical models 3ageographic information systems 3asediment yield 3astorms 3astreams 3awater 3awater erosion 3awatersheds 3aAlps region 3aItaly1 aDada, Arianna 1 aGrossi, Giovanna 0 tWater.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 13, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131926793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010100164300001600265520170500281592002801986650001502014650000902029650001102038650001102049650002302060653003002083653002902113653002302142700002502165700002202190700002202212773009702234856008002331852000902411655001202420IND60691367920200616000000.0200429e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069136792DNAL7 a10.2752/175303709X4576032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGee, Nancy R.10aPreschoolers' Adherence to Instructions as a Function of Presence of a Dog and Motor Skills Task  ap. 267-276.  aThe purpose of this study was to examine preschoolers' (n = 11) ability to follow instructions in the presence or absence of a real dog while executing a variety of motor skills tasks. These tasks were divided into one of three general classifications: 1) Modeling Tasks: the children were asked to emulate the behavior of a model, 2) Competition Tasks: the children were asked to do the task faster than a competitor, and 3) Tandem Tasks: the children were asked to do the tasks at the same time as a co-performer. Typical and Identified (language impaired) preschool children were randomly assigned to perform five tasks of each general classification alone, with a human, with a real dog, and with a stuffed dog that was similar in size and appearance to the live dog. Two independent raters rated each child's adherence to instructions (interrater reliability = 0.99) on a 7-point scale. A significant interaction between task classification and type of co-performer revealed that in the Modeling Tasks the preschoolers adhered better to the instructions when the real dog was present relative to the other conditions. In the Tandem Tasks the children adhered to instructions best when they performed the task with a human, followed by the stuffed dog (as manipulated by a human), the real dog, and worst when they were asked to perform the tasks alone. The type of co-performer made no significant difference in the Competition Tasks. These results indicate the presence of a real dog tends to be beneficial for promoting preschoolers' compliance with instructions in motor skills tasks that require modeling behavior, but not in those tasks that stress competition or those performed in tandem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3adogs 3ahumans 3amodels 3apreschool children 0aadherence to instructions 0ahuman-animal interaction 0amotor skills tasks1 aSherlock, Timothy R.1 aBennett, Emily A.1 aHarris, Shelly L.0 tAnthrozoös.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 22, no. 3 p.267-276dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/175303709X4576033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013300171300001400304520133800318592002801656650001601684650002001700650001001720650001701730650001101747650001701758650001601775653002201791653002801813653002201841653002801863653001901891700002301910700002301933700002301956700003001979773008802009856008502097852000902182655001202191IND60610995520221118160828.0190725e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061099552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.05.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeme, Sebastijan10aOptimal price of electricity of solar power plants and small hydro power plants – Technical and economical part of investments  ap. 87-95.  aThis paper presents a multi-criteria evaluation analysis of the optimal price of electricity of solar power plants and small hydro power plants. The objective of this paper is to deal with the technical and economical part of the investment in the construction of solar power plant and small hydro power plant. Based on reviewed literature no paper was found that compare technical and economical analysis between solar power plant and small hydro power plant. The advantages and disadvantages of each technology in terms of technical and economical part of the placement in an area are presented. On the basis of the investment and operating costs an analysis of the viability of investment at different purchase prices of electricity is implemented, with the help of acceptance indicators. This paper presents a new approach to multi-criteria single aim valuation giving the estimation of suitability for the construction of solar power plants and small hydro power plants as a result. Single aim multi-criteria evaluation gives us the basis for deciding which technology is appropriate for placement in an area. To achieve a 10-year payback period, a multi-criteria evaluation analysis showed that the reference price (41.94 €/kWh) for solar power plants was increased by 3.3 times and for small hydro power plants by 1.4 times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aoperating costs 3apaper 3apower plants 3aprices 3asolar energy 3awater power 0aSolar power plant 0aSmall hydro power plant 0aNet present value 0aInternal rate of return 0aPayback period1 aSredenšek, Klemen1 aPraunseis, Zdravko1 aŠtumberger, Bojan1 aHadžiselimović, Miralem0 tEnergy.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 157 p.87-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.05.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012100172300001800293520221600311592002802527650004502555650001202600650001602612650002202628650001502650650001602665650001902681650001502700650003002715650002502745650001202770651001402782700002302796700002402819700003002843700002702873773013902900856008503039852000903124655001203133IND60746382920221122065936.0210803e20210818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074638292DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2021.19346002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllega, Lucrecia14aThe variability of sea surface temperature in the Patagonian Shelf Argentina, from 35 years of satellite information  ap. 6090-6106.  aThe aim of the present work is to analyse the variations of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Anomaly of Sea Surface Temperature (ASST) using more than thirty years of satellite data. We studied if these variations have possible ocean-atmosphere connections with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) in a crucial region for fisheries off the Patagonian Shelf. For the analysis, we used SST data collected from 1985 to 2019 with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. The two databases were merged to obtain 35 years of continuous SST data. The study area was divided into three zones to present different oceanographic and bathymetric characteristics. These zones are located in the gulf, in the middle of the continental shelf, and at the shelf break. For each of the zones, the monthly SST climatology and the ASST series are shown. To define their periodicity, monthly ASST data were analysed spectrally by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Transform. Cross-Wavelet Transform (XWT) was applied to analyse the co-variance of ASST with respect to climate indices. Our results show that the isotherm distribution seems to be separated by the 64º W meridian. To the east of 64º W, it follows an oblique direction from southwest to northeast; to the west of 64º W, a more complex behaviour of the SST field seems to be associated with the coastal dynamics. The ASST series shows that the values of negative anomalies are higher than those of the positive ones. Nevertheless, positive ASSTs are more extreme and persistent in time than the negative ones. The ASST wavelet diagrams denote a common and non-stationary periodicity in the three zones, with statistically significant power spectra in the intra-seasonal (9-month) and inter-annual (24-month and 4-year) time scales. There are clearly common features in the wavelet power of the time series related to ASST and climate forcing. The SAM exhibited the closest relationship with ASST in the three zones.

Characterization of the obtained AgCl samples with different wettabilities confirms the decisive effect of particle size although light irradiation also causes their wettability transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3achemical composition 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aevaporation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3airradiation 3aparticle size 3asilver chloride 3awettability1 aYang, Lilin1 aWang, Yaoguang1 aYang, Chao1 aTian, Wen1 aJiang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5560-08850 tLangmuir.g2019 May 23, v. 35, no. 24 p.7944-7953dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b008093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010900161300001800270520143200288592002801720596006301748596005001811596007201861650001401933650001001947650002301957650001301980650001501993650001802008650001102026650001102037650001902048650002002067650004002087650001502127650002502142650002602167651001902193700001502212700001602227700001702243773013002260856008302390852000902473655001202482IND60694650020221119224902.0200613e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069465002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-020-02048-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Rui10aSolar UV radiation exacerbates photoinhibition of a diatom by antifouling agents Irgarol 1051 and diuron  ap. 1243-1251.  aMarine diatoms are ubiquitously distributed in both coastal and open oceans, playing an important role in global primary productivity. In coastal waters, they are exposed to various pollutants in addition to multiple environmental stressors. Here, we show the pennate diatom Nitzschia sp. isolated from the East China Sea decreased its photosynthetic performance under the combined influences of two typical marine organic pollutants (Irgarol 1051 and diuron), that are frequently used as biocides to prevent biofouling, and solar UV radiation (UVR). Nitzschia sp. was sensitive to both pollutants under visible light (PAR) without UVR, even at the lowest concentration (0.5 μg L⁻¹) tested; higher levels led to greater reductions in its photochemical yield. When additionally exposed to UVR (280–400 nm), the inhibition of the quantum yields by the antifouling pollutants was exacerbated, reflecting a synergistic impact of the pollutants and UVR. Exposure to UVR brought about 5–20% reduction at different levels of Irgarol 1051, diuron, and their mixture, with a higher reduction percentage due to UVR observed at lower concentrations of the pollutants. Our results indicate that even low levels of antifouling agents can result in significant impacts on diatoms in the presence of solar UVR, implying that combinations of UVR and organic pollutants could be a potential method to control-target algal biofouling.  aPublisher supplied data  aBK20181314cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  a41876113cNatural Science Foundation of China  a2019B18614cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aNitzschia 3aalgae 3aantifouling agents 3abiocides 3abiofouling 3acoastal water 3adiuron 3aoceans 3aphotochemistry 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3apollutants 3aprimary productivity 3aultraviolet radiation 3aEast China Sea1 aWu, Yaping1 aXu, Juntian1 aGao, Kunshan0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2020 Apr., v. 32, no. 2 p.1243-1251dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-020-02048-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014100174300001400315520099400329592002801323650002901351650002501380650002501405650001101430650002201441650001201463650002801475650001401503650001301517650001301530653001301543653001101556653001101567653001601578653001101594700001901605700002101624773012301645856005101768852000901819655001201828IND50075521420221122065913.0140410e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007552142DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2012.7347132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, Golam Reza10aEvaluation of susceptibility of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Sitophilus granarius (L.) and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) to spinosad  ap. 46-51.  aIn this research, we evaluated the toxicity of different concentrations of spinosad to one-day-old adult of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Sitophilus granarius (L.) and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens). The exposure times were 24, 48 and 72 h in all experiments. In contact tests for R. dominica, the maximum mortality rate was achieved with 500 ppm of spinosad after 72 h exposure. The application of 400 ppm of spinosad after 72 h caused maximum mortality in S. granarius. For contact treatment, the complete control of C. ferrugineus was obtained with 500 ppm spinosad at 72 h exposure time. It is possible to recommend 500 ppm of spinosad for complete control of the tested insects through contact application. Estimated LC₅₀ values of spinosad in 72 h after exposure for adults of R. dominica, S. granarius and C. ferrugineus were 1287, 279 and 53.17 ppm, respectively. The results show that C. ferrugineus is the most susceptible insect to spinosad in these experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptolestes ferrugineus 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aSitophilus granarius 3aadults 3aexposure duration 3ainsects 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3aspinosad 3atoxicity 0abioassay 0abeetle 0ainsect 0ainsecticide 0aweevil1 aNamvar, Peyman1 aAfshari, Hossain0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 46, no. 1 p.46-51dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2012.734713  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009300156300001800249520096100267592002801228650001201256650001201268650001901280650002301299650001501322650001601337650002001353650002901373650002001402650002601422650001901448650001301467650002401480700001401504700001901518773012501537856007401662852000901736655001201745IND60639802220221119145950.0190503e20160329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063980222DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc02065d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoo, H.

Life cycle assessment was introduced as a system-wide approach that considers all processes from the extraction of natural resources to various bio-conversion steps that lead to the final product. Three bio-chemicals were selected in the investigation: methanol, formic acid, and acetone. The results suggest that the environmental benefits anticipated from renewable resources to produce green chemicals should be reviewed on a case by case basis. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to demonstrate that a 10% increase in biomass output and its availability (per unit land area) results in more CO₂ savings than a 10% increased yield in the bio-conversion methods. More importantly, land use change may have a dramatic influence on the total CO₂ emissions for lignocellulose utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystem services 3afeedstocks 3aformic acid 3agreen chemistry 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland use change 3alife cycle assessment 3alignocellulose 3amethanol 3arenewable resources1 aEe, W.

Both vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (100 mg/kg b.w.) and vitamin E (40 mg/kg b.w.) inhibited the increase of Ca and P in the aorta and the elastin fr. from the arteriosclerotic rats. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (50 mg/kg b.w.) also suppressed the deposition of Ca and P in the aorta, but there was no change due to vitamin K<sub>3</sub> or geranylgeraniol (side chain of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>) administration. Both vitamin K<sub>2</sub> and vitamin E showed lipid radical scavenging activity in the in vitro experiment. However, neither vitamin K<sub>3</sub> nor geranylgeraniol exhibited anti-arteriosclerotic or radical scavenging activity under the above experimental conditions. It is suggested that vitamin K<sub>2</sub> and vitamin E promoted an antiarteriosclerotic effect by radical scavenging activity. These actions of vitamin K<sub>2</sub> are required in the structure of 2-methylnaphthoquinone and its side chain (geranylgeraniol).  aPublisher supplied data 3aergocalciferol 3aatherosclerosis 3afree radicals 3acalcium 3avitamin E 3alipid peroxidation 3amineral content 3ageraniol 3aanimal models 3aelastin 3aoxidation 3arats 3aaorta 3aphosphorus 3avitamin K 3amolecular conformation 2aAnimals 2aAortaxmetabolism 2aArteriosclerosisxdrug therapyxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aDiet, Atherogenic 2aElastinxmetabolism 2aErgocalciferols 2aFree Radical Scavengers 2aMale 2aNaphthoquinonesxchemistry 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aVitamin Expharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aVitamin Kxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aVitamin K 3 0ainhibitors 0avitamins 0achemical structure1 aHayashi,  M.1 aTakegami,  H.1 aUsami,  E.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 69, no. 1 p.23-26dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.69.1.233Available from publisher's Web site  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01387naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005300125300001400178520051600192650001100708650001700719650002000736650001100756653002400767700001500791700001400806700001800820700002000838700001700858700001300875773008300888852000900971930003300980945001301013946001101026655001201037IND2329815020221120125533.0021122e200201  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232981502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaiser, M.10aComputer simulation of a continuous whisky still  ap. 27-31.  aGrain whisky is typically manufactured in a continuous distillation unit comprising of two columns, the beer stripper and the rectifier.

The variations in these distributions, with respect to space and time, are presented graphically. Evaluation of the model predictions with drying data obtained from square-wave temperature variations showed good agreement between the model and the experimental data within 8.4%. The advantages of employing cyclic heating/cooling schemes on the drying kinetics and product quality are demonstrated. Analytical results illustrated the importance of product tempering, continuous heat flux reversals within the product and reducing the product surface temperature to minimise the ascorbic acid loss and product colour change due to non-enzymatic browning. 3awater content 3adrying 3afood processing 3afood processing quality 3akinetics 3aprediction 3aheat treatment 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3amathematical models 3aequations 3aascorbic acid 3anutrient retention 3aMaillard reaction 3acooling 0aprocessing losses 0adistribution 0acyclic fluctuations1 aChou, S.K.1 aChua, K.J.1 aMujumdar, A.S.1 aHawlader, M.N.A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.65-75x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02158naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245010200210300001600312520107700328650001201405650002201417650002401439650002501463653002401488700002101512700002501533773012401558852000901682856008501691930003301776946001101809655001201820IND4441312620221120110054.0100813e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444131262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10735-010-9275-52doi7 aPMC29210562pmcid7 a205522572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoediger, Matthias 10aTissue distribution of the laminin β1 and β2 chain during embryonic and fetal human development  ap. 177-184.  aLaminins are the major glycoproteins present in all basement membranes. Previously, we showed that perlecan is present during human development. Although an overview of mRNA-expression of the laminin β1 and β2 chains in various developing fetal organs is already available, a systematic localization of the laminin β1 and β2 chains on the protein level during embryonic and fetal human development is missing. Therefore, we studied the immunohistochemical expression and tissue distribution of the laminin β1 and β2 chains in various developing embryonic and fetal human organs between gestational weeks 8 and 12. The laminin β1 chain was ubiquitously expressed in the basement membrane zones of the brain, ganglia, blood vessels, liver, kidney, skin, pancreas, intestine, heart and skeletal system. Furthermore, the laminin β2 chain was present in the basement membrane zones of the brain, ganglia, skin, heart and skeletal system. The findings of this study support and expand upon the theory that these two laminin chains are important during human development. 3alaminin 3abasement membrane 3atissue distribution 3aimmunohistochemistry 0aHuman embryogenesis1 aMiosge, Nicolai 1 aGersdorff, Nikolaus 0 tJournal of molecular histology.g2010 Apr., v. 41, no. 2-3 p.177-184dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1567-23797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10735-010-9275-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100813b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01546naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245007400144300001600218500001500234520070200249650002500951650003600976650002201012653001901034700001901053773009401072852000901166930003301175945002501208946001101233655001201244IND4363418120221120100844.0040715e20040412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436341812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

These protein complexes accommodate proton-transfer pathways through which protons are conducted. In this review, we focus specifically on the role of the protein-membrane surface and the surface-bulk water interface in the dynamics of proton delivery to these proton-transfer pathways. The general mechanisms are illustrated by experimental results from studies of bacterial photosynthetic reaction centres (RCs) and cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers 3aelectron transfer 0aphotosynthesis1 aBrzezinski, P.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2004 Apr. 12, v. 1655, no. 1-3 p.102-115x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2004/07/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02898naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001600215245006900231300001600300500001500316520123200331650001201563650001901575650001401594650001101608650001001619650001601629650002601645650001001671650002101681650002701702650001901729650002601748650001801774650002001792650005701812650005101869650005201920650005601972650001702028653001802045653002202063700001802085700002302103773007602126852000902202856008502211945002502296946001102321655001202332IND4362166520221120101014.0040420e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436216652DNAL7 a129205632pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-003-0675-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Embryogenic callus cultures were initiated from young shoots raised in vitro from the stem portion of the bulbil on medium supplemented with 1-2 mg l(-1) kinetin (KN) and 0.2-0.5 mg l(-1) α-naphthaleneacetic acid plus KN or 1-1.5 mg l(-1) benzylaminopurine (BAP) or 0.25-0.5 mg l(-1) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid plus BAP or 0.5-1.0 mg l(-1) KN. Embryos at various developmental stages (globular-, heart- or torpedo-shaped) produced mature and germinating embryos on being transferred to a new medium containing 0-0.25 mg l(-1) KN. After 28 days, a maximum of 76% germinated embryos was obtained on a medium supplemented with 0.1 mg l(-1) KN. The capacity for embryogenesis remained constant in the callus upon subculturing on the same medium for more than 48 months. Histological observations showed a distinct multicellular origin for most of the somatic embryos as they developed from epidermal, sub-epidermal and inside callus cells, while a few of them originated from a superficial callus cell. Plantlets regenerated from embryos were transferred to the field where their survival rate was 100%. 3akinetin 3aAgave sisalana 3ahistology 3ashoots 3asisal 3afiber crops 3asomatic embryogenesis 3a2,4-D 3amicropropagation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3acallus culture 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3asomatic embryos 2aAgavexembryologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Structuresxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aRegeneration 0aplant anatomy 0abenzylaminopurine1 aBansude, G.M.1 aAneesh Kumar, K.C.0 tPlant cell reports.g2003 Oct., v. 22, no. 3 p.188-194x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-003-0675-93Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRSCe2004/04/24  aNon-US 7aarticle04197naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215100001800232245019100250300001600441500001500457520159600472650002302068650002702091650001502118650002202133650001702155650001502172650002302187650002202210650002502232650003002257650002602287650002502313650001902338650002102357650001802378650001902396650002602415650001802441650001702459650001802476650001602494650002002510650005702530650002802587650002102615650003002636650002902666650001702695650005202712650003502764650004202799650004502841653001702886653003502903653002802938653002202966700001402988700002203002700001703024700001903041700002403060700001503084700001403099700002203113700001403135773007603149852000903225856008503234945002503319946001103344655001203355IND4362167120221120090223.0040420e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436216712DNAL7 a145517342pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-003-0666-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Immature anther-derived calli were used to develop transgenic plants. These calli were co-cultured with A. tumefaciens harboring a plasmid vector containing the H. brasiliensis superoxide dismutase gene (HbSOD) under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. The β-glucuronidase gene (uidA) was used for screening and the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (nptII) was used for selection of the transformed calli. Factors such as co-cultivation time, co-cultivation media and kanamycin concentration were assessed to establish optimal conditions for the selection of transformed callus lines. Transformed calli surviving on medium containing 300 mg l(-1) kanamycin showed a strong GUS-positive reaction. Somatic embryos were then regenerated from these transgenic calli on MS2 medium containing 2.0 mg l(-1) spermine and 0.1 mg l(-1) abscisic acid. Mature embryos were germinated and developed into plantlets on MS4 medium supplemented with 0.2 mg l(-1) gibberellic acid, 0.2 mg l(-1) kinetin (KIN) and 0.1 mg l(-1) indole-3-acetic acid. A transformation frequency of 4% was achieved. The morphology of the transgenic plants was similar to that of untransformed plants. Histochemical GUS assay revealed the expression of the uidA gene in embryos as well as leaves of transgenic plants. The presence of the uidA, nptII and HbSOD genes in the Hevea genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and genomic Southern blot hybridization analyses. 3aHevea brasiliensis 3agenetic transformation 3apolyamines 3aSouthern blotting 3aforest trees 3atransgenes 3abeta-glucuronidase 3atransgenic plants 3asuperoxide dismutase 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asomatic embryogenesis 3anucleotide sequences 3areporter genes 3amicropropagation 3aabscisic acid 3acallus culture 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3aantioxidants 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aGenetic Vectors 2aHeveaxembryologyxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aKanamycinxpharmacology 2aOxidative Stress 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRegeneration 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgenetics 2aTransformation, Geneticxdrug effects 2aTreesxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 0arubber trees 0aneomycin phosphotransferase II 0amolecular sequence data 0aorganic compounds1 aRekha, K.1 aVenkatachalam, P.1 aUratsu, S.L.1 aDandekar, A.M.1 aKumari Jayasree, P.1 aKala, R.G.1 aPriya, P.1 aSushma Kumari, S.1 aSobha, S.0 tPlant cell reports.g2003 Oct., v. 22, no. 3 p.201-209x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-003-0666-x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRSCe2004/04/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02354naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001800215245010600233300001600339500001500355520071300370650001901083650001601102650001901118650002701137650002201164650001701186650001601203650001301219650002101232650001601253650001601269650002601285650001601311650006001327650003901387650003901426650003801465650002201503650001701525653001601542653001801558700001801576773007601594852000901670856008501679945002501764946001101789655001201800IND4362166020221120090314.0040420e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436216602DNAL7 a128792592pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-003-0669-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The objective of this study is to investigate the role that EGF plays in rat tympanic membrane (TM) wound healing using two techniques, microarray and immunohistochemistry. The tympanic membranes of rats were perforated using a sterile needle and sacrificed at time points during 2 weeks following perforation. The normalized signal intensities at the time points for EGF and associated genes are presented. The rat EGF mRNA did not change significantly between time points. Five associated proteins, including heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor were found to be differentially expressed above a two fold threshold at 12 h following perforation. EGF staining was found at low levels in the uninjured TM. Levels of EGF staining increased at 24 h in the basal keratinocyte layer, became diffusely elevated in the specimen at 36 h, before a second peak in staining of the keratinocyte layer at Day 4. The staining of EGF corresponds to its multiple roles in TM wound healing. 3atissue repair 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aepidermal growth factor 3arats 0aMicroarray 0ahistology 0aEGF 0aTympanic membrane1 aRedmond, Sharon L. 1 aAtlas, Marcus D. 1 aGhassemifar, Reza 0 tJournal of molecular histology.g2010 Dec., v. 41, no. 6 p.309-314dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1567-23797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10735-010-9287-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02860naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245012900170300001600299500001500315520175600330650001602086650002702102650001502129650001802144650001702162653001302179653000902192653001302201653001402214700001902228773007902247852000902326856009402335930003302429945001302462946001102475655001202486IND2039194820221120052805.0940503e199310  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203919482DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3113.1993.tb00667.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeitz, L.L.10aSuperfamily Membracoidea (Homoptera: Auchenorrhyncha).

The following placements are corroborated: Cicadelloidea Latreille, 1825, is a junior synonym of Membracoidea Rafinesque, 1815; Biturritiidae Metcalf, 1951, is a junior synonym of Aetalionidae Spinola, 1850; Nicomiidae Haupt, 1929, is a junior synonym of Membracidae Rafinesque, 1815. The new family Melizoderidae includes two genera: Melizoderes Spinola and Llanquihuea Linnavuori & DeLong. Within Aetalionidae, the subfamily Biturritiinae is redefined to include only five genera. Within the family Membracidae, the subfamily Endoiastinae, subfam.n., is described; the subfamilies Centronodinae Deitz, 1975, status n. (with tribe Centronodini Deitz, 1975, including the genus Paracentronodus Sakakibara, 1971, new placement), and Centrodontinae Deitz, 1975, status n. (with tribe Centrodontini Deitz, 1975), are recognized for the first time; and the following groups are redefined: subfamilies Stegaspidinae Haupt, 1929, Nicomiinae Haupt, 1929, and Membracinae Rafinesque, 1815; and tribe Stegaspidini Haupt, 1929 (Stegaspidinae). The new subfamily Endoiastinae includes three genera: Endoiastus Fowler, Scytodepsa Stal, and Stictodepsa Stal. Endoiastus productus Osborn, 1922, is placed as a junior synonym of Stictodepsa neotropicalis Kirkaldy, 1909, syn.n. Lectotypes are designated and illustrated for Tettigonia muscaria Fabricius, 1803 (now Lophyraspis muscaria) and Cicada fuscata Fabricius, 1803 (now Stictodepsa neotropicalis Kirkaldy, 1909). 3aMembracidae 3aanatomy and morphology 3anew family 3anew subfamily 3aCicadellidae 0ataxonomy 0akeys 0asynonyms 0aHomoptera1 aDietrich, C.H.0 tSystematic entomology.g1993 Oct., v. 18, no. 4 p.287-296x0307-69707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3113.1993.tb00667.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTLX  aNon-US 7aarticle01505naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245009400169300001600263500001500279520045800294650002700752650001500779650001600794651001400810651001800824653002400842653001300866653000900879700001600888773007900904852000900983856009400992930003301086945001301119946001101132655001201143IND2036088020221120041046.0931203e199307  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203608802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3113.1993.tb00661.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolton, B.10aTaxonomy and biology of the supposedly lestobiotic ant genus Paedalgus (Hym.: Formicidae)  ap. 181-189.  a2019-12-04  aThe taxonomy and biology of the supposedly lestobiotic ant genus Paedalgus is reviewed.

The aim of this work was to study the effect of crude garlic pre-treatment on iron-mediated lipid peroxidation, proliferation and autophagy for 5 weeks. Rats were fed distilled water or garlic solution (1 g/kg body weight) by gavage for the first 3 weeks as pre-treatment and received a basal diet supplemented or not with ferrous sulfate (650 mg Fe/kg diet) for the last 2 weeks of treatment. Immunohistochemistry labeling and ultrastuctural observations were used to evaluate the iron deleterious effects in the liver. Iron supplementation induced cell proliferation predominantly in non parenchymal cells comparing to hepatocytes, but not apoptosis. In addition, iron was accumulated within the hepatic lysosomes where it triggers autophagy as evidenced by the formation of autophagic vesicles detected by LC3-II staining. It also induced morphologic alterations of the mitochondrial membranes due to increased lipid peroxidation as shown by elevated iron and malondialdehyde concentrations in serum and tissues. Garlic pre-treatment reduced iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation by decreasing the malondialdehyde level in the liver and colon and by enhancing the status of antioxidants. In addition, garlic reduced the iron-mediated cell proliferation and autophagy by lowering iron storage in the liver and protected mitochondrial membrane. Based on these results, garlic treatment significantly prevented iron-induced oxidative stress, proliferation and autophagy at both biochemical and histological levels due to its potent free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties. 3agarlic 3aoxidative stress 3aelectron microscopy 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aAutophagyxdrug effects 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aComplex Mixturesxpharmacology 2aDietary Supplements 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effects 2aGarlicxchemistry 2aIronxbloodxmetabolism. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aMale 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aOrgan Specificityxdrug effects 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aProtective Agentsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 0aIron supplementation 0aProliferation 0aAutophagy1 aHammami, Imen 1 aKouidhi, Wided 1 aChargui, Abderrahman 1 aBen Ammar, Awatef 1 aHamdaoui, Mohamed Hédi 1 aEl May, Ahmed 1 aEl May, Michèle 0 tJournal of molecular histology.g2010 Oct., v. 41, no. 4-5 p.233-245dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1567-23797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10735-010-9283-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100924b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03136naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001200128245010700140300002000247520147800267650002901745650001801774650002101792650002501813650002501838650002901863650002401892650001801916650001501934650002401949650002401973650002301997650003002020650001802050650003002068650002802098650002402126650003402150650005402184650003802238650002302276650002702299653001202326653002802338653001902366653001602385700001102401700001802412773009702430852000902527939003302536946001302569655001202582IND9206137120221120023651.0921006e19920605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920613712DNAL7 a15974622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, J.10aCDC14 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: cloning, sequence analysis, and transcription during the cell cycle  ap. 11274-11280.  aWe have cloned, mapped and sequenced the complete CDC14 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized its transcription during the cell cycle. CDC14 was found within a 3.5-kilobase pair XhoI-XbaI fragment of chromosome VI. The DNA sequence reveals an open reading frame capable of encoding a 423-amino acid polypeptide. Protein sequence comparisons through the Prosite, Genbank and EMBL databases allowed us to identify a conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase active site in the encoded CDC14 protein beginning at amino acid 153. Disruption demonstrates that CDC14 is an essential gene. The level of the CDC14 transcript appears to be weakly cell cycle-regulated and has a periodicity which lags approximately 15 min behind histone HTB1 mRNA accumulation levels. DNA sequence analysis has identified a region within the CDC14 promoter which bears a striking resemblance (15 out of 21 base pairs identity) to the cell cycle regulation region of the promoter of the histone H2A1-H2B1 (HTA1-HTB1) gene pair. The cell cycle regulation sequence is responsible for the periodic accumulation and hydroxyurea sensitivity of the histone HTA1-HTB1 message. However, unlike histone mRNA, which is repressed upon hydroxyurea arrest, CDC14 mRNA appears to be unaffected. This suggests that CDC14 and histone genes are regulated by different mechanisms during the cell cycle. Furthermore, superhelical density measurements suggest that CDC14 is not involved in nucleosome assembly. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acell division 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Cycle Proteins 2aChromosome Deletion 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHydroxyureaxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aProtein Tyrosine Phosphatases 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Alignment 2aTranscription, Genetic 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m61194 0aembl/m611941 aXu, H.1 aGrunstein, M.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1992 June 5, v. 267, no. 16 p.11274-11280x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01483naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006000128300001400188520062400202650000900826650000900835650001400844650001400858650002100872650001000893650001900903651001000922653001600932700001700948700002000965700001500985773008001000852000901080939003301089946001101122655001201133IND9206136020221117181134.0921006s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920613602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGikunju, J.K.10aFluoride in fish from lakes of Great Rift Valley, Kenya  ap. 85-90.  aFluoride (F) levels in the fillet of 4 species of fish (Tilapia leucostictius, T. zilii, T. nilotica, Micropterus salmoides) ranged from 1.3 to 2.0 mg F/kg wet weight, while the hone levels ranged from 117 to 211 mg F/kg.

The F content of fish fillet does not appear to be a major contributor to the prevalent and severe human dental fluorosis in the Rift Valley area. 3afish 3adiet 3afluorides 3afluorosis 3anutrient content 3alakes 3ahealth hazards 3aKenya 0acomparisons1 aMaitho, T.E.1 aBirkeland, J.M.1 aLokken, P.0 tEcology of food and nutrition.g1992, v. 27, no. 2 p.85-90x0367-02447nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02650naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008900143300001600232520092400248650002501172650002301197650001701220650001601237650001001253650001201263650001501275650001501290650002301305650002501328650002001353650000901373650001201382650001701394650002201411650003201433650006501465650003001530650004601560650002601606650000901632650003501641650005301676650000901729650002201738653001601760653002301776700001301799700001801812700001401830700001601844700001401860700001101874773009601885852000901981939003301990946001302023655001202036IND9206136320221117181135.0921006e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920613632DNAL7 a16366102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrwoll, E.10aEffects of dietary protein deficiency on mineral metabolism and bone mineral density  ap. 314-319.  aThe effects of dietary protein restriction on mineral and bone metabolism are uncharacterized. We studied growing rats fed a diet low in protein (5%) for 4, 6, and 8 wks (n = 10 animals/group) and compared them with animals pair-fed with a protein-replete (18%) diet. The low-protein diet rapidly induced a profound hypocalciuria that persisted for > 8 wk. Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations were not affected but serum total and free 25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations as well as gastrointestinal calcium absorption were lower in the low-protein animals. Skeletal dimensions were reduced in the protein-deprived rats but there were no significant differences in bone mineral content between control and low-protein animals at 4, 6, and 8 wks. Hence, dietary protein deprivation resulted in slower growth but bone mineral density was maintained when there was a marked reduction in urinary calcium excretion. 3aprotein deficiencies 3amineral metabolism 3abone density 3ablood serum 3aurine 3acalcium 3acreatinine 3aphosphorus 3aexperimental diets 3askeletal development 3acholecalciferol 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBone Density 2aCalcitriolxblood 2aCalciumxmetabolismxurine. 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aCreatininexbloodxurine. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aMale 2aPhosphorusxmetabolismxurine. 2aProtein Deficiencyxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 0aderivatives 0acalcium absorption1 aWare, M.1 aStribrska, L.1 aBikle, D.1 aSanchez, T.1 aAndon, M.1 aLi, H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Aug., v. 56, no. 2 p.314-319x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01599naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011200125300001600237500001500253520065100268650002200919650001000941650003000951650001100981650001200992650002301004653002401027700001701051700001701068700001501085700001601100773008001116852000901196939003301205946001101238655001201249IND9206137920221117181121.0921006s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920613792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavoye, I.10aHeat and mass transfer dynamic modelling of an indirect biscuit baking tunnel-oven.

A study of the state of the art of biscuit baking and modelling of baking ovens suggests the choice of structure of the dynamic model. The model includes heat transfer from gas combustion to the biscuits. In the baking chamber, conduction (for the band conveyor), convection and radiation fluxes are considered. Mass transfer coupled with heat transfer is described. The velocity of the air inside the oxen, as well as the drying of the biscuit, are modelled. Physical parameters are taken into account correlations or identified laws. 3asimulation models 3aovens 3afood processing equipment 3abaking 3acookies 3athermal properties 0amathematical models1 aTrystram, G.1 aDuquenoy, A.1 aBrunet, P.1 aMarchin, F.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1992, v. 16, no. 3 p.173-196x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02150naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009100128300001600219520111900235650000901354650002001363650001201383650001801395650001401413650001201427650001201439650002001451650002001471650002101491650001301512653000901525653002301534653002401557700002001581773008501601852000901686930003301695945001301728946001101741655001201752IND2329811320221117162442.0021122e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232981132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijkink, B.H.10aMilling properties of peas in relation to texture analysis. II. Effect of pea genotype  ap. 105-111.  aThree smooth and three wrinkled pea varieties were evaluated for their milling behaviour in a classifier hit mill. Two of the smooth pea types were the commercially available yellow peas and the other a green wild type. The wrinkled pea varieties were mutants of the smooth wild type pea. The site of the mutation was located at the gene that affects the supply of substrate during starch synthesis, which modifies the overall composition of the pea and the size distribution of starch granules. A texture analyser with a Stanley knife set-up was used to measure the energy uptake required to split the pea varieties at different moisture contents. These data were then compared to the energy required to mill the same pea types in a classifier hit mill. In general, the wrinkled mutants required more milling energy than the smooth pea varieties. A positive relationship was found between the energy uptake in the texture analyser and the milling energy for similar peas in all cases, although there were some deviations from linearity. Hence, the texture analyser data can be used to predict milling performance. 3apeas 3amilling quality 3atexture 3afood analysis 3acultivars 3amilling 3amutants 3astarch granules 3aprotein content 3afood composition 3agenotype 0asize 0aenergy consumption 0aclassifier hit mill1 aLangelaan, H.C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 Feb., v. 51, no. 2 p.105-111x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03146naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245005900192300001600251520134100267650000801608650001201616650001101628650001001639650002101649650002001670650002601690650002201716650001901738650001401757650001701771650001501788650002701803650002001830650001201850650002101862650002101883650002901904650001101933650002201944650001401966650003101980650000902011650002602020650001402046651001102060651001102071653001902082653001702101700002502118700001902143700001802162700001702180700001702197773013702214852000902351856009202360930003302452946001102485655001202496IND4410378720221117162420.0080919e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441037872DNAL7 a188037912pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2008.00735.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlloa-Arvizu, R.10aGenetic analysis of Mexican Criollo cattle populations  ap. 351-359.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic structure of Mexican Criollo cattle populations using microsatellite genetic markers. DNA samples were collected from 168 animals from four Mexican Criollo cattle populations, geographically isolated in remote areas of Sierra Madre Occidental (West Highlands). Also were included samples from two breeds with Iberian origin: the fighting bull (n = 24) and the milking central American Criollo (n = 24) and one Asiatic breed: Guzerat (n = 32). Genetic analysis consisted of the estimation of the genetic diversity in each population by the allele number and the average expected heterozygosity found in nine microsatellite loci. Furthermore, genetic relationships among the populations were defined by their genetic distances. Our data shows that Mexican cattle populations have a relatively high level of genetic diversity based either on the mean number of alleles (10.2-13.6) and on the expected heterozygosity (0.71-0.85). The degree of observed homozygosity within the Criollo populations was remarkable and probably caused by inbreeding (reduced effective population size) possibly due to reproductive structure within populations. Our data shows that considerable genetic differentiation has been occurred among the Criollo cattle populations in different regions of Mexico. 3aDNA 3aalleles 3abreeds 3abulls 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahighlands 3ahomozygosity 3ainbreeding 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation size 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA, Satellitexgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aGenetic Carrier Screening. 2aMale 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPhylogeny 3aMexico 0aMexico 0aCriollo cattle 0aF statistics1 aGayosso-Vázquez, A.1 aRamos-Kuri, M.1 aEstrada, F.J.1 aMontaño, M.1 aAlonso, R.A.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2008 Oct., v. 125, no. 5 p.351-359dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2008.00735.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080919b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04230naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245014700141300001600288500001500304520272600319650001603045650001603061650001803077650001503095650002403110650002503134650001403159650000903173650002403182650001203206650002103218650002503239650003503264650003203299650000903331650007103340650002203411650000903433650001703442650003003459653002103489700002603510700001803536700001503554773009003569852000903659939003303668946001103701655001203712IND9206137720221117162426.0921006e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920613772DNAL7 a13182842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, B.10aChronic and continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of neuropeptide Y in Long-Evans rats mimics the feeding behaviour of obese Zucker rats  ap. 295-302.  a2019-12-04  aNeuropeptide Y (NPY), a member of the pancreatic polypeptide family strongly stimulates food intake when injected centrally in animals. It is found in abundance in the brain and particularly in areas involved in the regulation of feeding behaviour. Moreover, in these areas, NPY concentrations are higher in the obese hyperphagic Zucker rat. The aim of the present experiment was to reproduce in normal Long-Evans rats the high central levels of NPY measured in Zucker rats. We therefore continuously infused NPY in the brain lateral ventricle through osmotic mini-pumps and studied the effects of this infusion on different parameters of the feeding behaviour. Male adult Long-Evans rats were fed ad libitum on a high carbohydrate (HC) diet and on a high fat (HF) diet given simultaneously in two separate cups. NPY was infused at a rate of 0.44 micrograms/h (n= 11) and rats infused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (n = 11) served as controls. The infusions lasted 14 days. Total food intake markedly increased in NPY infused rats starting on the first day after pump installation (33.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 14.8 +/- 0.6 g/day; P < 0.0001). This effect lasted for nine days. In these rats, the average food intake during the infusion period (21.0 +/- 1.6 g/day) was also significantly greater than during the pre-infusion period (13.1 +/- 0.5 g/day; P < 0.0001) and the post-infusion period (10.6 + 0.4 g/day; P < 0.0001). This increase was mainly due to an increased intake of HC diet that followed the variations of total food intake and to a lesser extent to the increase in the HF intake that lasted during the five first days of infusion only. NPY infused rats weighed significantly more than the controls and developed abdominal fat mass but their body weight plateaued during the last five days of infusion. The dark light (D/L) pattern was also largely modified by NPY infusion. The D/L ratio for HC intake fell from a value of 4.29 +/- 0.40 to 1.39 +/- 0.07 (P < 0.0001) in the NPY infused rats, with effects lasting during the whole infusion period. The D/L ratio for HF intake was slightly modified during the first days of infusion only. The chronic ICV infusion of neuropeptide Y therefore reproduced the modifications of the eating behaviour observed in the Zucker fatty rat (hyperphagia, overweight, nutrient preference and disturbed diurnal pattern of food intake). The present results support our hypothesis of an important role of NPY in the development of these syndromes. The decreased effects of NPY on body weight and food intake after nine days of continuous infusion might be relevant to the establishment in normal rats of counter-regulatory mechanisms that might be lacking in the obese Zucker rat. 3afood intake 3adietary fat 3aneuropeptides 3aoverweight 3acerebral ventricles 3adietary carbohydrate 3ainjection 3arats 3afeeding preferences 2aAnimals 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFood Preferencesxdrug effects 2aInfusion Pumps, Implantable 2aMale 2aNeuropeptide Yxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aObesityxetiology 2aRats 2aRats, Zucker 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0afeeding behavior1 aStricker-Krongrad, A.1 aNicolas, J.P.1 aBurlet, C.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g1992 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.295-302x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02079naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245010800185300001400293520052700307650001200834650003400846650001500880650002900895650001000924650002400934650001600958650001200974650001200986650001900998650001901017650005601036650003901092650005201131653000901183653000801192653001401200700001401214700001501228700001401243700001301257700001401270700001301284773011901297852000901416856009201425930003301517946001101550655001201561IND4415351220221117162400.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441535122DNAL7 a191963472pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2583.2009.00847.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaori, E.10aIAPV, a bee-affecting virus associated with Colony Collapse Disorder can be silenced by dsRNA ingestion  ap. 55-60.  aColony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has been associated with Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV).

  1 aIgamberdiev, A.U.10aRegulation of NAD- and NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases by reduction levels of pyridine nucleotides in mitochondria and cytosol of pea leaves  ap. 117-125.  aRegulation of NAD- and NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases (NAD-ICDH, EC 1.1.1.41, and NADP-ICDH, EC 1.1.1.42) by the level of reduced and oxidized pyridine nucleotides has been investigated in pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaves. The affinities of mitochondrial and cytosolic ICDH enzymes to substrates and inhibitors were determined on partially purified preparations in forward and reverse directions. From the kinetic data, it follows that NADP+- and NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases in mitochondria represent a system strongly responding to the intramitochondrial NADPH and NADH levels. The NADPH, NADP+, NADH and NAD+ concentrations were determined by subcellular fractionation of pea leaf protoplasts using membrane filtration in mitochondria and cytosol in darkness and in the light under saturating and limiting CO2 conditions. The cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio was about 1 and almost constant both in darkness and in the light. In mitochondria, the NADPH/NADP ratio was low in darkness (0.2) and increased in the light, reaching 3 in limiting CO2 conditions compared to 1 in saturating CO2. At high reduction levels of NADP and NAD observed at limiting CO2 in the light, i.e. when photorespiratory glycine is the main mitochondrial substrate, isocitrate oxidation in mitochondria will be suppressed and citrate will be transported to the cytosol ('citrate valve'), where the cytosolic NADP-ICDH supplies 2-oxoglutarate for the photorespiratory ammonia refixation. 3aPisum sativum 3apeas 3aphotorespiration 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 0aammonia refixation1 aGardestrom, P.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2003 Sept. 30, v. 1606, no. 1-3 p.117-125x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2004/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle01840naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245009300147300001600240520069600256650002600952650001400978650001100992650003701003650001401040650001701054650002401071650001201095650002601107650001101133650003801144650000901182650003001191650001701221653001601238700001401254700001401268773008301282852000901365939003301374946001101407655001201418IND9206134020221123034622.0921006e19920330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920613402DNAL7 a16176872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemleitner, S.10aSynthesis and antitumour activity of derivatives of curdlan and lichenan branched at C-6  ap. 239-246.  aDerivatives of curdlan and lichenan, linear (1 leads to 3)-beta-D- and (1 leads to 3/1 leads to 4)-beta-D-glucans, respectively, have been synthesised having alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl, alpha-L-rhamnosyl, beta-D-glucosyl, and beta-gentiobiosyl side chains attached at positions 6.

  1 aAndreasson, U.10aSpectroscopic characterization of a semi-stable, charge-separated state in Cu2+-substituted reaction centers from Rhodobacter sphaeroides  ap. 45-52.  aIn reaction centers from Rhodobacter sphaeroides exposed to continuous illumination in the presence of an inhibitor of the QA - to Q(B) electron transfer, a semi-stable, charge-separated state was formed with halftimes of formation and decay of several minutes. When the non-heme iron was replaced by Cu2+, the decay of the semi-stable, charge-separated state became much slower than in centers with bound Fe2+ with about the same rate constant for formation. In Cu2+-substituted reaction centers, the semi-stable state was associated with an EPR signal, significantly different from that observed after chemical reduction of the acceptor-side quinone or after illumination at low temperature, but similar to that of an isolated Cu2+ in the absence of magnetic interaction. The EPR results, obtained with Cu2+-substituted reaction centers, suggest that the slow kinetics of formation and decay of the charge-separated, semi-stable state is associated with a structural rearrangement of the acceptor side and the immediate environment of the metal-binding site. 3aphotosynthesis 3acopper 3amolecular conformation 0aconformational change1 aCarlsson, T.1 aAndreasson, L.E.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2003 Oct. 17, v. 1607, no. 1 p.45-52x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2004/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle01609naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245008800147300001600235520045900251650002600710650001500736650002300751650001400774650002200788650003700810650001700847650001200864650002600876650001100902650003800913650000900951650003000960650001700990653001601007700001401023700001401037773008301051852000901134939003301143946001101176655001201187IND9206134120221123034553.0921006e19920330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920613412DNAL7 a16176882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemleitner, S.10aSynthesis and antitumour activity of sulfoalkyl derivatives of curdlan and lichenan  ap. 247-252.  a2-Sulfoethyl, 3-sulfopropyl, and 4-sulfobutyl derivatives of the (1 leads to 3)-beta-D-glucan curdlan and the (1 leads to 3/1 leads to 4)-beta-D-glucan lichenan have been synthesised.

Here we address this assumption and examine how the timing of tablet and food administration can influence small intestine transit time. Methods A non-disintegrating, radiolabelled tablet was given to ten healthy volunteers in a three-way crossover study using three different feeding regimens (1) fasted (tablet administered on an empty stomach and food withheld for four hours) (2) fed (tablet administered after food) and (3) pre-feed (tablet administered 45 min before food). Tablet transit through the gastrointestinal tract was followed using gamma scintigraphy. Results The small intestinal transit times of tablets after fasted and fed dosing regimens were similar, median 204 and 210 min respectively. With the pre-feed dose, small intestinal transit time was significantly shorter than in the fasted or fed state at 141 min. With this dosing regimen, in six of the volunteers tablets were in the upper small intestine when food arrived and these had a median small intestinal transit time of 100 min. Conclusions The timing of food ingestion has a clear effect on small intestinal transit of single-unit formulations and this has implications for drug bioavailability. 3agastrointestinal transit 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdult 2aCross-Over Studies 2aFasting 2aGastric Emptying 2aGastrointestinal Transit 2aHumans 2aIndium Radioisotopesxadministration & dosage 2aIntestine, Smallxphysiologyxradionuclide imaging. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPentetic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aPostprandial Period 2aRadiopharmaceuticalsxadministration & dosage 2aTablets 2aTime Factors 2aYoung Adult 0agamma scintigraphy 0aintestinal flow 0amigrating myoelectric complex 0amodified release 0amotility1 aMcConnell, Emma L. 1 aShort, Michael D. 1 aBasit, Abdul W. 0 tPharmaceutical research.g2009 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.356-360dBoston : Springer USx0724-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11095-008-9749-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03970naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012800125300001400253500001500267520281400282650002203096650001403118650001403132650001403146650002003160650001003180650001503190650001203205650001403217650001003231653001403241653002403255653001403279653001503293653002003308653001903328700001403347700001403361773008303375852000903458930003303467945001303500946001103513655001203524IND2328108120221123034609.0020718e200107  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232810812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzekaj, P.10aMembrane fouling by turbidity constituents of beer and wine: characterization and prevention by means of infrasonic pulsing  ap. 25-36.  a2019-12-05  aDuring microfiltration of fermented beverages such as beer and wine, colloidal turbidity constituents play an important role membrane fouling and therefore hinder the permeate flux. This paper studies polymeric membrane fouling by turbidity constituents of beer and wine and proposes a fouling prevention method to improve permeate flux. The model turbidity suspensions, based on gelatin and tannic acid, were microfiltered in a stirred cell using 0.2 micrometer cellulose acetate (CA), polyvinylidene di-fluoride (PVDF) and polycarbonate (PC) membranes under constant pressure (0.79 bar) and agitation (1350 rpm). Fouling caused by either a separate protein solution or a separate polyphenol solution was considerably lower than the fouling caused by a solution of both at the same concentration, which suggests that fouling is mainly caused by light scattering complexes formed by polyphenols and proteins. In all cases, during the microfiltration of model turbidity suspensions, the internal fouling mechanism dominated first and this was later followed by a period of external fouling. It was shown that membrane fouling depends strongly on the initial turbidity of the solution. A lower turbidity of the model solution resulted in a lower final total resistance. The initial turbidity also influenced the duration of the initial period of internal fouling. For the lower turbidity model solutions internal fouling lasted longer. An infrasonic pulsing was applied to remove foulant cake and improve permeate flux during microfiltration of model turbidity suspensions, and wine and beer samples. In infrasonic pulsing, high frequency pulses of permeate are periodically sent back in the direction of the membrane at a lower pressure than the transmembrane pressure. This causes the membrane to vibrate rapidly and removes a portion of the foulant cake. The model turbidity suspension (33 +/- 2 NTU) was filtered through a flat-sheet PVDF membrane at a transmembrane pressure of 0.65 bar. In the experiments with infrasonic pulsing a 0.2 duty cycle (phi) was used. The improvement in net permeate flux depended on the infrasonic pulse frequency. For the highest frequency (6.67 Hz) net permeate flux improved fourfold in comparison with long-term permeate flux in normal cross-flow. These data fitted very well to the theoretical model first published by Czekaj [Reduccion del Ensuciamiento de Membranas Polimericas en Procesos de Microfiltracion Tangencial de Suspensiones Biologicas Mediante Utilizacion de Infrasonidos y de la Tecnica de Flujo Transversal, PhD Thesis, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Spain] Experiments with wine and beer samples filtered through a PS hollow fiber membrane yielded approximately 2.4 and 2.1 times larger permeate fluxes with infrasonic pulsing than with normal cross-flow. 3asimulation models 3aequations 3aturbidity 3afrequency 3amicrofiltration 3awines 3awinemaking 3abrewing 3apermeates 3abeers 0amembranes 0amathematical models 0apulsation 0adeposition 0afood processing 0asound pressure1 aLopez, F.1 aGuell, C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 July, v. 49, no. 1 p.25-36x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03035naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007000127300001400197520182200211650001802033650001202051650001902063650001802082650001802100650001602118650002102134650002102155650001002176650001602186650001602202650001802218650001302236650001202249650001502261650001202276650001402288650001102302653002702313653001102340700001302351700001502364700001302379773008302392852000902475930003302484945001302517946001102530655001202541IND2328108520221123024328.0020718e200107  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232810852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamesh, M.N.10aInfluence of processing parameters on the drying of spice paprika  ap. 63-72.  aPaprika is utilized for its strong colour and has very little pungency. The quality of ground paprika is mainly determined by its seasoning power i.e., capsaicin content its natural colour i.e., carotenoid content, its particle size and water content. Selection of proper drying conditions is necessary for minimizing thermal stress, over-drying and maintenance of relevant compounds which determine the quality of the product. Loss of red colour is caused by autoxidation of the carotenoids. It is reported that the stability of the quality of paprika, during storage is dependent on drying conditions and the degradation rate of quality increases as the drying temperature increases. In view of the importance of this spice product standardization of processing protocol is necessary. Transport properties in terms of interphase mass and heat transfer along with the diffusion coefficient were determined for paprika from drying experiments. The analysis includes the comprehensive process including the form of the product like whole fruit or pericarp, various preprocessing steps like cutting, separating, steam blanching and drying. Drying was carried out using both a conventional pilot scale convective dryer and a laboratory dryer with the additional facility of drying under inert atmosphere. For processing under inert gas, the pre- and post-drying steps of cutting, separating and grinding the product before storage were also carried out under inert conditions The influence of these pre-processing steps on the drying behaviour was characterized by determining the transport properties. Additionally, the product was also analyzed for its red colour intensity (ASTA) value, tocopherol, carotenoids and vitamin C content, to evaluate the best possible processing protocol to obtain a good quality product. 3awater content 3apaprika 3adrying quality 3aheat transfer 3amass transfer 3adiffusivity 3afood composition 3anutrient content 3acolor 3atocopherols 3acarotenoids 3aascorbic acid 3apericarp 3acutting 3aseparation 3awashing 3ablanching 3adrying 0acontrolled atmospheres 0afruits1 aWolf, W.1 aTevini, D.1 aJung, G.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 July, v. 49, no. 1 p.63-72x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02353naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245009700180300001600277520086800293650002001161650001901181650001101200650001501211650001501226650000901241650001001250650000901260650001301269650001101282650001101293650000901304650001601313650002601329650001501355650001401370650001201384651001101396653002001407653002801427653002701455700002101482700002501503700002301528773013401551852000901685856008501694930003301779946001101812655001201823IND4414177020221123024523.0081226e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441417702DNAL7 a190345312pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-008-0194-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnez, Igor 10aPsychological mechanisms in outdoor place and weather assessment: towards a conceptual model  ap. 101-111.  aThe general aim has been to illuminate the psychological mechanisms involved in outdoor place and weather assessment. This reasoning was conceptualized in a model, tentatively proposing direct and indirect links of influence in an outdoor place-human relationship. The model was subsequently tested by an empirical study, performed in a Nordic city, on the impact of weather and personal factors on participants' perceptual and emotional estimations of outdoor urban places. In line with our predictions, we report significant influences of weather parameters (air temperature, wind, and cloudlessness) and personal factors (environmental attitude and age) on participants' perceptual and emotional estimations of outdoor urban places. All this is a modest, yet significant, step towards an understanding of the psychology of outdoor place and weather assessment. 3aair temperature 3abioclimatology 3amodels 3aprediction 3apsychology 3awind 2aAdult 2aAged 2aEmotions 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aModels, Psychological 2aPerception 2aSensation 2aWeather 0aSweden 0aThermal comfort 0aCognitions and emotions 0aEnvironmental attitude1 aThorsson, Sofia 1 aEliasson, Ingegärd 1 aLindberg, Fredrik 0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2009 Jan., v. 53, no. 1 p.101-111dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-008-0194-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081226b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02994naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012300126300001600249520189200265650001602157650002502173650002102198650003002219650001802249650001302267650002002280650002002300650003302320650001902353650002102372651001602393653002502409653001902434700002102453773008102474852000902555939003302564946001102597655001202608IND9206135220221123024411.0921006e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920613522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchot, P.P.10aHuman impact on regional groundwater composition through intervention in natural flow patterns and changes in land use  ap. 297-313.  aThe relations between groundwater composition, land use, soil conditions and flow patterns on a regional scale are studied for the Gooi and Vechtstreek area in the Netherlands. This densely populated area consists of a glacier-created ridge with dry sand soils bordered by the Vecht and Eem River plains with wet peat and clay soils. R-mode factor analysis and Q-mode cluster analysis were applied to a set of 1349 groundwater analyses to determine the factors controlling groundwater composition and the main resulting water types. The results indicate that groundwater composition in the study area is affected on a regional scale by human activities through changes in land use and intervention in natural flow patterns. On the ridge, ground water is recharged by precipitation, which dissolves carbonates from the matrix of the sandy aquifer. Increased solute concentrations in shallow ground water, especially of nitrate, sulphate and potassium, indicate increased pollution resulting from urbanization and increasingly intensive agricultural activity over the past decades. In the Vecht River plain infiltration occurs as a result of drainage of polders and groundwater extraction on the ridge. Recharge occurs by precipitation and from polluted surface water to which ammonium, organic complexes and carbonic acid are added through decomposition of organic matter in the peat and clay soils. The carbonic acid results in enhanced dissolution of carbonates present in the soil and the underlying sandy aquifer. Oxygen depletion and subsequent low redox potentials result in denitrification, dissolution of manganese and iron oxides, and sulphate reduction. The flow of ground water from high-level to low-level polders causes displacement of a former stagnant brackish groundwater body under the Vecht River plain accompanied by increased mixing of fresh and brackish ground water. 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3agroundwater flow 3agroundwater contamination 3awater quality 3aland use 3aedaphic factors 3ahydrologic data 3aprincipal component analysis 3ahydrochemistry 3acluster analysis 3aNetherlands 0acorrelation analysis 0ahuman activity1 aWal, J. van der.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1992 June, v. 134, no. 1/4 p.297-313x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03071naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245007300170300001800243520207300261653001402334653002802348653001402376653001602390653002102406653001402427653003002441700001702471773011202488852000902600856009202609930003302701946001102734655001202745IND4412727320221123024351.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441272732DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00959.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFORTUIN, A.R.10aEvidence for Late Messinian seismites, Nijar Basin, south-east Spain  ap. 1595-1622.  aThe Feos Formation of the Nijar Basin comprises sediments deposited during the final stage of the Messinian salinity crisis when the Mediterranean was almost totally isolated. Levels of soft-sediment deformation structures occur in both conglomeratic alluvial sediments deposited close to faults and the hyposaline Lago Mare facies, a laminated and thin-bedded succession of whitish chalky marls and intercalated sands alternating with non-marine coastal plain deposits. Deformation structures in the coarse clastics include funnel-shaped depressions filled with conglomerate, liquefaction dykes terminating downwards in gravel pockets, soft-sediment mixing bodies, chaotic intervals and flame structures. Evidence for soft-sediment deformation in the fine-grained Lago Mare facies comprises syndepositional faulting and fault-grading, sandstone dykes, mixed layers, slumping and sliding of sandstone beds, convolute bedding, and pillar and flame structures. The soft-sediment deformed intervals resemble those ascribed elsewhere to seismic shaking. Moreover, the study area provides the appropriate conditions for the preservation of deformation structures induced by seismicity; such as location in a tectonically active area, variable sediment input to produce heterolithic deposits and an absence of bioturbation. The vertical distribution of soft-sediment deformation implies frequent seismic shocks, underlining the importance of seismicity in the Betic region during the Late Messinian when the Nijar Basin became separated from the Sorbas Basin to the north. The presence of liquefied gravel injections in the marginal facies indicates strong earthquakes (M greater-than-or-equal 7). The identification of at least four separate fissured levels within a single Lago Mare interval suggests a recurrence interval for large magnitude earthquakes of the order of millennia, assuming that the cyclicity of the alternating Lago Mare and continental intervals was precession-controlled. This suggestion is consistent with the present-day seismic activity in SE Spain. 0aLago Mare 0aliquefaction structures 0aMessinian 0aNijar Basin 0apalaeoseismology 0aseismites 0asoft-sediment deformation1 aDABRIO, C.J.0 tSedimentology.g2008 Dec., v. 55, no. 6 p.1595-1622dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0037-07467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00959.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02890naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100002800155245011900183300001600302500002400318520129000342650002201632650001701654650001701671650001301688650002101701650002001722650002101742650001901763650002001782650002001802650001101822650001901833650001901852650001101871650001301882650001201895650001101907650001101918650001401929650001501943650002601958653001701984700001702001700002202018773012902040852000902169856007702178930003302255945002502288946001102313655001202324IND4415192320221123010816.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441519232DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.34562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF5001 aHargreaves, Jennifer C.10aAre compost teas an effective nutrient amendment in the cultivation of strawberries? Soil and plant tissue effects  ap. 390-397.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Compost teas are purported to serve as an effective source of nutrients; however, there is little scientific evidence to support or refute this claim. Compost tea infusions made with municipal solid waste compost and ruminant compost were used as amendments for strawberry cultivation and their efficacy was compared to municipal solid waste (MSW) compost, ruminant compost, and fertilizer amendments. A variety of parameters were examined including the nutrient, micronutrient and metal concentrations of soil and leaf tissue, pH, total soil carbon and nitrogen, and mineralized nitrogen.RESULTS: Compost tea treatments provided similar amounts of most macro- and micronutrients compared to MSW compost, ruminant compost, and fertilizer treatments and subsequently to strawberry plants. The MSW compost added significantly greater amounts of Ca, Na, and S to soil with increased plant uptake while the ruminant compost treatment plots had significantly greater available soil P. The compost and fertilizer treatments also provided greater amounts of K to soil compared to the compost tea treatments.CONCLUSIONS: In a 2 year study, non-aerated compost teas were effective nutrient amendments for strawberries compared to ruminant and MSW compost, and inorganic fertilizers. 3aFragaria ananassa 3astrawberries 3aMSW composts 3aextracts 3acomposted manure 3asoil amendments 3anutrient content 3atrace elements 3amineral content 3anutrient uptake 3aleaves 3asoil fertility 3asoil chemistry 3acarbon 3anitrogen 3acalcium 3asodium 3asulfur 3apotassium 3aphosphorus 3anutrient availability 0acompost teas1 aAdl, M.

We aimed to evaluate the frequency and severity of anaemia and other haematological changes among patients with Sheehan's syndrome, in comparison with healthy controls. Sixty-five SS patients and 55 age-matched female healthy controls were included. Biochemical and hormonal assessments and haematological evaluations were carried out, and groups were compared. The mean number of red blood cells, as well as mean haemoglobin, iron and erythropoietin levels, total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation were all significantly lower in SS patients compared to controls. SS patients had significantly higher rates of anaemia (80.0% vs. 25.5%, p = 0.0001), iron deficiency (44.6% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.001), leukopenia (20.0% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.015), thrombocytopenia (9.2% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.028) and bicytopenia (21.5% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.001) compared to controls. Anaemic SS patients had normochromic-normocytic anaemia (55%) or hypochromic-microcytic anaemia (45%). Anaemia is frequently associated with Sheehan's syndrome and responds to appropriate replacement therapy. Hypopituitarism should be considered as a possible cause of anaemia, and a hormone examination should be undertaken promptly, particularly in patients with anaemia resistant to therapy and/or with a history suggestive of Sheehan's syndrome. 3aanemia 2aAdult 2aAnemiaxetiology 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxetiology 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypopituitarismxcomplications 2aIncidence 2aLeukopeniaxetiology 2aMiddle Aged 2aThrombocytopeniaxetiology 0aHormone replacement therapy 0aanemia (disease) 0aSheehan's syndrome 0aHypopituitarism1 aTuzcu, Alpaslan 1 aBahceci, Mithat 1 aArikan, Senay 1 aBahceci, Selen 1 aPasa, Semir 0 tAnnals of hematology.g2009 May, v. 88, no. 5 p.405-410dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0939-55557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00277-008-0607-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02474naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245006700123300001600190500008300206500001500289520110700304650001801411650001101429650001101440650001301451650001001464650002001474650001601494650002101510650001801531650001901549650001101568653002401579653002401603653001001627653002401637653001101661653001301672653002201685700001601707700001601723700001501739700002301754700002701777773008601804852000901890930003301899945001301932946001101945655001201956IND2327973620221123011152.0020710e200109  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232797362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFito, P.10aVacuum impregnation for development of new dehydrated products  ap. 297-302.  aIn the special issue: Drying /edited by G.V. Barbosa-Canovas and R.G. Moreira.  a2019-12-05  aVacuum impregnation (VI) of structured foods implies the partial release of gas from pores and its substitution by an external liquid. Therefore, important changes in physicochemical and structural properties take place in the food and these affect its behavior in drying operations (air-drying (AD) and/or osmotic dehydration (OD)). The adequate control of VI prior to dehydration may be used as a tool both to improve mass transfer and to develop engineered products. In order to evaluate this alternative, the effectiveness of VI as a tool in porous matrix formulation is analyzed. Likewise, its influence on some physical and transport properties of the plant tissue and the relevant changes induced in osmotic and convective drying processes are discussed, since these are probably the most interesting alternative processes to lengthen the impregnated product shelf-life. Improved yield of some dehydration processes, such as fruit candyin, when VI is applied at the beginning, is also discussed in terms of the cell network relaxation mechanism, responsible for hydrodynamic tissue impregnation. 3aplant tissues 3aapples 3avolume 3aporosity 3acandy 3afood processing 3adried fruit 3afood composition 3amass transfer 3aultrastructure 3adrying 0aphysical properties 0aosmotic dehydration 0afruit 0avacuum impregnation 0avacuum 0acandying 0aconvective drying1 aChiralt, A.1 aBarat, J.M.1 aAndres, A.1 aMartinez-Monzo, J.1 aMartinez-Navarette, N.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 Sept., v. 49, no. 4 p.297-302x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03760naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245019100195300001600386520159300402650001401995650001202009650002002021650001802041650002102059650001502080650001202095650001002107650001002117650001802127650001402145650002502159650001802184650001002202650001202212650002402224650002102248650004102269650004102310650002802351650001402379650003002393650002702423650008302450651001102533651001302544651001102557651001802568651001302586651001102599653002002610700002502630700002002655700002102675700002402696700002102720700002102741700002502762773012802787852000902915856009202924930003303016946001303049655001203062IND4411586820221123010707.0081017e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441158682DNAL7 a190170632pmid7 a10.1111/j.1550-7408.2008.00342.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFERREIRA, ROBSON C.12aA Phylogenetic Lineage of Closely Related Trypanosomes (Trypanosomatidae, Kinetoplastida) of Anurans and Sand Flies (Psychodidae, Diptera) Sharing the Same Ecotopes in Brazilian Amazonia  ap. 427-435.  aAnalysis of the phylogenetic relationships among trypanosomes from vertebrates and invertebrates disclosed a new lineage of trypanosomes circulating among anurans and sand flies that share the same ecotopes in Brazilian Amazonia. This assemblage of closely related trypanosomes was determined by comparing whole SSU rDNA sequences of anuran trypanosomes from the Brazilian biomes of Amazonia, the Pantanal, and the Atlantic Forest and from Europe, North America, and Africa, and from trypanosomes of sand flies from Amazonia. Phylogenetic trees based on maximum likelihood and parsimony corroborated the positioning of all new anuran trypanosomes in the aquatic clade but did not support the monophyly of anuran trypanosomes. However, all analyses always supported four major clades (An01-04) of anuran trypanosomes. Clade An04 is composed of trypanosomes from exotic anurans. Isolates in clades An01 and An02 were from Brazilian frogs and toads captured in the three biomes studied, Amazonia, the Pantanal and the Atlantic Forest. Clade An01 contains mostly isolates from Hylidae whereas clade An02 comprises mostly isolates from Bufonidae; and clade An03 contains trypanosomes from sand flies and anurans of Bufonidae, Leptodactylidae, and Leiuperidae exclusively from Amazonia. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing morphological and growth features, and molecular phylogenetic affiliation of trypanosomes from anurans and phlebotomines, incriminating these flies as invertebrate hosts and probably also as important vectors of Amazonian terrestrial anuran trypanosomes. 3aBufonidae 3aHylidae 3aLeptodactylidae 3aPhlebotominae 3aTrypanosomatidae 3aecosystems 3aforests 3afrogs 3ahosts 3ainvertebrates 3amonophyly 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal DNA 3atoads 2aAnimals 2aAnuraxparasitology 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Protozoanxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPsychodidaexparasitology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTrypanosomatinaxclassificationxcytologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 3aAfrica 3aAmazonia 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aPantanal 0aBrazil 0aribosomal genes1 aDE SOUZA, ADELSON A.1 aFREITAS, RUI A.1 aCampaner, Marta.1 aTAKATA, CARMEM S.A.1 aBARRETT, TOBY V.1 aSHAW, JEFFREY J.1 aTEIXEIRA, MARTA M.G.0 tJournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2008 , v. 55, no. 5 p.427-435dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1066-52347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1550-7408.2008.00342.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02021naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009900124300001400223500014900237520100600386650002401392650003601416650002001452650002201472650002501494651002301519773008901542852000901631856003501640939003301675946001101708655001201719IND9304398420221122234911.0930805e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930439842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, T.K.10aRambutan industry in the Northern Territory--current status, research and development emphasis  ap. 62-70.  aPaper presented at the: International Symposium on Tropical Fruit: Frontier in Tropical Fruit Research, May 20-24, 1991, Pattaya City, Thailand.  aRambutan is gaining in commercial importance in the Northern Territory. Plantings have increased appreciably to about 20,000 trees. Production is confined to areas around Darwin, north of the Adelaide River because of constraints of salinity and temperature. Currently, the markets are small but rather lucrative; largely interstate and to a smaller extent local. Rambutan is complementary to mango as it crops immediately after the mango crop in October, and comes in earlier than rambutan in Queensland. To sustain the growth of the rambutan industry, research and development emphases are stressed on a wide range of topics, notable among which are :i) to understand the interaction of meteorological factors and irrigation cum fertilisation practices so as to sustain early flowering and fruit set; ii) to reduce the adverse impact of ants-mealy bugs-sooty mould infestation and bird damage by environment- and user-friendly approaches; and iii) to extend the post-harvest shelf-life of the fruit. 3aNephelium lappaceum 3atropical and subtropical fruits 3acrop production 3aresearch projects 3adevelopment projects 3aNorthern Territory0 tActa horticulturae.g1992 Oct., , no. 321 p.62-70wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40u10.17660/ActaHortic.1992.321.5  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02053naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008200131300001600213500008300229520091700312650001801229650002001247650001101267650003001278650001001308650000901318650001301327650001601340650001101356650002401367650000801391653002501399653001701424700002401441700002601465773008601491852000901577930003301586945001301619946001101632655001201643IND2327973420221122234844.0020710e200109  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232797342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega-Mercado, H.10aAdvances in dehydration of foods.

The evolution of drying technology, divided into four generations, is thoroughly reviewed, from tray drying to the combination of some drying technologies (the hurdle technology approach in drying) in order to optimize the process in terms of final food quality and energy consumption. The study of each generation covered numerous examples of different dryers, including their principles of operation, basic configurations and most common applications, as well as their main advantages and disadvantages. 3awater content 3afood processing 3adrying 3afood processing equipment 3awater 3aheat 3ahumidity 3atemperature 3adryers 3amicrowave treatment 3aair 0apsychrometric charts 0apsychrometry1 aGongora-Nieto, M.M.1 aBarbosa-Canovas, G.V.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 Sept., v. 49, no. 4 p.271-289x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02537naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245014000142300001400282500001500296520151300311650002801824650001901852650002201871650003601893653002001929653001901949700001701968700001801985700001602003773009002019852000902109930003302118945002502151946001102176655001202187IND4362788720221122234854.0040604e20040130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436278872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFyfe, P.K.10aDisruption of a specific molecular interaction with a bound lipid affects the thermal stability of the purple bacterial reaction centre  ap. 11-22.  a2019-12-05  aRelatively little is known about the functions of specific molecular interactions between membrane proteins and membrane lipids. The structural and functional consequences of disrupting a previously identified interaction between a molecule of the diacidic lipid cardiolipin and the purple bacterial reaction centre were examined. Mutagenesis of a highly conserved arginine (M267) that is responsible for binding the head-group of the cardiolipin (to leucine) did not affect the rate of photosynthetic growth, the functional properties of the reaction centre, or the X-ray crystal structure of the complex (determined to a resolution of 2.8 angstrom). However, the thermal stability of the protein was compromised by this mutation, part of the reaction centre population showing an approximately 5 °C decrease in melting temperature in response to the arginine to leucine mutation. The crystallised mutant reaction centre also no longer bound detectable amounts of cardiolipin at this site. Taken together, these observations suggest that this particular protein-lipid interaction contributes to the thermal stability of the complex, at least when in detergent micelles. These findings are discussed in the light of proposals concerning the unfolding processes that occur when membrane proteins are heated, and we propose that one function of the cardiolipin is to stabilise the interaction between adjacent membrane-spanning alpha-helices in a region where there are no direct protein-protein interactions. 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3aheat stability 3amembrane proteins 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers 0amembrane lipids 0aphotosynthesis1 aIsaacs, N.W.1 aCogdell, R.J.1 aJones, M.R.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2004 Jan. 30, v. 1608, no. 1 p.11-22x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2004/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02186naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245004700192300001400239500001500253520096900268650002201237650002601259650001101285650000901296650002801305650002801333653002701361653002401388653001701412700002101429700002001450700001801470700001401488773012901502852000901631856009201640930003301732946001101765655001201776IND4414725820221122234904.0090109e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441472582DNAL7 a182985672pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2605.2008.00875.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuratori, Monica10aMolecular markers of human sperm functions  ap. 25-45.  a2019-12-04  aFertilization is a stepwise process that allows two mature gametes to reach each other, fuse and eventually give rise to a new individual. Despite the tremendous importance of reproduction for species development and maintenance, fertility is decreasing worldwide, with peaks in western countries. It is estimated that about 7% of men experiences problems in conceiving a child because of sperm defects. In such a situation, understanding which are the essential sperm players in each of the steps of the fertilization process is essential for the development of new pharmacological strategies to treat the infertile men, for genetic screening of idiopathic male infertility as well as to produce effective male contraceptive agents. The present review will summarize recent evidence for the identification and characterization of molecular markers of sperm functions with emphasis on post-ejaculatory maturation events and the process of sperm-oocyte interaction. 3aacrosome reaction 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSperm-Ovum Interactions 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 0asperm-zona interaction 0asperm-oocyte fusion 0acapacitation1 aLuconi, Michaela1 aMarchiani, Sara1 aForti, Gianni1 aBaldi, E.0 tInternational journal of andrology.g2009 Feb., v. 32, no. 1 p.25-45dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-62637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2605.2008.00875.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02521naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100002000198245006100218300001600279500001500295520091800310650001701228650002401245650001701269650001801286650002101304650002501325650002601350650001801376650005001394650003201444650001201476650003901488650005401527650001701581650003201598653002801630653001601658700001801674700001501692700001601707700001701723773007601740852000901816856008501825930003301910945002501943946001101968655001201979IND4363124720221122220841.0040629e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436312472DNAL7 a147585032pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-003-0749-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The regenerates were micropropagated from cultures that originated from 15-year-old progeny of plus trees. Two plus trees aged over 70 years showed recalcitrant responses. Thidiazuron in combination with 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) induced a significantly higher number of shoots per explant than the most optimal BAP treatment (5.88 vs. 3.05 shoots). Woody plant medium and Dubovsk minimal medium had no significant effects on shoot formation and multiplication rates. All plantlets raised in vitro were phenotypically normal and successfully hardened to ex vitro conditions. Two experimental field plots with 3-year-old in vitro-propagated trees were established. 3aforest trees 3aindole butyric acid 3aUlmus glabra 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3aphenylurea compounds 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 2aAdeninexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aCulture Mediaxpharmacology 2aKinetin 2aPhenylurea Compoundsxpharmacology 2aPlant Shootsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aThiadiazoles 2aUlmusxgrowth & development 0aplant growth substances 0athidiazuron1 aSpisakova, K.1 aLiptak, S.1 aPichler, V.1 aDurkovic, J.0 tPlant cell reports.g2004 Apr., v. 22, no. 9 p.640-644x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-003-0749-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/07/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02759naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100002500215245012300240300001600363520089900379650002701278650001401305650001401319650002201333650001001355650001901365650002601384650002101410650002501431650002001456650001701476650002301493650001901516650003001535650002201565650002501587650002301612650002901635650002601664650004301690650001701733650002401750650002801774653002801802700001701830700001501847700001401862700001801876773007601894852000901970856008501979930003302064945002502097946001102122655001202133IND4363139420221122220959.0040629e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436313942DNAL7 a147455032pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-004-0756-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Single roots were selected according to their morphology in the absence of antibiotic or herbicide resistance markers. Seventy-one putative transformed hairy root lines from independent transformation events were established. Regeneration was induced in MS liquid medium supplemented with 30 micromolar 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), and the regenerants were multiplied on MS solid medium containing 10 micromolar BA. Following elongation on MS medium supplemented with 1 micromolar BA and 500 mg/l polyvinylpyrrolidone, the shoots were subjected to a root-inducing treatment. Stable integration of TL-DNA within the horse chestnut genome was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The copy number of transgenes was estimated to be from two to four. 3aAesculus hippocastanum 3achestnuts 3anut crops 3atransgenic plants 3aroots 3atissue culture 3ain vitro regeneration 3amicropropagation 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3agenetic vectors 3atransfer DNA 3abeta-glucuronidase 3areporter genes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aSouthern blotting 3anucleotide sequences 2aAesculusxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aRegeneration 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data1 aMuhovski, Y.1 aDruart, P.1 aCalic, D.1 aRadojevic, L.0 tPlant cell reports.g2004 Apr., v. 22, no. 9 p.698-704x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-004-0756-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/07/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01673naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009400167300001300261520075100274653001601025653002201041653003401063653002001097700002501117773010301142852000901245856008501254930003301339946001101372655001201383IND4433993420221122220944.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443399342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10887-009-9048-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoepke, Matthias 10aDo international labor standards contribute to the persistence of the child-labor problem  ap. 1-31.  aIn recent years, a number of governments and consumer groups in rich countries have tried to discourage the use of child-labor in poor countries through measures such as product boycotts and the imposition of international labor standards. The purported objective of such measures is to reduce the incidence of child-labor in developing countries and thereby improve children's welfare. In this paper, we examine the effects of such policies from a political-economy perspective. We show that these types of international action on child-labor tend to lower domestic political support within developing countries for banning child-labor. Hence, international labor standards and product boycotts may delay the ultimate eradication of child-labor. 0aChild labor 0aPolitical economy 0aInternational labor standards 0aTrade sanctions1 aZilibotti, Fabrizio 0 tJournal of economic growth.g2010 Mar., v. 15, no. 1 p.1-31dBoston : Springer USx1381-43387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10887-009-9048-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02046naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245016000125300001600285520088700301650001601188650001301204650001501217650001401232650001601246650002301262650002001285650001401305650001901319650001901338650001601357650002001373650000901393650001701402650001301419653001801432653001701450700002101467773008301488852000901571939003301580946001101613655001201624IND9206139120221122220928.0921006e19920801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920613912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, M.L.10aRefeeding meal-fed rats increases lipoprotein liapse activity and deposition of dietary [14C]lipid in white adipose tissue and decreases oxidation to 14CO2  ap. 773-778.  aMeal-fed (3 h) rats had a decreased food intake, body weight and carcass fat compared with rats fed ad libitum. On refeeding a chow meal containing [1-14C]triolein, the production of 14CO2 was lower (45%) and the accumulation of carcass [14C]lipid higher (37%) in the meal-fed rats. There was higher lipoprotein lipase activity and greater accumulation of [14C]lipid in the epididymal and subcutaneous adipose-tissue depots of the meal-fed rats. In contrast, heparin-releasable lipoprotein lipase was not increased in perfused hearts of meal-fed rats on refeeding. Return of meal-fed rats to feeding ad libitum reversed these changes before the restoration of body weight or carcass fat. Evidence is presented that decreased dietary intake rather than meal pattern is an important determinant of the alterations in adipose lipid metabolism in the meal-fed rat in response to a meal. 3adietary fat 3atriolein 3astarvation 3arepletion 3alipogenesis 3alipoprotein lipase 3aenzyme activity 3aoxidation 3acarbon dioxide 3aadipose tissue 3abody weight 3ablood chemistry 3arats 3amalnutrition 3abody fat 0ameal patterns 0ameal feeding1 aWilliamson, D.H.0 tBiochemical journal.g1992 Aug. 1, v. 285, no. pt.3 p.773-778x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01819naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245006100213300001400274520091700288653002101205653001501226653001401241700002001255773010401275852000901379856008501388930003301473946001101506655001201517IND4433993620221122192354.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443399362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10887-010-9050-12doi7 aPMC38671412pmcid7 a243636042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalemli-Ozcan, Sebnem 10aMortality change, the uncertainty effect, and retirement  ap. 65-91.  aWe examine the role of declining mortality in explaining the rise of retirement over the course of the twentieth century. We construct a model in which individuals make labor/leisure choices over their lifetimes subject to uncertainty about their dates of death. In an environment with high mortality, an individual who saves for retirement faces a high risk of dying before he can enjoy his planned leisure. In this case, the optimal plan is for people to work until they die. As mortality falls, however, it becomes optimal to plan, and save for, retirement. We analyze our model using two mathematical formulations of the survival function as well as data on actual changes in the US life table over the last century, and show that this “uncertainty effect” of declining mortality would have more than outweighed the “horizon effect” by which rising life expectancy would have led to later retirement. 0aLife cycle model 0aRetirement 0aAnnuities1 aWeil, David N. 0 tJournal of economic growth.g2010 Mar., v. 15, no. 1 p.65-91dBoston : Springer USx1381-43387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10887-010-9050-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02758naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100002000215245010600235300001600341520101400357650002301371650001201394650001601406650002201422650002701444650002001471650003401491650001501525650001501540650001801555650001201573650001201585650001201597650002501609650001801634650002001652650004401672650002501716650004301741650002801784653003201812653002401844653002801868700001701896700001601913773007601929852000902005856008502014930003302099945002502132946001102157655001202168IND4363138920221122192411.0040629e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436313892DNAL7 a147270532pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-003-0746-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Proliferating immature zygotic embryos were used as target tissue for bombardment using a particle inflow gun. Different culture and selection strategies were assessed in order to obtain an optimised mannose selection protocol. Stable integration of the manA gene into the genome of pearl millet was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Stable integration of the manA transgene into the genome of pearl millet was demonstrated in T1 and T2 progeny of two independent transformation events with no more than four to ten copies of the transgene. Similar to results obtained from previous studies with maize and wheat, the manA gene was shown to be a superior selectable marker gene for improving transformation efficiencies when compared to antibiotic or herbicide selectable marker genes. 3aPennisetum glaucum 3amillets 3agrain crops 3atransgenic plants 3agenetic transformation 3asomatic embryos 3amannose-6-phosphate isomerase 3atransgenes 3abiomarkers 3aculture media 3amannose 3asucrose 3aglucose 3anucleotide sequences 2aCulture Media 2aGenetic Markers 2aMannose-6-Phosphate Isomerasexgenetics 2aPennisetumxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 0amicroprojectile bombardment 0amannose-6-phosphate 0amolecular sequence data1 aBurger, J.T.1 aBotha, F.C.0 tPlant cell reports.g2004 Apr., v. 22, no. 9 p.684-690x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-003-0746-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/07/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02838naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245013800165300001600303500002400319520169200343650001602035650002302051650001702074650002602091650002102117650002302138650002002161650001402181650001602195700001802211700002102229700001402250700001702264773011902281852000902400856005502409655001202464IND4426717820221122150146.0091002e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442671782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00235.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLO, Y.M.10aEffects of intermolecular interactions and molecular orientation on the flux behavior of xanthan gum solutions during ultrafiltration  ap. 623-644.  aIncludes references  aConformational changes of xanthan gum as a function of concentration were investigated to elucidate its unusual flux behavior during ultrafiltration (UF). The contribution of hydrogen bonding on structure formation and the molecular orientation of xanthan gum on the flow characteristics were studied rheomechanically and rheo-optically. Known to affect xanthan structure at low concentrations, hydrogen bonding unexpectedly did not show significant influence on xanthan rheological properties up to 2 wt %. The ordered layers formed on the membrane surface proved responsible for the enhanced water removal during UF. This unique behavior could be attributed to the formation of aligned molecular orientation in addition to the viscosity increases during the biphasic region. Significant differences were observed between xanthan fermentation broth and solutions made of commercial xanthan, suggesting the need to control the salt concentration in fermentation broth in order to make UF an effective recovery process for xanthan gum after fermentation. The knowledge gained from the present study strengthens fundamental understandings on the conformational changes of xanthan biopolymers during the recovery of xanthan gum from fermentation broth using ultrafiltration (UF). By taking advantage of the aligned molecular orientation, along with controlling the salt concentration in the fermentation broth, UF could be operated at elevated flux to speed up the removal of water from the viscous fermentation broth. The technology should find broad applications in the fermentation industry, especially where viscosity is of concern during the separation and purification of the product. 3abiopolymers 3achemical structure 3afermentation 3afermentation industry 3ahydrogen bonding 3asalt concentration 3aultrafiltration 3aviscosity 3axanthan gum1 aZIEGLER, R.C.1 aARGIN-SOYSAL, S.1 aHSU, C.H.1 aWAGNER, N.J.0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2009 Oct., v. 32, no. 5 p.623-644dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00235.x 7aarticle03213naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245006600188300001600254520128100270650001201551650001901563650002901582650001001611650001201621650001801633650001301651650001001664650001101674650002901685650001401714650001301728650001701741650001601758650001201774650005101786650006101837650004601898650003101944650001101975650005001986650000902036650004102045650002202086650004002108653002702148653002502175653001102200653001802211653002002229653001902249700001602268700001802284773012802302852000902430856009202439930003302531946001102564655001202575IND4416538420221122105349.0090220e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441653842DNAL7 a191708152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01664.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCASTELLA, G.10aMating triggers dynamic immune regulations in wood ant queens  ap. 564-570.  aMating can affect female immunity in multiple ways. On the one hand, the immune system may be activated by pathogens transmitted during mating, sperm and seminal proteins, or wounds inflicted by males. On the other hand, immune defences may also be down-regulated to reallocate resources to reproduction. Ants are interesting models to study post-mating immune regulation because queens mate early in life, store sperm for many years, and use it until their death many years later, while males typically die after mating. This long-term commitment between queens and their mates limits the opportunity for sexual conflict but raises the new constraint of long-term sperm survival. In this study, we examine experimentally the effect of mating on immunity in wood ant queens. Specifically, we compared the phenoloxidase and antibacterial activities of mated and virgin Formica paralugubris queens. Queens had reduced levels of active phenoloxidase after mating, but elevated antibacterial activity 7 days after mating. These results indicate that the process of mating, dealation and ovary activation triggers dynamic patterns of immune regulation in ant queens that probably reflect functional responses to mating and pathogen exposure that are independent of sexual conflict. 3aFormica 3aanimal ovaries 3aantibacterial properties 3adeath 3afemales 3aimmune system 3aimmunity 3amales 3amodels 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3apathogens 3aproteins 3areproduction 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aAntsxenzymologyximmunologyxphysiology. 2aArthrobacterxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aHemolymphxchemistryxenzymologyximmunology. 2aMale 2aMonophenol Monooxygenasexmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 0aantibacterial activity 0aFormica paralugubris 0amating 0aphenoloxidase 0asexual conflict 0asperm survival1 aCHRISTE, P.1 aCHAPUISAT, M.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2009 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.564-570dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01664.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02761naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008900144300001800233520133600251650001301587650004301600650001601643650002801659650000901687650001801696650002201714650003501736650002701771650002301798650004001821650003901861650006601900650002301966650004901989650002402038650004802062653001902110653002202129700001602151773008302167852000902250939003302259946001102292655001202303IND9205117620221122105338.0920813e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920511762DNAL7 a13181132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhush, R.S.10aIndependent transposition of multiple Ac elements in the same transgenic tomato cell  ap. 1065-1072.  aTo effectively use transposable elements for the genetic manipulation of plant species lacking well characterized endogenous elements, it is important to evaluate the behavior of known transposable elements following their introduction into heterologous host species. One critical parameter concerns the timing of transposition in relation to the development of the transgenic host since this will affect the frequency with which transposition events are captured in the gametes. In order to examine whether different elements in the same cell are differentially active during development, we used Southern hybridizations to assess the activity of Activator (Ac) elements in progeny plants derived from a tomato transformant carrying five Ac's at two loci. All of the elements at one locus transposed in the primary transformant at a developmental stage resulting in the transmission of newly transposed elements to the next generation. In contrast, one or more of the Ac's at the second locus were not active at this stage and were transmitted to the next generation at the original donor T-DNA insertion site. These elements were, however, transpositionally active in somatic tissue. These results demonstrated that individual transposable elements in the same transformed cell can be differentially activated during development. 3aZea mays 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atransposons 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aloci 3agametogenesis 3aSouthern blotting 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenetic transformation 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aMutagenesis, Insertionalxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aVegetablesxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0agenetic change 0aactivator element1 aYoder, J.I.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1992 Apr., v. 18, no. 6 p.1065-1072x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01564naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245009900189300001400288500002400302520037500326650002500701650001700726650001000743650003200753650001400785650002300799650001700822650001200839650003100851650003600882650003200918650003100950700002800981773011201009852000901121856004801130655001201178IND4435257020221122105343.0100409e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443525702DNAL7 a200123422pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-009-9328-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetanović, Radmila.10aPlant-eriophyoid mite interactions: specific and unspecific morphological alterations.

The proposed model is based on the solution of continuity, momentum and mass transfer equations, modified according to the boundary layer theory coupled with the osmotic pressure model. The aim of the present study is to determine the range of operating conditions in the laminar flow regime, where the concentration polarization phenomena, typical of membrane operation, are maintained within acceptable limits. Membrane hydraulic permeability, generalized Reynolds number and fluid rheological properties were shown to play a crucial role in the system performances. Both the diffusion coefficient and the free stream velocity are critical in evaluating membrane performances. As far as the permeate flux decay is concerned, an opposite trend between the diffusion coefficient and axial velocity, is observed at a fixed Reynolds number. The presented model is general: it could be applied to characterize the concentration polarization phenomena whenever a solution, modeled by non-Newtonian constitutive equations, is fed to a membrane module. 3amathematical models 3afood processing quality 3alaminar flow 3aequations 3afruit pulp 3afruit juices 3apermeability 0afluid mechanics 0aconcentration 0apolarization1 aCalabro, V.1 aIorio, G.1 aDe Cindio, B.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 May, v. 48, no. 3 p.235-241x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02762naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245008900168300001800257520144000275650002601715650002401741650001701765650001001782650001901792650002201811650001401833650001801847650002201865650001301887700002301900700002001923700002301943700002801966700002001994700002402014700002502038700001902063773013802082852000902220856008802229946001102317655001202328IND4440284220221122105403.0100723e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444028422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShastri, Shilpa10aPlasmodium CDP-DAG synthase: An atypical gene with an essential N-terminal extension  ap. 1257-1268.  aCytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol synthase (CDS) diverts phosphatidic acid towards the biosynthesis of CDP-DAG, an obligatory liponucleotide intermediate in anionic phospholipid biosynthesis. The 78kDa predicted Plasmodium falciparum CDS (PfCDS) is recovered as a 50kDa conserved C-terminal cytidylyltransferase domain (C-PfCDS) and a 28kDa fragment that corresponds to the unusually long hydrophilic asparagine-rich N-terminal extension (N-PfCDS). Here, we show that the two fragments of PfCDS are the processed forms of the 78kDa pro-form that is encoded from a single transcript with no alternate translation start site for C-PfCDS. PfCDS, which shares 54% sequence identity with Plasmodium knowlesi CDS (PkCDS), could substitute for PkCDS in P. knowlesi. Experiments to disrupt either the full-length or the N-terminal extension of PkCDS indicate that not only the C-terminal cytidylyltransferase domain but also the N-terminal extension is essential to Plasmodium spp. PkCDS and PfCDS introduced in P. knowlesi were processed in the parasite, suggesting a conserved parasite-dependent mechanism. The N-PfCDS appears to be a peripheral membrane protein and is trafficked outside the parasite to the parasitophorous vacuole. Although the function of this unusual N-PfCDS remains enigmatic, the study here highlights features of this essential gene and its biological importance during the intra-erythrocytic cycle of the parasite. 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPlasmodium knowlesi 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3ahydrophilicity 3amembrane proteins 3aparasites 3aphospholipids 3asequence analysis 3avacuoles1 aZeeman, Anne-Marie1 aBerry, Laurence1 aVerburgh, R.

In this study, we evaluated the performances of newly designed real-time PCR assays using TaqMan® probes and targeting the 3 following specific genes: (i) the insertion sequence IS711, (ii) bcsp31 and (iii) per genes for the detection of Brucella at genus level. The real-time PCR assays were compared to previously described conventional PCR assays targeting the same genes. The genus-specificity was evaluated on 26 Brucella strains, including all species and biovars. The analytical specificity was evaluated on a collection of 68 clinically relevant, phylogenetically related or serologically cross-reacting micro-organisms. The analytical sensitivity was assessed using decreasing DNA quantities of Brucella ovis, B. melitensis bv. 1, B. abortus bv. 1 and B. canis reference strains. Finally, intra-assay repeatability and inter-assay reproducibility were assessed. All Brucella species DNA were amplified in the three tests. However, the earliest signal was observed with the IS711 real-time PCR, where it varied according to the IS711 copy number. No cross-reactivity was observed in all three tests. Real-time PCR was always more sensitive than conventional PCR assays. The real-time PCR assay targeting IS711 presented an identical or a greater sensitivity than the two other tests. In all cases, the variability was very low. In conclusion, real-time PCR assays are easy-to-use, produce results faster than conventional PCR systems while reducing DNA contamination risks. The IS711-based real-time PCR assay is specific and highly sensitive and appears as an efficient and reproducible method for the rapid and safe detection of the genus Brucella. 3aBrucella 3abrucellosis 3adisease detection 3azoonoses 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA probes 3aphylogeny 3avalidity 3arapid methods 3aligases 3apathogen identification 3agenes 3amolecular epidemiology 3aaccuracy 3atransposons 3adisease diagnosis 2aBrucellaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0amethodology 0anew methods 0amolecular genetics1 aAlbert, David1 aChénais, Benoît1 aHénault, Sylvie1 aZygmunt, Michel S.1 aPoliak, Sylvie1 aGarin-Bastuji, Bruno0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 May 28, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.156-164dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02994naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245005000144300001800194500001500212520135400227650001801581650002401599650002401623650001801647650001901665650002501684650001801709650002301727650002301750650003301773650002901806650002301835650002801858650002201886650002301908650004001931650002901971650004902000650002402049650003602073653001902109653002802128653002502156653002302181653001302204700001402217700001702231700001702248700001502265773008302280852000902363939003302372946001102405655001202416IND9205117720221122082947.0920813e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920511772DNAL7 a16001432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaggini, F.10aRibosomal RNA genes of Phaseolus coccineus.

Four clones of different insert size were analysed. Restriction patterns and physical maps of these length variants (pPH1, pPH2, pPH5, pPH6) were performed through complete Eco RI cleavage and partial digestion with Hpa II, Hae III, Sau 3AI, Sma I. Evidence was obtained that the length heterogeneity of the four genes was mainly due to a differing number of about 170 bp sub-repeating elements in the IGS. Indeed, there are 16 of these in pPH1, about 34 in pPH2, 10 in pPH5 and about 60 in pPH6. The sequence analysis of pPH6 sub-repeats revealed that there are two types of sub-repeats: short ones (S) of 162 bp and long ones (L) of 176 bp. The homology between S and L is high (93.8%). S and L elements are present in at least three of the four genes investigated, as shown by a restriction pattern obtained with Hae III digestion to completion. The relative frequency of S and L types, however, differs among the four genes. The possible functional meaning of the sub-repeat structure is discussed on the basis of the homology between the S and L sequences on the one hand and on the other the ribosomal sequences of: i) Xenopus promoter(s); ii) wheat block A sub-repeats; iii) presumptive promoter(s) of wheat. 3aribosomal RNA 3arestriction mapping 3aPhaseolus coccineus 3aribosomal DNA 3aintergenic DNA 3arepetitive sequences 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConsensus Sequencexgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aFabaceaexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0amultiple genes 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aribosomal cistrons 0acistrons1 aTucci, G.1 aDemartis, A.1 aGelati, M.T.1 aAvanzi, S.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1992 Apr., v. 18, no. 6 p.1073-1082x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03927naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002300194245010000217300001400317500002400331500001500355520160300370650002801973650001802001650002002019650001302039650002302052650001902075650002502094650001102119650001702130650001402147650002202161650002202183650001002205650001202215650001102227650001802238650001102256650001202267650002402279650002802303650001202331650003802343650001302381650001102394650001802405650003302423650003702456650001002493651001002503651002502513653002702538653002602565653002802591653001702619653002902636653001302665653003002678653002302708700002402731700002102755700002102776700002102797700001902818773009402837852000902931856008802940930003303028945002503061946001103086655001203097IND4420189720221122061514.0090508e20090528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018972DNAL7 a191577282pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL200 0aL8001 aPongolini, Stefano10aPrion protein genotypes of Italian sheep breeds with lysine-171 and phenylalanine-141 detection  ap. 18-23.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAmino acid polymorphisms of the prion protein gene influence sheep susceptibility to classical and atypical scrapie. Substitutions at codons 136, 154 and 171 play an important role in classical scrapie. Codon 141 leucine to phenylalanine mutation (AFRQ) has been recognized as an increased risk factor for atypical scrapie. In addition a rare allele with lysine at codon 171 (ARK) has been detected in Mediterranean sheep breeds. The presence of ARK poses two problems: the determination of its frequency and its possible interference with genotyping output of routine methods lacking specific detection capacity for ARK. The aim of our work was the development of a routine genotyping method with the capacity to identify ARK and AFRQ in addition to the normally detected alleles and to determine the frequencies of all these alleles in 5 main Italian breeds: Sarda (n =2494), Bergamasca (n =2686), Appenninica (n =297), Comisana (n =361) and Massese (n =402). A multiplex primer extension assay targeting the six single nucleotide polymorphisms of interest was developed. Allele frequencies revealed a very low level of ARR in Bergamasca (6.91%) as opposed to the other breeds, very diverse levels of AFRQ ranging from absence in Comisana to 10.70% in Massese and a restricted presence of ARK. This allele has only been detected in Bargamasca with a significant 3.67% and marginally in Appenninica (0.34%). These results underline the need for adequate routine methods for genotyping of breeds with alleles that can interfere with typing of important codons such as the case of ARK for codon 171. 3aSardinian (sheep breed) 3agene deletion 3arisk assessment 3agenotype 3adisease resistance 3agene frequency 3agenetic polymorphism 3alysine 3arisk factors 3abioassays 3adisease diagnosis 3abreed differences 3asheep 3ascrapie 3acodons 3aphenylalanine 3aprions 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aAnimals 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenotype 2aLysine 2aPhenylalanine 2aPrionsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aScrapiexepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aSheep 3aItaly 0aItalyxepidemiology. 0aComisana (sheep breed) 0aMassese (sheep breed) 0amolecular sequence data 0asheep breeds 0aBergamasca (sheep breed) 0amutation 0aAppenninica (sheep breed) 0amolecular genetics1 aBergamini, Federica1 aIori, Alessandra1 aMigliore, Sergio1 aCorradi, Attilio1 aBassi, Stefano0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 May 28, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.18-23dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03167naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001600176245010600192300001600298500002400314500001500338520107300353650002301426650002801449650002401477650001201501650001901513650002301532650001501555650001401570650002301584650002501607650002801632650002201660650004401682650001401726650001001740650001201750650001301762650007001775650006501845650001001910650004801920650001401968651001001982651002501992653001302017653001302030653002502043700001202068700001802080700001602098700001602114700001402130700001602144700001902160700001602179773009602195852000902291856008802300930003302388945002502421946001102446655001202457IND4420190020221122061401.0090508e20090528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442019002DNAL7 a191854322pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aWei, Zigong10aCharacterization of Streptococcus suis isolates from the diseased pigs in China between 2003 and 2007  ap. 196-201.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to illustrate the characteristics of 407 strains of Streptococcus suis (S. suis) isolated from diseased pigs in China. The results revealed that S. suis, with 56.6% of the Streptococci isolates, had replaced Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus as the predominant agent. Among the strains investigated, serotype 2 (43.2%) was most prevalent, followed by serotypes 3 (14.7%) and 4, 8, 5, 7, 1/2 (3.2-6.4%). Serotype 2 was more frequently isolated from swine with systemic infection, while serotype 3 was significantly associated with pneumonia. A high percentage of S. suis serotype 2 strains (54%) belonged to the genotype sly+ mrp+ epf+, which is a highly virulent strain, as confirmed by mice infection test. Biofilm producers only had lowly virulence compared to strains with the same genotype, indicating that biofilm could be associated with virulence but be not the character of virulent strains. The present study contributes to understanding the characteristics of Streptococcus suis and controlling Streptococcal disease in China. 3atemporal variation 3aepidemiological studies 3abacterial pneumonia 3abiofilm 3aswine diseases 3adisease prevalence 3apathotypes 3aserotypes 3aStreptococcus suis 3alongitudinal studies 3apathogen identification 3adisease incidence 3aStreptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus 3avirulence 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aGenotype 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aStreptococcus suisxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aVirulence 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology. 0aetiology 0agenotype 0abacterial infections1 aLi, Ran1 aZhang, Anding1 aHe, Hongkui1 aHua, Yafeng1 aXia, Jing1 aCai, Xuehui1 aChen, Huanchun1 aJin, Meilin0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 May 28, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.196-201dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03022naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245011300188300001600301520126900317650002801586650002501614650001601639650001301655650001901668650001001687650002101697650002401718650003101742650007301773650002301846650002801869650003201897650007001929650003101999650002402030650004002054653002502094653003002119653001502149700001302164700001402177700001902191700001502210773012202225852000902347856009202356930003302448946001102481655001202492IND4418927120221122035724.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441892712DNAL7 a193413962pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01563.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weihua10aCross-talk between an orphan response regulator and a noncognate histidine kinase in Streptomyces coelicolor  ap. 150-156.  aTwo-component systems (TCSs), typically consisting of a histidine kinase (HK) and a cognate response regulator (RR), are the most common signaling systems in bacteria. Besides paired genes encoding TCSs, there also exists unpaired HKs and orphan RRs. In Streptomyces coelicolor, 13 orphan RRs have been annotated. Because of lack of cognate HKs, little is known as yet about the regulation of orphan RRs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that several orphan RRs had high amino acid sequence identities with RRs from typical TCSs in S. coelicolor. Among them, the orphan RR SCO3818 and RR SCO0204, which paired with HK SCO0203, showed the highest identity (65%), suggesting that the two RRs might both be under the regulation of SCO0203. Following studies showed that SCO0203 could phosphorylate not only SCO0204 but also SCO3818. Deletion of either sco0203 or sco3818 led to enhanced production of blue-pigmented antibiotic actinorhodin, which indicated a functional correlation between SCO0203 and SCO3818. These results suggested that SCO3818 might be regulated by SCO0203. This is the first report describing the regulation of an orphan RR by an HK. Moreover, this is also the first identification of cross-talk between different TCS components in S. coelicolor. 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3aamino acid sequences 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abioinformatics 3agenes 3ahistidine kinase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnthraquinonesxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aConserved Sequence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphorylationxphysiology 2aProtein Kinasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSignal Transduction 2aStreptomyces coelicolorxmetabolism 0atwo-component system 0aorphan response regulator 0across-talk1 aShu, Dan1 aChen, Lei1 aJiang, Weihong1 aLu, Yinhua0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2009 May, v. 294, no. 2 p.150-156dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01563.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04253naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100002100203245012700224300001500351500002400366500001500390520177100405650002002176650001802196650003702214650002102251650002002272650002502292650002802317650002202345650002202367650001402389650003302403650002802436650002702464650001002491650001202501650002302513650002602536650002102562650002502583650000902608650002502617650001202642650002202654650002902676650007202705650004402777650002402821650002402845650002402869650001402893650002902907650003402936650001502970651001102985653001902996653002803015653001303043700002603056700002503082700002103107700001703128700001703145773009503162852000903257856008803266930003303354945002503387946001103412655001203423IND4420191220221122030145.0090508e20090528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442019122DNAL7 a191935002pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL810 0aL821 0aL8001 aEriksson, Helena10aCharacterization of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae isolates from poultry, pigs, emus, the poultry red mite and other animals  ap. 98-104.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aErysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is the causative agent of erysipelas in mammals and birds, especially pigs and poultry. In order to investigate the suitability of different subtyping methods for genetic and phenotypic similarities among Swedish isolates of the organism, 45 isolates from poultry (n =23), pigs (n =17), emus (n =2) and the poultry red mite Dermanyssus gallinae (n =3) were investigated by serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on eleven isolates from nine animal species. The results indicated a random scattering of serotypes throughout the dendrogram based on PFGE banding patterns following SmaI digestion. In three cases, isolates with an identical PFGE pattern were of differing serotypes. No differentiation into subgroups by antimicrobial susceptibility testing by broth microdilution was possible as results were similar for all isolates. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations for most antimicrobials, including penicillin and oxytetracycline, were low. The 16S rRNA gene sequences (1443 nts) from eight of eleven selected isolates of Erysipelothrix spp. were identical to that of the type strain E. rhusiopathiae ATCC 19414T. The other three isolates differed from the type strain by two or three nucleotides. While this method may be useful for identification of Erysipelothrix spp., it is unsuitable for epidemiological investigations. Similarities in PFGE banding patterns between isolates from chickens and mites supported the hypothesis that D. gallinae may act as a reservoir and vector for E. rhusiopathiae.

We report the first record of a newly introduced ant species, Myrmica specioides Bondroit, to the state of Washington. It possesses the characteristics of a potential pest ant: high aggressiveness, polygyny, and the tendency to reach high local abundances. This early record might facilitate the control of introduced populations before they can develop into a genuine nuisance. 3aMyrmica 3ainsect morphology 3ainsect taxonomy 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3ainsect ecology 3anew geographic records 3aUnited States 0aWashington 0ageographical distribution1 aRadchenko, Alexander 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Feb., v. 11, no. 2 p.253-256dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9229-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090205b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03360naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002200172245012800194300001600322500002400338500001500362520175000377650001602127650003002143650002102173650001902194650001602213650002302229650000902252650001502261650001902276650001902295650002402314650001102338650002102349651001202370651001802382653002102400653003002421653001702451653002502468700002902493700002102522773010002543852000902643856008502652930003302737945002502770946001102795655001202806IND4415172020221122005414.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441517202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9228-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aL300 0aL7001 aRodda, Gordon H. 10aWhat parts of the US mainland are climatically suitable for invasive alien pythons spreading from Everglades National Park?  ap. 241-252.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Burmese Python (Python molurus bivittatus) is now well established in southern Florida and spreading northward. The factors likely to limit this spread are unknown, but presumably include climate or are correlated with climate. We compiled monthly rainfall and temperature statistics from 149 stations located near the edge of the python's native range in Asia (Pakistan east to China and south to Indonesia). The southern and eastern native range limits extend to saltwater, leaving unresolved the species' climatic tolerances in those areas. The northern and western limits are associated with cold and aridity respectively. We plotted mean monthly rainfall against mean monthly temperature for the 149 native range weather stations to identify the climate conditions inhabited by pythons in their native range, and mapped areas of the coterminous United States with the same climate today and projected for the year 2100. We accounted for both dry-season aestivation and winter hibernation (under two scenarios of hibernation duration). The potential distribution was relatively insensitive to choice of scenario for hibernation duration. US areas climatically matched at present ranged up the coasts and across the south from Delaware to Oregon, and included most of California, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South and North Carolina. By the year 2100, projected areas of potential suitable climate extend northward beyond the current limit to include parts of the states of Washington, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. Thus a substantial portion of the mainland US is potentially vulnerable to this ostensibly tropical invader. 3atemperature 3ageographical distribution 3ainvasive species 3anational parks 3ahibernation 3aintroduced species 3arain 3aestivation 3aclimate models 3aPython molurus 3aecological invasion 3asnakes 3aclimatic factors 3aFlorida 0aUnited States 0aclimate matching 0aPython molurus bivittatus 0anative range 0aclimatic suitability1 aJarnevich, Catherine S. 1 aReed, Robert N. 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Feb., v. 11, no. 2 p.241-252dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9228-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090205b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03544naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245019500182300001600377500001500393520154000408650001201948650001201960650003201972650004502004650002702049650005902076650002702135650004002162650007202202650000902274650000902283650002302292650003102315650005502346650002702401653003202428653001702460653000902477653001402486700001602500700001702516700001802533700001702551700001802568700001502586700001902601700001602620700001802636700001502654700001602669773010702685852000902792856008502801930003302886946001102919655001202930IND4413445020221122005457.0081205e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441344502DNAL7 a189466562pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-008-1172-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakayama, S. 10aImpact of whole body irradiation and vascular endothelial growth factor-A on increased beta cell mass after bone marrow transplantation in a mouse model of diabetes induced by streptozotocin  ap. 115-124.  a2019-12-04  aAims/hypothesis Recent studies have shown that bone marrow transplantation reduces hyperglycaemia in a mouse model of diabetes induced by streptozotocin. However, the essential factors for the improvement of hyperglycaemia by bone marrow transplantation have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to search for such factors. Methods We investigated the effect of irradiation to whole body, to abdomen alone or to whole body excluding abdomen, followed by infusion or no infusion of bone marrow cells. We also investigated the effect of bone marrow transplantation on beta cell-specific vascular endothelial growth factor-A gene (Vegfa) knockout mice. Results Bone marrow transplantation improved streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemia and partially restored islet mass. This change was associated with increased islet vascularisation. Among the other methods investigated, low-dose irradiation of the whole body without infusion of bone marrow cells also improved blood glucose level. In streptozotocin-treated beta cell-specific Vegfa knockout mice, which exhibit impaired islet vascularisation, bone marrow transplantation neither improved hyperglycaemia, relative beta cell mass nor islet vascularisation. Conclusion/interpretation Our results indicate that whole body irradiation is essential and sufficient for restoration of beta cell mass after streptozotocin treatment independent of infusion of bone marrow cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A produced in beta cells is also essential for this phenomenon. 3ainsulin 2aAnimals 2aBone Marrow Transplantation 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxsurgery 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEndothelial Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHyperglycemiaxprevention & control 2aInsulin-Secreting Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aTransplantation, Isogeneic 2aVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Axpharmacology 2aWhole-Body Irradiation 0aEndothelial progenitor cell 0aregeneration 0aVEGF 0aStem cell1 aUchida, T. 1 aChoi, J.

Avocado and coconut oils in the absence (control oil) and presence (treated oil) of caffeic acid (CA) or p-coumaric acid (pCA) were stored at 20 and 60 °C for 50 days. The total phenolic content, peroxide value, p-anisidine value (p-AV), free fatty acids (FFAs) and FA composition of the obtained oils were examined on days 0, 7, 15, 23, 35 and 50. Results showed that storage at 60 °C accelerated oil oxidation, and the CA or pCA helped preserve avocado and coconut oils to different extents. CA and pCA protected some desirable unsaturated fatty acids at 60 °C, but facilitated the hydrolysis of triglycerides. Substantially extractable phenolics were still detected in the treated oils after either storage. Incorporation of phenolics into oil products is feasible and beneficial for increasing oil stability and nutritional value. 3aavocado oil 3acaffeic acid 3afree fatty acids 3ahydrolysis 3anutritive value 3aoxidation 3ap-anisidine value 3ap-coumaric acid 3aperoxide value 3atriacylglycerols 3aunsaturated fatty acids1 aThakorlal, Jessica1 aZhou, Jing0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2011 Aug., v. 46, no. 8 p.1575-1585dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02655.x 7aarticle03110naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245011100187300001600298500002400314520140100338650002001739650001401759650001901773650002701792650001701819650001201836650002201848650000901870650003301879650001901912650001201931650002601943650003301969650003002002650001102032650002002043650004702063650005102110650002802161650005002189700001802239700001402257700001602271700001702287700001502304700001402319700001602333700001502349773011602364852000902480856005502489655001202544IND4447947220221121232809.0110125e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444794722DNAL7 a204031252pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2010.01616.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, SSD10aQuantification, Morphology and Ultrastructure of Preantral Follicles of Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) Foetuses  ap. e17-e22.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to determine the number, morphology and ultrastructure of preantral ovarian follicles of buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) foetuses at different ages.

The primordial follicle consisted of an oocyte surrounded by a layer of flattened follicular cells with a normally eccentric oocyte nucleus. Dispersed Golgi complex, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, rounded mitochondria and several lipid vesicles were observed in the cytoplasm and cell junctions between the follicle cell membranes and the oocyte. This work describes the number, morphometry and ultrastructure of preantral follicles of buffalo foetuses, concluding that folliculogenesis is established between 8 and 34 cm CRL and that follicle number varies individually and according to age and that further studies are needed in this species. 3aGolgi apparatus 3abuffaloes 3acell membranes 3afollicular development 3amitochondria 3aoocytes 3aovarian follicles 3arump 3asmooth endoplasmic reticulum 3aultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloesxembryology 2aCell Nucleusxultrastructure 2aCytoplasmxultrastructure 2aFemale 2aGestational Age 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanningxveterinary 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmissionxveterinary 2aOocytesxultrastructure 2aOvarian Folliclexembryologyxultrastructure.1 aFerreira, MAP1 aLima, MYS1 aSampaio, RV1 aCordeiro, MS1 aSilva, TVG1 aCosta, NN1 aMiranda, MS1 aOhashi, OM0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2011 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.e17-e22dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2010.01616.x 7aarticle03171naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002000172245019900192300001600391500002400407520164400431650003102075650003102106650002302137650002602160650002302186650002302209650002102232650002402253650001402277650003002291650002102321651001002342700001902352700002002371700001602391700001902407773010002426852000902526856008502535930003302620945002502653946001102678655001202689IND4415171720221121232844.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441517172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9225-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aF822 0aK0011 aCheng, Xin-Yue 10aCompetitive displacement of the native species Bursaphelenchus mucronatus by an alien species Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Nematoda: Aphelenchida: Aphelenchoididae): a case of successful invasion  ap. 205-213.  aIncludes references  aThe presence of alien invasive species has serious negative impact on endemic biodiversity, especially on native species that occupy the same niche in the ecosystem. To study the influence of the alien invasive species Bursaphelenchus xylophilus on its native sister species B. mucronatus, the two nematode species were mix-cultured in a fungal mat and mix-inoculated into a susceptible host. By comparing the propagation parameters of both species under competitive and noncompetitive conditions it was shown that the propagation level of B. xylophilus was clearly higher than that of B. mucronatus under laboratory culture. Furthermore, the propagation capacity of B. xylophilus under competitive conditions was much higher than that under noncompetitive conditions, both in laboratory culture and with host inoculation. Bursaphelenchus xylophilus also excluded B. mucronatus when the two species were cultured as a mixture for a longer time. The relative abundance ratios of the two species in natural pinewoods were also determined by random sampling of dying pine trees from regions with different invasion histories. It was noted that with an increase in invasion years the distribution frequency of B. xylophilus increased while that of B. mucronatus decreased. Experimental tests verified our hypothesis that because of its high fecundity and strong competitive ability, the invasive species B. xylophilus out-competed the native species B. mucronatus and displaced it in natural ecosystems. The successful invasion of B. xylophilus is attributed to competitive displacement, which may be one of the ecological invasive mechanisms. 3aBursaphelenchus mucronatus 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3acolonizing ability 3acompetitive exclusion 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3afecundity 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aPinus thunbergii 3aChina1 aXie, Pei-Zhen 1 aCheng, Fei-Xue 1 aXu, Ru-Mei 1 aXie, Bing-Yan 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Feb., v. 11, no. 2 p.205-213dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9225-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02650naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002600163245006700189300001600256500002400272520128800296650002001584650002201604650002101626650002401647650002601671650002401697650002201721650002601743650000901769650001101778650002601789651001501815653002201830653002301852653001901875700002301894773010001917852000902017856008502026930003302111945002502144946001102169655001202180IND4415171820221121223911.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441517182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9226-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aF3001 aBanasiak, Stephen E. 10aLong term dynamics of Rosa multiflora in a successional system  ap. 215-224.  aIncludes references  aLong term studies of invasion dynamics are critical in developing a more complete understanding of the factors that influence species spread. To address this issue, the dynamics of the non-native invasive plant, Rosa multiflora, were examined using a 40-year record of successional change. The roles of biotic and abiotic factors in regulating R. multiflora invasion were also assessed. The invasion showed an initial 9-year time lag, followed by a 20-year period of population expansion and an ultimate decline as succession progressed. During all phases of R. multiflora's invasion, there was continuous turnover within plots. Rainfall during the previous season was found to increase R. multiflora colonization during population expansion while tree species inhibited the invader's growth. During expansion and decline of R. multiflora, common associated species were often positively or negatively correlated with changes in R. multiflora cover. Though early population dynamics were regulated by propagule pressure, the major influence on R. multiflora late in succession was canopy closure. Although the invasion of this species was largely self-limiting in this system, the species is likely to persist within late successional systems and may require management intervention. 3aRosa multiflora 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aecological succession 3apopulation dynamics 3aplant communities 3aenvironmental factors 3arain 3acanopy 3along term experiments 3aNew Jersey 0ainvasion dynamics 0apropagule pressure 0acanopy closure1 aMeiners, Scott J. 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Feb., v. 11, no. 2 p.215-224dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9226-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02919naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245011700186300001600303520126600319650000901585650001601594650001801610650002201628650001101650650001601661650001601677650001101693650001401704650001901718650001001737650002401747650001201771650002301783650001701806650000901823650002001832650001901852650002201871650001101893650001301904653002501917653002501942700001901967700002001986700001802006700001802024700002202042773013202064852000902196856009202205930003302297946001102330655001202341IND4440277120221121200956.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444027712DNAL7 a206628192pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-0929.2010.00757.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Peng10aInfluences of Northern Leaf Blight on corn silage fermentation quality, nutritive value and feed intake by sheep  ap. 487-493.  aThis study examined the differences between non-inoculated (control) corn and Northern Leaf Blight (NLB)-damaged corn (inoculated corn); dry matter (DM) yield, silage fermentation quality, nutritive value and feed intake by sheep were compared. Leaf, stem and grain dry weights and gross yield of inoculated corn were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased compared with control corn. The contents of water-soluble carbohydrate and nitrogen-free extract (NFE) were decreased in inoculated corn compared with control corn. Silage made from both inoculated and control corn showed good fermentation quality. The digestibility of DM, organic matter, ether extract, NFE, and energy of silage made from inoculated corn were significantly (P < 0.05) lower, and contents of total digestible nutrients (TDN) and digestible energy (DE) were also significantly (P < 0.05) lower compared with silage made from the control corn. DM intake showed no significant discrepancy between the two types of silage. TDN and DE intakes from inoculated silage were significantly (P < 0.05) lower compared with control silage. From the above results it was shown that NLB caused a decrease in DM yield and NFE content in corn and a decrease in the nutritive value and feed intake of silage. 3acorn 3acorn silage 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3aenergy 3afeed intake 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3asheep 3asilage fermentation 2aAnimals 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFermentation 2aMale 2aNutritive Value 2aPlant Diseases 2aSheepxphysiology 2aSilage 2aZea mays 0afermentation quality 0anorthern leaf blight1 aSouma, Kousaku1 aKobayashi, Yuki1 aIwabuchi, Kei1 aSato, Chihiro1 aMasuko, Takayoshi0 tAnimal science journal =.g2010 Aug., v. 81, no. 4 p.487-493dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2010.00757.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120413b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03241naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245009100203300001800294506007600312520094800388506003701336650001001373650001701383650002701400650002001427650001801447650001901465650001001484650001801494650001101512700002201523700002301545700002301568700002201591700002001613700002401633700002201657700002001679700002201699700002001721700001901741700001801760700001701778700002301795700001601818700002001834700001701854700001601871700002001887700001801907700002001925700002201945700002201967700001701989700002202006700002002028700001802048700001702066700001902083700001902102700001902121700003202140700002202172773012702194852000902321856008302330939003302413946001302446655001202459IND4450951620221207131814.0110319e20110318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445095162DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12001132doi7 aPMC40903092pmcid7 a214153522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalik, Fady I.10aCardiac Myosin Activation: A Potential Therapeutic Approach for Systolic Heart Failure  ap. 1439-1443.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDecreased cardiac contractility is a central feature of systolic heart failure. Existing drugs increase cardiac contractility indirectly through signaling cascades but are limited by their mechanism-related adverse effects. To avoid these limitations, we previously developed omecamtiv mecarbil, a small-molecule, direct activator of cardiac myosin. Here, we show that it binds to the myosin catalytic domain and operates by an allosteric mechanism to increase the transition rate of myosin into the strongly actin-bound force-generating state. Paradoxically, it inhibits adenosine 5'-triphosphate turnover in the absence of actin, which suggests that it stabilizes an actin-bound conformation of myosin. In animal models, omecamtiv mecarbil increases cardiac function by increasing the duration of ejection without changing the rates of contraction. Cardiac myosin activation may provide a new therapeutic approach for systolic heart failure.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3aactive sites 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadverse effects 3aanimal models 3acardiac output 3adrugs 3aheart failure 3amyosin1 aHartman, James J.1 aElias, Kathleen A.1 aMorgan, Bradley P.1 aRodriguez, Hector1 aBrejc, Katjuša1 aAnderson, Robert L.1 aSueoka, Sandra H.1 aLee, Kenneth H.1 aFiner, Jeffrey T.1 aSakowicz, Roman1 aBaliga, Ramesh1 aCox, David R.1 aGarard, Marc1 aGodinez, Guillermo1 aKawas, Raja1 aKraynack, Erica1 aLenzi, David1 aLu, Pu Ping1 aMuci, Alexander1 aNiu, Congrong1 aQian, Xiangping1 aPierce, Daniel W.1 aPokrovskii, Maria1 aSuehiro, Ion1 aSylvester, Sheila1 aTochimoto, Todd1 aValdez, Corey1 aWang, Wenyue1 aKatori, Tatsuo1 aKass, David A.1 aShen, You-Tang1 aVatner, S.

However, how its interlaminar circuitry executes cognitive computations is poorly understood. Using linear-array multicontact electrodes, we simultaneously recorded unit activities across cortical layers in the perirhinal cortex of macaques performing a pair-association memory task. Cortical layers were estimated on the basis of current source density profiles with histological verifications, and the interlaminar signal flow was determined with cross-correlation analysis between spike trains. During the cue period, canonical "feed-forward" signals flowed from granular to supragranular layers and from supragranular to infragranular layers. During the delay period, however, the signal flow reversed to the "feed-back" direction: from infragranular to supragranular layers. This reversal of signal flow highlights how the temporal cortex differentially recruits its laminar circuits for sensory and mnemonic processing. 3aMacaca 3acognition 3acortex 3aelectrodes 3amemory 3amonkeys1 aHirabayashi, Toshiyuki1 aTamura, Keita1 aMiyashita, Y.q(Yasushi),d1949-0 tScience.g2011 Mar. 18, v. 331, no. 6023 p.1443-1447dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11999673Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110321  aOther US 7aarticle02276naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245009800163300001800261520095500279650001401234650002201248650001401270650001501284650001801299650001901317650001701336650002001353650001001373650002101383650001101404650002501415700002501440700001901465700001701484700002301501700001801524700002301542773012701565852000901692856008301701939003301784946001301817655001201830IND4450951520221121124804.0110319e20110318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445095152DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12012482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Naomi J.10aIndependent and Parallel Recruitment of Preexisting Mechanisms Underlying C₄ Photosynthesis  ap. 1436-1439.  aC₄ photosynthesis allows increased photosynthetic efficiency because carbon dioxide (CO₂) is concentrated around the key enzyme RuBisCO. Leaves of C₄ plants exhibit modified biochemistry, cell biology, and leaf development, but despite this complexity, C₄ photosynthesis has evolved independently in at least 45 lineages of plants. We found that two independent lineages of C₄ plant, whose last common ancestor predates the divergence of monocotyledons and dicotyledons about 180 million years ago, show conserved mechanisms controlling the expression of genes important for release of CO₂ around RuBisCO in bundle sheath (BS) cells. Orthologous genes from monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous C₃ species also contained conserved regulatory elements that conferred BS specificity when placed into C₄ species. We conclude that these conserved functional genetic elements likely facilitated the repeated evolution of C₄ photosynthesis. 3aC3 plants 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aC4 plants 3aLiliopsida 3aMagnoliopsida 3acarbon dioxide 3acell biology 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3aregulatory sequences1 aNewell, Christine A.1 aStanley, Susan1 aChen, Jit E.1 aPerrin, Abigail J.1 aKajala, Kaisa1 aHibberd, Julian M.0 tScience.g2011 Mar. 18, v. 331, no. 6023 p.1436-1439dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12012483Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110321  aOther US 7aarticle03782naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001200182245008000194300001600274500002400290520145400314650002201768650002101790650002501811650001901836650002101855650002401876650000901900650001801909650001901927650001101946650002401957650002001981650001802001650002002019650001402039650004402053650001902097650001802116650001802134650001502152650003702167650002502204650001202229650002602241650003002267650003702297650001102334650000902345650003702354650003702391650002902428650005502457650001702512650000902529650002502538650002602563650002802589700001702617700002002634700001802654700002902672700002402701773010002725852000902825856008502834930003302919945002502952946001102977655001202988IND4420192020221121065545.0090508e20090622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442019202DNAL7 a194293682pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aRosidah10aToxicology evaluation of standardized methanol extract of Gynura procumbens  ap. 244-249.  aIncludes references  aAims of the study: Gynura procumbens (Merr.), which is known as “Sambung nyawa”, is widely used in South East Asian countries in the traditional treatment of many ailments. However, there is little toxicological information available regarding safety following repeated exposure. The present investigation describes the toxicity of a methanol extract of Gynura procumbens leaves in rats. Materials and methods: For acute toxicity studies, a methanol extract of Gynura procumbens was orally administered to Sprague-Dawley rats (female and male) at a dose range of 1000-5000mg/kg. For sub-chronic toxicity studies, the rats were orally administered the methanol extract of Gynura procumbens at the doses of 125, 250, and 500mg/(kgday) for a period of 13 weeks. The animals were sacrificed, followed by examination of their organs and blood serum. Results and conclusions: Administration of the methanol extract from Gynura procumbens leaves at 1000-5000mg/kg did not produce mortality or significant changes in the general behaviour, body weight, or organ gross appearance of rats. There were no significant differences in the general condition, growth, organ weights, haematological parameters, clinical chemistry values, or gross and microscopic appearance of the organs from the treatment groups as compared to the control group. Therefore, the NOAEL for the Gynura procumbens methanol extract is 500mg/(kgday) administered orally for 13 weeks. 3aGynura procumbens 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3aplant extracts 3aherbal medicines 3aoral administration 3arats 3aanimal models 3aacute toxicity 3adosage 3asubchronic toxicity 3ablood chemistry 3aanimal organs 3aanimal behavior 3amortality 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3abody condition 3atissue weight 3aanimal growth 3ahematology 3ano observed adverse effect level 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAsteraceaexchemistry 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMedicine, East Asian Traditional 2aNo-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aPlant Leaves 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aToxicity Tests, Acute 2aToxicity Tests, Chronic1 aYam, Mun Fei1 aSadikun, Amirin1 aAhmad, Mariam1 aAkowuah, Gabriel Akyirem1 aAsmawi, Mohd.

The evolution of grasping is far more complex, as shown by analysis of new morphometric and behavioural data. The latter concern the modes of food grasping in 11 species (one platyrrhine, nine catarrhines and humans). We show that precision grip and thumb-lateral behaviours are linked to carpus and thumb length, whereas power grasping is linked to second and third digit length. No phylogenetic signal was found in the behavioural characters when using squared-change parsimony and phylogenetic eigenvector regression, but such a signal was found in morphometric characters. Our findings shed new light on previously proposed models of the evolution of grasping. Inference models suggest that Australopithecus, Oreopithecus and Proconsul used a precision grip. 3aHominidae 3acarpus 3ahumans 3amodels 3amorphometry 3aphylogeny 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aCatarrhinixanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aCebidaexanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aChild, Preschool 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aHand Strengthxphysiology 2aHaplorhinixanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aPhylogeny 2aSpecies Specificity 0agrasping 0apalaeobiology 0aprecision grip 0avariance partitioning with PVR1 aLAURIN, M.1 aGORCE, P.1 aBELS, V.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2008 Nov., v. 21, no. 6 p.1732-1743dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01582.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03405naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245013500169300001400304500002400318520218500342650002202527650001102549650001202560650002602572650001602598650001102614650001002625650001402635650001002649650001802659650001902677650001402696650001102710650001102721651001202732700001902744700002102763700003802784773009202822852000902914856004802923655001202971IND4413970120221121054155.0081219e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441397012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-008-9550-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihaljević, Melita10aDual impact of the flood pulses on the phytoplankton assemblages in a Danubian floodplain lake (Kopački Rit Nature Park, Croatia)  ap. 77-88.  aIncludes references  aThere are several conflicting hypothesis that deal with the influence of flooding in the natural river-floodplain systems. According to the Flood Pulse Concept, the flood pulses are not considered to be a disturbance, while some recent studies have proven that floods can be a disturbance factor of phytoplankton development. In order to test whether flooding acts as a disturbance factor in the shallow Danubian floodplain lake (Lake Sakadaš), phytoplankton dynamics was investigated during two different hydrological years--extremely dry (2003) without flooding and usually flooded (2004). A total of 18 phytoplankton functional groups were established. The sequence of phytoplankton seasonality can be summarized P/D [rightward arrow] E (W1, W2) [rightward arrow] C/P (only in potamophase) [rightward arrow] S2/H1/SN/S1 [rightward arrow] W1/W2 [rightward arrow] P/D. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that the water level was a significant environmental variable in 2004. Due to the higher total biomass of Bacillariophyceae established under potamophase conditions, floodings in the early spring seem to be a stimulating factor for phytoplankton development. On the other hand, the flood pulses in May and June had dilution effects on nutrients, so that a significantly lower phytoplankton biomass was established indicating that flooding pulses can be regarded as a disturbance event. Such conditions supported diatom development (D, P, C species) and prolonged its dominance in the total phytoplankton biomass. A long-lasting Cyanoprokaryota bloom (various filamentous species--S1, S2, SN and H1 representatives) with very high biomass characterized the limnophase (dry conditions) in summer and autumn of both years. In-lake variables (lake morphology, internal loadings of nutrients from sediments, light conditions) seem to be important for the appearance of Cyanoprokaryota bloom. The equilibrium phase was found during the Cyanoprokaryota bloom only in the extremely dry year. This study showed that depending on the time scale occurrence, flood pulses can be a stimulating or a disturbance factor for phytoplankton development in Lake Sakadaš. 3aBacillariophyceae 3aautumn 3abiomass 3aenvironmental factors 3afloodplains 3afloods 3alakes 3anutrients 3aparks 3aphytoplankton 3apollution load 3asediments 3aspring 3asummer 3aCroatia1 aStević, Filip1 aHorvatić, Janja1 aHackenberger Kutuzović, Branimir0 tHydrobiologia.g2009 Feb., v. 618, no. 1 p.77-88dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9550-6 7aarticle01866naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011800124300001600242520070100258650002200959650002000981650001901001650001301020650001501033650001301048650001301061650001501074650001901089650002401108650001701132650001701149653001201166653001401178653001801192700001501210700001401225700001401239700001701253773008401270852000901354930003301363945001301396946001101409655001201420IND2326808920221121045245.0020430e200105  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232680892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, D.S.14aThe use of physical carbon dioxide absorbents to control pressure buildup and volume expansion of kimchi packages  ap. 183-188.  aCO2 absorption by zeolite and active carbon was investigated as a tool to alleviate the pressure buildup and volume expansion that results from carbon dioxide production in kimchi packages. Zeolite was more effective than active carbon in terms of CO2 absorption capacity, and could also maintain CO2 adsorption equilibrium as long as it was protected from water vapor. A plastic film with high CO2 transmission rate and limited water vapour permeability was able to control the CO2 absorption rate of the zeolite sachet. Zeolite sealed in 10 micrometers thick high density polyethylene could significantly reduce pressure and volume increase when included inside kimchi packages at 15 degrees C. 3atraditional foods 3afermented foods 3acarbon dioxide 3apressure 3aabsorbents 3azeolites 3acharcoal 3aabsorption 3afood packaging 3apackaging materials 3apermeability 3aplastic film 0asachets 0aexpansion 0aactive carbon1 aShin, D.H.1 aLee, D.U.1 aKim, J.C.1 aCheigh, H.S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 May, v. 48, no. 2 p.183-188x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01390naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005700128300001600185520048800201650001800689650001500707650002300722650001600745650001900761650002000780650002400800650001400824700001500838700001800853700001900871773008400890852000900974930003300983945001301016946001101029655001201040IND2326804520221121045242.0020430e200105  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232680452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, M.D.10aSorption isotherms and heat of sorption of pineapple  ap. 103-107.  aSorption isotherms of pineapple were determined at 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C temperatures by using dynamic method.

These vesicles are similar to modern cellular membranes and can serve to contain water-soluble species, concentrate species, and have the potential to catalyze reactions. The origin of the use of photochemical energy in metabolism (i.e. energy transduction) is one of the central issues in the origin of life. This includes such questions as how energy transduction may have occurred before complex enzymatic systems, such as required by contemporary photosynthesis, had developed and how simple a photochemical system is possible. It has been postulated that vesicle structures developed the ability to capture and transduce light, providing energy for reactions. It has also been shown that pH gradients across the membrane surface can be photochemically created, but coupling these to drive chemical reactions has been difficult. Colloidal semiconducting mineral particles are known to photochemically drive redox chemistry. We propose that encapsulation of these particles has the potential to provide a source of energy transduction inside vesicles, and thereby drive protocellular chemistry, and represents a model system for early photosynthesis. In our experiments we show that TiO₂ particles, in the ~20 nm size range, can be incorporated into vesicles and retain their photoactivity through the dehydration/rehydration cycles that have been shown to concentrate species inside a vesicle. 3aphotosynthesis 3acolloids 3asemiconductors 2aBiogenesis 2aColloidsxchemistry 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aPhotochemical Processes 2aPhotosynthesis 2aTitaniumxchemistry 0aVesicles 0aEnergy transduction 0aProtocells 0aOrigin of life 0aOrigin of photosynthesis1 aNoveron, Juan 1 aBasa, Ranor C.

The Glenelg River and its southern Australian landscape have been extensively studied by different researchers across many projects, and several restoration actions implemented across different reaches and spatial scales. Research involving diverse researchers and projects over extended periods shows strengths such as flexibility in pursuing emerging research questions, increased regional capacity by facilitating research training, and the generation of broader perspectives on river management. We conclude that metastability is a likely state for rivers with multiple interacting disturbances in regions with Mediterranean-type climates. In such rivers, disrupted relationships between the physical environment and ecological processes are likely, such that habitat restoration might have limited effectiveness. Restoration practices that constitute a disturbance might also risk disrupting metastability, or their impact may be limited because metastability confers resistance to further disturbance. Restoration may be more effectively targeted at less-disturbed reaches where ecosystems have a greater capacity to respond. Similarly, restoration in disturbed reaches might be more effectively directed at supporting metastability in the face of landscape change, than attempting to restore antecedent conditions. 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3ahabitat conservation 3alandscapes 3aresearchers 3arivers 0aGlenelg River 0ariver management 0ariver restoration 0ascience communication1 aMitchell, B.D.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2010, v. 61, no. 7 p.778-785dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF090733Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02205naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245005300130300001600183520105200199650001801251650001001269650001401279650001101293650002401304650001401328650001301342650001601355650001401371650001501385650002001400650001801420650001301438650001801451650001801469650001301487650001801500650002001518650001001538653001701548700001901565773008501584852000901669930003301678945001301711946001101724655001201735IND2326775120221121012209.0020428e200106  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232677512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelegrina, A.H.10aModelling the pneumatic drying of food particles  ap. 301-310.  aA one-dimensional model for pneumatic drying of food particles is presented.

A plug-flow assumption is made for the dryer model and the non-spherical shape of particles is considered in drag and heat transfer coefficients. The set of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations is solved numerically for the velocity, moisture and temperature of particles and air along the dryer. The model is applied to simulate the drying of potato particles under different conditions. Model predictions are used to illustrate the complex transport phenomena that occur during the process and the profiles of temperature, moisture content and pressure developed through the dryer. Effects of mass flowrates ratio, velocity and temperature of air, shape and size of particle on drying time and final moisture content of the material are studied. 3awater content 3afoods 3aparticles 3adrying 3amathematical models 3aequations 3ahumidity 3atemperature 3ashrinkage 3aprediction 3apotato products 3amass transfer 3amomentum 3aparticle size 3aheat transfer 3aair flow 3ahydrodynamics 3afood processing 3ashape 0aflash drying1 aCrapiste, G.H.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 June, v. 48, no. 4 p.301-310x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02454naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245015000168300001800318520121200336650002201548650002501570650001301595650001901608650001101627650001101638650001401649650001401663650001401677650002001691650001301711650001301724700001901737700002101756700003301777773013801810852000901948856008801957946001102045655001202056IND4440285020221120155556.0100723e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444028502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGendrin, Claire10aPost-translational membrane sorting of the Toxoplasma gondii GRA6 protein into the parasite-containing vacuole is driven by its N-terminal domain  ap. 1325-1334.  aHow eukaryotic pathogens export and sort membrane-bound proteins destined for host-cell compartments is still poorly understood. The dense granules of the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii constitute an unusual secretory pathway that allows soluble export of the GRA proteins which become membrane-associated within the parasite replicative vacuole. This process relies on both the segregation of the proteins routed to the dense granules from those destined to the parasite plasma membrane and on the sorting of the secreted GRA proteins to their proper final membranous system. Here, we provide evidence that the soluble trafficking of GRA6 to the dense granules relies on the N-terminal domain of the protein, which is sufficient to prevent GRA6 targeting to the parasite plasma membrane. We also show that the GRA6 N-terminal domain, possibly by interacting with negatively charged lipids, is fundamental for proper GRA6 association with the vacuolar membranous network of nanotubes. These results support our emerging model: sorting of transmembrane GRA proteins to the host cell vacuole is mainly driven by the dual role of their N-terminal hydrophilic domain and is compartmentally regulated. 3aToxoplasma gondii 3acytoplasmic granules 3agranules 3ahydrophilicity 3alipids 3amodels 3ananotubes 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 3avacuoles1 aBittame, Amina1 aMercier, Corinne1 aCesbron-Delauw, Marie-France0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2010 Sept., v. 40, no. 11 p.1325-1334d[Oxford; New York]: Elsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.03.0143Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02284naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245007900144300001400223520147000237650001901707650002901726653002101755653003101776700001801807773009101825852000901916930003301925945002501958946001101983655001201994IND4368010420221120150759.0050329e20050107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436801042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDekker, J.P.10aSupramolecular organization of thylakoid membrane proteins in green plants  ap. 12-39.  aThe light reactions of photosynthesis in green plants are mediated by four large protein complexes, embedded in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII) are both organized into large supercomplexes with variable amounts of membrane-bound peripheral antenna complexes. PSI consists of a monomeric core complex with single copies of four different LHCI proteins and has binding sites for additional LHCI and/or LHCII complexes. PSII supercomplexes are dimeric and contain usually two to four copies of trimeric LHCII complexes. These supercomplexes have a further tendency to associate into megacomplexes or into crystalline domains, of which several types have been characterized. Together with the specific lipid composition, the structural features of the main protein complexes of the thylakoid membranes form the main trigger for the segregation of PSII and LHCII from PSI and ATPase into stacked grana membranes. We suggest that the margins, the strongly folded regions of the membranes that connect the grana, are essentially protein-free, and that protein-protein interactions in the lumen also determine the shape of the grana. We also discuss which mechanisms determine the stacking of the thylakoid membranes and how the supramolecular organization of the pigment-protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane and their flexibility may play roles in various regulatory mechanisms of green plant photosynthesis. 3aphotosynthesis 3alight harvesting complex 0astate transition 0anonphotochemical quenching1 aBoekema, E.J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2005 Jan. 7, v. 1706, no. 1-2 p.12-39x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20050815b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/04/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02671naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245005800163300001600221520152300237650001601760650002001776650001701796650000901813650001001822650001301832650001901845650001901864650002101883650001101904650001701915650001301932650001101945650001101956653001501967653002001982773010902002852000902111856008502120930003302205946001102238655001202249IND4413733820221120150817.0081212e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441373382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-008-9111-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaase, N. U. 10aHealthy Aspects of Potatoes as Part of the Human Diet  ap. 239-258.  aPotatoes are constituents of many diets. Nutritionalists identify several positive aspects but also discuss some adverse reactions. Therefore, healthiness of potato food has to be established taking into account new knowledge about natural constituents and food-borne substances. This paper presents data of three main areas: carbohydrates, toxins and antioxidants. The glycaemic behaviour of prepared potatoes has discredited the general understanding of potatoes as a healthy foodstuff. Boiled or steamed potatoes contain a large amount of rapidly available starch, but alongside genotype driven variability some preparation steps may also have an influence. The glycaemic load as the most relevant criterion for healthy subjects is relatively low. Potatoes may contain toxins, either natural (e.g. glycoalkaloids) or food-borne toxins (e.g. acrylamide). Minimization strategies have been developed for several potato dishes to reduce the intake substantially. Consumer handling particularly determines the specific level with those toxins. Antioxidants are a potent source of health promoting reactions in humans. They are present in potatoes, but specific concentrations are related to several aspects, e.g. plant growth, time interval after lifting, genotype, and kind of preparation. Again, the way in which consumers handle the potatoes is relevant. In summary, potatoes are very well suited for our modern diet, but consumers need advice to ensure that they are stored and prepared in the most appropriate way. 3aacrylamides 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3adiet 3afoods 3agenotype 3aglycemic index 3aglycoalkaloids 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3aplant growth 3apotatoes 3astarch 3atoxins 0aAcrylamide 0aGlycaemic index0 tPotato research.g2008 Dec., v. 51, no. 3-4 p.239-258dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0014-30657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-008-9111-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02403naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001500170245012100185300001600306500002400322520109000346650003201436650002001468650001801488650002801506650003101534650001301565650002101578650002201599650002001621650002101641700001801662700001601680773011501696852000901811856009201820930003301912945002501945946001101970655001201981IND4420186520221120140850.0090508e20090512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2008.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aR100 0aR3001 aRezaei, J.10aNutritive value of fresh and ensiled amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) treated with different levels of molasses  ap. 153-160.  aIncludes references  aThe nutritive value of the fresh and ensiled amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) treated with various levels of molasses was assessed.

Based on its moderate CP value and in vitro gas production, amaranth has potential as a livestock forage and, when drying is not practical, amaranth can be preserved as silage. 3agas production (biological) 3anutritive value 3asilage making 3aamaranth grain products 3aAmaranthus hypochondriacus 3amolasses 3afeed composition 3aforage evaluation 3afeed processing 3anutrient content1 aRouzbehan, Y.1 aFazaeli, H.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2009 May 12, v. 151, no. 1-2 p.153-160dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2008.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/05/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03175naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100002000181245013200201300001800333506007600351520074000427506003701167650002801204650002201232650000901254650001701263650002001280650002501300650002501325650001401350650001801364650002201382650002701404650001201431650001901443650002401462650001201486650002301498650003301521650002501554650002401579650002201603650001701625650002801642650002801670650003101698650001201729650003001741650006001771650000801831650005201839650002701891650003401918650004501952650001201997653002802009653001902037653001302056700001702069700002002086700001702106773014302123852000902266856008302275930003302358945001302391946001302404655001202417IND2047276720221207134036.0950814e19950718dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204727672DNAL7 a75427752pmid7 aPMC414092pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.15.67632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChouinard, S.W.12aA potassium channel beta subunit related to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily is encoded by the Drosophila Hyperkinetic locus  ap. 6763-6767.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenetic and physiological studies of the Drosophila Hyperkinetic (Hk) mutant revealed defects in the function or regulation of K+ channels encoded by the Shaker (Sh) locus. The Hk polypeptide, determined from analysis of cDNA clones, is a homologue of mammalian K+ channel beta subunits (Kv beta). Coexpression of Hk with Sh in Xenopus oocytes increases current amplitudes and changes the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation, consistent with predicted functions of Hk in vivo. Sequence alignments show that Hk, together with mammalian Kv beta, represents an additional branch of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. These results are relevant to understanding the function and evolutionary origin of Kv beta.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3acomplementary DNA 3aloci 3apolypeptides 3aoxidoreductases 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3apotassium 3aion transport 3aelectrophysiology 3agenetic transformation 3aoocytes 3aXenopus laevis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aElectrophysiology 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Insectxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Familyxgenetics 2aOocytes 2aOxidoreductasesxgenetics 2aPotassium Channelsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aShaker Superfamily of Potassium Channels 2aXenopus 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u23545 0ahk locus1 aWilson, G.F.1 aSchlimgen, A.K.1 aGanetsky, B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 July 18, v. 92, no. 15 p.6763-6767x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.15.67633Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03294naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245011800187300001600305520125000321650001501571650002501586650002301611650003001634650001901664650001501683650002201698650001401720650002801734650003001762650002001792650002001812650001501832650001801847650001401865650002701879650001501906650001301921650006001934650003501994650002302029650004002052650003902092650001702131650002802148650002902176650003302205650002702238650002202265653002302287653001902310700001302329700001302342700001602355773012802371852000902499856009202508930003302600946001102633655001202644IND4416225120221120130026.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441622512DNAL7 a192155802pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02487.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, H.Y.10aAnalysis of expressed sequence tags from Chaetomium cupreum grown under conditions associated with mycoparasitism  ap. 275-280.  aTo elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with mycoparasitism from Chaetomium cupreum, an effective biocontrol agent with ability against plant pathogenic fungi. One cDNA library was constructed from conditions predicted to resemble mycoparasitic process. A total of 1876 ESTs were generated and assembled into 1035 unigenes. B lastX search revealed that 585 unigenes had similarities with sequences available from public databases. Based on the ESTs abundance, MFS monosaccharide transporter was found as the gene expressed at the highest level. A KEGG analysis allowed mapping of 60 metabolic pathways well represented by the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, d-arginine and ornithine metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. The genes related to mycoparasitism were detected. The results revealed that the cell walls of the fungal pathogen can simulate some aspects of the mycoparasitic interaction between C. cupreum and its targets. This is the first report to study genes expression under conditions associated with the mycoparasitic process. The findings contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in mycoparasitism and will help to advance our efforts in developing novel strategies for biocontrol of plant fungal diseases. 3aChaetomium 3abiochemical pathways 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acDNA libraries 3acell walls 3acomplementary DNA 3adatabases 3aexpressed sequence tags 3afungal diseases of plants 3agene expression 3agluconeogenesis 3aglycolysis 3amycoparasites 3aornithine 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3atryptophan 3aunigenes 2aChaetomiumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aComputational Biologyxmethods 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aExpressed Sequence Tagsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGene Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology 0aChaetomium cupreum 0amycoparasitism1 aYang, Q.1 aWang, G.1 aShang, F.D.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2009 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.275-280dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02487.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090213b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02747naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002100170245011000191300001600301500002400317520152100341650002601862650001301888650002001901650001101921650002701932650001201959650001501971650001901986650001802005650001602023653001302039773011502052852000902167856009202176930003302268945002502301946001102326655001202337IND4420186720221120130108.0090508e20090512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aMansoori, Behzad10aAbsorption capacity of chicken intestine for d-xylose in response to graded concentrations of tannic acid  ap. 167-171.  aIncludes references  aDietary tannins alter the mechanisms involved in cellular uptake and transport of simple sugars. An experiment was conducted on broiler chickens to evaluate the absorptive response of intestine to the graded concentrations of tannic acid (TA), using d-xylose absorption test. Four groups of ten 28-d-old broiler cockerels, were given d-xylose solution alone (500mgkg⁻¹ BW, group 1) and with TA solution at a dose of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5g/bird (groups 2-4, respectively), orally. One blood samples prior-to, and four others after administration of test material, were collected by ulnar vein puncture on 40min basis for 160min, and the concentration of d-xylose in plasma was measured. The plasma d-xylose concentration in each group had a quadratic correlation with time (P<0.001, R ² =0.75, 0.84, 0.73 and 0.84 for groups 1-4, respectively). Tannic acid delayed and severely suppressed the intestinal absorption of d-xylose in groups 2-4 (P<0.001). The plasma d-xylose concentration of group was negatively related to the level of dosed TA with an exponential trend at each time of blood sampling (R ² =0.88, 0.87, 0.86 and 0.83 for 40, 80, 120 and 160min post-ingestion of TA solution, respectively). Tannic acid showed to be a strong luminal inhibitor of sugar absorption. However, the ingestion of higher concentrations of TA (1.5g/bird) did not further reduce the concentration of plasma d-xylose suggesting the influence of TA on the intestinal absorption capacity was dose-dependent in an exponential manner. 3aintestinal absorption 3achickens 3apoultry feeding 3axylose 3achemical concentration 3atannins 3atest meals 3ablood sampling 3adose response 3apolyphenols 0ad-xylose0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2009 May 12, v. 151, no. 1-2 p.167-171dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.01.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/05/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02779naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002000126024001800146040001800164100001500182245008500197300002000282500001500302506007600317520104000393506003701433650002701470650001801497650002201515650003001537650001501567650002001582650001901602650004101621650002201662650001901684650002001703653001301723653002001736653003401756653001201790653003201802653001301834653003001847653001301877653002601890700001301916773014401929852000902073856008402082930003302166945001302199946001302212655001202225IND2047208420221207132030.0950809e19911201dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204720842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.88.23.105582doi7 aPMC529682pmcid7 a16601412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDale, E.C.10aGene transfer with subsequent removal of the selection gene from the host genome  ap. 10558-10562.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA general method of gene transfer that does not leave behind a selectable marker in the host genome is described. A luciferase gene was introduced into the tobacco genome by using the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hpt) as a linked selectable marker. Flanked by recombination sites from the bacteriophage P1 Cre/lox recombination system, the hpt gene was subsequently excised from the plant genome by the Cre recombinase. The Cre-catalyzed excision event in the plant genome was precise and conservative--i.e., without loss or alteration of nucleotides in the recombinant site. After removal of the Cre-encoding locus by genetic segregation, plants were obtained that had incorporated only the desired transgene. Gene transfer without the incorporation of antibiotic-resistance markers in the host genome should ease public concerns over the field release of transgenic organisms expressing such traits. Moreover, it would obviate the need for different selectable markers in subsequent rounds of gene transfer into the same host.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aluciferase 3aplasmid vectors 3abacteriophages 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3agenetic markers 0aluc gene 0acre recombinase 0ahygromycin phosphotransferase 0aenzymes 0asite specific recombination 0ahpt gene 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0acre gene 0agenetic recombination1 aOw, D.W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1991 Dec. 1, v. 88, no. 23 p.10558-10562x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.88.23.105583Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02784naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003300131040001800164100001800182245012400200300001800324500001500342506007600357520118400433506003701617650002501654650000901679650001601688650003601704650002301740650002701763650002301790650001201813650002001825650003801845650002801883653001501911653001601926653001801942700001601960700002101976773014201997852000902139856008302148930003302231945001302264946001302277655001202290IND2047017820221207132017.0950727e19950703dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204701782DNAL7 a116075542pmid7 aPMC415652pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.14.65972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCentury, K.S.10aNDR1, a locus of Arabidopsis thaliana that is required for disease resistance to both a bacterial and a fungal pathogen  ap. 6597-6601.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have employed Arabidopsis thaliana as a model host plant to genetically dissect the molecular pathways leading to disease resistance. A. thaliana accession Col-0 is susceptible to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 but resistant in a race-specific manner to DC3000 carrying any one of the cloned avirulence genes avrB, avrRpm1, avrRpt2, and avrPph3. Fast-neutron-mutagenized Col-0 M2 seed was screened to identify mutants susceptible to DC3000(avrB). Disease assays and analysis of in planta bacterial growth identified one mutant, ndr1-1 (nonrace-specific disease resistance), that was susceptible to DC3000 expressing any one of the four avirulence genes tested. Interestingly, a hypersensitive-like response was still induced by several of the strains. The ndr1-1 mutation also rendered the plant susceptible to several avirulent isolates of the fungal pathogen Peronospora parasitica. Genetic analysis of ndr1-1 demonstrated that the mutation segregated as a single recessive locus, located on chromosome III. Characterization of the ndr1-1 mutation suggests that a common step exists in pathways of resistance to two unrelated pathogens.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aloci 3amutagenesis 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3achromosome mapping 3aPeronospora parasitica 3adisease resistance 3amutants 3arecessive genes 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea 3ahypersensitive response 0andr1 locus 0achromosomes 0agene location1 aHolub, E.B.1 aStaskawicz, B.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 July 3, v. 92, no. 14 p.6597-6601x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.14.65973Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02521naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002000125024001900145040001800164100001800182245013900200300001800339500001500357506007600372520107200448506003701520650004501557650002401602650000901626650002301635650002201658650002301680650002001703650002601723653001601749700001401765700001501779773014201794852000901936856008301945930003302028945001302061946001302074655001202087IND2047018320221207132028.0950727e19950703dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204701832DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.92.14.66452doi7 aPMC415752pmcid7 a116075562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubcovsky, J.10aDifferentiation between homoeologous chromosomes 1A of wheat and 1Am on Triticum monococcum and its recognition by the wheat Ph1 locus  ap. 6645-6649.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn most allopolyploid plants, only homogenetic chromosome pairing occurs in meiosis, as a result of the recognition of genome differentiation by the genetic system regulating meiotic chromosome pairing. The nature of differentiation between chromosomes of closely related genomes is examined here by investigating recombination between wheat chromosome 1A and the closely related homoeologous chromosome 1Am of Triticum monococcum. The recognition of the differentiation between these chromosomes by the Ph1 locus, which prevents heterogenetic chromosome pairing in wheat, is also investigated. Chromosomes 1A and 1Am are shown to be colinear, and it is concluded that they are differentiated "substructurally." This substructural differentiation is argued to be recognized by the Ph1 locus. In the absence of Ph1, the distribution and frequencies of crossing over between the 1A and 1Am homoeologues were similar to the distribution and frequencies of crossing over between 1A homologues. The cytogenetic and evolutionary significance of these findings is discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aTriticum monococcum 3aloci 3achromosome mapping 3aTriticum aestivum 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenetic markers 3agenetic recombination 0achromosomes1 aLuo, M.C.1 aDvorak, J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 July 3, v. 92, no. 14 p.6645-6649x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.14.66453Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02432naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001900128245009200147300001600239500002400255500001500279520101600294650002901310650001801339650001101357650001401368650002001382650002401402650001901426650001701445650001801462650002001480650002201500650001701522650001601539650002701555653001601582700001901598700001801617700001801635773013101653852000901784856007401793930003301867945002501900946001301925655001201938IND4415279420221120110647.0090123s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441527942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aF1101 aFreeland, R.S.10aUsing Ground-Penetrating Radar to Evaluate Soil Compaction of Athletic Turfgrass Fields  ap. 509-514.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRepairing a compacted turfgrass athletic field is a laborious activity, requiring significant expense. The objective of this project is to develop a rapid survey method for mapping soil compaction that occurs from player trafficking. Once mapped, field managers can target compacted regions of their fields for site-specific remediation; thereby, reducing their labor and expenses. We developed a non-intrusive survey protocol employing ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and an ultra-high frequency antenna. The ultra-high frequency antenna probed to a very shallow depth, into the near-surface layers affected by foot-traffic compaction. We scanned a profile extending 50 cm beneath the turfgrass surface of a football field. The GPR survey supplied spatial patterns of soil compaction, and the horizon thicknesses of organic matter, sand, and the gravel-base substratum. The spatial patterns of the GPR data sets compared similarly to those patterns of surface hardness obtained using a Clegg Impact Soil Tester. 3aground-penetrating radar 3asand fraction 3agravel 3athickness 3aathletic fields 3asoil organic matter 3alawns and turf 3asoil surveys 3asoil horizons 3asoil compaction 3aspatial variation 3aturf grasses 3ameasurement 3anondestructive methods 0amethodology1 aSorochan, J.C.1 aGoddard, M.J.1 aMcElroy, J.S.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2008, v. 24, no. 4 p.509-514dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/12  aOther US 7aarticle02804naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012900169300001400298520140600312650000801718650001301726650002201739650001401761650001601775650002401791650001801815650001101833650002301844650001701867650001201884650000901896650002701905650001601932650001601948653002301964653003101987653003702018653002202055773012402077852000902201856009202210930003302302946001102335655001202346IND4416878620221120110636.0090228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441687862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-6593.2007.00106.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChesnaux, R.10aHow groundwater seepage and transport modelling software can be useful for studying gaseous transport in an unsaturated soil  ap. 32-40.  aThe aim of this paper is to show how standard hydrogeologic software, usually used to model contaminant transport in groundwater under unsaturated conditions, can also be used to model gas transport in unsaturated porous media. Physical processes involved in the interaction between the atmosphere and the unsaturated soils are considered: transport by diffusion through the air and the groundwater, exchange between the liquid and gas phases and consumption. These physical processes are incorporated into the governing equations of a groundwater numerical code; by considering air, contained in the unsaturated soil, as water in the seepage numerical model, the air effectively becomes fluid within the numerical code. Then, the investigated gas is defined as the contaminant in the transport model, which is transported by -the air for the modeller-, and -water for the numerical code-. The over-riding assumption is that the air profiles and, therefore, water profiles of volume contents remain constant. The approach is illustrated using two examples, which consider the transport of oxygen. The first deals with oxygen distribution through a laboratory-cell diffusion containing reactive mining tailings. The second deals with the oxygen fluxes through the vadose zone, between the atmosphere and an unconfined aquifer's water table. Both examples consider different cases of oxygen consumption. 3aair 3aaquifers 3acomputer software 3aequations 3agroundwater 3amathematical models 3amine tailings 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aporous media 3aseepage 3asoil 3aunsaturated conditions 3avadose zone 3awater table 0agas flux modelling 0agroundwater numerical code 0amining tailings waste management 0aunsaturated soils0 tWater and environment journal.g2009 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.32-40dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1747-65857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-6593.2007.00106.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03048naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012400167300001800291520156300309650002001872650002001892650001601912650002001928650001101948650002301959650001101982650001101993650001502004650002202019650001502041650003002056650001302086650001802099650001902117650001302136650001202149700002102161700002102182700001902203700003602222700002202258773013602280852000902416856008502425930003302510946001102543655001202554IND4434013720221120095405.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443401372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-010-3460-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimalt, Joan O. 10aIntegrated analysis of halogenated organic pollutants in sub-millilitre volumes of venous and umbilical cord blood sera  ap. 2265-2272.  aA rapid, robust and economical method for the analysis of persistent halogenated organic compounds in small volumes of human serum and umbilical cord blood is described. The pollutants studied cover a broad range of molecules of contemporary epidemiological and legislative concern, including polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlorobenzenes (CBs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), DDTs, polychlorostyrenes (PCSs) and polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Extraction and clean-up with n-hexane and concentrated sulphuric acid was followed with analysis by gas chromatography coupled to electron capture (GC-ECD) and GC coupled to negative ion chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (GC-NICI-MS). The advantages of this method rest in the broad range of analytes and its simplicity and robustness, while the use of concentrated sulphuric acid extraction/clean-up destroys viruses that may be present in the samples. Small volumes of reference serum between 50 and 1000 μL were extracted and the limits of detection/quantification and repeatability were determined. Recoveries of spiked compounds for the extraction of small volumes (≥300 μL) of the spiked reference serum were between 90% and 120%. The coefficients of variation of repeatability ranged from 0.1-14%, depending on the compound. Samples of 4-year-old serum and umbilical cord blood (n = 73 and 40, respectively) from a population inhabiting a village near a chloro-alkali plant were screened for the above-mentioned halogenated pollutants using this method and the results are briefly described. 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aethers 3agas chromatography 3ahexane 3ahumans 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asampling 3asulfuric acid 3aumbilical cord 3avillages 3aviruses1 aHowsam, Michael.1 aCarrizo, Daniel 1 aOtero, Raquel 1 ade Marchi, Mary Rosa Rodrigues 1 aVizcaino, Esther 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 Mar., v. 396, no. 6 p.2265-2272dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-3460-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02693naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245018000163300001800343520121600361650001301577650002301590650001501613650001901628650001901647650004101666650001501707650001201722650002501734650001901759650002001778650001201798700001801810700002201828700002401850700002101874700002301895700001901918700002401937773013601961852000902097856008502106930003302191946001102224655001202235IND4434013820221120095401.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443401382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-009-3434-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDück, Roman 10aCombination of chemical and electron-impact ionisation with GC×GC-qMS for characterization of fatty alcohol alkoxylate polymers in the low-molecular-weight range up to 700 Da  ap. 2273-2283.  aThe class of fatty alcohol alkoxylates describes surfactants that are synthesised by reaction of fatty alcohols with alkoxides such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide or a combination of both as copolymers. Such alkoxylates are used, for example, as nonionic surfactants in home and industrial cleaning and washing agents. Chemical characteristics of such alkoxylate copolymers, for example the degree of alkoxylation, the arrangement of building blocks (random or block polymerisation), the type of the starter, and endcapping, play an important role in application behaviour. The analysis of these characteristics is challenging because in many cases such copolymers have high polydispersity and a large number of constitutional isomers depending on the degree of alkoxylation. Furthermore, the alkoxylates often occur in a complex multicomponent matrix. Here we present a method for characterization of silylated fatty alcohol alkoxylates in the low-molecular-weight range by means of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with electron impact and chemical ionisation. This method also enables detailed analysis of the alkoxylates in a complex matrix such as modern detergents. 3acleaning 3acomposite polymers 3adetergents 3aethylene oxide 3afatty alcohols 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aionization 3aisomers 3anonionic surfactants 3apolymerization 3apropylene oxide 3awashing1 aWulf, Volker 1 aGeißler, Margit 1 aBaier, Hans-Ulrich 1 aWirtz, Michaela 1 aKling, Hans-Willi 1 aGäb, Siegmar 1 aSchmitz, Oliver J. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 Mar., v. 396, no. 6 p.2273-2283dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-009-3434-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03824naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001500185245014000200300001400340500002400354500001500378520128100393650002001674650003301694650001801727650001601745650001501761650001201776650002001788650002501808650002401833650002001857650002701877650001701904650002101921650001801942650001101960650001401971650002001985650002102005650002402026650001602050650002202066650001902088650001202107650002902119650001802148650001102166650001402177650003102191650002502222650003802247650004702285650005802332650003802390650001602428650001302444650003102457653001702488653001902505700001602524700001802540700001702558700001202575700001702587700001702604700001802621700001302639700001802652700001602670773009402686852000902780856008802789930003302877945002502910946001102935655001202946IND4420188620221120095319.0090508e20090528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018862DNAL7 a191678432pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aCao, Yimei10aSynthesis of empty capsid-like particles of Asia I foot-and-mouth disease virus in insect cells and their immunogenicity in guinea pigs  ap. 10-17.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe assembly of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) requires the cleavage of the P12A polyprotein into individual structural proteins by protease 3C. In this study, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus that simultaneously expressed the genes for the P12A and 3C proteins of Asia I FMDV from individual promoters. The capsid proteins expressed in High Five[trade mark sign] insect cells were processed by viral 3C protease, as shown by Western blotting, and were antigenic, as revealed by their reactivity in an indirect sandwich-ELISA, and by immunofluorescent assay. The empty capsid-like particles were similar to authentic 75S empty capsids from FMDV in terms of their shape, size and sedimentation velocity, as demonstrated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Both empty capsid-like particles and some small-sized particles (about 10nm in diameter) were also observed using immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, the empty capsid-like particles or intermediates induced high levels of FMDV-specific antibodies in guinea pigs following immunization, and neutralizing antibodies were induced in the second week after vaccination. These recombinant, non-infectious, FMDV empty capsids are potentially useful for the development of new diagnostic techniques and vaccines. 3ain vivo studies 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aBaculoviridae 3avaccination 3acell lines 3ainsects 3aanimal diseases 3arecombinant proteins 3astructural proteins 3agene expression 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3apathogenesis 3asubunit vaccines 3acoat proteins 3acapsid 3alivestock 3aimmune response 3ain vitro studies 3avaccine development 3aguinea pigs 3aprotein synthesis 3aviral antigens 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aBaculoviridae 2aCapsid 2aCell Line 2aDNA, Recombinantxgenetics 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFoot-and-Mouth Diseasexbloodximmunology. 2aFoot-and-Mouth Disease Virusximmunologyxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viral 2aGuinea Pigs 2aInsecta. 2aViral Vaccinesximmunology 0aempty capsid 0aviral proteins1 aLu, Zengjun1 aSun, Jiachuan1 aBai, Xingwen1 aSun, Pu1 aBao, Huifang1 aChen, Yingli1 aGuo, Jianhong1 aLi, Dong1 aLiu, Xiangtao1 aLiu, Zaixin0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 May 28, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.10-17dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02892naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002000167245012000187300001600307500002400323520135500347650002001702650001401722650002301736650001201759650001701771650001101788650001301799650002501812650001401837650001601851650002001867650002501887650001301912650001501925650002501940650004201965700002102007700001702028700001802045700001602063700001402079773010202093852000902195856008902204930003302293945002502326946001102351655001202362IND4420184020221120085739.0090508e20090617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2009.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF8411 aLiu, Zhong-Jing10aExogenous paraquat changes antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation in drought-stressed cucumber leaves  ap. 138-143.  aIncludes references  aIn order to examine whether paraquat modifies the functioning of antioxidants and oxidative stress levels in drought-stressed plants, a cucumber cultivar (Cucumis sativus cv. Yuexiu no. 3) was grown hydroponically for 2 days. Drought stress, which was induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), increased the contents of malonaldehyde (MDA), superoxide radical (O₂ ⁻) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in cucumber leaves, while pretreatment of paraquat decreased them. Under drought stress induced by PEG, we observed the decreased contents of MDA, H₂O₂ and O₂ ⁻ in paraquat-pretreated plants in comparison to unpretreated stressed plants. Drought stress and paraquat both increased the activities of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.7), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1), monodehydroascorbate reducatase (MDHAR, EC 1.6.5.4), glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2), reduced glutathione (GSH) and reduced ascorbate (AsA). But the combined effect of paraquat application and drought stress resulted in the highest activities of antioxidants. So paraquat is able to moderate the activities of scavenging system enzymes and to influence oxidative stress intensity under drought stress induced by PEG. 3aCucumis sativus 3acucumbers 3alipid peroxidation 3adrought 3awater stress 3aleaves 3aparaquat 3aantioxidant activity 3acultivars 3ahydroponics 3amalondialdehyde 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acatalase 3aperoxidase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate)1 aZhang, Xiao-Long1 aBai, Ji-Gang1 aSuo, Bang-Xia1 aXu, Pei-Lei1 aWang, Lin0 tScientia horticulturae.g2009 June 17, v. 121, no. 2 p.138-143dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2009.01.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03703naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001700181245012300198300001800321506007600339520141200415506003701827650001301864650002101877650001801898650001701916650002501933650003601958650003501994650001902029650008002048650002402128650002902152650010102181650004602282650009602328650002902424650003202453650002002485650002502505650003702530650004702567653001202614653001702626653001602643700001802659700001402677700002102691700002102712700001902733700001902752773014302771852000902914856008302923930003303006945001303039946001303052655001203065IND2047280520221207123021.0950814e19950718dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204728052DNAL7 a76243812pmid7 aPMC414832pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.15.71202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBokros, C.L.10aFunction of the p86 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor (iso)4F as a microtubule-associated protein in plant cells  ap. 7120-7124.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe isozyme form of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F [eIF-(iso)4F] from wheat germ is composed of a p28 subunit that binds the 7-methylguanine cap of mRNA and a p86 subunit having unknown function. The p86 subunit was found to have limited sequence similarity to a kinesin-like protein encoded by the katA gene of Arabidopsis thaliana. Native wheat germ eIF-(iso)4F and bacterially expressed p86 subunit and p86-p28 complex bound to taxol-stabilized maize microtubules (MTs) in vitro. Binding saturation occurred at 1 mol of p86 per 5-6 mol of polymerized tubulin dimer, demonstrating a substoichiometric interaction of p86 with MTs. No evidence was found for a direct interaction of the p28 subunit with MTs. Unlike kinesin, cosedimentation of eIF(iso)4F with MTs was neither reduced by MgATP nor enhanced by adenosine 5'-[gamma-imido]triphosphate. Both p86 subunit and p86-p28 complex induced the bundling of MTs in vitro. The p86 subunit was immunolocalized to the cytosol in root maize cells and existed in three forms: fine particles, coarse particles, and linear patches. Many coarse particles and linear patches were colocalized or closely associated with cortical MT bundles in interphase cells. The results indicate that the p86 subunit of eIF-(iso)4F is a MT-associated protein that may simultaneously link the translational machinery to the cytoskeleton and regulate MT disposition in plant cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3abinding proteins 3amessenger RNA 3amicrotubules 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aEukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aImmunoblotting 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aKinesinsxgenetics. 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMicrotubule-Associated Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMicrotubulesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPeptide Initiation Factorsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxultrastructure 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Conformation 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aZea maysxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0abinding 0ainteractions 0atranslation1 aHugdahl, J.D.1 aKim, H.H.1 aHanesworth, V.R.1 aHeerden, A. van.1 aBrowning, K.S.1 aMorejohn, L.C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 July 18, v. 92, no. 15 p.7120-7124x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.15.71203Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03301naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003000171245010900201300001600310520122300326650002601549650002901575650002901604650002601633650001201659650001101671650001601682650002501698650001901723650001101742650002001753650001301773650000701786650002001793650001401813650002301827650004001850650001301890650007401903650001101977650007301988650001402061650007402075650002702149653001702176653002802193653002502221700002002246700002902266700002602295700002902321700002202350700002302372773012302395852000902518856009202527930003302619946001102652655001202663IND4411576620221120054425.0081017e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441157662DNAL7 a190540822pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01366.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReshetnikov, Alexander S.10aCharacterization of the pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath  ap. 202-210.  aAn active pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) from the thermotolerant methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus Bath, containing a six-residue polyhistidine tag, was characterized. The enzyme was homodimeric (2 x 45 kDa), nonallosteric and most active at pH 7.0. PPi-PFK catalyzed reactions of PPi-dependent phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) (Km 2.27 mM and Vmax 7.6 U mg⁻¹ of protein), sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (Km 0.027 mM and Vmax 31 U mg⁻¹) and ribulose-5-phosphate. In the reaction with F-6-P, the apparent Km for PPi was 0.027 mM, while in the reverse reaction, Km for orthophosphate was 8.69 mM and that for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 0.328 mM (Vmax 9.0 U mg⁻¹). Phylogenetically, M. capsulatus PPi-PFK was most similar to PPi-PFKs from the lithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizers Nitrosomonas europaea (74.0%), Nitrosospira multiformis (73.6%) and Betaproteobacterial methylotroph Methylibium petroleiphilum PM1 (71.6% identity). Genes coding PPi-PFK and a putative V-type H⁺-translocating pyrophosphatase (H⁺-PPi-ase) were cotranscribed as an operon. The potential significance of the PPi-PFK for regulation of carbon and energy fluxes in M. capsulatus Bath is discussed. 3a6-phosphofructokinase 3aMethylococcus capsulatus 3aNitrosolobus multiformis 3aNitrosomonas europaea 3aammonia 3acarbon 3aenergy flow 3afructose 6-phosphate 3aheat tolerance 3aoperon 3aorthophosphates 3aoxidants 3apH 3aphosphorylation 3aphylogeny 2aCloning, Molecular 2aInorganic Pyrophosphatasexgenetics 2aKinetics 2aMethylococcus capsulatusxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aOperon 2aPhosphotransferasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amethanotroph 0aPPi-phosphofructokinase 0aH⁺-pyrophosphatase1 aRozova, Olga N.1 aKhmelenina, Valentina N.1 aMustakhimov, Ildar I.1 aBeschastny, Alexander P.1 aMurrell, J.

The elements are localized within intron and flanking regions of many genes. These elements consist of two inverted repeats flanking sequences ranging from 5 bp to > 500 bp. Identification of multiple elements in which sequence conservation includes both the flanking and internal regions implies that these TrEs are capable of duplicative transposition. Two of the elements were identified in promoter regions of the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) polygalacturonase and potato (Solanum tuberosum) Win1 genes. The element in the polygalacturonase promoter spans a known regulatory region. In both cases, ancestral DNA sequences, which represent potential recombination target sequences prior to insertion of the elements, have been cloned from related species. The sequences of the inverted repeated domains in plants and C. elegans show a high degree of phylogenetic conservation. While frequency of the different elements is variable, some are present in very high copy number A member of a single C. elegans TrE family is observed approximately once every 20 kb in the genome. The abundance of the described TrEs suggests utility in the genomic analysis of these and related organisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apromoter regions 3astructural genes 3asequence alignment 3apolygalacturonase 3aSolanum tuberosum 3agenetic recombination 3atransposons 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPolygalacturonasexgenetics 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSolanum tuberosumxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 0acomparisons 0awin1 gene 0ainverted repeat flanking sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aSolanum 0arepetitive sequences1 aGarlick, B.1 aBelknap, W.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Sept. 12, v. 92, no. 19 p.8886-8890x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.19.88863Available from publisher's Web site  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03299naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100002400181245013200205300001600337500002400353500001500377520173300392650002202125650001702147650002302164650002302187650001502210650002102225650001002246650002502256650002602281650002502307650002502332650002902357650002302386650004902409653002402458700002102482700001902503773010602522852000902628856007502637930003302712945002502745946001102770655001202781IND4415215220221120054435.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441521522DNAL7 a187981782pmid7 a10.1002/ps.16472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF200 0aX1001 aJacquemin, Bertrand10aModelling binary mixtures of herbicides in populations resistant to one of the components: evaluation for resistance management  ap. 113-121.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Herbicide mixtures are commonly proposed to delay the selection of herbicide resistance in susceptible populations (called the SM strategy). However, in practice, herbicide mixtures are often used when resistance to one of the two active ingredients has already been detected in the targeted population (called the RM strategy). It is doubtful whether such a practice can select against resistance, as the corresponding selection pressure is still exerted. As a consequence, the effect of mixtures on the evolution of an already detected resistance to one of the herbicides in the combination remains largely unexplored. In the present work, a simple model was developed to explore further the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a binary RM strategy might stabilise or even reduce resistance frequency.RESULTS: Covering the hypothetical largest range of parameters, 39% of 9000 random simulations attest that the RM strategy might theoretically reduce resistance frequency. When strong enough, high genetic cost of resistance, negative cross-resistance between the herbicides associated in the mixture and reduced selection differential between resistant and susceptible plants can counterbalance the resistance advantage to one of the two applied herbicides. However, the required conditions for an RM strategy to ensure resistance containment in natural conditions seldom overlap with experimental parameter estimates given in the literature.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the sufficient conditions for an RM strategy to be effective would rarely be encountered. As a consequence, the strategy of formulating mixtures with herbicides for which resistance has already been detected should be avoided. 3asimulation models 3aweed control 3agenetic resistance 3apesticide mixtures 3aherbicides 3across resistance 3aweeds 3aherbicide resistance 3aresistance management 2aBiological Evolution 2aHerbicide Resistance 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aModels, Biological 2aPoaceaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 0amathematical models1 aGasquez, Jacques1 aReboud, Xavier0 tPest management science.g2009 Feb., v. 65, no. 2 p.113-121dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.16473Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/03/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03889naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001400181245010700195300001800302500001500320506007600335520146700411506003701878650002001915650002401935650002501959650002701984650001802011650001202029650002102041650001302062650002202075650002002097650000902117650001502126650002002141650001902161650001202180650005502192650002002247650003702267650002602304650005202330650003002382650002202412650002802434650002202462650002102484650002702505650002002532650002202552650000902574650002502583650003902608650003102647650004802678653001202726653001902738653001702757653001502774700001502789700002002804773014402824852000902968856008302977930003303060945001303093946001303106655001203119IND2048085020221207133031.0951003e19950912dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204808502DNAL7 a75680082pmid7 aPMC410422pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.19.87392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNah, S.Y.12aA trace component of ginseng that inhibits Ca2+ channels through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein  ap. 8739-8743.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA crude extract from ginseng root inhibits high threshold, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels through an unknown receptor linked to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. We now have found the particular compound that seems responsible for the effect: it is a saponin, called ginsenoside Rf (Rf), that is present in only trace amounts within ginseng. At saturating concentrations, Rf rapidly and reversibly inhibits N-type, and other high-threshold, Ca2+ channels in rat sensory neurons to the same degree as a maximal dose of opioids. The effect is dose-dependent (half maximal inhibition: 40 micromolar) and it is virtually eliminated by pretreatment of the neurons with pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Go and G, GTP-binding proteins. Other ginseng saponins-ginsenosides Rb1, Rc, Re, and Rg1- caused relatively little inhibition of Ca2+ channels, and lipophilic components of ginseng root had no effect. Antagonists of a variety of neurotransmitter receptors that inhibit Ca2+ channels fail to alter the effect of Rf, raising the possibility that Rf acts through another G protein-linked receptor. Rf also inhibits Ca2+ channels in the hybrid F-11 cell line, which might, therefore, be useful for molecular characterization of the putative receptor for Rf. Because it is not a peptide and it shares important cellular and molecular targets with opioids, Rf might be useful in itself or as a template for designing additional modulators of neuronal Ca2+ channels.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aneurophysiology 3aPanax pseudoginseng 3amedicinal properties 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aion transport 3acalcium 3abinding proteins 3asaponins 3aelectrophysiology 3aplasma membrane 3arats 3acell lines 3asensory neurons 3ainorganic ions 2aAnimals 2aCalcium Channel Blockersxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aElectric Conductivity 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGanglia, Spinalxcytology 2aMolecular Mimicry 2aNarcoticsxpharmacology 2aNeurons, Afferent 2aPanaxxchemistry 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPertussis Toxin 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSaponinsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aTissue Extractsxchemistry 2aVirulence Factors, Bordetellaxpharmacology 0aneurons 0aginsenoside rf 0aginsenosides 0ainhibition1 aPark, H.J.1 aMcCleskey, E.W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Sept. 12, v. 92, no. 19 p.8739-8743x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.19.87393Available from publisher's Web site  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03589naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182100002000199245012000219300001600339520136300355592002801718650001901746650001601765650001701781650001601798650001701814650004201831650000901873650001801882650001701900650002301917650001901940650001601959650002101975650001701996650001902013650001202032650004202044650002702086650001902113650003002132650001702162650002602179650001702205650002302222650000902245650003002254650000902284650002502293650002302318650007602341650004102417650004202458650004002500700001702540773013502557852000902692856008602701930003302787945002502820946001102845990002302856655001202879IND4371838220221120042250.0050628e20050301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437183822DNAL7 a159296362pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.75.2.1492doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study examined the effects of various antioxidants on several gastric parameters after a single exposure to indomethacin. Forty-eight male rats of the Sprague-Dawley (200–250 g) strain were randomly divided to receive a single antioxidant (tocopherol, tocotrienol, or ubiquinone) or a combination of two (tocopherol-tocotrienol, tocopherol-ubiquinone or tocotrienol-ubiquinone) for 28 days. The rats were then challenged with a single dose of indomethacin and killed six hours later. Findings showed that the severity of gastric lesions was comparable in all groups. Only groups that received a combination of antioxidants exhibited reduced lipid peroxidation compared with all other groups (p < 0.05). The combination groups had a higher level of gastric prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) content compared with all other groups (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference among the groups in the gastric acid concentration and the glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio. We conclude that although supplementation of these antioxidants in combination had desirable effects on lipid peroxidation and gastric PGE<sub>2</sub> level, they did not reduce the lesions produced by indomethacin.  aPublisher supplied data 3agastric mucosa 3atocopherols 3atocotrienols 3aubiquinones 3aindomethacin 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3arats 3apeptic ulcers 3aantioxidants 3alipid peroxidation 3aprostaglandins 3aglutathione 3alesions (animal) 3agastric acid 3adrug synergism 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosage 2aDinoprostonexanalysis 2aDrug Synergism 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aGastric Acid 2aGlutathionexanalysis 2aIndomethacin 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aMale 2aMalondialdehydexanalysis 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aStomachxchemistry 2aStomach Diseasesxchemically inducedxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aTocopherolsxadministration & dosage 2aTocotrienolsxadministration & dosage 2aUbiquinonexadministration & dosage1 aKang,  T.

First, Sb2S3 thin films have been deposited by spray pyrolysis method using an aqueous solution of antimony chloride and thiourea on the glass at a substrate temperature of 240 °C to 330 °C. Then, the deposition process of this layer has been done on fluorine- doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass at a constant temperature of 300 °C. The structural, surface morphological, optical and electrical characterizations of the samples were carried out using X-ray diffraction, field effect scanning electron microscope, UV–vis spectroscopy, and four-probe apparatus, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that by increasing substrate temperature, the amorphous nature of the Sb2S3 thin film changed to the polycrystalline structure. Also, while the layer/glass sample has an individual Sb2S3 (orthorhombic) crystalline phase, the band gap values for Sb2S3 thin films prepared by increasing substrate temperature varied from 1.68 eV to 1.75 eV. Data analysis showed the Sb2S3 thin film on both substrates had a relatively high absorption coefﬁcient (∼105 cm−1) in the visible range, and the direct bandgap had a smaller value in the layer grown on glass compared to that grown on FTO coated glass substrate. Electrical measurements exhibited the Sb2S3/FTO sample had a lower sheet resistance and resistivity than the Sb2S3/glass sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantimony 3aaqueous solutions 3aglass 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asulfides 3atemperature 3athiourea 3atin dioxide 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aSb2S3 0aThin film 0aSpray pyrolysis 0aOptical properties 0aElectrical properties1 aAdelifard, M.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2019 June, v. 140 p.205-212dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2019.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012500169300001200294500001100306520164200317592002801959596006401987650002202051650002502073650002302098650001802121650001802139650001702157650002802174650001202202650002002214650002402234650001102258650002602269650001602295650001502311650001902326650002502345650001502370700001902385700002002404700001902424700006502443773014402508856008202652852000902734655001202743IND60623144720221120155924.0181209e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062314472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-018-2567-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwŏn, Yŏng-min,10aManipulation of the microalgal chloroplast by genetic engineering for biotechnological utilization as a green biofactory  ap. 183.  aReview  aThe chloroplast is an essential organelle in microalgae for conducting photosynthesis, thus enabling the photoautotrophic growth of microalgae. In addition to photosynthesis, the chloroplast is capable of various biochemical processes for the synthesis of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and terpenoids. Due to these attractive characteristics, there has been increasing interest in the biotechnological utilization of microalgal chloroplast as a sustainable alternative to the conventional production platforms used in industrial biotechnology. Since the first demonstration of microalgal chloroplast transformation, significant development has occurred over recent decades in the manipulation of microalgal chloroplasts through genetic engineering. In the present review, we describe the advantages of the microalgal chloroplast as a production platform for various bioproducts, including recombinant proteins and high-value metabolites, features of chloroplast genetic systems, and the development of transformation methods, which represent important factors for gene expression in the chloroplast. Furthermore, we address the expression of various recombinant proteins in the microalgal chloroplast through genetic engineering, including reporters, biopharmaceutical proteins, and industrial enzymes. Finally, we present many efforts and achievements in the production of high-value metabolites in the microalgal chloroplast through metabolic engineering. Based on these efforts and advances, the microalgal chloroplast represents an economically viable and sustainable platform for biotechnological applications in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018M00600cNational Marine Biodiversity Institute of Korea 3abiobased products 3abiochemical pathways 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abiotechnology 3acarbohydrates 3achloroplasts 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenetic engineering 3alipids 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolites 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3aterpenoids1 aKim, Kyung Woo1 aChoi, Tae-Young1 aKim, Sun Young1 aKim, Jaoon Young Hwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0578-06350 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2018 Dec., v. 34, no. 12 p.183-183dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-018-2567-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245008400162506011700246506007600363520184300439592002802282506003702310650001302347650001302360650001602373650001502389650001002404653002502414653002602439653003302465653002202498653003002520700001402550700001902564700001402583773010502597856008602702852000902788655001202797IND60773554420221207095854.0220809e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077355442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1277962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yu10aOn the ideal groundwater sampling window by utilizing transition pumping period  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA new method of groundwater sampling has recently been proposed, which involves two-phase well purging – a high-flow rate pumping phase followed by low flow rate purging and sampling. The high pumping rate yields a rapid well drawdown and enhances hydraulic gradients within the aquifer. After switching to a low pumping rate, the stressed flow field is maintained to prevent the water in the well casing from moving downwards to bias the collected samples. This study addresses two practical issues that are critical for applying such a sampling method: the determination of the pumping switch time and the transition time interval available for groundwater sampling. We use Theis and Papadopulos solutions to study the impact of wellbore storage on the correlation between switch time and transition time interval. By imposing critical conditions to the derived solutions, we suggest that the transition time interval is solely associated with the switch time. Results show that a later switch time yields a longer transition time interval. Theis solution provides an approximate linear relationship between the switch time and the transition time interval, which can be used as a simple approximate practical guideline. Results from Papadopulos solution confirm the linear relationship at late times and provide a more accurate relationship for early times by accounting for the well storage impact. A sensitivity analysis indicates that aquifers with smaller storativity under a higher pumping ratio will generate a longer transition time interval given the same switch time. Similarly, an earlier switch time is allowed given a predefined transition time interval. This study presents a guideline to determine reasonable switch time under various aquifer hydrogeologic conditions and estimate the ideal groundwater sampling window.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquifers 3adrawdown 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3awells 0aGroundwater sampling 0aIdeal sampling window 0aHigh stress low flow purging 0aTwo phase pumping 0aTransition pumping period1 aHou, Deyi1 aHuang, Haiying1 aLuo, Jian0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 July, v. 610 p.127796-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1277963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03578naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011400164300001600278500002000294520240700314592002802721650001002749650001402759650001902773650003102792650001302823650001002836650001402846650001502860650002502875650001402900650001002914650002602924651001802950700002102968773010902989856007303098852000903171655001203180IND60569910020221116213129.0170626e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056991002DNAL7 a10.1890/13-0613.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJäger, Christoph G.10aResource competition across habitat boundaries: asymmetric interactions between benthic and pelagic producers  ap. 287-302.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn shallow aquatic systems, benthic and pelagic primary producers typically compete for light and nutrients along opposing vertical supply axes: pelagic algae shade the benthic habitat; conversely, benthic algae intercept the nutrient flux from the sediment to the pelagic habitat. We present a general framework for analyzing such spatially asymmetric resource competition across habitat boundaries using a mechanistic, dynamical model. We visualize the mechanisms determining the outcome of these cross‐habitat interactions using zero‐net‐growth isoclines, resource supply points, and resource consumption vectors. In extensive invasion analyses, we characterize the abiotic and competitive persistence boundaries of pelagic and benthic primary producers, which are set by environmental factors determining nutrient and light supply and are modified by resource use by the competitor in the respective other habitat. We note several qualitative differences between cross‐habitat and “classical” within‐habitat resource competition. First, coexistence of cross‐habitat competitors is facilitated by, but does not require niche differentiation with respect to, the utilization of resources. Because each species has a competitive edge for the resource that is supplied from “its” side of the system, a competitor that is inferior in utilizing both resources can sometimes coexist with, or even exclude, a superior competitor. Second, increasing the external supply of one resource (the nutrient) may initially favor both competitors, until a breakpoint is reached where the benthic producer goes abruptly extinct. Finally, whether a given pair of cross‐habitat competitors coexist or shows alternative states may depend on the environment. Specifically, benthic and pelagic algae may coexist at low nutrient and light supply but produce alternative states at high nutrient and light supply. Alternative states are, in turn, promoted by any algal trait combination that increases the spatial asymmetry in resource consumption, i.e., leads to a higher nutrient consumption in the benthic habitat and/or a higher light consumption in the pelagic habitat. In a first empirical application, we show that predictions from our model give a good fit to published data on benthic and pelagic primary production in temperate and arctic lakes spanning a broad range of nutrient environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aasymmetry 3adynamic models 3aecological differentiation 3ahabitats 3alakes 3anutrients 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3asediments 3ashade 3atrophic relationships 3aArctic region1 aDiehl, Sebastian0 tEcological monographs.g2014 May, v. 84, no. 2 p.287-302dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0613.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011600182300001600298520140000314592002801714650001001742650001801752650001601770650001301786650001501799650002301814650002101837650000901858650000901867650001801876650001601894650001201910650001801922650002401940650001201964650002301976650000901999650002502008650002502033650003402058650000902092650001702101650001302118700002002131700001902151700001802170700001802188773014202206852000902348856008202357655001202439IND4401525420221116181855.0200207e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440152542DNAL7 a159838042pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-005-0051-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jyh-Jye10aEffect of red mold rice on antifatigue and exercise-related changes in lipid peroxidation in endurance exercise  ap. 247-253.  aThis study evaluated the effect of red mold rice supplementation on antifatigue and exercise-related changes in lipid peroxidation of male adult Wistar rats through swimming exercise. Thirty 16-week-old rats were studied by dividing them into three groups (ten for each group). Other than the control group (CD), the other two groups were divided into a high-dose (HD) treatment group (5 g red mold rice/kg body weight for the HD group), and a low-dose (LD) group (1 g red mold rice/kg body weight for the LD group). Swimming endurance tests were conducted after 28 days of red mold rice supplementation, and the result showed that the treatment group showed a higher exercise time (CD, 78.0±6.4; LD, 104.2±9.6; and HD, 129.4±10.9 min; p<0.05) and a higher blood glucose concentration (CD, 76.67±8.08; LD, 111.34±8.50; and HD, 117.67±11.06 mg/dl; p<0.05) than the CD. Moreover, the blood lactate (CD, 45.00±0.90; LD, 31.41±1.80; and HD, 28.89±1.62 mg/dl; p<0.05), blood urea nitrogen (CD, 21.87±0.75; LD, 20.33±0.83; and HD, 20.53±1.09 mg/dl; p<0.05), and hemoglobin (CD, 14.20±0.21; LD, 13.70±0.55; and HD, 13.28±0.35 g/dl; p<0.05) were also significantly lower than those of the CD. Besides, the result suggested that the red mold rice supplementation may decrease the contribution of exercise-induced oxidative stress and improve the physiological condition of the rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3aexercise 3ahemoglobin 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3arice 3aurea nitrogen 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucose 2aDietary Supplements 2aFatigue 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aMale 2aMonascusxphysiology 2aOryzaxmicrobiology. 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animal 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSwimming1 aShieh, Meng-Jyh1 aKuo, Shing-Lin1 aLee, Chun-Lin1 aPan, Tzu-Ming0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2006 Mar., v. 70, no. 2 p.247-253dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-005-0051-53Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03071naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011600169300001600285520158400301592002801885650001501913650001801928650001401946650001801960650001101978650001501989650001902004650001602023650001902039650001102058650001502069650001902084650001402103650001802117650001602135651002202151653001602173653001302189653002702202653002702229653001602256653002502272700002202297700001702319700002802336773009902364856008102463852000902544655001202553IND60545017720221118052125.0160901e20140425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054501772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2013.08.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaballero, Isabel10aAssessment of suspended solids in the Guadalquivir estuary using new DEIMOS-1 medium spatial resolution imagery  ap. 148-158.  aMeasurements of Total Suspended concentrations (TSS) are critical for monitoring geomorphological processes as well as ensuring the “good status” of transitional and coastal waters. Here, we explore the potential of the new DEIMOS-1, multi-spectral, medium-resolution satellite sensor for quantifying TSS dynamics within the large, turbid Guadalquivir estuary (SW Iberian Peninsula). Eight scenes were atmospherically corrected using various image-based procedures (apparent reflectance; Dark Object Subtraction, DOS; and solar zenith angle approximation, COSTZ). In-situ measurements (100 to 1400mgL−1) from three campaigns coinciding (±15min) with satellite overpasses were used to assess the semi-analytical algorithm from Nechad et al. (2010) relating water-leaving reflectance (ρw) to TSS. All bands were very sensitive to TSS, however saturation of the visible wavelengths was observed at the highest sediment loads. The best correlation was obtained for the NIR band (755–906nm) using the simple band-reflectance model at the top of atmosphere reflectance (ρw(TOA)), TSS (mgL−1)=21428.77 ρw(TOA)/(1−ρw(TOA)/0.21)−346.17 (r2=0.864, p<0.001, εr=25.411%, n=53), which was used to generate maps. This approach revealed detailed spatio-temporal variability in sediment concentrations within the river plume, near to shore and far up the river channel. We demonstrate that DEIMOS-1 has a high capability as a valuable tool for the frequent, synoptic monitoring of water-quality parameters needed for the optimum management of coastal and transitional waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoastal water 3aestuaries 3ageomorphology 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apollution load 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asatellites 3asediment yield 3asediments 3awater quality 3awavelengths 3aIberian Peninsula 0aOcean color 0aDEIMOS-1 0aAtmospheric correction 0aTotal Suspended Solids 0aRiver plume 0aGuadalquivir estuary1 aMorris, Edward P.1 aRuiz, Javier1 aNavarro, G.q(Gabriel),0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Apr. 25, v. 146 p.148-158dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.08.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03893naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100001800157245015700175300001800332520154000350592002801890650002201918650001201940650001401952650001601966650001401982650001301996650001402009650001202023650001602035650001102051650001902062650001902081650002102100650001702121650001602138650002402154650001102178650001702189650001602206650002802222650001002250650001302260650003602273650001202309650004302321650006302364650003002427650005102457650002002508650003102528650002402559650004302583650000902626650002502635650002702660650002902687650001702716650004002733650002102773650004402794700002502838700002502863700002402888700001802912700002102930773009102951856007203042852000903114655001203123IND60080801920221119085725.0140811e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008080192DNAL7 a243997832pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.51132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBose, Madhura10aPrevention of Arthritis Markers in Experimental Animal and Inflammation Signalling in Macrophage by Karanjin Isolated from Pongamia pinnata Seed Extract  ap. 1188-1195.  aKaranjin, the furanoflavonoid reported to possess gastroprotective and anti‐diabetic properties, was investigated against experimental arthritis and its molecular signalling in inflammation was explored in macrophages. Karanjin was isolated from hexane extract of Pongamia pinnata seeds and was evaluated on arthritis markers in adjuvant induced arthritis model (AIA) in two doses (per oral; 10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day). Karanjin dose dependently reduced collagen and cartilage breakdown markers viz. urinary hydroxyproline and glucosamine, respectively, serum lysosomal enzymes responsible for articular cartilage damage, and major proinflammatory cytokine TNFα, secreted by macrophages involved in articular inflammation and destruction. Karanjin also prevented joint damage as evidenced from arthritis score, radiographic and histopathological analysis. To delineate the molecular target of Karanjin, in vitro study on LPS induced macrophages were performed at calibrated non toxic doses (4 µg/mL and 6 µg/mL). Karanjin reduced TNFα production and also showed potent inhibitory effect on nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production which is generally induced by TNFα from activated macrophages. NF‐κB, the key regulator of TNFα signalling during inflammation was significantly suppressed by Karanjin. Our study for the first time highlights the anti‐inflammatory role of Karanjin in experimental arthritis model as well as on macrophage signalling, thereby depicting its probable mechanism of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMillettia pinnata 3aanimals 3aarthritis 3ablood serum 3acartilage 3acollagen 3acytokines 3aenzymes 3aglucosamine 3ahexane 3ahistopathology 3ahydroxyproline 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aradiography 3areactive oxygen species 3aseeds 3atoxicity 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacology 2aArthritis, Experimentalxchemically inducedxdrug therapy. 2aBenzopyransxpharmacology 2aCartilage, Articularxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aInflammationxdrug therapy 2aLipopolysaccharides 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMillettiaxchemistry 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aRats, Wistar 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism1 aChakraborty, Mousumi1 aBhattacharya, Sourav1 aMukherjee, Debarati1 aMandal, Suvra1 aMishra, Roshnara0 tPhytotherapy research.g2014 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.1188-1195dJ.

Species richness maps produced by stacking species distribution model (SDM) range maps could prove useful in this regard, but little attention has been given to this approach. Here we generate a species richness map by stacking the ranges of 86 Mesoamerican fern species modelled by MaxEnt from field data collected by the Sampled Red List Index for Plants project. Predicted species richness showed a hump-backed relationship with elevation, peaking at mid-elevation (1800–2000 m). A remarkably similar pattern was observed in a field survey conducted to validate the approach. Predicted species richness was also low in sites with high water deficits, as previously shown in the fern literature. Beta-diversity in the lowlands was greatest between sites with strongly contrasting water deficits, further emphasising the importance of this environmental variable. The stacked SDM approach was thus able to reproduce broad biogeographical patterns of species richness, despite many of the fern species being represented by fewer than 20 samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aferns and fern allies 3alowlands 3amodels 3aspecies richness 3asurveys 3atropics 0aMaxEnt 0aMesoamerican ferns 0aSampled red list index (SRLI) 0aSpecies distribution models (SDMs)1 aBrummitt, Neil A.1 aCoomes, D.

The use of NIR probes enables deep photon penetration in tissue, minimizes photo-damage to biological samples, and produces low background auto-fluorescence from biomolecules present in living systems. The number of new analyte-responsive NIR fluorescent probes has increased substantially in recent years as a consequence of intense research efforts. In this tutorial review, we highlight recent advances (2010–2013) made in the development and applications of NIR fluorescent probes. The review focuses on NIR fluorescent probes that have been devised to sense various biologically important species, including ROS/RNS, metal ions, anions, enzymes and other related species, as well as intracellular pH changes. The basic principles involved in the design of functional NIR fluorescent probes and suggestions about how to expand applications of NIR imaging agents are also described.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioimaging 3afluorescence 3apH 3aphotons1 aPark, Sookil1 aYoon, Juyoung1 aShin, Injae0 tChemical Society reviews.g2013 Dec. 2, v. 43, no. 1 p.16-29dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cs60271k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245013800160300002000298520133300318592002801651650001401679650001801693650001501711650002601726650001301752650001401765650001101779653002501790653001001815653002001825653001501845653002201860653002301882700001601905700001501921700001801936700001701954700001801971700001901989700001502008700001602023700001602039700005602055700005602111773014202167856008002309852000902389655001202398IND60753915520221116182122.0211020e20211008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075391552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c050862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Gong10aPt and Mo Co-Decorated MnO₂ Nanorods with Superior Resistance to H₂O, Sintering, and HCl for Catalytic Oxidation of Chlorobenzene  ap. 14204-14214.  aMnO₂ nanorods with exposed (110), (100), or (310) facets were prepared and investigated for catalytic oxidation of chlorobenzene, then the (110)-exposed MnO₂ nanorod was screened as the candidate parent and further modified by Pt and/or Mo with different contents. The loading of Pt enhanced activity and versatility of the pristine MnO₂, but the polychlorinated byproducts and Cl₂ were promoted, conversely, as the decoration of Mo inhibited the polychlorinated byproducts and improved durability. Determination of structure and properties suggested that Pt facilitated the formation of more oxygen vacancies/Mn³⁺ and surface adsorbed oxygen weakened the bonds of surface lattice oxygen, while Mo stabilized surface lattice oxygen and increased acid sites, especially Brønsted acid sites. Expectedly, Pt and Mo bifunctionally modified MnO₂ presented a preferable activity, selectivity, and durability along with the super resistance to H₂O, high-temperature, and HCl, and no prominent deactivation was observed within 30 h at 300 °C under dry and humid conditions, even at high-temperature aging at 600 °C and HCl-pretreatment (7 h). In this work, the optimized Mo and Pt codecorated MnO₂ was considered a promising catalyst toward practical applications for catalytic oxidation of actual Cl-VOCs emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achlorobenzene 3adurability 3aenvironmental science 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 0acatalytic combustion 0aCVOCs 0amanganese oxide 0aacid-redox 0athermal stability 0achemical stability1 aCai, Yuanpu1 aZhang, Hao1 aHong, Dongsen1 aShao, Shijie1 aTu, Chensheng1 aChen, Yuexiang1 aWang, Feng1 aZhen, Biao,1 aBai, Yuting1 aWang, Xingyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3505-61111 aDai, Qiguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6764-67440 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Oct. 08, v. 55, no. 20 p.14204-14214dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c050863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012000163300001800283500001900301520142400320592002801744650001701772650002501789650002001814650002301834650001501857650001601872650002501888650001401913650001301927650002101940700002001961773013401981856007402115852000902189655001202198IND60661434720221122053209.0190829e20131104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066143472DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cs60272a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeekley, Claire M.10aWhich form is that? The importance of selenium speciation and metabolism in the prevention and treatment of disease  ap. 8870-8894.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe biological activity of selenium is dependent upon its speciation. We aim to integrate selenium speciation and metabolism into a discussion of the mechanisms by which selenium exerts its biological activity. First, we present the current status of selenium in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases with particular attention paid to the results of major chemoprevention trials involving selenium supplementation. A comprehensive review of the current understanding of the metabolism of common dietary selenium compounds – selenite, selenomethionine, methylselenocysteine and selenocystine – is presented, with discussion of the evidence for the various metabolic pathways and their products. The antioxidant, prooxidant and other mechanisms of the dietary selenium compounds have been linked to their disease prevention and treatment properties. The evidence for these various mechanisms – in vitro, in cells and in vivo – is evaluated with emphasis on the selenium metabolites involved. We conclude that dietary selenium compounds should be considered prodrugs, whose biological activity will depend on the activity of the various metabolic pathways in, and the redox status of, cells and tissues. These factors should be considered in future laboratory research and in selecting selenium compounds for trials of disease prevention and treatment by selenium supplementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abioactive properties 3achemoprevention 3adisease prevention 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethylselenocysteine 3aselenites 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine1 aHarris, Hugh H.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2013 Nov. 4, v. 42, no. 23 p.8870-8894dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cs60272a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245011000170300001800280500001500298520188900313592002802202650001002230650002202240650003602262650001602298650000902314650002302323650002002346650002502366650002602391650001102417650002702428650001002455650001402465650001202479650001502491650002202506650002502528650001302553650001202566650002102578653002002599700002002619700002002639700002202659700002502681700002302706773011302729856008402842852000902926655001202935IND4472292420221120071011.0150808e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447229242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaskova, Veronika10aCombined exposure of Japanese quails to cyanotoxins, Newcastle virus and lead: Oxidative stress responses  ap. 2082-2090.  a2019-12-06  aWild birds are continually exposed to many anthropogenic and natural stressors in their habitats. Over the last decades, mass mortalities of wild birds constitute a serious problem and may possibly have more causations such as natural toxins including cyanotoxins, parasitic diseases, industrial chemicals and other anthropogenic contaminants. This study brings new knowledge on the effects of controlled exposure to multiple stressors in birds. The aim was to test the hypothesis that influence of cyanobacterial biomass, lead and antigenic load may combine to enhance the effects on birds, including modulation of antioxidative and detoxification responses. Eight treatment groups of model species Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were exposed to various combinations of these stressors. The parameters of detoxification and oxidative stress were studied in liver and heart after 30 days of exposure. The antioxidative enzymatic defense in birds seems to be activated quite efficiently, which was documented by the elevated levels and activities of antioxidative and detoxification compounds and by the low incidence of damage to lipid membranes. The greatest modulations of glutathione level and activities of glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and lipid peroxidation were shown mostly in the groups with combined multiple exposures. The results indicate that the antioxidative system plays an important role in the protective response of the tissues to applied stressors and that its greater induction helps to protect the birds from more serious damage. Most significant changes of these “defense” parameters in case of multiple stressors suggest activation of this universal mechanism in situation with complex exposure and its crucial role in protection of the bird health in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliver 3anatural toxicants 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aparasitoses 3alead 3alipid peroxidation 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acyanobacterial toxins 3alipids 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheart 3amortality 3aviruses 3awild birds 3aCoturnix japonica 3aantioxidant activity 3ahabitats 3abiomass 3aoxidative stress 0aJapanese quails1 aPaskerova, Hana1 aPikula, Jiří,1 aBandouchova, Hana1 aSedláčková, Jana,1 aHilscherova, Klara0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2011 Oct., v. 74, no. 7 p.2082-2090dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01839naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245008900178300001600267500000900283520071000292592002801002650001401030650001501044650002401059650001101083650001701094650002301111650001501134650002301149651001101172700001901183700002101202773014901223856009601372852000901468655001201477IND60668400520221121172529.0191125e197609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066840052DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1976.03615995004000050042x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhuja, L.

The experimental data show considerable scatter due mainly to natural soil variability within a soil series. However, the data exhibited a fairly proportional relationship between runoff initiation time and antecedent soil saturation deficit (final minus initial soil-water content), in accordance with a simple Green-Ampt type equation. The results indicate a potential method for estimating erosive portions of rainstorms and subsequent soil loss hazards in relation to varying antecedent soil-water contents during different seasons of the year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aprediction 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3asoil erosion 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aHawaii1 aDangler, E.

Oysters regulate the biogeochemistry of coastal systems in part by promoting sediment nutrient recycling and removing excess nitrogen via denitrification. Less clear is how oysters alter sediment greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes—an important consideration as oyster populations grow. Here, we show that sediments in oyster habitats produce carbon dioxide (CO₂), with highest rates in spring (2396.91 ± 381.98 μmol CO₂ m–² h–¹) following deposition of seasonal diatom blooms and in summer (2795.20 ± 307.55 μmol CO₂ m–² h–¹) when temperatures are high. Sediments in oyster habitats also consistently released methane to the water column (725.94 ± 150.34 nmol CH₄ m–² h–¹) with no seasonal pattern. Generally, oyster habitat sediments were a sink for nitrous oxide (N₂O; −36.11 ± 7.24 nmol N₂O m–² h–¹), only occasionally releasing N₂O in spring. N₂O release corresponded to high organic matter and dissolved nitrogen availability, suggesting denitrification as the production pathway. Despite potential CO₂ production increases under aquaculture in some locations, we conclude that in temperate regions oysters have an overall negligible impact on sediment GHG cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aaquaculture 3acarbon dioxide 3adenitrification 3agreenhouse gases 3ahabitats 3amethane 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aorganic matter 3aoysters 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3aspring 3asummer 3atechnology 0aoyster 0agreenhouse gas1 aFulweiler, Robinson W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0871-42460 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Oct. 06, v. 55, no. 20 p.14225-14233dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c052533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011900166300001600285500001900301520164600320592002801966650001201994650001502006650001502021650002102036650001402057650001002071650001402081650001802095650000902113650001302122650001202135650001302147650001302160650002102173650002202194650002302216650001902239650001102258650001302269650001502282773013202297856007402429852000902503655001202512IND60661434820221122053108.0190829e20140113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066143482DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cs60273g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiju, Vasudevanpillai10aChemical modifications and bioconjugate reactions of nanomaterials for sensing, imaging, drug delivery and therapy  ap. 744-764.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs prepared nanomaterials of metals, semiconductors, polymers and carbon often need surface modifications such as ligand exchange, and chemical and bioconjugate reactions for various biosensor, bioanalytical, bioimaging, drug delivery and therapeutic applications. Such surface modifications help us to control the physico-chemical, toxicological and pharmacological properties of nanomaterials. Furthermore, introduction of various reactive functional groups on the surface of nanomaterials allows us to conjugate a spectrum of contrast agents, antibodies, peptides, ligands, drugs and genes, and construct multifunctional and hybrid nanomaterials for the targeted imaging and treatment of cancers. This tutorial review is intended to provide an introduction to newcomers about how chemical and bioconjugate reactions transform the surface of nanomaterials such as silica nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, gold quantum clusters, semiconductor quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, fullerene and graphene, and accordingly formulate them for applications such as biosensing, bioimaging, drug and gene delivery, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy. Nonetheless, controversial reports and our growing concerns about toxicity and pharmacokinetics of nanomaterials suggest the need for not only rigorous in vivo experiments in animal models but also novel nanomaterials for practical applications in the clinical settings. Further reading of original and review articles cited herein is necessary to buildup in-depth knowledge about the chemistry, bioconjugate chemistry and biological applications of individual nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abioimaging 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemistry 3adrugs 3afullerene 3agene transfer 3agold 3agraphene 3aligands 3ananogold 3apeptides 3apharmacokinetics 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotothermotherapy 3asemiconductors 3asilica 3atoxicity 3atoxicology0 tChemical Society reviews.g2014 Jan. 13, v. 43, no. 3 p.744-764dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cs60273g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008400166300001800250500002000268520181800288592002802106596000902134650002302143650001302166650001202179650001102191650001802202650001002220650001102230650001402241650002502255650001502280650001402295650002002309650002702329650001402356650001102370700002102381700002502402700001902427700002102446700001602467700002102483773013502504856008302639852000902722655001202731IND60786302620221119155527.0220803e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078630262DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2019.01.00182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDube, Nothabo10aIn Situ Cotton Leaf Area Index by Height Using Three‐Dimensional Point Clouds  ap. 2999-3007.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThree‐dimensional (3‐D) high‐throughput crop phenotyping may benefit plant research and breeding programs by providing a rapid, nondestructive method of determining in‐season crop growth and development. In this study, a set of three inexpensive, structured, near‐infrared laser projectors mounted on a robotic platform were used to generate high‐density color point clouds (PCs) in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in 2016 and 2017. The PCs were calibrated based on destructive leaf area measurements, and the transformed PCs were analyzed to quantify leaf area by canopy height in 1‐cm intervals. We conducted weekly scans of 8‐m plots throughout the growing season for two cotton cultivars and two irrigation treatments during the 2 yr. The calibrated PCs were used to accurately measure leaf area index and leaf area index by canopy height. The analysis of leaf area distribution throughout the growing season indicated significant cultivar and irrigation effects by canopy height as well as significant interactions between cultivar and irrigation. Based on the results, it is possible to use a 3‐D sensor system to distinguish growth habits that are not easily measured using traditional growth measurements. The information obtained from 3‐D measurements may provide additional information about several canopy characteristics that are currently difficult to measure, including radiation capture parameters and biomass partitioning. Core Ideas Leaf area index (LAI) has not traditionally been separated in plants by height. Three‐dimensional sensing was used to accurately measure LAI by height in cotton. Cotton cultivar, irrigation, and growth stage measurably affected LAI by height. Three‐dimensional sensing may complement measures of radiation capture and other spatial factors.  aPublisher supplied data  cBASF 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3acanopy 3acanopy height 3acolor 3acotton 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3airrigation 3aleaf area 3aleaf area index 3anondestructive methods 3aphenotype 3arobots1 aBryant, Benjamin1 aSari‐Sarraf, Hamed1 aKelly, Brendan1 aMartin, Clyde F.1 aDeb, Sanjit1 aRitchie, Glen L.0 tAgronomy journal.g2019 Nov., v. 111, no. 6 p.2999-3007dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2019.01.00183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100001900157245022600176300001800402520172600420592002802146650001302174650001502187650001602202650002802218650001602246650002202262650002402284650001702308650000802325650002302333650001302356650001702369650001002386650001002396650002202406650002402428650003502452650003002487650002302517650002402540650002402564650001102588650004202599650001102641650002902652650000902681650003102690650001602721650003902737650001702776700002202793700002002815700001902835700003002854700002402884773009102908856007202999852000903071655001203080IND60080802120221119085511.0140811e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008080212DNAL7 a245360392pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.51172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZilaee, Marzie10aBarberry Treatment Reduces Serum Anti‐Heat Shock Protein 27 and 60 Antibody Titres and High‐sensitivity C‐reactive Protein in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome: A Double‐blind, Randomized Placebo‐controlled Trial  ap. 1211-1215.  aMetabolic syndrome is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The heat shock proteins (HSPs) are associated with risk factors for CVD. The aim of the present study was to survey the effect of barberry on antibody titres to HSPs and high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP) in patients with metabolic syndrome. In our study, subjects (N = 106, 79 women and 27 men, 18–65 years old) with metabolic syndrome were randomized into two groups: a group of patients who received three capsules of barberry and a control group who received three capsules of placebo for 6 weeks. Antibodies against HSPs 27, 60/65 and 70, hs‐CRP and lipid profile were determined in patients before (week 0) and after (week 6) intervention. spss software (version 16.0; Inc, Chicago, IL) was used for data analysis. Results showed that barberry had no significant effect on serum level of anti‐HSPs 65 and 70. But there was a significant decrease in anti‐HSP 27 in both case and control groups (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively, in the case and control groups). Barberry decreased significantly anti‐HSP 60 in the case group (p = 0.03). High‐sensitivity CRP was decreased non‐significantly (p = 0.17) in the case group and increased significantly (p = 0.04) in the control group. Barberry decreased significantly low‐density lipoprotein and total cholesterol and increased significantly high‐density cholesterol (p < 0.05). Results of the present study suggested that barberry supplementation in patients with metabolic syndrome decreased significantly anti‐HSPs 27 and 60 and hs‐CRP levels and improved lipid profile.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stratified, systematic random sampling was adopted. The ethnomedicinal survey was conducted between January and March 2011 by involving the selected 371 household members on knowledge and practice of TAPs by administering a pre-tested questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 54.4% respondents had adequate awareness and usage custom of TAPs and 16 types of plant have been most commonly known and employed by the respondents to prevent/treat malaria. Leaves (57.2%) were most commonly used plant part to prepare traditional antimalarial phytotherapy remedies. Decoction was one of the most commonly used methods to administer TAPs. The chi-square test result revealed that a significant association is found between the usage custom of traditional antimalarial plants and gender (P-value=0.0282), age (P-value=0.0024), educational status (P-value=0.0295), and monthly income (P-value=0.0001), although not with the ethnicity (P-value=0.7933) of the respondents. CONCLUSION: TAPs usage is an integral part of the tradition and custom of the Ethiopians. However, nearly half of the respondents have had lack of awareness about TAPs and majority of them are reluctant in exercising either due to its ineffectiveness or its bitter taste. Therefore, further laboratory-based research is extremely imperative to identify their antiplasmodial activity and bioactive molecules which could pave the way to formulate the novel affordable as well as accessible potent antimalarials in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimalarials 3aeducational status 3agender 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aleaves 3amalaria 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aquestionnaires 3asampling 3asurveys 3ataste 3atraditions 2aAdult 2aAntimalarialsxisolation & purificationxtherapeutic use. 2aAwareness 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aCultural Characteristics 2aEducational Status 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aIncome 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMale 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Preparationsxisolation & purificationxtherapeutic use. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Factors 2aYoung Adult 0aEthiopia1 aTsehaye, Endrias0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 May 7, v. 141, no. 1 p.143-150dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245008800211520169800299592002801997650001902025650001202044650002002056650001502076650001302091650002702104650000902131653003902140653003902179653001402218653002702232653002902259653003602288700002302324773011202347856008302459852000902542655001202551IND60612617120221122114306.0190624e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061261712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2018.e004312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Leary, Bethan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6595-663410aEcological connectivity across ocean depths: Implications for protected area design  aCoastal nations have embarked on a rapid program of marine protected area (MPA) establishment, incentivised by the approaching 2020 deadline of United Nations global marine protection targets. Alongside, efforts are underway to extend protection into areas beyond national jurisdiction through a new international legally binding instrument. These developments are welcome but there are risks that in meeting them, nations will still fail to supply adequate protection to marine life. An increasing number of MPAs protect the seabed while the water column remains open to fishing. This is because vulnerable habitats in need of protection are disproportionately perceived to be those on the seabed, while the water column is viewed as much less at risk. The seabed and water column are, however, inextricably linked. Transitions between human-defined vertical ocean zones are blurred, with animals and oceanographic features moving across depths. Here, we explore a rapidly growing literature on ecological and environmental connections through the water column, and between the water column and the seabed, to consider whether vertically stratified management is justified from an ecological standpoint. We find that emerging research increasingly links upper-ocean communities and processes to seabed ecology and biogeochemistry suggesting that exploitation of the water column is likely to have a significant and widely distributed footprint in the deep-sea. We conclude that there is a strong a priori case for surface to seabed protection within MPAs, and that this should be the default, precautionary approach to safeguard intact ecosystems with as near to natural function as possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3aanimals 3abiogeochemistry 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3amarine protected areas 3arisk 0aAreas beyond national jurisdiction 0aConvention on Biological Diversity 0aHigh seas 0aMarine protected areas 0aPelagic-benthic coupling 0aSustainable Development Goal 141 aRoberts, Callum M.0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2018 July, v. 15 p.e00431-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2018.e004313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245008100179300001600260500000900276520127700285592002801562650001201590650001501602650002501617650001801642650003101660650002501691650001701716700002001733700001701753773014801770856009601918852000902014655001202023IND60668400720221120115500.0191125e198503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066840072DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1985.03615995004900020005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVon Tress, M.12aA Calcite Dissolution Model for the Estimation of Particle Size Distribution  ap. 302-307.  aepub  aSince reactions of solid phase carbonates generally occur as surface reactions, the reactive surface area and particle size distribution become important considerations. The objective of this study was to develop and test a stochastic model for the dissolution of calcite in which particle size is treated as a random variable. When used in conjunction with pH-stat steady-state dissolution procedure, the stochastic model provides a method to obtain estimates of particle size distribution of calcite in mixed particle size systems. The stochastic model was developed from a deterministic model which is based on the equal diameter reduction hypothesis. The deterministic model differs from the stochastic model in that a uniform particle size is assumed in the former and a distribution of particle sizes in the latter. Particle distribution was expressed according to the beta function, which was selected because of its flexibility. The stochastic model represented an improvement over the deterministic model in description of the dissolution of calcite under steady-state conditions. This improvement is due to the fact that a sample of particles in nature is more realistically described according to a distribution of particle sizes than as a single particle size.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcite 3acarbonates 3adeterministic models 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3astochastic processes 3asurface area1 aLoeppert, R.

While an increasing number of empirical studies have shown that environmental changes can alter the strengths of species interactions, these studies are typically short (<1–2 generations) and therefore give only partial information about longer term population dynamics. To focus on longer term dynamics, we investigated population cycles of pea aphids and their most common parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, in Wisconsin, USA. Data collected over three years in alfalfa fields showed an apparent host–parasitoid population cycle. Furthermore, higher pea aphid population growth rates and increased parasitism were correlated with higher naturally occurring temperatures. While these effects were observed with seasonal fluctuations in temperature, they beg the question of how long‐term changes in mean annual temperature might change aphid–parasitoid population cycles, a question which we further pursued with laboratory experiments. To quantify temperature‐dependent demographic parameters, we used short‐term (<1 generation) experiments conducted at 20°C and 27°C. The higher temperature increased aphid and parasitoid development rates, adult aphid life span and fecundity, and parasitoid attack rates. We then conducted multi‐generation population‐level laboratory experiments to reveal the effects of temperature (20°C vs. 27°C) on population dynamics. We fit the resulting time series data using a nonlinear age‐structured state‐space model to estimate population‐level processes that could not be estimated in short‐term laboratory experiments. Using the model, we parsed out the demographic rates that had the largest impacts on aphid–parasitoid population cycles. This analysis showed that there were frequent contrasts in the effects of temperature operating through different demographic rates. For example, the temperature‐dependent increase in aphid development rate decreased cycle amplitude, while the increase in parasitoid attack rate increased cycle amplitude. There were also striking interactions among demographic rates. For example, the temperature‐dependent increase in aphid development rate could either increase or decrease the cycle period depending on the values of other demographic rates. Although these complexities make predictions difficult, overall they suggest that increasing long‐term mean temperature will decrease the period, increase the amplitude, and tend to destabilize pea aphid–A. ervi dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aAphidius ervi 3aadults 3aalfalfa 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aempirical research 3afecundity 3alaboratory experimentation 3alongevity 3amodels 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apeas 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aWisconsin1 aHarmon, Jason P.1 aIves, Anthony R.0 tEcological monographs.g2014 Aug., v. 84, no. 3 p.457-476dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-1933.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010800167300001600275520131100291592002801602650001101630650001701641650001301658650001001671650001501681650002201696650001501718650001901733650001701752650002101769650001301790650002601803650001301829650001401842650001401856650001601870651000901886700002401895700002101919700002501940700002001965700001701985700002202002773012202024856008102146852000902227655001202236IND60623145520221120155842.0181127e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062314552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11515-018-1522-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeikhaei, Bijan10aWidely distribution of hematological parameters in thalassemia patients with similar α-globin genotype  ap. 469-474.  aBACKGROUND: Thalassemia is known as the commonest monogenic disorder with an imbalanced rate of globin chains production of adult hemoglobin. Despite the available information about the thalassemia etiology, its phenotype varies from each patient to another. This study aimed to evaluate the hematological parameters of patients with the same -α3.7 homozygote and heterozygote genotypes to amend screening programs. METHODS: In this observational study, we evaluated 1301 thalassemia suspected patients who referred to the Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center of Ahvaz University of Medical Sciences, Khuzestan, Iran during 2014–2016. According to the genotyping studies, patients divided into 2 groups with -α3.7/αα (n = 646) and -α3.7/-α3.7 (n = 181) genotypes. Thereafter, distribution of hematological parameters evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: The mean age in heterozygous and homozygous groups was 25.7±4.5 and 26±4.4 years old, respectively. The degree of anemia was considerably varied in patients with the same genotype. MCV, RBC and MCH showed a wide distribution in patients. CONCLUSION: The findings presented here suggest that other molecular mechanisms along with α-globin gene mutations could be involved in determining the phenotypes of alpha thalassemia patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aerythrocytes 3aetiology 3agenes 3agenotyping 3ahematologic tests 3ahemoglobin 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3amedical sciences 3amutation 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3aphenotype 3ascreening 3athalassemia 3aIran1 aSalehi-Fard, Pejman1 aParidar, Mostafa1 aKarimzadeh, Mehraneh1 aDehghani, Razie1 aZamiri, Asma1 aTakhviji, Vahideh0 tFrontiers in biology.g2018 Dec., v. 13, no. 6 p.469-474dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001712x1674-79847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11515-018-1522-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008200158300001800240520131800258592002801576650002301604650002101627650002101648650001101669650001801680650001301698650001701711650001701728700001801745700001801763700001701781700002001798773013401818856007401952852000902026655001202035IND60661435120221122221732.0190829e20140210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066143512DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cs60277j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jing-Juan10aFunctional nanoprobes for ultrasensitive detection of biomolecules: an update  ap. 1601-1611.  aWith the rapidly increasing demands for ultrasensitive biodetection, the design and applications of functional nanoprobes have attracted substantial interest for biosensing with optical, electrochemical, and various other means. In particular, given the comparable sizes of nanomaterials and biomolecules, there exists plenty of opportunities to develop functional nanoprobes with biomolecules for highly sensitive and selective biosensing. Over the past decade, numerous nanoprobes have been developed for ultrasensitive bioaffinity sensing of proteins and nucleic acids in both laboratory and clinical applications. In this review, we provide an update on the recent advances in this direction, particularly in the past two years, which reflects new progress since the publication of our last review on the same topic in Chem. Soc. Rev. The types of probes under discussion include: (i) nanoamplifier probes: one nanomaterial loaded with multiple biomolecules; (ii) quantum dots probes: fluorescent nanomaterials with high brightness; (iii) superquenching nanoprobes: fluorescent background suppression; (iv) nanoscale Raman probes: nanoscale surface-enhanced Raman resonance scattering; (v) nanoFETs: nanomaterial-based electrical detection; and (vi) nanoscale enhancers: nanomaterial-induced metal deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorescent dyes 3ametals 3anucleic acids 3aproteins 3apublications 3aquantum dots1 aZhao, Wei-Wei1 aSong, Shiping1 aFan, Chunhai1 aChen, Hong-Yuan0 tChemical Society reviews.g2014 Feb. 10, v. 43, no. 5 p.1601-1611dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cs60277j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009000164520170200254592002801956650001201984650001201996650001702008650001402025650001702039650002402056650001502080650001502095650001902110650000902129650001302138650002402151653001502175653001502190653003302205653001302238653002402251653002602275773011202301856008302413852000902496655001202505IND60612617420221122114339.0190624e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061261742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2018.e004232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTensen, L.10aBiases in wildlife and conservation research, using felids and canids as a case study  aWith limited funds available for research and conservation, resources should primarily be focussed on taxa that need it the most. Although some consider all species equal, others argue that research prioritization should depend on a species' role in the ecosystem, taxonomic uniqueness, limited geographic range, or high risk of extinction. This study aimed to quantitatively compare scientific output to species characteristics in order to assess potential bias in research and conservation prioritization. The Felidae and Canidae families were used as case studies, and all peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2013 and 2017 were included. Articles were divided into topics, and research output was compared to species' body size, conservation status, keystone effect, geographic range, and evolutionary distinctiveness. Research allocation varied greatly among species, from zero to 579 publications. Overall, the best predictors for research allocation were body size and keystone effect. No significant correlation was found between research output and the conservation status, geographic range size and evolutionary distinctiveness of species. The average number of publications was the same for felid and canid species (N = 60), yet a notable difference was that studies on felids mainly focussed on conservation and wildlife management, whereas canid studies most often involved diseases and other health issues. This study affirms that research effort are not yet focussed on species that need it the most. An attempt should be made to allocate research funds towards species that are understudied, endangered, and taxonomically unique, or have a small geographic range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanidae 3aFelidae 3abiogeography 3abody size 3acase studies 3aconservation status 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3aprioritization 3arisk 3awildlife 3awildlife management 0aCarnivores 0aEndangered 0aEvolutionary distinctiveness 0aKeystone 0aResearch allocation 0aWildlife conservation0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2018 July, v. 15 p.e00423-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2018.e004233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012800162300001600290500000900306520169400315592002802009650001202037650001702049650001502066650000902081650000902090650001302099650002302112650000902135700001802144700001602162773013602178856008202314852000902396655001202405IND60668400920221120124819.0191228e200105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066840092DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2001.653694x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, U.K.10aAdsorption Behavior of Cadmium, Zinc, and Lead on Hydroxyaluminum– and Hydroxyaluminosilicate–Montmorillonite Complexes  ap. 694-703.  aepub  aThe current imperfect understanding about the adsorption behavior of heavy metals on hydroxyaluminum (HyA)- and hydroxyaluminosilicate (HAS)-interlayered phyllosilicates led us to conduct this study. We examined the adsorption behavior of Cd, Zn, and Pb on synthetically prepared HyA– and HAS–montmorillonite (Mt) complexes in comparison with that on untreated Mt. A very dilute initial metal concentration of 10⁻⁶ M in 0.01 M NaClO₄ background was used in all the adsorption systems. The presence of HyA and HAS polymers on Mt greatly promoted the adsorption of all three metals. Such promoting effects of HyA and HAS polymers on the metal adsorption were, however, not very different from each other. The observed adsorption selectivity sequences of Pb > Zn > Cd on Mt as well as Pb ≫ Zn ≥ Cd on the complexes resemble the reported metal selectivity sequences on amorphous Fe and Al hydroxides. At different pHs, partitioning the adsorbed metals into strongly and weakly held fractions indicated that specific adsorption rather than nonspecific adsorption might have largely controlled the metal selectivity, particularly on the complexes. This led us to assume a predominant involvement of interlayered HyA or HAS polymers in metal adsorption from such dilute solutions. On Mt, the metals were predominantly adsorbed on the permanent charge sites in an easily replaceable state. However, a substantial involvement of the edge OH⁻ groups of Mt in specific adsorption of the metals was also evident, especially at higher pH. Obviously, on Mt and on the complexes, the relative abundance of each type of site and their affinity to heavy metals were substantially different.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3ahydroxides 3airon 3alead 3apolymers 3asodium perchlorate 3azinc1 aTaniguchi, S.1 aSakurai, K.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 May, v. 65, no. 3 p.694-703dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2001.653694x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011000166520218900276592002802465650001202493650001102505650001602516650002102532650002602553650000902579650001102588650001602599650001502615653002202630653001802652653001502670653003002685700001702715700001802732700001702750700001502767700001602782700001302798773010502811856008602916852000903002655001203011IND60773555320221120114524.0220809e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077355532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qiang10aHydrological effects of the snow fraction and its ecohydrological explication within the Budyko framework  aUnderstanding the effects of climate and catchment characteristics on hydrological behavior is critical in hydrological sciences. Furthermore, improving the clarity associated with the physical meaning of the Budyko hypothesis on how it can be incorporated into ecohydrological processes remains a significant challenge, while the conciseness it affords in addressing hydrological responses has promoted its application. This study explores the hydrological effects of the snow fraction (fₛ) and assesses the ecohydrological meaning of the catchment parameter (n) within the Budyko framework, employing 1576 globally investigated catchments. Results showed that the Budyko hypothesis decreased systematic errors (NS = 0.76, RMSE = 181.01 mm a⁻¹) when incorporating the fₛ compared with no snow fraction incorporated it (NS = 0.54, RMSE = 248.85 mm a⁻¹), especially for catchments with higher fₛ. In these catchments, a higher fₛ was generally consistent with a higher normalized mean streamflow (Q), while the opposite was true for normalized evaporation (E/P). Under the Budyko framework, n and fₛ distribution generally exhibited opposite trends. Moreover, higher n was mainly distributed near water limited and the highest energy limited boundaries, while higher fₛ represented lower (P-Q)/P (i.e., the mean (P-Q)/P was 0.59, 0.57, and 0.38 for catchments with lower (fₛ < 0.15), medium (0.15 ≤ fₛ < 0.50), and higher (fₛ ≥ 0.50) fₛ). Statistical relationships among ecohydrological processes and catchment parameter suggested that: (i) higher storm depth (α) generally indicated higher normalized mean Q; (ii) a higher plant-available water holding capacity (κ) resulted in a reduction in Q/P, especially when κ was > 0.12; (iii) the effective rooting depth (Zₑ) exhibited a complex regulatory effect on P partitioning; and (iv) α, Zₑ, and κ controlled n by 65%, 22%, and 13%, respectively, in all catchments. The ecohydrological processes incorporated into catchment parameters will broaden the ability of the Budyko hypothesis to describe hydrological behavior in a changing world, especially in the ungauged catchment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3ahydrologic cycle 3aplant available water 3asnow 3astorms 3astream flow 3awatersheds 0aBudyko hypothesis 0aSnow fraction 0aStreamflow 0aEcohydrological processes1 aYang, Yuting1 aLiang, Liqiao1 aYan, Denghua1 aWang, Xuan1 aLi, Chunhui1 aSun, Tao0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 July, v. 610 p.127813-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008900157300001400246500001100260520217600271592002802447650001902475650002202494650003002516650001202546650001702558650001502575650002102590650002202611650001802633650001102651650002502662650001102687651001102698700001602709700002302725773010802748856007302856852000902929655001202938IND60569910920221116213707.0170626e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056991092DNAL7 a10.1890/14-0306.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValls, Audrey10aKeystone species: toward an operational concept for marine biodiversity conservation  ap. 29-47.  aREVIEW  aVarious definitions and indices have been proposed in the literature to identify keystone species. In this study, we intended to make the concept of keystone species operational for marine biodiversity conservation. We used an exclusive definition of keystone species, based on the original concept of keystone predator, and derived a new functional index of keystoneness (KS) from an ecosystem‐modeling approach. First, several KS indices were formulated, by combining measures of the mixed‐trophic impact (MTI) and biomass of species. Then, a meta‐analysis was performed, based on 101 published Ecopath food‐web models, selected with a scoring method, and representative of the variety of marine ecosystems worldwide. The indices were applied to the models, and two statistical methods were compared to select the most promising KS index. Rank correlation tests were performed to assess the balance between the contribution of the impact and biomass components to the different KS indices. In addition, a classification tree was implemented, based on ecosystem‐specific thresholds applied to the latter species traits, and used to confirm the identified keystone species. The selected index obtained the highest number of models with positive results from both the rank correlation tests and the classification tree. We also demonstrated the limitations of existing KS indices previously applied in the literature. Species were ranked according to their estimates of keystoneness with the selected KS index, so that potential keystone species were quantitatively identified in the 101 modeled food webs. The standardized modeling approach allowed for a comparison of the identified keystone species across models: cartilaginous fishes and toothed whales obtained the highest occurrences. Finally, the selected KS index was applied to the well‐known case study of Prince William Sound (Alaska, USA). Potentially significant anthropogenic (fishing) impacts on keystone species were also considered and discussed. The operational methodology presented is directly applicable to marine food webs, and may be adapted to other (freshwater or terrestrial) systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChondrichthyes 3aaquatic food webs 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiomass 3acase studies 3afreshwater 3akeystone species 3amarine ecosystems 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3awhales 3aAlaska1 aColl, Marta1 aChristensen, Villy0 tEcological monographs.g2015 Feb., v. 85, no. 1 p.29-47dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/14-0306.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245015700163520207400320592002802394650001802422650001502440650001202455650001402467650002702481650001102508650001202519650002202531650001502553650002802568651001002596653001502606653005602621653002902677653002302706653002202729653003502751700001602786700001402802700001402816700001502830700001102845700001702856773010502873856008602978852000903064655001203073IND60773555420221120103416.0220809e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077355542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Dan10aNew method for diagnosing resilience of agricultural soil-water resource composite system: Projection pursuit model modified by sparrow search algorithm  aConsidering the driving mechanism of agricultural soil–water resource composite system (ASWRS) resilience, the Jiansanjiang Branch of China Beidahuang Agricultural Reclamation Group Co., Ltd., is selected as the research object. A projection pursuit (PP) model improved by the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) was proposed to measure the key drivers of resilience, and the driving mechanism of resilience was analysed in combination with the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI). The performance of the built model and the rationality of the results were verified, thus providing a new horizon for the healthy and sustainable development of agricultural water and soil resources and the environment. The results indicated that the SSA-PP model constructed in this paper was superior to PP models based on genetic algorithm (GA) optimization (GA-PP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO-PP) in regard to the solution speed and optimization ability, and these three models yielded similar conclusions. Compared with those of the entropy weight (EW) method, the driving results of the SSA-PP model are more significant, and the screened key driving factors are more reasonable. It was finally determined that the impact on the resilience of the ASWRS was the result of the joint action of economic and agricultural systems. The key driving factors included the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), paddy field proportion, per capita net income and grain output per unit area. According to the LMDI results, the economic level, grain output and paddy field proportion increased, which played a positive role in driving resilience. With the use of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to simulate the future evolution of the key driving factors, it was predicted that the resilience level will increase year by year in the future. It was found that accelerating the economic development process, increasing the grain output, implementing rational planning and adjusting the agricultural planting structure are effective ways to enhance resilience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3aalgorithms 3aentropy 3aevolution 3agross domestic product 3aincome 3apaddies 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aResilience 0aAgricultural soil–water resource composite system 0aSparrow search algorithm 0aProjection pursuit 0aDriving mechanism 0aLogarithmic mean Divisia index1 aLiu, Deping1 aLiu, Dong1 aFu, Qiang1 aHuang, Yan1 aLi, Mo1 aLi, Tianxiao0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 July, v. 610 p.127814-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245012600174300002000300520097700320592002801297650001301325650001301338650002301351650001101374650001601385650002001401650001401421650001901435650001001454700002601464700002101490700005901511700005901570700006201629773017301691856008101864852000901945655001201954IND60753916220221116182157.0211020e20211011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075391622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c023002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiannikopoulos, Ioannis10aGeospatial Network Approach for Assessing Economic Potential of Ethylene-to-Fuel Technology in the Marcellus Shale Region  ap. 14801-14814.  aThe Marcellus Shale region is rich in natural gas liquids (NGLs) and a likely future hub for NGL derivatives such as ethylene. A geospatial network model of the U.S. petrochemicals and refining industry is developed and utilized to assess the potential for the adoption of a technology for oligomerization of ethylene to gasoline, or a gasoline blend stock, as a means to utilize NGL derivatives available in the region. The model is a mixed-integer linear program with the objective of minimizing the total annual cost incurred by the regional industry. Case studies in which this technology is added to the industry network model are described, and sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the effect of model parameters such as the prices of crude oil and ethylene. These results can be used as cost target benchmarks for this new technology. More broadly, this work demonstrates a geospatial network modeling approach for evaluating new processing technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3agasoline 3alinear programming 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aoligomerization 3apetroleum 3aprocess design 3ashale1 aSkouteris, Alkiviadis1 aEdgar, Thomas F.1 aBaldea, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6400-03151 aAllen, David T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6646-87551 aStadtherr, Mark A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3223-95050 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 60, no. 41 p.14801-14814dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c023003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245008600154300001800240520142700258592002801685650001301713650001601726650001501742650002201757650002201779650002301801650002501824650003701849700001901886700001901905773012201924856007302046852000902119655001202128IND60080802620221119085224.0140811e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008080262DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.121912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZobel, M.,10aPlant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities – which drives which?  ap. 1133-1140.  aMore than a decade ago, the Driver (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal partners drive plant communities) and Passenger (AMF community dynamics follows changes in the host plant community) hypotheses were suggested to explain the mutual relationships of plant and AMF communities. We propose one more hypothesis: the Habitat hypothesis, which postulates that both plant and AMF communities follow changes in abiotic conditions. The null hypothesis for all three working hypotheses can be called the Independence hypothesis, which proposes that plant and AMF communities are unrelated. We investigate the assumptions of these hypotheses and the available evidence in support of them. We suggest that community dynamics during secondary succession, including those related to land‐use changes, may be explained by the Driver hypothesis, while the dynamics of plant and AMF communities during primary succession may be explained by the Passenger hypothesis. Within‐region co‐variation of successionally stable plant and AMF communities may be explained by the Habitat hypothesis, while the Independence hypothesis may explain global patterns of plant and AMF communities. These suggestions are tentative, and more evidence from both descriptive and experimental studies is required to assess them. In particular, comparative information is needed about dispersal limitation of plant and AMF communities in dynamic landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3alandscapes 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aplant communities 3aprimary succession 3asecondary succession 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aÖpik, Maarja,1 aHelm, Aveliina0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2014 Sept., v. 25, no. 5 p.1133-1140dOpulus PresswJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.121913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01647naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012700159300001800286520063300304592002800937650001400965650002000979650002200999650001301021650001301034650001401047650001301061700002001074700001901094773012501113856007401238852000901312655001201321IND60662696420221119113354.0190906e20130723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066269642DNAL7 a10.1039/c3gc40267c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParis, Cecilia10aMetal-containing zeolites as efficient catalysts for the transformation of highly valuable chiral biomass-derived products  ap. 2101-2109.  aMetal-containing zeolites, especially Sn-Beta, perform as very efficient heterogeneous catalysts in the selective oxidation of levoglucosenone, which is considered as a platform chemical for the production of highly-valuable chemicals, towards the synthesis of the optically pure γ-lactone (S)-γ-hydroxymethyl-α,β-butenolide (HBO) using H₂O₂ as an oxidizing agent.

When restoring these fire-suppressed forests, managers often try to reproduce these structures to increase ecosystem resilience. We examined unburned and burned forest structures for 1937 0.81ha sample areas in Yosemite National Park, USA. We estimated severity for fires from 1984 to 2010 using the Landsat-derived Relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) and measured openings and canopy clumps in five height strata using airborne LiDAR data. Because our study area lacked concurrent field data, we identified methods to allow structural analysis using LiDAR data alone. We found three spatial structures, canopy-gap, clump-open, and open, that differed in spatial arrangement and proportion of canopy and openings. As fire severity increased, the total area in canopy decreased while the number of clumps increased, creating a patchwork of openings and multistory tree clumps. The presence of openings >0.3ha, an approximate minimum gap size needed to favor shade-intolerant pine regeneration, increased rapidly with loss of canopy area. The range and variation of structures for a given fire severity were specific to each forest type. Low- to moderate-severity fires best replicated the historic clump-opening patterns that were common in forests with frequent fire regimes. Our results suggest that managers consider the following goals for their forest restoration: 1) reduce total canopy cover by breaking up large contiguous areas into variable-sized tree clumps and scattered large individual trees; 2) create a range of opening sizes and shapes, including ~50% of the open area in gaps >0.3ha; 3) create multistory clumps in addition to single story clumps; 4) retain historic densities of large trees; and 5) vary treatments to include canopy-gap, clump-open, and open mosaics across project areas to mimic the range of patterns found for each forest type in our study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acanopy gaps 3aecological resilience 3afire regime 3afire severity 3afires 3aforest restoration 3aforest types 3alidar 3amanagers 3anational parks 3aremote sensing 3atrees 3aUnited States 0aFire severity 0aForest structure 0aRelativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) 0aLiDAR 0aGaps 0aTree clumps 0aSierra Nevada 0aAbies concolor 0aAbies magnifica 0aPinus lambertiana 0aPinus ponderosa1 aNorth, Malcolm P.1 aLutz, James A.1 aChurchill, Derek J.1 aRoberts, Susan L.1 aSmith, Douglas F.1 aMcGaughey, Robert J.1 aKane, Jonathan T.1 aBrooks, Matthew L.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Aug., v. 151 p.89-101dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03913naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245012500165300001500290500002000305520263600325592002802961650003002989650001403019650001903033650001103052650002003063650002703083650002603110650001703136650001403153650001603167650001103183650001303194650001303207650001403220650001603234651001403250700002403264773010903288856007303397852000903470655001203479IND60569911120221116213516.0170626e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056991112DNAL7 a10.1890/13-2355.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrongiello, John R.12aA statistical framework to explore ontogenetic growth variation among individuals and populations: a marine fish example  ap. 93-115.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrowth is a fundamental biological process, driven by a multitude of intrinsic (within‐individual) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, that underpins individual fitness and population demographics. Focusing on the comprehensive information stored in aquatic and terrestrial organism hard parts, we develop a series of increasingly complex hierarchical models to explore spatial and temporal sources of growth variation, ranging in resolution from within individuals to across a species. We apply this modeling framework to an extensive data set of otolith increment measurements from tiger flathead (Platycephalus richardsoni), a demersal commercially exploited fish that inhabits the warming waters of southeast Australia. We recreated growth histories (biochronology) up to four decades in length from seven fishing areas spanning this species' range. The dominant pattern in annual growth was an age‐dependent, allometric decline that varied among individuals, sexes, fishing areas, years, and cohorts. We found evidence for among‐area differences in growth‐rate selectivity, whereby younger fish at capture were generally faster growers. Temporal growth variation was partitioned into two main sources: extrinsic year to year annual fluctuations in environmental conditions and persistent cohort‐specific growth differences, reflecting density dependence and/or juvenile experience. Despite low levels of among‐individual growth synchrony within areas, we detected a regionally coherent signal of increasing average growth rate through time, a trend related to oceanic warming. At the southerly (poleward) range limit, growth was only weakly related to temperature, but farther north in warmer waters this relationship strengthened until closer to the species' equatorward range limit, growth declined with increasing temperatures. We partitioned these species‐wide and area‐specific phenotypic responses into within‐ and among‐individual components using a reaction norm approach. Individual tiger flathead likely possess sufficient growth plasticity to successfully adapt to warming waters across much of their range, but increased future warming in the north will continue to depress growth, affecting individual fitness and even population persistence. Our modeling framework is directly applicable to other long‐term, individual‐based, data sets such as those derived from tree rings, corals, and tag–recapture studies, and provides an unprecedented level of resolution into the drivers of growth variation and the ecological and evolutionary implications of environmental and climatic change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatycephalus richardsoni 3aallometry 3aclimate change 3acorals 3adata collection 3ademographic statistics 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowth rings 3ajuveniles 3amarine fish 3amodels 3aontogeny 3aotoliths 3aphenotype 3atemperature 3aAustralia1 aThresher, Ronald E.0 tEcological monographs.g2015 Feb., v. 85, no. 1 p.93-115dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-2355.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013300169300001600302520196700318592002802285650002302313650001502336650001402351650001302365650001002378650002202388650002102410650000902431650001302440650002302453650001602476650001602492650002502508650001602533650001502549650001502564700002102579773012802600856008102728852000902809655001202818IND60623146020221120170408.0181127e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062314602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11707-018-0721-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHultstrand, D. M.14aThe sensitivity of snowpack sublimation estimates to instrument and measurement uncertainty perturbed in a Monte Carlo framework  ap. 728-738.  aThe bulk aerodynamic flux equation is often used to estimate snowpack sublimation since it requires meteorological measurements at only one height above the snow surface. However, to date the uncertainty of these estimates and the individual input variables and input parameters uncertainty have not been quantified. We modeled sublimation for three (average snowpack in 2005, deep snowpack in 2011, and shallow snowpack in 2012) different water years (October 1 to September 30) at West Glacier Lake watershed within the Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiments Site in Wyoming.We performed a Monte Carlo analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of modeled sublimation to uncertainties of the input variables and parameters from the bulk aerodynamic flux equation. Input variable time series were uniformly adjusted by a normally distributed random variable with a standard deviation given as follows: 1) the manufacturer’s stated instrument accuracy of 0.3°C for temperature (T), 0.3 m/s for wind speed (Uz), 2% for relative humidity (RH), and 1 mb for pressure (P); 2) 0.0093 m for the aerodynamic roughness length (z₀) based on z₀ profiles calculations from multiple heights; and 3) 0.08 m for measurement height (z). Often z is held constant; here we used a constant z compared to the ground surface, and subsequently altered z to account for the change in snow depth (dₛ). The most important source of uncertainty was z₀, then RH. Accounting for measurement height as it changed due to snowpack accumulation/ablation was also relevant for deeper snow. Snow surface sublimation uncertainties, from this study, are in the range of 1% to 29% for individual input parameter perturbations. The mean cumulative uncertainty was 41% for the three water years with 55%, 37%, and 32% occurring for the wet, average, and low water years. The top three variables (z varying with dₛ, z₀, and RH) accounted for 74% to 84% of the cumulative sublimation uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aecosystems 3aequations 3aglaciers 3alakes 3arelative humidity 3aroughness length 3asnow 3asnowpack 3astandard deviation 3asublimation 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3awind speed1 aFassnacht, S.

To investigate this, we developed an 11-year time series of MODIS Normalized Burn Ratio images corresponding to peak-growing season conditions for a study area located in the Pacific Northwest of the conterminous United States. Using a temporal segmentation algorithm that was originally developed using Landsat TM and ETM data, we created annual maps of forest disturbance from these time series. We then compared these maps to a database of annual forest disturbance that was compiled using Landsat TM/ETM data for the same region. Results from this comparison revealed that about half of all pixels affected by disturbances that occupied more than 5% of a MODIS pixel were correctly identified as disturbed, including 79% of those that were affected by disturbances larger than one-third of a MODIS pixel. Our results also show that the size, severity, and timing of disturbance events, along with gridding artifacts inherent to MODIS data, interact in complex ways that influence the signature of forest disturbance events in MODIS data. These results demonstrate both the utility as well as the limitations of MODIS and other coarse spatial resolution sensors for monitoring forest disturbance at regional to global scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ainsects 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3atime series analysis 3aUnited States 0aChange detection 0aMODIS 0aNorthwest Forest Plan 0aForest disturbance 0aTemporal segmentation 0aTime series1 aKennedy, Robert E.1 aYang, Zhiqiang1 aBraaten, Justin1 aKrankina, Olga N.1 aFriedl, Mark A.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Aug., v. 151 p.114-123dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.07.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245008800208300001400296520149200310592002801802596004701830650001501877650001001892650001501902650001101917650002001928650001501948650002501963650001601988700002402004773011702028856008102145852000902226655001202235IND60631464120221120165322.0190224e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063146412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12080-018-0386-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegault, Geoffrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2136-587X10aAccounting for environmental change in continuous-time stochastic population models  ap. 31-48.  aThe demographic rates (e.g., birth, death, migration) of many organisms have been shown to respond strongly to short- and long-term environmental change, including variation in temperature and precipitation. While ecologists have long accounted for such nonhomogeneous demography in deterministic population models, nonhomogeneous stochastic population models are largely absent from the literature. This is especially the case for models that use exact stochastic methods, such as Gillespie’s stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), which commonly assumes that demographic rates do not respond to external environmental change (i.e., assumes homogeneous demography). In other words, ecologists are currently accounting for the effects of demographic stochasticity or environmental variability, but not both. In this paper, we describe an extension of Gillespie’s SSA (SSA +) that allows for nonhomogeneous demography and examine how its predictions differ from a method that is partly naive to environmental change (SSAn) for two fundamental ecological models (exponential and logistic growth). We find important differences in the predicted population sizes of SSA + versus SSAn simulations, particularly when demography responds to fluctuating and irregularly changing environments. Further, we outline a computationally inexpensive approach for estimating when and under what circumstances it can be important to fully account for nonhomogeneous demography for any class of model.  aPublisher supplied data  a1457660cDivision of Environmental Biology 3aalgorithms 3adeath 3ademography 3amodels 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3astochastic processes 3atemperature1 aMelbourne, Brett A.0 tTheoretical ecology.g2019 Mar., v. 12, no. 1 p.31-48dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000920x1874-17387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-018-0386-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01178naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245004100180300001600221500000900237520029000246592002800536650000900564650001500573650001900588650000900607700001900616773014800635856009600783852000900879655001200888IND60668401420221120144917.0191125e197003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066840142DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1970.03615995003400020052x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorvell, W.

In the slurry state, partial solubilization of the polymer may occur. This may ultimately lead to wax formation, reactor fouling and polymer agglomeration. These issues may be alleviated by empirically adapting polymerization conditions, but a rational approach to that necessitates detailed information about polymer solubility. This information can be obtained through quantification of solid–liquid equilibria (SLE), which, in turn, necessitate input from experimental data. With an experimental setup for cloud point temperature determinations, the necessary data input was obtained to estimate the SLE of different PE (high-density polyethylene (HDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE)) in typical slurry process diluents. The cloud point temperatures predicted by the developed models were checked against experimental results. It was established that the behavior of solvent mixtures can be predicted based on that of their components.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyclohexanes 3ahexane 3apolyethylene 3apolymerization 3aprocess design 3aslurries 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aBrüll, Robert1 aMacko, Tibor1 aPerez, Francisco1 aPanitzky, Jens0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Oct. 07, v. 60, no. 41 p.14968-14976dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c024063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010700172520161300279592002801892650001101920650001101931650001101942650001501953650000901968650001101977650001501988651001102003653002502014653001602039653003202055653001902087653001102106700002202117773010502139856008602244852000902330655001202339IND60773555820221120103420.0220809e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077355582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBournas, Apollon10aInvestigation of the gridded flash flood Guidance in a Peri-Urban basin in greater Athens area, Greece  aIn this research work, an implementation of the gridded Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) method is conducted for the prediction and evaluation of flash floods in Greece. The FFG system is a well-established Early Warning System (EWS) for the estimation of flash flood threats, especially in small ungauged basins, where flash floods are the most dominant form of flooding. First, an overview of the gridded FFG system is conducted, where all computations are performed at grid level. The methodology applied consists of the derivation of the threshold rainfall, referred to as the FFG. The catastrophic flash flood event that occurred on the 15th of November 2017 and caused the loss of 24 human lives and extensive economic damage within the Mandra settlement, in the Attica region in Greece, is used to assess the lead time provided by the system. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed regarding the two main aspects of the system, i.e. the threshold runoff and the estimation of the soil moisture conditions, and their impact on the generated lead times. Results show that the most crucial aspect of the system is the soil moisture conditions, since in wet conditions a 10% deviation on a scale from zero to one, can result in a complete time-step loss of the possibilities provided lead time, while in dry conditions the deviation is much larger. Finally, concerning the studied event, results show that if the system was operational, and the forecasted rainfall matched the values of the actual rainfall, at least a five-hour lead time warning could have been issued based on the results of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3afloods 3ahumans 3aprediction 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil water 3aGreece 0aFlash flood guidance 0aGridded FFG 0aFlood threshold maps Greece 0aSarantapotamos 0aMandra1 aBaltas, Evangelos0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 July, v. 610 p.127820-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04984naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010000169300001600269520339300285592002803678650001203706650002403718650001503742650002903757650001103786650001703797650001803814650001203832650001403844650001003858650001103868650001503879650001503894650001603909650002403925650001303949650001903962650002503981651001104006653001204017653001604029653002304045653001204068653001104080653001004091653001704101653001504118700002104133700002304154700001904177773009604196856008104292961001204373852000904385655001204394IND60545018920221118051926.0160901e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054501892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2013.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPflugmacher, Dirk10aUsing Landsat-derived disturbance and recovery history and lidar to map forest biomass dynamics  ap. 124-137.  aImproved monitoring of forest biomass and biomass change is needed to quantify natural and anthropogenic effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Landsat's temporal and spatial coverage, moderate spatial resolution, and long history of earth observations provide a unique opportunity for characterizing vegetation changes across large areas and long time scales. However, like with other multi-spectral passive optical sensors, Landsat's relationship of single-date reflectance with forest biomass diminishes under high leaf area and complex canopy conditions. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is largely determined by its disturbance and recovery history, we conceived a method that enhances Landsat's spectral relationships with biomass by including information on vegetation trends prior to the date for which estimates are desired. With recently developed algorithms that characterize trends in disturbance (e.g. year of onset, duration, and magnitude) and post-disturbance regrowth, it should now be possible to realize improved Landsat-based mapping of current biomass across large regions. Moreover, given that we now have 40years of Landsat data, it should also be possible to use this approach to map historic biomass densities.In this study, we developed regression tree models to predict current forest aboveground biomass (AGB) for a mixed-conifer region in eastern Oregon (USA) using Landsat-based disturbance and recovery (DR) metrics. We employed the trajectory-fitting algorithm LandTrendr to characterize DR trends from yearly Landsat time series between 1972 and 2010. The most important DR predictors of AGB were associated with magnitude of disturbance, post-disturbance condition and post-disturbance recovery, whereas time since disturbance and pre-disturbance trends showed only weak correlations with AGB. Including DR metrics substantially improved predictions of AGB (RMSE=30.3Mgha−1, 27%) compared to models based on only single-date reflectance (RMSE=39.6Mgha−1, 35%). To determine the number of years required to adequately capture the effect of DR on AGB, we explored the relationship between time-series length and model prediction accuracy. Prediction accuracy increased exponentially with increasing number of years across the entire observation period, suggesting that in this forest region the longer the historic record of disturbance and recovery metrics the more accurate the mapping of AGB. However, time series lengths of between 10 and 20years were adequate to significantly improve model predictions, and lengths of as little as 5years still had a meaningful impact. To test the concept of historic biomass prediction, we applied our model to Landsat time series from 1972–1993 and estimated AGB biomass change between 1993 and 2007. Our estimates compared well with historic inventory data, demonstrating that long-term Landsat observations of DR processes can aid in monitoring AGB and AGB change.Instead of directly linking Landsat data with the limited amount of available field-based AGB data, in this study we used the field data to map AGB with airborne lidar and then sampled the lidar data for model training and error assessment. By using lidar data to build and test our prediction model, this study illustrates that lidar data have great value for scaling between field measurements and Landsat data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aaboveground biomass 3aalgorithms 3aanthropogenic activities 3acanopy 3acarbon cycle 3aforest stands 3aforests 3aleaf area 3alidar 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3aregrowth 3aremote sensing 3atime series analysis 3aOregon 0aLandsat 0aTime series 0aForest disturbance 0aBiomass 0aCarbon 0aLidar 0aTasseled cap 0aLandTrendr1 aCohen, Warren B.1 aKennedy, Robert E.1 aYang, Zhiqiang0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Aug., v. 151 p.124-137dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007900160300001800239520081900257592002801076650003001104650002601134650001601160650001501176700002201191700002101213700002901234700002001263700002501283700001701308700001701325700001701342700002301359700001801382700001801400700002201418700003101440700002801471700002201499700001801521700002001539700002701559700002501586700002501611700002301636700002001659700002601679700002201705700002001727700002101747700002601768700001601794700002001810700002501830700001801855700002001873700002401893700002001917700002101937700002001958700003001978700003102008700002102039700002302060700002202083700001802105700001702123700001902140700002102159700001502180700002302195700001902218773012202237856007302359852000902432655001202441IND60080802920221119085820.0140811e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008080292DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.121902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoles, Angela T.10aWhich is a better predictor of plant traits: temperature or precipitation?  ap. 1167-1180.  aQUESTION: Are plant traits more closely correlated with mean annual temperature, or with mean annual precipitation?

The International Waterbird Census (IWC) has been regularly implemented in Morocco since 1983. Thanks to this program, a large database on wintering waterbirds’ populations has been collected. In this article, we summarize the wintering data of three globally threatened waterbirds: Aythya ferina, Marmaronetta angustirostris, and Oxyura leucocephala. The population of Aythya ferina, which is declining, is largely distributed in the country, in over a hundred wetlands, 26 of which verify the national importance criteria. Marmaronetta angustirostris has a stable trend over the years even though its population can know high annual fluctuations; it winters in more or less 50 wetlands, among which 18 host more than 1% of its regional population and 16 verify the criteria for national importance. On the contrary, Oxyura leucocephala, a globally endangered bird only encountered in a dozen wetlands, shows a moderate increase in its numbers; only two wetlands verify the Ramsar criterion 6, while a total of six can be considered of national importance. Furthermore, given the conservation statuses of these waterbirds and according to the Ramsar criterion 2, all their hosting sites are of international importance. The results presented in this paper are a crucial step for the adoption and implementation of adequate conservation measures for the species and their key sites. Nevertheless, comprehensive research and coordinated efforts on the factors (ecological and anthropogenic) influencing the species, at the national and international levels, are required for a better understanding of their populations’ dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  cGREPOM/BirdLife Morocco  cONCFS 3aAythya 3aOxyura leucocephala 3adatabases 3amigratory behavior 3awater birds 3azoology 3aMorocco1 aDakki, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8042-39721 aEl Agbani, Mohammed-Aziz1 aQninba, Abdeljebbar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7572-78671 aEl Hamoumi, R’himou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2004-62520 tInternational journal of zoology.g2021 Jan. 21, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:21406x1687-84857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/88462033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01991naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245013900206300001800345520046600363592002800829650002500857650001300882650002200895650002300917650002300940650002200963650001000985650003200995650001601027650002201043650002201065650002701087700001601114700005601130700001701186700001801203700001801221700001301239700001301252700005601265773012001321856008301441852000901524655001201533IND60685755920221121161713.0200306e20200214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068575592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c001502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Wei-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4835-477510aFlavipesides A–C, PKS-NRPS Hybrids as Pancreatic Lipase Inhibitors from a Marine Sponge Symbiotic Fungus Aspergillus flavipes 164013  ap. 1825-1829.  aThree unusual chlorinated PKS-NRPS hybrid metabolites, flavipesides A–C (1–3), were isolated from a strain of marine sponge symbiotic fungus Aspergillus flavipes 164013.

The objectives were to: (i) evaluate whether increased FHB risk is associated with within-field maize residue; (ii) determine the spatial pattern of FHB incidence; and (iii) quantify the relationship between FHB incidence and severity. FHB was assessed in a total of 160 fields between early milk and dough. Incidence ranged from 1.0 to 89.9% (median = 25%) and severity from 0.02 to 18.6% (median = 1.3%). FHB risk was neither lower nor higher in wheat following maize than in wheat following soybean. Only 18% of fields were classified as having aggregated patterns of FHB-symptomatic spikes. A binary power law description of the variances was consistent with an overall random pattern of the disease. These results conform with the hypothesis that FHB epidemics in southern Brazil are driven by sufficient atmospherically-transported inoculum from regional sources. The incidence-severity relationship was coherent across growing season, growth stage, and previous crop; one common fitted curve described the relationship across all observations. Estimating severity from incidence may be useful in reducing the workload in epidemiological surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepidemiological studies 3arisk 3adough 3ano-tillage 3adevelopmental stages 3asoybeans 3acorn 3adisease outbreaks 3agrowing season 3amilk 3aspring wheat 3aFusarium head blight 3ainoculum 3aBrazil 0asurveys1 aShah, Denis A.1 aFernandes, José Maurício C.1 aBergstrom, Gary C.1 aDel Ponte, Emerson M.0 tPlant disease.g2015 Oct., v. 99, no. 10 p.1360-1366dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-09-14-0944-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012200168300001600290520130300306592002801609650002301637650001301660650002701673650002301700650001001723650001201733650002301745650001101768650001401779650000901793700002001802700002801822700002201850700002001872773009101892856008301983852000902066655001202075IND60777105320221121142404.0220514s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077710532DNAL7 a10.1163/1568538087851119862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonacci, Teresa10aTesting the predatory behaviour of Podarcis sicula (Reptilia: Lacertidae) towards aposematic and non-aposematic preys  ap. 449-453.  aFood preferences and the effects of prey chemical repellents in the dietary behaviour of Podarcis sicula were tested using four species of Carabid beetles as prey models. The goal of the study was to assess (i) the ability of P. sicula to recognize insect preys provided with chemical repellents and aposematic colorations under laboratory conditions, and (ii) the importance of chemical signals used by the prey model as antipredatory strategy. Preys used in this study were Brachinus sclopeta and Anchomenus dorsalis (aposematic species) and Amara anthobia and A. aenea (non-aposematic species). Aposematic species are characterized by warning color pattern and by production of chemical repellents, while non-aposematic ones do not. Amara anthobia and A. aenea were attacked with high frequency by P. sicula, Brachinus sclopeta and Anchomenus dorsalis with low frequency. Non-aposematic species were preyed more often than the aposematic ones. Brachinus sclopeta was preyed after low latency, while Amara anthobia and A. aenea after long latency. Non-aposematic species were captured and eaten without difficulty, while when B. sclopeta or A. dorsalis were captured, lizards always tossed their head and then rub the snout on the soil, probably because of the unpalatability of aposematic preys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachinus sclopeta 3aPodarcis 3aantipredatory behavior 3aaposematic species 3acolor 3ainsects 3amimicry (behavior) 3amodels 3apredation 3asoil1 aCapula, Massimo1 aBrandmayr, Tullia Zetto1 aBrandmayr, Pietro1 aAloise, Gaetano0 tAmphibia-reptilia.g2008, v. 29, no. 3 p.449-453dBrillwJournal:6284x0173-53737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568538087851119863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245017100168300001600339520138300355592002801738650002501766650001801791650002201809650001101831650002601842650002801868650001401896650002001910650001301930650003601943650001501979650002901994700002602023700003002049700002002079700002102099700002402120700001802144700002002162700002402182700002602206700001702232700001602249773009902265856008002364852000902444655001202453IND60083003020221119183825.0141101e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008300302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2010.11.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelporte, Cédric10aOptimization of apolipoprotein-B-100 sequence coverage by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for the future study of its posttranslational modifications  ap. 129-138.  aProteomic applications have been increasingly used to study posttranslational modifications of proteins (PTMs). For the purpose of identifying and localizing specific but unknown PTMs on huge proteins, improving their sequence coverage is fundamental. Using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), peptide mapping of the native apolipoprotein-B-100 was performed to further document the effects of oxidation. Apolipoprotein-B-100 is the main protein of low-density lipoprotein particles and its oxidation could play a role in atherogenesis. Because it is one of the largest human proteins, the sequence recovery rate of apolipoprotein-B-100 only reached 1% when conventional analysis parameters were used. The different steps of the peptide mapping process—from protein treatment to data analysis—were therefore reappraised and optimized. These optimizations allowed a protein sequence recovery rate of 79%, a rate which has never been achieved previously for such a large human protein. The key points for improving peptide mapping were optimization of the data analysis software; peptide separation by LC; sample preparation; and MS acquisition. The new protocol has allowed us to increase by a factor of 4 the detection of modified peptides in apolipoprotein-B-100. This approach could easily be transferred to any study of PTMs using LC–MS/MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapolipoprotein B-100 3aatherogenesis 3acomputer software 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3alow density lipoprotein 3aoxidation 3apeptide mapping 3apeptides 3apost-translational modification 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aVan Antwerpen, Pierre1 aZouaoui Boudjeltia, Karim1 aNoyon, Caroline1 aAbts, Frédéric1 aMétral, Frédéric1 aVanhamme, Luc1 aReyé, Florence1 aRousseau, Alexandre1 aVanhaeverbeek, Michel1 aDucobu, Jean1 aNève, Jean0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 411, no. 1 p.129-138dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2010.11.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011000160520157700270592002801847650001501875650002001890650001701910650000901927650001501936650002301951650001401974651001001988651001301998653002902011653001902040653002102059653002102080653002802101653002502129653002002154700001802174700001302192773009402205856008202299852000902381655001202390IND60727959520221120115836.0210820e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072795952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2021.1068792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Tong10aDataset of mineral contents of fine-sand and silt-sized soil particles from deserts in China and Mongolia  aThere are over 70 types of mineral species in desert soils. Previous data have focused on major mineral contents and thus, the identification of minor mineral species is lacking. The diversity of minor mineral species was investigated in 19 surficial sediments from deserts in China and Mongolia. A modern scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based in-situ mineral mapping technique was used to determine the minor mineral species concentrations. For further analysis and interpretation, the identified species were grouped into felsic, mica, carbonate, heavy, rare earth, and salt-type minerals. The data in this article demonstrate that the concentrations of felsic, mica, and carbonate minerals are higher than those of the other mineral groups, and thus can be used to provide evidence of sediment provenance. The obtained mineral concentrations were converted from the relative area percentage for each mineral species using standard mineral density data. Mineral mapping was performed using the mineral liberation analysis platform, and on average, approximately 40,000 single particles per sample were analyzed to achieve an accurate quantification of the mineral concentrations. For each of the analyzed single particles, the particle shape parameters, such as particle length and width, were stored and can be used to trace the sediment transport process.

The encapsulated probiotics in microbead gel matrix were further stabilized in maltodextrin solids by either spray or freeze-drying to form probiotic microcapsule powders. The free cells of probiotics were also sprayed and freeze-dried in maltodextrin only without microgel encapsulation. After rehydration of microgel-encapsulated powder, gel particles regained their shape. There was no difference in the loss of viability between encapsulated and unencapsulated probiotics during spray drying or freeze-drying. For LNCFM, spray-dried bacteria with or without gel encapsulation exhibited less death (3.03 and 3.07 log CFU/g reduction, respectively) than those of freeze-dried bacteria (4.36 and 4.89 log CFU/g reduction, respectively) after 6 months storage at 4 °C. The same trend was also observed in spray-dried LGG without gel encapsulation which showed 5.87 log CFU/g reduction in viability after 6 months at 4 °C; however, freeze-dried LGG without gel encapsulation exhibited a rapid reduction in viability of 5.91 log CFU/g within just 2 months. Gel-encapsulated LGG which was freeze-dried exhibited less death (3.32 log CFU/g reduction) after 6 months at 4 °C. This work shows that spray drying results in improved subsequent probiotic survivability compared to freeze-drying and that alginate gel encapsulation can improve the survivability following freeze-drying in a probiotic-dependent manner. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aaerosols 3abacteria 3aencapsulation 3afreeze drying 3agels 3apowders 3aprobiotics 3arehydration 3ashape 3aspray drying 3aviability1 aTurner, Mark S.1 aCoombes, Allan1 aBhandari, Bhesh0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Oct., v. 6, no. 10 p.2763-2769dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-012-0938-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245012000159300001800279520223900297592002802536650001202564650001902576650001402595650001002609650001602619650001702635650001002652650001002662650001202672650001002684650001502694650003302709650002502742650002102767650001202788651001002800653001802810653002002828653002302848700001502871700001702886700001902903700001602922700001602938700001902954773015402973856007803127852000903205655001203214IND60539596520221120220904.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053959652DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-93502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Rosa, G.10aApplication of the Welfare Quality protocol to dairy buffalo farms: Prevalence and reliability of selected measures  ap. 6886-6896.  aWithin the general aim of developing a Welfare Quality system for monitoring dairy buffalo welfare, this study focused on prevalence and interobserver reliability of the animal-related variables to be included in the scheme. As most of the measures were developed for cattle, the study also aimed to verify their prevalence for buffaloes. Thirty animal-based measures (22 clinical and 8 behavioral measurements) and 20 terms used for qualitative behavior assessment were assessed in 42 loose-housed buffalo farms. All farms were located in central-southern Italy. Two assessors were used (1 male and 1 female). The time needed to record all measures (animal-, resource-, and management-based) was 5.47±0.48 h (mean ± SD). Interobserver reliability of animal-based measures was evaluated using Spearman rank correlation coefficient test (rs). If 0.7 is considered as threshold for high interobserver reliability, all animal-based measures were above this level. In particular, most of the coefficients were above 0.85, with higher values observed for prevalence of animals that can be touched (rs=0.99) and prevalence of animals with iatrogenic abscess (rs=0.97), whereas lower coefficients were found for the prevalence of vulvar discharge (rs=0.74) and dewlap edema (rs=0.73). Twelve out of the 20 terms used for the qualitative behavior assessment reached a satisfactory interobserver reliability (rs=0.65). Principal component analysis of qualitative behavior assessment scores was conducted for each assessor. Both principal component 1 and principal component 2 showed high interobserver reliability (rs=0.80 and 0.79, respectively). In addition, relevant proportions of animals were affected by welfare issues specific to buffaloes, such as overgrown claws (median=34.1%), withers hygroma (median=13.3%), and vulvar or uterine prolapse (median=9.3%). We concluded that most of the investigated measures could be reliably included in the final scheme, which can be used as such to monitor buffalo welfare. However, to inform consumers about the welfare status of the animals, the data should be integrated into a single overall assessment of animal welfare, as already performed in the Welfare Quality project for dairy cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscess 3aanimal welfare 3abuffaloes 3aclaws 3acorrelation 3adairy cattle 3aedema 3afarms 3afemales 3amales 3amonitoring 3aprincipal component analysis 3aqualitative analysis 3auterine prolapse 3awithers 3aItaly 0adairy buffalo 0aWelfare Quality 0awelfare monitoring1 aGrasso, F.1 aWinckler, C.1 aBilancione, A.1 aPacelli, C.1 aMasucci, F.1 aNapolitano, F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Oct., v. 98, no. 10 p.6886-6896dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-93503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245013600182300001600318520102600334592002801360650002101388650001801409650001301427650001601440650004301456650001501499650001101514650001101525650002101536650001401557650001401571650001001585650001701595650001501612653002101627653001601648653001801664653001501682653000901697700003001706700003001736773010301766856008401869852000901953655001201962IND60125788020221120150741.0150513e20150418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012578802DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9861252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthukrishnan, Saradha Devi10aIdentification and determination of flavonoids, carotenoids and chlorophyll concentration in Cynodon dactylon (L.) by HPLC analysis  ap. 785-790.  aCynodon dactylon (L.) is a potent medicinal plant in the traditional and current Indian medicinal systems. The objective of this research was to find out the levels of flavonoids, carotenoids and chlorophyll b in C. dactylon leaves by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a diode array detector. HPLC analysis revealed that total carotenoid and total flavonoid concentration were 62 mg/100 g and 249.1 μg/g, respectively. The mean chlorophyll b was 85.1 mg/100 g in C. dactylon . Among the flavonoids, quercetin (164.7 μg/g) was the major flavonoid followed by kaempferol (48.2 μg/g), rutin (18.4 μg/g), catechin (12.1 μg/g) and myricetin (5.7 μg/g). Of the carotenoids, β-carotene (35.2 mg/100 g) was predominant followed by lutein (17.0 mg/100 g), violaxanthin (5.8 mg/100 g) and zeaxanthin (4.2 mg/100 g). Chlorophyll b concentration was 85.1 mg/100 g in C. dactylon . The results of this investigation should be useful information for further pharmacological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3abeta-carotene 3acatechin 3achlorophyll 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3alutein 3amedicinal plants 3amyricetin 3aquercetin 3arutin 3aviolaxanthin 3azeaxanthin 0aCynodon dactylon 0acarotenoids 0achlorophyll b 0aflavonoids 0aHPLC1 aKaliyaperumal, Ashokkumar1 aSubramaniyan, Annapoorani0 tNatural product research.g2015 Apr. 18, v. 29, no. 8 p.785-790dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2014.9861253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01991naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245006100175300001800236520074700254592002801001650002201029650001501051650002101066650001701087650001301104650002301117650001901140650001401159650002201173653001501195653001301210653001201223700002501235700002401260700002201284700002301306700002101329773012501350856008501475852000901560655001201569IND60689147820221123044244.0200419e20200417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068914782DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.15507662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoonsombat, Jutatip12aA new 22,26-seco physalin steroid from Physalis angulata  ap. 1097-1104.  aA new 22,26-seco physalin, physalin XI (1) together with 5 known compounds, were isolated from the dichloromethane extract of Physalis angulata L.

Compound 1 was assessed for its cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines (HepG2, HeLa, HuCCA-1, T47-D and A-549) and a normal cell line (MRC-5), and the result showed that it has no activity. Compounds 2 and 4 are highly toxic to H69AR and MDA-MB-23 cell lines.

We employed trapping and spotlighting across 36 transects to detect the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis). Repeat surveys were conducted over five sessions. We used multi-method occupancy to compare these methods. The probability of detection did not differ between one night of spotlighting (0.23&#xb1;0.04, mean&#xb1;s.e.), or one night of trapping (0.22&#xb1;0.03). Trapping continued for three nights, which led to the probability of detection rising to 0.41&#xb1;0.04. Spotlighting was only conducted once per session. These methods would require equivalent effort when conducted over three nights. Further investigation is required to compare this and other methods such as camera trapping and spotlighting with thermal cameras.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetaurus norfolcensis 3acameras 3amammalogy 3aprobability 0aarboreal mammals 0adetection probability 0aenvironmental management 0atrapping 0awildlife monitoring 0awildlife surveys1 aTaylor, Brendan D.0 tAustralian mammalogy.g2021, v. 44, no. 2 p.208-212dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:J000001169x0310-00497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AM200723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006500167300001600232520112700248592002801375650001701403650001501420650001701435650001001452650001801462650001201480650002201492650001301514650001401527650003501541650004501576650001401621650002201635653002901657653002601686653002201712700001601734700001901750700001701769700001801786700001501804773012101819856008201940852000902022655001202031IND60568994320221120051345.0170709e20170729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056899432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.05.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Qingbin10aExpression and purification of functional PDGF receptor beta  ap. 353-359.  aPlatelet Derived Growth Factor receptors (PDGFRs), members of receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily, play essential roles in early hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and organ development. Dysregulation of PDGF receptor signaling under pathological conditions associates with cancers, vascular diseases, and fibrotic diseases. Therefore, they are attractive targets in drug development. Like any other membrane proteins with a single-pass transmembrane domain, the high-resolution structural information of the full-length PDGF receptors is still not resolved. It is caused, at least in part, by the technical challenges in the expression and purification of the functional, full-length PDGF receptors. Herein, we reported our experimental details in expression and purification of the full-length PDGFRβ from mammalian cells. We found that purified PDGFRβ remained in two different oligomeric states, presumably the monomer and the dimer, with basal kinase activity in detergent micelles. Addition of PDGF-B promoted dimerization and elevated kinase activity of the receptor, suggesting that purified receptors were functional.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3adetergents 3adimerization 3adrugs 3ahematopoiesis 3amammals 3amembrane proteins 3amicelles 3aneoplasms 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3aplatelet-derived growth factor receptors 3areceptors 3avascular diseases 0aReceptor tyrosine kinase 0aPreexisting oligomers 0aNegative-stain EM1 aZhao, Liang1 aWang, Xiaojing1 aWang, Meimei1 aSui, Sen-Fang1 aMi, Li-Zhi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 July 29, v. 489 p.353-359dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.05.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010100173300001400274520139600288592002801684650001901712650002201731650001001753650001401763650001301777650002001790650001101810650001501821650002401836650002801860650001601888651001101904651001601915700001701931700001801948700001601966700002301982700002002005773009102025856008502116852000902201655001202210IND60084437320221119080643.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008443732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2009.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholefield, Paul10aModelling the European Farmland Bird Indicator in response to forecast land-use change in Europe  ap. 46-51.  aThe European Farmland Bird Indicator (EFBI) has been adopted as a Structural and Sustainable Development Indicator by the European Union. It is an aggregated index integrating the population trends of 33 common bird species associated with farmland habitats across 21 countries. We describe a modelling method for predicting this indicator from land-use characteristics. Using yearly historical land-use data of crop areas derived from the FAO databases (1990–2007) and published population data of farmland birds at the national level for the same period, we developed a series of multiple regression models to predict the trend of the EU state specific indicator, and the EFBI. These models incorporated up to 4 parameters and were selected based upon the significance (p<0.05) of the model inputs with respect to the predictive variable. 17 separate models were developed in total for each of 14 EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland, and a separate model for the EU level indicator. The selected models were then implemented to predict the EFBI in the year 2025, using scenarios of land-use change generated by the CAPRI agricultural model. The uncertainty of using the regression models is discussed with respect to predicting the likely impacts of land-use change on bird populations. This work lays the framework for future modelling of farmland birds at the international scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aagricultural land 3abirds 3adatabases 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asustainable development 3auncertainty 3aNorway 3aSwitzerland1 aFirbank, Les1 aButler, Simon1 aNorris, Ken1 aJones, Laurence M.1 aPetit, Sandrine0 tEcological indicators.g2011 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.46-51dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2009.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245013600166300001600302520139000318592002801708650002201736650001201758650002201770650001501792650001501807650001901822650001101841650001901852650002001871650001301891650001901904650001501923651001101938700001901949700002501968700002401993700002202017700001702039700002002056773013102076856008202207852000902289655001202298IND4472094120221121170628.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447209412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2011.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWawire, Michael10aEffect of harvest age and thermal processing on poly-γ-glutamate folates and minerals in African cowpea leaves (Vigna unguiculata)  ap. 160-165.  aCowpea leaves (Vigna unguiculata) are highly consumed in Africa because the plant is easy to cultivate and highly disease/drought tolerant. The vegetables are harvested between 4 and 9 weeks of maturity. The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate the effect of vegetable maturity on total folate content, poly-γ-glutamate profile and mineral content and (ii) evaluate the effect of thermal treatments on folate stability and its poly-γ-glutamate profile changes. The total folate content and the folate poly-γ-glutamate chain length increased with increasing maturity of the vegetables. Folate occurred predominantly as tri-γ-glutamates (55%); chain lengths of up to tetra-γ-glutamates (14%) for 4-week-old vegetables. For 6- and 8-week-old vegetables, they occurred mainly as penta-γ-glutamates (78 and 60% respectively); chain lengths of up to hexa and hepta-γ-glutamates respectively. On crushing raw vegetables, at all stages of maturity, there was enzymatic conversion to short chain folate poly-γ-glutamates indicating the presence of endogenous γ-glutamyl hydrolase. Heating (30–70°C for10min) affected the stability and profile of folates. There was a general decline (>60%) in the levels of minerals during maturation of the vegetables. In conclusion, the maturity stage is an important factor in optimizing the type and quantity of these micronutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3adrought tolerance 3afolic acid 3aharvesting 3aheat treatment 3aleaves 3amaturity stage 3amineral content 3aminerals 3araw vegetables 3avegetables 3aAfrica1 aOey, Indrawati1 aMathooko, Francis M.1 aNjoroge, Charles K.1 aShitanda, Douglas1 aSila, Daniel1 aHendrickx, Marc0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2012 Mar., v. 25, no. 2 p.160-165dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009300165300001600258500002000274520211900294592002802413596009202441596004502533596012002578650000802698650002402706650000902730650001302739650001502752650002702767650002702794650001402821650001402835650002202849650001302871650002402884651001502908700001702923700002302940773012902963856007503092852000903167655001203176IND60787121420221121005310.0220807e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078712142DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.212362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrazeal, Jennifer L.10aNoninvasive genetic spatial capture‐recapture for estimating deer population abundance  ap. 629-640.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInformed management of wildlife populations requires the accurate estimation of abundance, sex ratio, and other population parameters. For deer (Odocoileus spp.), the use of closed‐population, capture‐recapture (CR) methods, in conjunction with noninvasive DNA sampling, has become increasingly practical, but, up to now, these methods have been used in a non‐spatial modeling framework, which has limited their utility for population‐level inferences. In particular, extrapolation of plot‐level CR abundance estimates to the population required the use of multipliers of unknown reliability and potential bias. Spatially explicit capture‐recapture (SCR) models provide an integrated framework for directly estimating density as a function of spatial and habitat variables at landscape scales. We used fecal DNA samples in conjunction with SCR to estimate density, sex ratio, and habitat correlates to density for a mule deer (O. hemionus) population across a large (∼500 km²) area in the central Sierra Nevada Range, California, USA during 2013 and 2014. We surveyed 24 random transects within 4 30‐km² sites representative of the study area. Based on 411 samples genotyped at a sex marker and 8–10 microsatellite loci, the sex‐ratio for the study area was 62 (95% CI = 41–93) males/100 females in 2013 and 65 (95% CI = 45–94) males/100 females in 2014. Using SCR, we estimated density at 5.0 (95% CI = 2.3–7.8) deer/km² in 2013 and 5.1 (95% CI = 3.1–7.2) deer/km² in 2014. In comparison, non‐spatial CR analysis produced density estimates on average 60% higher, likely reflecting bias resulting from use of the commonly employed mean maximum recapture distance (MMRD) to estimate effective sampling area. The SCR models indicated that density was effectively homogeneous throughout the study area, with no strong relationship to habitat correlates. Altogether, these results demonstrate the utility of noninvasive fecal DNA methods in a SCR framework for estimation of abundance and density in deer populations at landscape scales. © 2017 The Wildlife Society  aPublisher supplied data  aNC‐8001‐11cCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife, Big Game Management Account  aP1320005cUniversity of California Davis  cMammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit of the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the University of California Davis 3aDNA 3aOdocoileus hemionus 3adeer 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amark-recapture studies 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amountains 3asex ratio 3aspecies abundance 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aCalifornia1 aWeist, Terri1 aSacks, Benjamin N.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2017 May, v. 81, no. 4 p.629-640dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.212363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001900187245012600206300001600332506007600348520123900424592002801663506003701691650001701728650001301745650001301758650002901771650001301800650001401813650002401827650001301851650002901864650001901893700002201912700001701934700002401951773010001975856008002075852000902155655001202164IND60083003620221207101623.0141101e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008300362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2010.11.0382doi7 aPMC30785842pmcid7 a211293582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Eric A.10aHigh-throughput fluorescence polarization assay to identify inhibitors of Cbl(TKB)–protein tyrosine kinase interactions  ap. 254-260.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) proteins play an important role in regulating signal transduction pathways by functioning as E3 ubiquitin ligases. The Cbl proteins contain a conserved tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain that binds more than a dozen proteins, including protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The cell surface expression levels of the PTKs are regulated by Cbl-mediated ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation. Dysfunction in this signaling cascade has resulted in prolonged activation of the PTKs and, therefore, has been implicated in inflammatory diseases and various cancers. Due to this negative regulatory function, Cbl has been largely ignored as a therapeutic target. However, recent studies, such as the identification of (i) gain of function c-Cbl mutations in subsets of myeloid cancer and (ii) c-Cbl as a prostate basal cell marker that correlates with poor clinical outcome, suggest otherwise. Here we report the development of a competitive high-throughput fluorescence polarization assay in a 384-well format to identify inhibitors of Cbl(TKB). The high-throughput screen readiness of the assay was demonstrated by screening the Prestwick Chemical Library.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afluorescence 3alymphoma 3amutation 3aprotein-tyrosine kinases 3aproteins 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 3atyrosine 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination1 aCharvet, Casey D.1 aLokesh, G.L.1 aNatarajan, Amarnath0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 411, no. 2 p.254-260dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2010.11.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245008500218520189600303592002802199650001302227650001402240650001602254650002802270650002002298650001402318650002002332650001302352650001302365650001302378650001502391650001702406650001902423650002002442650002502462651001402487653002302501653002002524653001402544653001402558653001502572700002602587700001802613700001902631700002102650700005702671700002302728700002702751700001902778773009302797856008602890852000902976655001202985IND60733442220221120120741.0220207e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073344222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e066612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampurna, Mahendra T.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7529-814214aThe knowledge of Indonesian pediatric residents on hyperbilirubinemia management  aHyperbilirubinemia in the newborn occurs more frequently in Indonesia. Therefore, it is important that pediatric residents in Indonesia acquire adequate knowledge of hyperbilirubinemia management. This study aims to determine the pediatric residents' knowledge on hyperbilirubinemia management, whether they follow recommended guidelines, and whether differences exist between five large Indonesian teaching hospitals. We handed out a 25-question questionnaire on hyperbilirubinemia management to pediatric residents at five teaching hospitals. A total of 250 questionnaires were filled in completely, ranging from 14 to 113 respondents per hospital. Approximately 76% of the respondents used the Kramer score to recognize neonatal jaundice. Twenty-four percent correctly plotted the total serum bilirubin levels (TSB) on the phototherapy (PT) nomograms provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for full-term and nearly full-term infants. Regarding preterm infants <35 weeks' gestational age, 66% of the respondents plotted TSB levels on the AAP nomogram, although this nomogram doesn't apply to this category of infants. Seventy percent of residents knew when to perform an exchange transfusion whereas 27% used a fixed bilirubin cut-off value of 20 mg/dL. Besides PT, 25% reported using additional pharmaceutical treatments, included albumin, phenobarbitone, ursodeoxycholic acid and immunoglobulins, while 47% of the respondents used sunlight therapy, as alternative treatment. The limited knowledge of the pediatric residents could be one factor for the higher incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and its sequelae. The limited knowledge of the residents raises doubts about the knowledge of the supervisors and the training of the residents since pediatric residents receive training from their supervisors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3acomplications (disease) 3agestational age 3ahospitals 3aimmunoglobulins 3ajaundice 3aneonates 3anomogram 3apediatrics 3aphototherapy 3aquestionnaires 3asolar radiation 3aursodeoxycholic acid 3aIndonesia 0aHyperbilirubinemia 0aNewborn infants 0aKnowledge 0aResidents 0aGuidelines1 aRohsiswatmo, Rinawati1 aPrimadi, Aris1 aWandita, Setya1 aSulistijono, Eko1 aBos, Arend F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6103-61251 aSauer, Pieter J.J.1 aHulzebos, Christian V.1 aDijk, Peter H.0 tHeliyon.g2021 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.e06661-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e066613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245015200158300001600310520093900326592002801265650002601293650002501319650002201344650002501366650002501391650001301416650001601429650001201445650001301457650003101470650001001501650002001511650001301531650002101544650001901565650004301584650002101627650002501648650001801673650001201691650002201703650001801725653003801743653001401781653001501795653002301810653001901833700001201852700001401864700001201878700001201890700001301902700001301915700001201928773012301940856007902063852000902142655001202151IND60582708920221118151307.0171006e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058270892DNAL7 a10.1139/cjps-2016-01802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, L.12aA Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene from Saussurea involucrata Kar. & Kir., SiCSD, enhances drought, cold, and oxidative stress in transgenic tobacco  ap. 816-826.  aSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) plays an important role in the stress tolerance of higher plants. In the present study, a novel Cu/Zn-SOD gene, SiCSD (accession no. KC912564), was cloned from Saussurea involucrata Kar. & Kir. The deduced amino acid sequence shared 85% identity with Cu/Zn-SOD of Solanum tuberosum L. and Solanum lycopersicum L. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that SiCSD was upregulated by treatments with cold, drought, and oxidative stresses. SiCSD transgenic tobacco plants improved tolerance to drought, freezing, and oxidative stresses and exhibited a higher survival rate, relative water content, photosynthesis efficiency, and higher activities of SODs, catalases, and ascorbate peroxidase, but lower ion leakage and malondialdehyde contents compared with the wild type. These data demonstrate that SiCSD may act as a positive regulator in drought and cold stress by reducing oxidant injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaussurea involucrata 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamino acid sequences 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acold stress 3adrought 3afreezing 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3awater content 0aSaussurea involucrata Kar. & Kir. 0aCu/Zn-SOD 0aSiCSD gene 0atransgenic tobacco 0aabiotic stress1 aSun, L.1 aZhang, L.1 aQiu, H.1 aLiu, C.1 aWang, A.1 aDeng, F.1 aZhu, J.0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 97, no. 5 p.816-826dCanadian Science Publishingx1918-18337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2016-01803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013800169300001800307520132800325592002801653650002401681650002501705650002601730650000901756650001701765650002001782650001701802650000901819650001101828650001801839650001501857650001001872650001601882650002201898650001801920650000901938650001001947650000901957650001101966650001201977651001201989651001602001700001502017700001902032773010702051856008202158852000902240655001202249IND60549223120221118155733.0160907e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054922312DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-11-14-1197-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCopes, Warren E.10aPhytophthora Species Recovered From Irrigation Reservoirs in Mississippi and Alabama Nurseries and Pathogenicity of Three New Species  ap. 1390-1395.  aFrom a survey for Phytophthora spp. in containment basins at one nursery each in Alabama and Mississippi, eight species and one taxon were recovered, with Phytophthora gonapodyides dominant in cooler months and P. hydropathica in warmer months, accounting for 39.6 and 46.6% overall recovery, respectively. Among the recoveries were P. macilentosa, P. mississippiae, and P. stricta, three new species recently described from a small lake (labeled M4) that serves as a primary water source for irrigation and to feed another irrigation pond (M5) at the Mississippi nursery. Neither of ponds M4 and M5 directly receives runoff from any production area. The three new species were tested for pathogenicity with Catharanthus roseus, Gardenia jasminoides ‘August Beauty,’ Hydrangea quercifolia ‘Semmes Beauty,’ Ilex magland ‘Oakland,’ Pieris japonica ‘Mountain Snow,’ and Rhododendron × ‘Brandi Michele Raley.’ None of the three species infected any of the test plants or became established in peat or pine bark growing media. Based on the result of pathogenicity trials as well as the field observation that none of the nine Phytophthora taxa recovered from irrigation reservoirs have caused episodic disease in the nurseries, they appear to not present a high risk to ornamental plants at those nurseries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aGardenia jasminoides 3aHydrangea quercifolia 3aIlex 3aPhytophthora 3aPieris japonica 3aRhododendron 3abark 3abasins 3agrowing media 3airrigation 3alakes 3anew species 3aornamental plants 3apathogenicity 3apeat 3aponds 3arisk 3arunoff 3asurveys 3aAlabama 3aMississippi1 aYang, Xiao1 aHong, Chuanxue0 tPlant disease.g2015 Oct., v. 99, no. 10 p.1390-1395dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-11-14-1197-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008200163300001600245500002000261520193200281592002802213596001902241596001802260596005002278650002002328650001202348650002602360650001802386650001202404650001302416650001402429650001502443650001702458650001002475650001502485650002402500650001402524700003302538700002002571773012902591856007502720852000902795655001202804IND60787121620221121005112.0220807e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078712162DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.212342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReidy, Jennifer L.10aDensity and nest survival of golden‐cheeked warblers: Spatial scale matters  ap. 678-689.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aConservation and management plans often rely on indicators such as species occupancy or density to define habitat quality, ignoring factors that influence reproductive success, and potentially limiting conservation achievements. We examined relationships between predicted density and nest survival with environmental features at multiple spatial scales for the golden‐cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) in a large preserve within an urbanizing landscape. Larger‐scale features of the forest and landscape composition best predicted density, whereas small‐scale vegetation features best predicted nest success. Predicted warbler density was more influenced by vegetation structure at the forest (100‐m) and landscape (1‐km) scales than at the plot (5–11.3‐m) scale. Predicted warbler density increased with greater woodland cover (100‐m), average canopy height (100‐m), and mixed woodland cover (1‐km). Average predicted density derived from distance sampling models fit to count data across 1,506 points surveyed during 2011–2014 was 0.21 males/ha (95% CI = 0.20–0.22). Nest survival (n = 610 nests) was strongly correlated with vegetation and terrain characteristics at the plot scale. Period nest survival decreased 28% and increased 36% and 21% across the range of slope, woody understory, and juniper basal area, respectively. Daily nest survival averaged 0.97 (0.96–0.98) but declined throughout the breeding season and varied annually (2011–2015). We recommend management for a high percentage of closed‐canopy, tall mixed juniper (Juniperus ashei)‐oak (Quercus spp.) woodland at the forest and landscape scales to support high densities of warblers. We also recommend protecting upland woodlands with a well‐developed woody understory and greater basal area of junipers because these characteristics were associated with greater nest success. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  cCity of Austin  cTravis County  cU.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station 3aJuniperus ashei 3aQuercus 3aSetophaga chrysoparia 3acanopy height 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3alandscapes 3anest success 3anests 3aunderstory 3awildlife management 3awoodlands1 aThompson, Frank R., IIIcIII1 aO'Donnell, Lisa0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2017 May, v. 81, no. 4 p.678-689dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.212343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245015600158300001500314520132300329592002801652650002201680650002501702650002301727650001401750650000901764650001001773650002101783650001201804650002401816650001301840653001101853653001401864653001101878653001101889653001001900653001801910700001901928700002601947700001501973700001701988700001202005700001202017773011902029856008202148852000902230655001202239IND60635094220221119160712.0190916e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063509422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2019.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Li10aReceptor complex and signalling pathway of the two type II IFNs, IFN-γ and IFN-γrel in mandarin fish or the so-called Chinese perch Siniperca chuatsi  ap. 98-112.  aIFN-γ, as the sole member of mammalian type II IFN, is a multifunctional cytokine which exerts its effects through two distinct IFN-γ receptors, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. However, in teleost fish, another IFN-γ homologous gene, namely IFN-γ related gene (IFN-γrel), has been identified. Although IFN-γ and IFN-γrel genes have been described in some fish species, many important aspects remain poorly understood in relation with their signalling and function. In the present study, IFN-γ and IFN-γrel, as well as their receptors, cytokine receptor family B (CRFB) 17, CRFB13, two of which are homologous to IFNGR1 in mammals, and CRFB6, homolomous to IFNGR2, have been characterized in mandarin fish, Siniperca chuatsi. It was revealed that the two type IFN members exhibit antiviral activity, and IFN-γ transduces downstream signalling through CRFB13 and CRFB6, while IFN-γrel interacts with CRFB17 to activate downstream signalling. Moreover, IFN-γ and IFN-γrel have been shown to exert antiviral biological activity in a STAT1-dependent manner. Intracellular domain analysis of CRFB17 and CRFB13 demonstrated that the Y386 tyrosine residue of CRFB13 is required for the activation of the IFN-γ-mediated biologic response, and the Y324 and Y370 residues in CRFB17 are required to activate IFN-γrel signalling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiniperca chuatsi 3aantiviral properties 3acytokine receptors 3acytokines 3afish 3agenes 3ainterferon-gamma 3amammals 3asignal transduction 3atyrosine 0aIFN-γ 0aIFN-γrel 0aCRFB17 0aCRFB13 0aCRFB6 0aMandarin fish1 aChen, Shan Nan1 aLaghari, Zubair Ahmed1 aHuang, Bei1 aHuo, Hui Jun1 aLi, Nan1 aNie, P.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2019 Aug., v. 97 p.98-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2019.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003600113040001800149100001300167245004600180300001600226500000900242520102100251592002801272650002201300650002601322650001401348650002301362650001601385650002101401650002501422650001701447650001601464650002501480650002701505650001801532650002301550650002301573650002001596650001701616650002101633650002001654651001001674700001701684700002901701700002001730700001901750700001801769700001501787700001701802700001601819700001901835773013501854852000901989856011201998856008302110961001302193655001202206IND4442437420221120075148.0191122e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444243742DNAL7 a10113/471622hdl7 a10.3198/jpr2009.09.0520crc2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, J.10aRegistration of ‘UI Winchester’ Wheat  ap. 224-227.  aepub  a‘UI Winchester’ (Reg.

This trade-off has been demonstrated in several taxa, such that males often host a greater parasite burden compared with female conspecifics. We suppressed testosterone in wild male eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) for 10 weeks using a novel gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine, Bopriva. We evaluated the impact of testosterone suppression on testes width, parameters of health, tick and worm burden in kangaroos using a before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental design. Given the potential impact of animal movement on parasite burden, core area use of a subset of males was also determined. Bopriva significantly reduced testosterone in male kangaroos as well as reducing the combined size of testes by 9.6% (P =0.01). There was no detectable effect of testosterone suppression on parasite burden and core area use in Treated kangaroos compared to Control (placebo) and Before treatment animals. Our results suggest that a duration of suppression longer than 10 weeks may be required to observe changes in parasite burden. Overall, this study provides a suitable framework for future studies to test whether reproductive hormones influence energy allocation, parasitism, and reproductive strategies in marsupials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacropus giganteus 3aenergy 3afemales 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3amales 3amammalogy 3aparasitism 3aplacebos 3atestosterone 3aticks 3avaccines 0aimmunocompetence 0akangaroo 0a<i>Macropus giganteus 0amarsupial 0aparasite burden 0asexual signals 0aticks</kwd>1 aGray, Rachael1 aHilton, Zoe J.1 aKeeley, Tamara1 aMurray, ‘Kangaroo' Phil1 aHerbert, Catherine A.0 tAustralian mammalogy.g2021, v. 44, no. 2 p.213-224dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:J000001169x0310-00497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AM210173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014500173300001400318520141800332592002801750650001901778650002901797650002501826650001101851650002001862650002201882650000901904650001601913700002101929700001801950700001801968773009101986856008502077852000902162655001202171IND60084437920221119080609.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008443792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2009.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelbron, Hendrike10aIndicators for strategic environmental assessment in regional land use planning to assess conflicts with adaptation to global climate change  ap. 90-95.  aThe paper presents the use of indicators in a site-specific assessment method for strategic environmental assessment in regional land use planning (here: SEA-REP). It is explained with the example of the state of environment indicator ‘LUCCA 4—Urban Areas at Risk of Flooding’, how SEA as a decision-aiding instrument can contribute to the prevention of conflicts with policy for adaptation to climate change. The method begins with the determination of impact factors for SEA. In the presented study, the physical impact factors of land consumption, land use change, and directed flooding were recognised. A core problem during the selection of indicators for land uses for the adaptation to climate change (here: LUCCA) and the derivation of assessment thresholds was a lack of region-wide policy objectives for the protection of land and resources. Therefore, in a second step, regional environmental orientation objectives were derived from national and EU environmental policy. A standard method for the selection of LUCCA indicators and the derivation of assessment thresholds for conflict analysis is described. Three classes of conflict classification for regional plan designations on the individual site are proposed. It is recommended that future adaptation measures of regional land use planning should be designations of specific land uses as priority areas for urban areas prone to flood risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental policy 3afloods 3aland use change 3aland use planning 3arisk 3aurban areas1 aSchmidt, Michael1 aGlasson, John1 aDownes, Nigel0 tEcological indicators.g2011 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.90-95dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2009.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245010600207300002000313520121400333592002801547650001901575650002101594650001101615650002101626650001101647650001701658650001301675650001101688650001901699700002801718700005401746700006201800700006501862700002701927773013701954856008002091852000902171655001202180IND60606148720180918000000.0180724e20180508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060614872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b021652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedström, Svante1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6496-686510aSpin Uncoupling in Chemisorbed OCCO and CO2: Two High-Energy Intermediates in Catalytic CO2 Reduction  ap. 12251-12258.  aThe production of useful compounds via the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a matter of intense research. Although the thermodynamics and kinetic barriers of CO2RR are reported in previous computational studies, the electronic structure details are often overlooked. We study two important CO2RR intermediates: ethylenedione (OCCO) and CO₂ covalently bound to cluster and slab models of the Cu(100) surface. Both molecules exhibit a near-unity negative charge as chemisorbed, but otherwise they behave quite differently, as explained by a spin-uncoupling perspective. OCCO adopts a high-spin, quartetlike geometry, allowing two covalent bonds to the surface with an average gross interaction energy of −1.82 eV/bond. The energy cost for electronically exciting OCCO– to the quartet state is 1.5 eV which is readily repaid via the formation of its two surface bonds. CO₂, conversely, retains a low-spin, doubletlike structure upon chemisorption, and its single unpaired electron forms a single covalent surface bond of −2.07 eV. The 5.0 eV excitation energy to the CO₂– quartet state is prohibitively costly and cannot be compensated for by an additional surface bond.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical bonding 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3ageometry 3amodels 3athermodynamics1 ados Santos, Egon Campos1 aLiu, Chang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0123-631X1 aChan, K.q(Karen),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6897-11081 aAbild-Pedersen, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1911-074X1 aPettersson, Lars G.

The digested protein samples are then automatically subjected to LC/MS analysis using the same HPLC system. The system was used for peptide mapping of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), known as a challenging group of therapeutic proteins for achieving complete coverage and quantitative representation of all peptides. Detailed sample preparation protocols, using an Agilent HPLC system, are described for Lys-C digestion of mAbs with intact disulfide bonds and tryptic digestion of mAbs after reduction and alkylation. The automated procedure of Lys-C digestion of nonreduced antibody, followed by postdigestion disulfide reduction, produces both the nonreduced and reduced digests that facilitate disulfide linkage analysis. The automated peptide mapping LC/MS system has great utility in preparing and analyzing multiple samples for protein characterization, identification, and quantification of posttranslational modifications during process and formulation development as well as for protein identity and quality control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3abiopharmaceuticals 3adenaturation 3adigestion 3adisulfide bonds 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apeptide mapping 3apeptides 3apost-translational modification 3aquality control1 aŚāha, Bhāvanā,1 aXiao, Gang1 aBondarenko, Pavel V.1 aZhang, Zhongqi0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 411, no. 2 p.284-291dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01478naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245007100170300001600241520046400257592002800721650001700749650001600766650002300782650001200805650001100817650001800828650000900846650001800855650001600873651001000889700002200899773014100921856005701062852000901119655001201128IND4464987620221121203017.0120418e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446498762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1982.tb00414.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamal, K.B.12aA note on decreasing absolute risk aversion among farmers in nepal  ap. 220-225.  aAttitudes toward risk are explored for a sample of rice growers on small farms in Nepal, in the context of the subjective expected utility maximisation model.

Six field trials were conducted over a 2-yr period (2014–2015) at three locations in southwestern Ontario to determine whether there is a benefit of including dicamba in a postemergence application of glyphosate at two application timings for the control of non-glyphosate-resistant weeds in Roundup Ready 2 Xtend™ soybean. Adding dicamba to glyphosate did not increase control of grass weed species. The tank mix of glyphosate and dicamba increased the control of redroot pigweed, common ragweed, common lambsquarters, and lady’s thumb by as much as 14%, 3%, 7%, and 5%, respectively, at 8 weeks after the late-postemergence application. In general, broadleaf weed density and biomass collected 6 weeks after the late-postemergence application was reduced more with dicamba applied alone or together with glyphosate than when glyphosate was applied alone early postemergence. Due to the absence of a grass herbicide, weed interference with dicamba applied alone resulted in a yield loss of 30%–33% while treatments containing glyphosate resulted in a yield loss of only 3%–7%. The tank mix of glyphosate and dicamba improved broadleaf weed control, but it should not be applied alone due to poor control of grass weeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium album 3aapplication timing 3abiomass 3abroadleaf weeds 3adicamba 3afield experimentation 3aglyphosate 3agrass weeds 3agrasses 3aherbicide resistance 3amixing 3apostemergent weed control 3asoybeans 3aOntario 0adicamba 0adicamba-resistant 0aglyphosate 0aherbicide resistance 0asoybean 0ayield 0aweeds1 aSoltani, N.1 aHooker, D.C.1 aRobinson, D.E.1 aVink, J.P.1 aSwanton, C.J.1 aSikkema, P.H.0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2017 Mar. 31, v. 97, no. 5 p.891-901dCanadian Science Publishingx1918-18337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2016-02923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011600174300001800290520056500308592002800873650002300901650002300924650002800947650001300975650001200988700001901000700002201019700002001041700006201061700005901123700006201182773012001244856008301364852000901447655001201456IND60685757120200413000000.0200306e20200219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068575712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c002352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManick, Anne-Doriane10aAccess to Fluorenones Using Benzocyclopentynone Surrogate as Partner for the [2 + 2 + 2] Cycloaddition Reaction  ap. 1894-1898.  aA convenient and versatile procedure for the straightforward synthesis of substituted fluorenones as valuable scaffolds is described under rhodium catalysis.

(Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) is a major univoltine pest of oilseed rape in many European countries. Winter oilseed rape is cultivated on several million hectares in Europe and the continuous use of pyrethroid insecticides to control pollen beetle populations has resulted in high selection pressure and subsequent development of resistance. Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in this pest is now widespread and the levels of resistance are often sufficient to result in field control failures at recommended application rates. Recently, metabolic resistance mediated by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases was implicated in the resistance of several pollen beetle populations from different European regions. Here, we have also investigated the possible occurrence of a target-site mechanism caused by modification of the pollen beetle para-type voltage-gated sodium channel gene. We detected a single nucleotide change that results in an amino acid substitution (L1014F) within the domain IIS6 region of the channel protein. The L1014F mutation, often termed kdr, has been found in several other insect pests and is known to confer moderate levels of resistance to pyrethroids. We developed a pyrosequencing-based diagnostic assay that can detect the L1014F mutation in individual beetles and tested more than 350 populations collected between 2006 and 2010 in 13 European countries. In the majority of populations tested the mutation was absent, and only samples from two countries, Denmark and Sweden, contained pollen beetles heterozygous or homozygous for the L1014F mutation. The mutation was first detected in a sample from Denmark collected in 2007 after reports of field failure using tau-fluvalinate, and has since been detected in 7 out of 11 samples from Denmark and 25 of 33 samples from Sweden. No super-kdr mutations (e.g. M918T) known to cause resistance to pyrethroids were detected. The implications of these results for resistance management strategies of pollen beetle populations in oilseed rape crops are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsect pests 3apyrethroid insecticides 3aamino acid substitution 3aBrassicogethes aeneus 3apyrethrins 3acytochrome P-450 3agenes 3aresistance management 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3apollen 3aapplication rate 3asodium channels 3acrops 3aSweden 3aDenmark 0aMeligethes aeneus1 aZimmer, Christoph T.1 aAndrews, Melanie1 aSlater, Russell1 aBass, Chris1 aEkbom, Barbara1 aGustafsson, Göran,1 aHansen, Lars Monrad1 aKristensen, Michael1 aZebitz, Claus P.W.1 aWilliamson, Martin S.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2012 July, v. 103, no. 3 p.173-180dElsevier Inc.x0048-35757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2012.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010200209300001800311520110100329592002801430650001601458650001501474650001901489650002301508650001701531650001901548650002001567650001501587650001101602700006101613700001701674700001801691700002001709700006001729773012301789856008301912852000901995655001202004IND60759806520221122020759.0211213e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075980652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c011362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScoppola, Ernesto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6390-052X10aInvestigating the Conformation of Surface-Adsorbed Proteins with Standing-Wave X-ray Fluorescence  ap. 5195-5203.  aProtein adsorption to surfaces is at the heart of numerous technological and bioanalytical applications, but sometimes, it is also associated with medical risks. To deepen our insights into processes involving layers of surface-adsorbed proteins, high-resolution structural information is essential. Here, we use standing-wave X-ray fluorescence (SWXF) in combination with an optimized liquid-cell setup to investigate the underwater conformation of the random-coiled phosphoprotein β-casein adsorbed to hydrophilic and hydrophobized solid surfaces. The orientation of the protein, as determined through the distributions of sulfur and phosphorus, is found to be sensitive to the chemical nature of the substrate. While no preferred orientations are observed on hydrophobized surfaces, on hydrophilic Al oxide, β-casein is adsorbed as a diblock copolymer with the phosphorylated domain I attached to the surface. Our results demonstrate that targeting biologically relevant chemical elements with SWXF enables a detailed investigation of biomolecular layers under near-physiological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3acomposite polymers 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3aphosphoproteins 3aphosphorus 3asulfur1 aGochev, Georgi G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5033-31941 aDrnec, Jakub1 aPithan, Linus1 aNovikov, Dmitri1 aSchneck, Emanuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9769-21940 tBiomacromolecules.g2021 Nov. 23, v. 22, no. 12 p.5195-5203dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c011363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245016400175520124500339592002801584650001601612650001401628651000901642653001601651653002501667653002401692653001701716653000901733700006001742700001801802700002901820700001801849773009301867856008601960852000902046655001202055IND60733442920221120053642.0220207e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073344292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e066722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoseini, Akramsadat10aQualitative exploration of the factors influencing the use of dietary supplements in Iranian women: introduction to areas of focus for developing interventions  aLiterature shows that the consumption of Dietary Supplements (DS) is more common in Iran.

After the first round of the interviews was done, we performed content analysis of the data and continued up to data saturation. Two main themes including personal factors (with 5 subthemes including sociodemographic characteristics, perceived benefits of DS, history of illness, physiological conditions, and lifestyle factors) and socio-economic factors (with 3 subthemes including subjective norms, the price of food and commercial considerations of the sectors involved in the production and sale of DS) emerged as the experiences of the participants as to the intake of DS. These variables may suggest areas which need to be focused on for performing more effective interventions to affect appropriate consumption of DS in Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood prices 3alifestyle 3aIran 0aExperiences 0aQualitative research 0aDietary supplements 0aDeterminants 0aIran1 aDehdari, Tahereh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5670-30771 aSolhi, Mahnaz1 aRahideh, Seyedeh Tayebeh1 aJanani, Leila0 tHeliyon.g2021 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.e06672-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e066723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012400163300001600287520164600303592002801949650002201977650002101999650001602020650001202036650001402048650001202062650001002074650001502084650001502099650001202114650002702126651001002153651001102163700001702174700002102191773016502212856007302377852000902450655001202459IND60438718820221120032727.0151023e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043871882DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.126392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Gethin M. V.10aPatterns of reproductive isolation within and between two Lygaeus species characterized by sexual conflicts over mating  ap. 890-901.  aTheory suggests that, under some circumstances, sexual conflict over mating can lead to divergent sexually antagonistic coevolution among populations for traits associated with mating, and that this can promote reproductive isolation and hence speciation. However, sexual conflict over mating may also select for traits (e.g. male willingness to mate) that enhance gene flow between populations, limiting population divergence. In the present study, we compare pre‐ and post‐mating isolation within and between two species characterized by male–female conflict over mating rate. We quantify sexual isolation among five populations of the seed bug Lygaeus equestris collected from Italy and Sweden, and two replicates of a population of the sister‐species Lygaeus simulans, also collected from Italy. We find no evidence of reproductive isolation amongst populations of L. equestris, suggesting that sexual conflict over mating has not led to population divergence in relevant mating traits in L. equestris. However, there was strong asymmetric pre‐mating isolation between L. equestris and L. simulans: male L. simulans were able to mate successfully with female L. equestris, whereas male L. equestris were largely unable to mate with female L. simulans. We found little evidence for strong post‐mating isolation between the two species, however, with hybrid F₂ offspring being produced. Our results suggest that sexual conflict over mating has not led to population divergence, and indeed perhaps supports the contrary theoretical prediction that male willingness to mate may retard speciation by promoting gene flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLygaeus equestris 3aLygaeus simulans 3acoevolution 3afemales 3agene flow 3ahybrids 3amales 3apopulation 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3areproductive isolation 3aItaly 3aSweden1 aNowlan, Toby1 aShuker, David M.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 Dec., v. 116, no. 4 p.890-901dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.126393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04581naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245005600160300001800216520296100234592002803195650001803223650001903241650002303260650001103283650002703294650001703321650002803338650001303366650000903379650001903388650000903407650001903416650001803435650001303453650001903466650000703485650002303492650002303515650001303538650001403551650001903565650002003584650001203604650001703616650001103633653001103644653000703655653001303662653003603675700002003711700001903731773015403750856007803904852000903982655001203991IND60539597520221120230119.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053959752DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-96432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzcan, Tulay10aYogurt made from milk heated at different pH values  ap. 6749-6758.  aMilk for yogurt manufacture is subjected to high heat treatment to denature whey proteins. Low milk pH values (≤6.5) at heating result in most denatured whey proteins becoming associated with casein micelles, whereas high milk pH values (≥7.0) at heating result in the formation of mostly soluble (nonmicellar) denatured whey protein complexes. There are conflicting reports on the relative importance of soluble and casein-bound whey protein aggregates on the properties of acid gels. Prior studies investigating the effect of pH of milk at heating used model gels in which milk was acidified by glucono-δ-lactone; in this study, we prepared yogurt gels using commercial starter cultures. Model acid gels can have very different texture and physical properties from those made by fermentation with starter cultures. In this study, we investigated the effects of different pH values of milk at heating on the rheological, light backscatter, and microstructural properties of yogurt gels. Reconstituted skim milk was adjusted to pH values 6.2, 6.7, and 7.2 and heated at 85°C for 30 min. A portion of the heated milk samples was readjusted back to pH 6.7 after heating. Milks were inoculated with 3% (wt/wt) yogurt starter culture and incubated at 40°C until pH 4.6. Gel formation was monitored using dynamic oscillatory rheology, and parameters measured included the storage modulus (G′) and loss tangent (LT) values. Light-backscattering properties, such as the backscatter ratio (R) and the first derivative of light backscatter ratio (R′), were also monitored during fermentation. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe gel microstructure. The G′ values at pH 4.6 were highest in gels made from milk heated at pH 6.7 and lowest in milk heated at pH 6.2, with or without pH adjustment after heating. The G′ values at pH 4.6 were lower in samples after adjustment back to pH 6.7 after heating. No maximum in the LT parameter was observed during gelation for yogurts made from milk heated at pH 6.2; a maximum in LT was observed at pH ~4.8 for samples heated at pH 6.7 or 7.2, with or without pH adjustment after heating. Higher R-values were observed with an increase in pH of heating, with or without pH adjustment after heating. The sample heated at pH 6.2 had only one major peak in its R′ profile during acidification, whereas samples heated at pH 6.7 and 7.2 had 2 large peaks. The lack of a maximum in LT parameter and the presence of a single peak in the R′ profile for the samples heated at pH 6.2 were likely due to the partial solubilization of insoluble calcium phosphate when milk was acidified to this lower pH value. No clear differences were observed in the microstructures of gels between the different treatments. This study indicates that heating milk at the natural pH (~6.7) created an optimum balance of casein-bound and soluble denatured whey proteins, which resulted in yogurt with the highest gel stiffness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aacidified milk 3acalcium phosphates 3acasein 3acultured milk starters 3afermentation 3afluorescence microscopy 3agelation 3agels 3agluconolactone 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3amanufacturing 3amicelles 3amicrostructure 3apH 3aprotein aggregates 3areconstituted milk 3arheology 3askim milk 3asolubilization 3astorage modulus 3atexture 3awhey protein 3ayogurt 0ayogurt 0apH 0arheology 0alight-backscattering properties1 aHorne, David S.1 aLucey, John A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Oct., v. 98, no. 10 p.6749-6758dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-96433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007500162300001600237500002000253520146100273592002801734596005101762650002301813650001201836650001101848650001201859650000901871650001001880650001301890650001401903650001001917650001401927650001201941650002501953650001301978651001401991700002702005700002202032700002202054700002102076700002102097700001902118700002402137700002302161773012902184856007502313852000902388655001202397IND60787122420221120192622.0220807e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078712242DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.212322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollard, Carla J.10aRemoval of an exotic fish influences amphibian breeding site selection  ap. 720-727.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFor pond‐breeding species, the distribution of larvae is a reflection of habitat suitability and adult breeding site selection. Some species preferentially breed in ephemeral ponds, which can provide benefits for larvae. An alternative strategy used by adults to increase offspring survival is to detect aquatic predators and avoid them when selecting breeding sites. We investigated whether either of these types of breeding site selection are contributing to the negative correlation between the distributions of tadpoles of the threatened green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) and the introduced eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) in Sydney, Australia. From 2003 to 2012 we drained ponds to temporarily remove gambusia and examined the effect of removal on the numbers of male, female, and juvenile frogs, and tadpoles. We found that males preferentially selected fish‐free ponds as breeding sites. In addition, the removal of gambusia increased tadpole abundance to over 140 times that of an undrained pond. Pond draining did not influence female or juvenile abundances. The ability to detect and avoid gambusia may be mitigating the effect of predation to a certain extent. We conclude that pond draining to remove exotic fish is an effective strategy that can be used to greatly increase the reproductive success of this and potentially other threatened amphibian species in the presence of exotic predators. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  aLP0989459cAustralian Research Council Linkage 3aGambusia holbrooki 3aLitoria 3aadults 3afemales 3afish 3afrogs 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amales 3apredation 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3atadpoles 3aAustralia1 aStockwell, Michelle P.1 aBower, Deborah S.1 aGarnham, James I.1 aPickett, Evan J.1 aDarcovich, Kerry1 aO'meara, Jenny1 aClulow, J.q(John),1 aMahony, Michael J.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2017 May, v. 81, no. 4 p.720-727dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.212323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245010800162300002000270520118400290592002801474650002301502650002201525650001501547650001601562650001401578650001501592650002601607650002101633700001401654700002001668700001401688700001601702700001601718700001601734700005601750700001601806700001401822700001701836700001801853700005501871700001601926700005501942773013701997856008002134852000902214655001202223IND60606149220221120155417.0180724e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060614922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b021802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Huanli10aIn Situ Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction and Raman Spectroscopy Studies of Gd@C82–S8 under High Pressure  ap. 10992-10998.  aThe structural transformation and mechanical properties of fullerenes under high pressure have attracted a significant interest. However, the research data on the large-cage endohedral metallofullerenes are still rare. Here, we first report high-pressure studies on a new cocrystal Gd@C₈₂–S₈ by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The high-pressure XRD data and Raman findings provide consistent evidence of no structural phase transition in Gd@C₈₂–S₈ before a pressure-induced irreversible amorphization at about 23 GPa and an anisotropic deformation of the C₈₂ cage upon compression. The bulk modules is as high as 44 GPa and the embedded Gd atom has a great effect on the pressure behavior of Gd@C₈₂, especially on the restraint of the compression of the adjacent bonds. The assignment of Raman-active vibrational modes and their corresponding eigenvectors of Gd@C₈₂ are presented for the first time by the theoretical calculation. Our findings provide new insights into the structural transformation of metallofullerenes under pressure and even contribute to prepare desired carbon materials with new structures and properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanisotropy 3adeformation 3afullerene 3agadolinium 3amechanical properties 3aphase transition1 aCheng, Hu1 aGao, Xuejiao J.1 aLi, Cheng1 aCui, Rongli1 aHuang, Huan1 aGuo, Xihong1 aLi, Xiaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2290-11981 aZhang, Lele1 aLiu, Bing1 aXu, Binggang1 aDong, Jinquan1 aGao, Xingfa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1636-63361 aLi, Yanchun1 aSun, Baoyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1542-46420 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 May 01, v. 122, no. 20 p.10992-10998dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b021803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012500174300001600299520149100315592002801806650002901834650002101863650001701884650001101901650001501912650003001927650002501957650001401982650003501996650001102031650001302042650001802055650001302073650002202086650000902108650001502117650001502132651001202147651001402159700002602173700002102199700001702220700001902237700002002256700002302276773009302299856008502392852000902477655001202486IND60084438720221119080734.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008443872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2009.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurkhard, Benjamin10aEcosystem based modeling and indication of ecological integrity in the German North Sea—Case study offshore wind parks  ap. 168-174.  aHuman exploitation and use of marine and coastal areas are apparent and growing in many regions of the world. For instance, fishery, shipping, military, raw material exploitation, nature protection and the rapidly expanding offshore wind power technology are competing for limited resources and space. The development and implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) strategies could help to solve these problems. Therefore, suitable spatial assessment, modeling, planning and management tools are urgently needed. These tools have to deal with data that include complex information on different spatial and temporal scales. A systematic approach based on the development of future scenarios which are assessed by combining different simulation models, GIS methods and an integrating set of ecological integrity indicators, was applied in a case study in the German North Sea. Here, the installation of huge offshore wind parks within the near future is planned. The aim was to model environmental effects of altered sea-use patterns on marine biota. Indicators of ecological integrity were used to assess altering conditions and possible ecosystem shifts ranging from systems’ degradations to the development of highly productive and diverse artificial reef systems. The results showed that some ecosystem processes and properties and related indicators are sensitive to changes generated by offshore wind park installations while others did not react as hypothesized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aartificial reefs 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental models 3afisheries 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3aplanning 3araw materials 3ashipping 3asimulation models 3awind 3awind farms 3awind power 3aGermany 3aNorth Sea1 aOpitz, Sílvia C.

Earthworms were sampled by a combination of formaldehyde extraction and hand sorting. Density data were analysed by combining correspondence analysis (CA) and null model analyses of niche overlap patterns and morphological trait dispersion. The first axis of the CA arranged samples according to the pasture ageing gradient and separated “pioneer” (CA1−) from “old pasture” (CA1+) species assemblages. The second axis segregated two different assemblages (CA2− and CA2+) that were consistently represented along the ageing gradient and was assumed to represent intra-plot assemblage heterogeneity. Niche overlap according to soil organic C, C:N ratio and root biomass was higher than expected by chance (EBC) in most assemblages, and was higher when calculated for the whole regional species pool than for local assemblages. Morphological dispersion was random or lower than expected by chance for the regional species pool and both CA1− and CA1+, and higher than expected by chance for both CA2− and CA2+. These results indicate that: (1) habitat and dispersal constraints act as filters by allowing only those species with similar prerequisite traits into assemblages; (2) inter-specific competition limit composition in a further step by calling for a minimal level of overdispersion in morphological traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aearthworms 3afilters 3aformaldehyde 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific competition 3apastures 3asoil organic carbon 3asorting 3aFrance1 aMargerie, P.1 aRenault, J.1 aBureau, F.1 aAubert, M.1 aHedde, M.0 tActa oecologica.g2011 , v. 37, no. 3 p.212-219dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2011.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03702naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008900162300001600251500002000267520229900287592002802586596006202614596006302676596006402739650002402803650001502827650001202842650001002854650002402864650002202888650001902910650001102929650001202940650001602952650002402968700002002992700002303012700002003035773012903055856007503184852000903259655001203268IND60787122520221120213959.0220807e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078712252DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.212282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, Bryan S.10aStructural uncertainty limits generality of fall harvest strategies for wild turkeys  ap. 617-628.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations are broadly distributed, occupy a variety of habitats, and have demographic rates that are heterogeneous through space and time. Dynamics of turkey populations are sensitive to the magnitude of fall either‐sex harvest, yet there have been few attempts to study performance of fall harvests systematically across a range of plausible demographic scenarios. Thus robustness of existing recommendations to structural uncertainty in population dynamics is marginally understood. We used a stochastic, sex‐specific theta‐logistic model to simulate performance of fall harvests (0–15%) across scenarios representing uncertainty about current rates of population productivity (3 levels), female losses during spring hunting (2 levels), and spring male harvest (3 levels), with uncertainty in the strength of density dependence as a common attribute. We demonstrated that performance of previously recommended fall harvests was not robust to changes in demographic parameters that occur within and among populations, and thus previous management recommendations may not be appropriate for all regions. Fall harvest rates capable of maintaining large populations with high probability varied from 0–6% with changes to population productivity, when median male and female spring harvests were 30% and 5%, respectively. In general, risks and management tradeoffs accompanying fall harvests were tightly linked to assumed values of population parameters, where changes to productivity and female loss had particularly strong effects on management outcomes. Specifically, reduced productivity or increased female loss decreased the ability to maintain large populations for a given fall harvest rate. Thus, fall harvest recommendations deduced from models that considered only a small portion of the demographic parameter space may not meet modern management objectives over a broader range of conditions. Moreover, our results suggest that future management could be improved by reducing structural uncertainty about turkey demography to allow for region‐specific harvest strategies, or by using decision‐theoretic approaches to identify harvest strategies that are robust to uncertainty about population parameters. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  cBoone and Crockett Endowment at Michigan State University  cQuantitative Fisheries Center at Michigan State University  cMichigan Department of Natural Resources, Wildlife Division 3aMeleagris gallopavo 3ademography 3afemales 3amales 3apopulation dynamics 3asimulation models 3aspace and time 3aspring 3aturkeys 3auncertainty 3awildlife management1 aBence, James R.1 aPorter, William F.1 aParent, Chad J.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2017 May, v. 81, no. 4 p.617-628dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.212283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245020600171300001600377520098200393592002801375650001401403650001201417650001901429650002101448650001801469650001101487650003201498650002301530650001501553653001801568653001801586653003201604653002501636700002701661700002301688773010101711856008401812852000901896655001201905IND60125789220221120125142.0150428e20150503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012578922DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9893942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiryaei, Marzieh10aFast determination of Ziziphora tenuior L. essential oil by inorganic–organic hybrid material based on ZnO nanoparticles anchored to a composite made from polythiophene and hexagonally ordered silica  ap. 833-837.  aIn this paper, for the first time, an inorganic–organic hybrid material based on ZnO nanoparticles was anchored to a composite made from polythiophene and hexagonally ordered silica (ZnO/PT/SBA-15) for use in solid-phase fibre microextraction (SPME) of medicinal plants. A homemade SPME apparatus was used for the extraction of volatile components of Ziziphora tenuior L. A simplex method was used for optimisation of five different parameters affecting the efficiency of the extraction. The main constituents extracted by ZnO/PT/SBA-15 and PDMS fibres and hydrodistillation (HD) methods, respectively, included pulegone (51.25%, 53.64% and 56.68%), limonene (6.73%, 6.58% and 8.3%), caryophyllene oxide (5.33%, 4.31% and 4.53%) and 1,8-cineole (4.21%, 3.31% and 3.18%). In comparison with the HD method, the proposed technique could equally monitor almost all the components of the sample, in an easier way, in a shorter time and requiring a much lower amount of the sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZiziphora 3acineole 3aessential oils 3amedicinal plants 3ananoparticles 3asilica 3asolid phase microextraction 3avolatile compounds 3azinc oxide 0aZnO/PT/SBA-15 0ananoparticles 0asolid phase microextraction 0aZiziphora tenuior L.1 aAbolghasemi, Mir Mahdi1 aNazemiyeh, Hossein0 tNatural product research.g2015 May 3, v. 29, no. 9 p.833-837dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2014.9893943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012400175520160000299592002801899650002301927650001601950650001501966650001301981650001601994650001902010650002102029650002002050650001402070650001302084651000902097653002102106653002402127653001602151653002702167773009302194856008602287852000902373655001202382IND60727961220221118030239.0220315e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072796122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e059812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNejatzadeh, Fatemeh10aEffect of silver nanoparticles on salt tolerance of Satureja hortensis l. during in vitro and in vivo germination tests  aThis study to evaluate the effects of silver nanoparticles on the salinity tolerance of (Satureja hortensis L.). The study done based on factorial experiment using a completely randomized design, in a laboratory and greenhouse in Islamic Azad University of Khoy, Iran in 2015. Silver nanoparticles concentrations were 0, 40, 60, and 80 ppm and salt concentrations 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 mM l⁻¹. Germination seeds of Satureja hortensis were counted twice a day for 14 days at laboratory. Then seedling transferred to the greenhouse and their growth continued. Traits measured were seedling weight, seedling lengths, germination rates, germination averages, germination potentials, and percentages of germination. Results showed that the silver nanoparticles improved significantly germination average; plants shoot length and increased plants resistance to salinity. Results showed that a significant reduction in germination percent and seedling growth due to the salinity stress while significantly increased with nano-particles application. In control treatment (without silver nanoparticle) and low level of salinity (0 mM l⁻¹) increased seed germination percentage, while the high levels of salinity inhibited the seed germination significantly. The results showed that the effect of silver nanoparticles was significant on germination percentage in P ≤ 0.05. Overall, application of silver nanoparticles was beneficial in improving salinity tolerance in the S. hortensis seedling and its application may stimulate the differences defense mechanisms of plants against salt toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSatureja hortensis 3agreenhouses 3ananosilver 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3atoxicity 3aIran 0aGermination rate 0aSalinity resistance 0aNano-silver 0a(Satureja hortensis L)0 tHeliyon.g2021 Feb., v. 7, no. 2 p.e05981-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e059813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245015000170300001600320520141100336592002801747650001501775650002601790650002701816650001601843650001601859650001001875650002301885650001801908650001201926650001201938650002601950650002301976650001301999650001002012700002402022700002302046700002402069700002002093700002002113700003502133700002302168773010002191856008002291852000902371655001202380IND60083004720221119183800.0141101e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008300472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2011.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmerman, Laura B.10aAbsorbance-based assay for membrane disruption by antimicrobial peptides and synthetic copolymers using pyrroloquinoline quinone-loaded liposomes  ap. 194-199.  aA simple homogeneous assay for the detection of membrane permeabilization by antimicrobial peptides and synthetic copolymers is described. Liposomes encapsulating pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), the prosthetic group of the apoenzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), are used to detect membrane permeabilization by the antimicrobial peptides MSI-594 and MSI-78 as well as various synthetic antimicrobial copolymers in an optical microwell assay. PQQ-loaded liposomes and the peptide or copolymer are added to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. If the integrity of the liposome is compromised, the PQQ encapsulated in the liposomes is released and available for activating the apoenzyme. The release of PQQ catalyzes a color change in the presence of apo-GDH, glucose, and the redox dye 1,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) that can be evaluated through a visual color change. For more quantitative measurements, the absorbance change over a 30min period was measured. The absorbance change is related to the activity and concentration for a given antimicrobial agent. Furthermore, by varying liposome compositions to include cholesterol, the potential toxicity of the peptide or polymer toward mammalian cells can be readily evaluated. The assay is simple and sensitive and will be useful for analyzing the membrane permeation/disruption properties of a host of antimicrobial peptides and synthetic polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aanti-infective agents 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aapoproteins 3acholesterol 3acolor 3acomposite polymers 3aencapsulation 3aglucose 3amammals 3aquantitative analysis 3asynthetic peptides 3atoxicity 3awells1 aWorley, Brittany V.1 aPalermo, Edmund F.1 aBrender, Jeffrey R.1 aLee, Kyung-Dall1 aKuroda, Kenichi1 aRamamoorthy, A.q(Ayyalusamy),1 aMeyerhoff, Mark E.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 411, no. 2 p.194-199dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011500162300001800277520208800295592002802383650002602411650001302437650001102450650001902461650001502480650001902495650002602514650002102540650001202561650001302573650001002586650001402596650001502610650001602625650001902641650002102660653002002681653002302701653001502724653001402739700002202753700001802775773015402793856007802947852000903025655001203034IND60539597720221120230207.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053959772DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-96952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarthy, M.M.10aAssociations between hepatic metabolism of propionate and palmitate in liver slices from transition dairy cows  ap. 7015-7024.  aMultiparous Holstein cows (n=95) were used to evaluate changes in hepatic propionate and palmitate metabolism and liver composition over time during the transition period, along with the relationships of these variables with cumulative increases in nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate during the periparturient period. Data from 3 previous experiments were used to address the study objectives, accounting for a total of 95 multiparous Holstein cows. Liver slices from biopsies on d −21, 1, and 21 relative to parturition were used to determine conversion of [1-14C]palmitate to CO2 and esterified products (EP) and the conversion of [1-14C]propionate to CO2 and glucose. Hepatic glycogen content was highest on d −21 and was 26.9 and 36.5% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, respectively. Liver triglyceride content was lowest at d −21 and was 271 and 446% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, respectively. We detected no difference in the capacity for the liver to oxidize [1-14C]palmitate to CO2 between d −21 and d 1; however, on d 21, oxidation was 84% of prepartum values. The capacity of the liver to convert [1-14C]palmitate to EP was 148 and 139% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, respectively. The capacity of liver to convert [1-14C]propionate to CO2 was 127 and 83% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, and the capacity of liver to convert [1-14C]propionate to glucose was 126 and 85% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, respectively. Correlation relationships suggest that overall, cows with elevated prepartum liver triglyceride content had elevated triglycerides throughout the transition period along with increased [1-14C]palmitate oxidation and conversion to EP and a decreased propensity to convert [1-14C]propionate to glucose. Cows with increased [1-14C]propionate oxidation had increased conversion of [1-14C]propionate to glucose throughout the transition period. Overall, conditions that lead to impairments in fatty acid metabolism during the transition period appear to be associated with impaired postpartum hepatic propionate metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aHolstein 3abiopsy 3acarbon dioxide 3adairy cows 3aesterification 3afatty acid metabolism 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aliver 3aoxidation 3apalmitates 3aparturition 3apropionic acid 3atriacylglycerols 0aearly lactation 0ahepatic metabolism 0apropionate 0apalmitate1 aPiepenbrink, M.S.1 aOverton, T.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Oct., v. 98, no. 10 p.7015-7024dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-96953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245013200212300002000344520167000364592002802034650000802062650001602070650001502086650001202101650001902113650001202132650001902144650001002163650001402173651001102187653001302198653002302211653001002234653002102244653002002265700001702285700002202302700006602324773014202390856008002532852000902612655001202621IND60753913420221116182448.0211020e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075391342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c040422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Stephanie R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6518-060X10aAir Quality Data Approach for Defining Wildfire Influence: Impacts on PM₂.₅, NO₂, CO, and O₃ in Western Canadian Cities  ap. 13709-13717.  aAs the climate warms, it is recognized that wildfires are increasing in size and frequency. The negative effects of wildfires on air quality are well documented, especially on commonly monitored atmospheric pollutants such as PM₂.₅, NO₂, CO, and O₃. However, it is not clear how frequently wildfires influence urban air quality and the size of that influence relative to traffic and industrial pollutants. To understand the impact of wildfires on air quality, we have established an automated method to identify wildfire-influenced ambient air measurements. The trajectory-fire interception method (TFIM) compares hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) back-trajectories from an air quality monitoring station to satellite imagery of fire “hot-spots” to determine the number of trajectory-fire interceptions that occur. From the number of interceptions and local PM₂.₅ measurements, we have defined a wildfire-influenced period to occur if the interception count is ≥20. TFIM wildfire identification compares favorably with Environment and Climate Change Canada’s smoke forecast, FireWork, and with the BlueSky trajectory-based forecast. Using TFIM, we studied the impact of wildfire-influenced periods on PM₂.₅, NO₂, CO, and O₃ from 2001 to 2019 in Western Canadian urban areas. We show that wildfire-influenced periods have elevated concentrations of PM₂.₅, NO₂, and CO but not O₃. We show that a decreasing urban baseline of CO and NO₂ over time results in a relatively greater impact of wildfires on these pollutants, which emphasizes the changing relative importance of wildfires on air quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3aautomation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahybrids 3aremote sensing 3asmoke 3awildfires 3aCanada 0awildfire 0aparticulate matter 0aozone 0anitrogen dioxide 0acarbon monoxide1 aLee, Kristyn1 aSantos, Guadalupe1 aAbbatt, Jonathan P.

In addition, based on the review it points out the bottlenecks and future trends of these three technology categories. Major progress in the shake-and-catch method is related to theoretical studies on the effective removal of apples and catching mechanisms to minimize bruising. The unacceptable bruising conditions hinder the shake-and-catch method from commercial application. Two startups of apple harvesting robots are in the stage of commercializing their products based on vacuum and three-finger end-effectors, respectively. Economic benefits, as well as technology reliability and robustness of both robots, are pending for validation before they are on the market. In addition, a key obstacle faced by both robots before commercial use is to find a solution to pick apples grown in clusters. Harvest-assist platforms are gradually adopted by apple growers, but at a very low rate due to their doubts on economic benefits. Validation of harvest-assist platforms’ economic benefits and incorporation with more functions (e.g., sorting) would enhance their adoption. With the rapid development of sensing and automation technologies, such as novel sensors, embedded systems, and machine learning algorithms, and the progress in new tree canopy structures that are friendlier for fruit visibility and accessibility, it is believed the robots for fresh market apple harvest would be realized and commercialized in the near future. Currently, more efforts should be invested in analyzing and validating the economic benefits of harvest-assist platforms, as well as adding more functions to the harvest-assist platforms, to increase their application rate for the benefit of the apple industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aapples 3aapplication rate 3aautomation 3acanopy 3aelectronics 3afresh market 3afruits 3aindustry 3amarkets 3amechanical harvesting 3aresearch and development 3atrees 0aApple harvest 0aShake-and-catch 0aInfield sorting 0aHarvest-assist platform 0aMechanization 0aRobots1 aIgathinathane, C.1 aLi, J.1 aCen, H.1 aLu, Y.1 aFlores, P.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2020 Aug., v. 175 p.105606-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.1056063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010600170300001800276500002000294520167900314592002801993596002902021596003902050596011402089596002902203596003302232596002602265650002002291650002102311650001302332650002302345650002302368650001002391650002102401650001402422650002502436650001602461700002002477700002002497700002102517773013502538856008302673852000902756655001202765IND60786300320221119155143.0220803e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078630032DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2019.02.01352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaurent, Anabelle12aA Framework for Visualization and Analysis of Agronomic Field Trials from On‐Farm Research Networks  ap. 2712-2723.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn on‐farm research network is an organization of farmers that conducts agronomic experiments under local conditions. It is common that an elementary statistical analysis be conducted for individual studies. However, there is unexplored potential in detecting yield response variability patterns for better decision making. We developed a data‐analytics framework and web‐application program that allows users to analyze multiple studies that use a common protocol and can identify the conditions where an imposed treatment may or may not be effective. The development of this data‐analytics framework is needed to improve predictions at the farm level that can lead to more cost‐effective, sustainable and environmentally sound agricultural production. Data visualization is an important part of data‐analytics. In this paper, we have developed and tested a Bayesian hierarchical model that can be used to assess the general agronomic performance of different management practices. Decision making related to new management practices should be based on the complete evidence, local conditions and economic considerations. The web‐application includes dynamic data visualization features to enhance communication and sharing of information with the goal to reach a broader audience. Core Ideas We develop a data‐analytics framework and web‐application for on‐farm research trials. A Bayesian hierarchical model quantifies the uncertainty in yield response. The model helps assess alternative practices, products, and technologies among trial locations. The framework provides a reactive break‐even economic analysis of alternative management practices.  aPublisher supplied data  cIowa Soybean Association  aANR‐11‐LABX‐0034cLabEx BASC  cChateaubriand Fellowship of the Office for Science & Technology of the Embassy of France in the United States  cPlant Sciences Institute  cIowa Soybean Research Center  cIowa State University 3aBayesian theory 3aagronomic traits 3aagronomy 3acost effectiveness 3adata visualization 3afarms 3aon-farm research 3aprotocols 3astatistical analysis 3auncertainty1 aKyveryga, Peter1 aMakowski, David1 aMiguez, Fernando0 tAgronomy journal.g2019 Nov., v. 111, no. 6 p.2712-2723dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2019.02.01353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245012900209300001600338520185600354592002802210650001602238650001202254650001502266650001502281650000902296650002002305650001202325650002402337650001302361650002202374650001302396650001402409700002602423700006802449700002302517700005902540773010402599856008202703852000902785655001202794IND60631461220221120134725.0190512e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063146122DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-018-2656-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Anna Mette1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1162-859210aStudies on acid stability and solid-phase block synthesis of peptide–peptoid hybrids: ligands for formyl peptide receptors  ap. 205-218.  aα-Peptoids as well as peptide/α-peptoid hybrids and peptide/β-peptoid hybrids constitute major classes of proteolytically stable peptidomimetics that have been extensively investigated as mimetics of biologically active peptides. Representatives of lipidated peptide/β-peptoid hybrids have been identified as promising immunomodulatory lead compounds, and hence access to these via protocols suitable for gram-scale synthesis is warranted to enable animal in vivo studies. Recent observations indicated that several byproducts appear in crude mixtures of relatively short benzyl-based peptide/β-peptoid oligomers, and that these were most predominant when the β-peptoid units displayed an α-chiral benzyl side chain. This prompted an investigation of their stability under acidic conditions. Simultaneous deprotection and cleavage of peptidomimetics containing either α-chiral α- or β-peptoid residues required treatment with strong acid only for a short time to minimize the formation of partially debenzylated byproducts. The initial work on peptide/β-peptoid oligomers with an alternating design established that it was beneficial to form the amide bond between the carboxyl group of the α-amino acid and the congested amino functionality of the β-peptoid residue in solution. To further simplify oligomer assembly on solid phase, we now present a protocol for purification-free solid-phase synthesis of tetrameric building blocks. Next, syntheses of peptidomimetic ligands via manual solid-phase methodologies involving tetrameric building blocks were found to give more readily purified products as compared to those obtained with dimeric building blocks. Moreover, the tetrameric building blocks could be utilized in automated synthesis with microwave-assisted heating, albeit the purity of the crude products was not increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aanimals 3aautomation 3abyproducts 3aheat 3ain vivo studies 3aligands 3amicrowave treatment 3amoieties 3apeptide receptors 3apeptides 3aprotocols1 aSkovbakke, Sarah Line1 aChristensen, Simon Bendt1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5229-21271 aPerez-Gassol, Iris1 aFranzyk, Henrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2822-19270 tAmino acids.g2019 Feb., v. 51, no. 2 p.205-218dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-018-2656-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100006200190245006700252300001600319506007600335520162900411592002802040506003702068650001802105650001902123650001202142650001502154650002302169650001102192650003202203650001302235650001202248650001802260650002502278650002402303650002302327651001802350651001002368653001902378653001602397653001902413653001302432653002402445700002402469700003002493700003302523700003102556700002602587700005902613700002902672773014302701856008302844852000902927655001202936IND60612614820221207100435.0190417e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061261482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijvsm.2018.07.0032doi7 aPMC62863932pmcid7 a305645872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMota-Rojas, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0562-036710aTeaching animal welfare in veterinary schools in Latin America  ap. 131-140.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is a high demand for a veterinary education in animal welfare (AW) with different approaches from the academic, society and trade points of view. Latin American (LA) countries members of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) are under the urge and should be obligated to teach AW. The aims of this article are to analyze the current drives of change on the importance of teaching animal welfare in LA, the competences recommended from international education organizations for the region, and to provide the contents on the curriculum in AW that a future veterinarian should achieve in the LA scenario, in other words to examine why teaching AW, what should be taught and how. Despite significant advances in introducing AW into veterinary training programs, much remains to be done regarding the future of this field in teaching veterinary science in Spain and LA countries, and in including this science as an independent course in programs at distinct levels to integrate the scientific, ethical and legal aspects of AW. This paper presents a proposal that was constructed with a view towards integrating diverse curricular approaches based on criteria, contents and concepts provided by the researchers and professors who collaborated in the book entitled: Bienestar Animal: Una Visión Global en Iberoamerica [Animal Welfare: A Global Vision in Ibero-America]. To ensure veterinary students will be better equipped to graduate with OIE day 1 competencies in AW, teaching approaches are needed that support project-based learning and gamification, critical thinking, reflection and collaborative learning.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal health 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3acurriculum 3aeducation programs 3aethics 3ainternational organizations 3alearning 3asociety 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary education 3aveterinary medicine 3aveterinary schools 3aLatin America 3aSpain 0aAnimal welfare 0aStudy plans 0aStudy programs 0aTeaching 0aVeterinary medicine1 aOrihuela, Agustín,1 aStrappini-Asteggiano, Ana1 aNelly Cajiao-Pachón, María1 aAgüera-Buendía, Estrella1 aMora-Medina, Patricia1 aGhezzi, Marcelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1226-77171 aAlonso-Spilsbury, María0 tInternational journal of veterinary science and medicine.g2018 Dec., v. 6, no. 2 p.131-140dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21657x2314-45997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijvsm.2018.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005700188245011400245300001200359506007600371520139300447592002801840596011401868506003701982650002102019650002002040650002402060650001202084650001202096650001202108650001902120650002002139650001702159650000902176650001302185650001902198650002102217650000702238650002102245650001802266650002902284650001702313650002402330650001902354650001802373650001702391650002102408650000902429651001102438700001902449700001902468700002302487700002602510700001702536700001802553773014202571856008202713852000902795655001202804IND60623143220221207131334.0181216e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062314322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-4040-62doi7 aPMC62671702pmcid7 a305461642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPająk, Marek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6946-880310aRestoration of Vegetation in Relation to Soil Properties of Spoil Heap Heavily Contaminated with Heavy Metals  ap. 392.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe main objectives of our study were to evaluate soil contamination on a zinc-lead spoil heap in the Upper Silesian Industrial Region in southern Poland using pollution indices, and to investigate the relation between soil properties and the natural succession of vegetation. Organic carbon and nitrogen, pH, soil texture, base cations, and heavy metal content were analyzed in soil samples at depths of 0–15 cm below the organic horizon over a regular grid of 14 sampling plots. The contents of Zn, Pb, and Cd exceeded by several times the acceptable thresholds. Measurements of soil enzyme activity were used to evaluate the progress of vegetation development in relation to soil chemical properties. The results indicate that heavy metals had a significant impact on soil enzyme activity and the development of vegetation cover. High contents of Pb and Cd reduced enzyme activity, while this activity increased with increasing amounts of soil organic matter. Further, the accumulative capacities of heavy metals in needles of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and aboveground biomass of bladder campion (Silene vulgaris (Moench) Garcke) were examined. A high accumulation of Zn, Pb, and Cd in the aboveground tissues of S. vulgaris indicated an unusual tolerance of this species to heavy metals and the possibility of using this species in phytoremediation of post-industrial sites.  aPublisher supplied data  aDS 3420cMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Republic of Poland in frame of Statutory Financial Support0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus sylvestris 3aSilene vulgaris 3aaboveground biomass 3abladder 3acadmium 3acations 3achemical bases 3aenzyme activity 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aorganic horizons 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3aplant tissues 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil enzymes 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3avegetation cover 3azinc 3aPoland1 aBłońska, Ewa1 aSzostak, Marta1 aGąsiorek, Michał1 aPietrzykowski, Marcin1 aUrban, Otmar1 aDerbis, Piotr0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2018 Dec., v. 229, no. 12 p.392-392dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-018-4040-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001600268500000900284520161800293592002801911650002001939650001101959650002601970650001901996650001302015650001302028650001202041650002002053650001602073650002402089650001202113650001602125651001602141700002202157700002402179700003602203700002302239773015702262856008202419852000902501655001202510IND60668398620221119051832.0191125e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066839862DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2013.12.05102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurtin, Denis10aMineralization of Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Following Physical Disturbance: A Laboratory Assessment  ap. 925-935.  aepub  aUncertainty persists regarding the influence of physical disturbance on mineralization of soil organic matter. This study examined how disturbance affects mineralization in soils with different management histories and textures. Results from a 100-d incubation (20°C, −10 kPa) using cores (0–15 cm deep; 5-cm diameter) from a field trial at Lincoln, New Zealand with different agronomic treatments in the previous 5 yr (pasture, arable cropping, and chemical fallow) confirmed that mineralization is strongly influenced by management history (C mineralized ranged from 390 mg kg⁻¹ in fallow soil to 1570 mg kg⁻¹ under pasture). However, there was no difference in C or N mineralization between disturbed (sieved <4 mm) and intact cores. In another experiment, comparisons of mineralization in intact and disturbed (<4 mm) cores from 14 arable and pasture fields with either silt loam or clay loam texture also showed no effect of disturbance. In a final experiment, large, air-dry aggregates (19–40 mm) from two soil types (silt loam and clay loam) were fragmented using a compressive force and the resulting subaggregates separated into size classes (<0.25, 0.25–1, 1–2, 2–4, 4–9.5, and 9.5–13.2 mm) by dry sieving. Mineralization increased only when aggregate size was below a certain threshold value (∼3 mm diameter); mineralization was ∼25–50% greater in fine (≤1 mm) vs. large (4–40 mm) aggregates, likely due to exposure of previously-occluded organic matter. Unless a substantial quantity of fine aggregates is generated, the influence of physical disturbance may be small.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay loam soils 3afallow 3afield experimentation 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3apastures 3asieving 3asilt loam soils 3asoil carbon 3asoil organic matter 3atexture 3auncertainty 3aNew Zealand1 aBeare, Michael H.1 aScott, Catherine L.1 aHernández Ramírez, Guillermo,1 aMeenken, Esther D.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2014 May, v. 78, no. 3 p.925-935dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2013.12.05103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012500170500001900295520153400314592002801848650002101876650002001897650002601917650001601943650001601959650001001975650003001985650001702015650001102032650002302043650001802066650001402084653001902098653002502117653002102142653003202163700001202195700001302207700001302220700001702233700001702250773011902267856008802386852000902474655001202483IND60714895620221118070417.0210305e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071489562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1430582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Zhikai10aDisequilibrium in chicken gut microflora with avian colibacillosis is related to microenvironment damaged by antibiotics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe avian colibacillosis outbreak is a disease that threatens public health, poultry production, and economic interests, even after antibiotic feed addition. It is known that avian pathogenic E. coli is a major pathogenic factor; however, the systemic characteristics of gut flora in disease samples and how pathogens grow remain unknown. To study these issues in depth, we used the whole microbial genome shotgun sequencing technique to compare entire microbes in diseased and healthy broiler chickens. We found that it was not only E. coli that increased substantially, but most pathogenic flora also increased significantly in diseased samples. Subsequently, we proved that aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance genes were mainly found in non-E. coli strains. This suggests that E. coli survival under antibiotic stress was due to the cooperative resistance from non-E. coli strains. Among all these increasing strains, attaching and effacing pathogens could damage host intestinal epithelial cells to release oxygen in the gut to make the microenvironment more adaptable for E. coli strains. Furthermore, we observed that the functions of the T4SS/T6SS secretion system were dramatically enhanced, which could help E. coli to compete and enlarge their living spaces. Ultimately, pathogenic E. coli accumulated to cause avian colibacillosis. This study provides a new insight into intestinal microecology in diseased individuals, which would propose new treatment options for avian colibacillosis from a metagenome perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aenvironment 3aflora 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametagenomics 3aoxygen 3apoultry production 3apublic health 3asecretion 0aGut microbiome 0aAvian colibacillosis 0aDynamics balance 0aIntestinal microenvironment1 aLi, Hui1 aLi, Meng1 aGao, Ran1 aGuo, Chongye1 aMi, Shuangli0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 762 p.143058-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1430583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245009100202300001800293520109200311592002801403596004101431650002501472650001701497650000901514650001001523650001301533650001101546650001201557650000901569651001201578700005901590773013301649856008101782852000901863655001201872IND60623143420221120160009.0181127e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062314342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-018-9625-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemm, Liina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1752-976310aDragonfly fauna in rewetted mires in Belarus: diverse but different from natural sites  ap. 1173-1180.  aMire specialist species are under strong anthropogenic pressure. In areas where the exploitation of their habitat has been temporary or unsuccessful, restoration frequently has risen as an objective. The results of the restoration activities for habitat specialists, however, are unclear. In this work we investigated whether raising the water level ca. 10 years ago in degraded bogs has brought back a characteristic group of fauna, and mire specialists therein. Dip-netting for Odonata larvae, together with habitat description, was carried out in restored, unrestored, and natural sites. We found almost no larvae at unrestored sites. The restored sites provided habitat for diverse Odonata fauna, including lagg zone species. Bog specialists only occurred at a former pit-mining site. Based on the study, we suggest three means to support the biodiversity of mire Odonata: (i) protecting the remaining natural mires, (ii) using pit-mining instead of milling for peat extraction, and (iii) creating special pools in former milled sites that have been designated for mire restoration.  aPublisher supplied data  agrant IUT 34-7cEesti Teadusagentuur 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3abiodiversity 3abogs 3afauna 3ahabitats 3alarvae 3amilling 3apeat 3aBelarus1 aSushko, Gennadi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1354-44130 tWetlands ecology and management.g2018 Dec., v. 26, no. 6 p.1173-1180dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870260x0923-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-018-9625-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024002600159040001800185100002100203245008900224300001800313506007600331520111300407592002801520506003701548650002601585650000901611650001501620650001301635650001201648650001301660650001401673650003301687650002201720650000801742650001701750650003701767650001001804650002901814650002801843650001301871650003201884650003501916650003901951650001301990650001402003650009302017650003102110700001902141700002002160700002502180700002302205773009102228856007202319852000902391655001202400IND60080800420221207044909.0140811e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008080042DNAL7 a245197352pmid7 aPMC4125540 [Available on 08/01/15]2pmcid7 a10.1002/ptr.51232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuaron, Jesus A.14aThe Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus Tea Tree Oil‐Reduced Susceptibility Mutants  ap. 1240-1245.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTea tree oil (TTO)‐reduced susceptibility (TTORS) mutants of two Staphylococcus aureus laboratory strains were isolated utilizing TTO gradient plates. Attempts to isolate TTORS mutants employing agar plates containing single TTO concentrations failed. All TTORS mutants demonstrated a small colony variant (SCV) phenotype and produced cells with a smaller diameter, as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The addition of SCV auxotrophic supplements to media did not lead to an increase in TTORS mutant colony size. Revertants were also isolated from the TTORS mutants following growth in drug‐free media, and all revertant strains demonstrated phenotypes similar to their respective parent strains. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that an SH1000 TTORS mutant demonstrated a thinner cell wall and novel septal invaginations compared with parent strain SH1000. In addition, comparative genomic sequencing did not reveal any mutations in an SH1000 TTORS mutant previously linked to well‐characterized SCV genotypes. This study demonstrates that TTO can select for a unique SCV phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aagar 3acell walls 3agenotype 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asequence analysis 3atea 3atea tree oil 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atrees 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aGenotype 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aTea Tree Oilxpharmacology1 aDulal, Santosh1 aCooke, Peter H.1 aTorres, Nathanial J.1 aGustafson, John E.0 tPhytotherapy research.g2014 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.1240-1245dJ.

A large number of components have been isolated from this herb. Polyphenols, myrtucommulone (MC), semimyrtucommulone (S‐MC), 1,8‐cineole, α‐pinene, myrtenyl acetate, limonene, linalool and α‐terpinolene are among the compounds considered to be the main biologically active components. Various parts of this herb such as its berries, leaves and fruits have been used extensively as a folk medicine for several centuries. The herb is used traditionally for the treatment of disorders such as diarrhea, peptic ulcer, hemorrhoid, inflammation, pulmonary and skin diseases, although clinical and experimental studies suggest that it possesses a broader spectrum of pharmacological and therapeutic effects such as antioxidative, anticancer, anti‐diabetic, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, hepatoprotective and neuroprotective activity.

Viable conidia were found on equipment in greenhouses that had a large BLM outbreak the previous year. All isolates from the equipment caused BLM lesions after inoculation of tomato leaves. The distribution of diseased plants in commercial greenhouses was analyzed using Morisita’s index of dispersion (IB). When the primary diseased plants were found before August, the IB value, calculated using the distribution of diseased plants in total and newly recognized in greenhouses, was over 1.0, indicating an aggregated distribution. However, when the primary diseased plants were first seen after August, the IB value tended not to differ significantly from 1, indicating a random distribution. The statistical analysis in this study suggests that new infections as cluster points around a diseased plant and secondary infections as independent cluster points occurred at the same time when disease development was fast. However, secondary infection was slight when the disease developed slowly. We thus hypothesized that conidia on agricultural equipment serves as primary inoculum, that the primary and secondary infection occur at the same time during large outbreaks and that the primary inoculum has a major role in the disease cycle of BLM over long periods in commercial greenhouses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudocercospora 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aconidia 3adisease outbreaks 3agreenhouses 3ainoculum 3aleaves 3asecondary infection 3astatistical analysis 3atomatoes1 aKawaguchi, Akira0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2019 Mar., v. 85, no. 2 p.101-108dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3871472x1345-26307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-018-00835-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011500161300001600276500002000292520216600312592002802478650001402506650003402520650001202554650001702566650001902583650002102602650000902623650001502632650001402647650003002661650001302691650002302704650002202727650001002749650001502759650001002774650002502784650000902809650001802818650001602836650001102852651001802863700001802881700002502899700003002924700001802954700002202972773011002994856007303104852000903177655001203186IND60569909020221118035035.0170626e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056990902DNAL7 a10.1890/12-2235.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLynch, Heather J.10aHow climate extremes—not means—define a species' geographic range boundary via a demographic tipping point  ap. 131-149.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpecies' geographic range limits interest biologists and resource managers alike; however, scientists lack strong mechanistic understanding of the factors that set geographic range limits in the field, especially for animals. There exists a clear need for detailed case studies that link mechanisms to spatial dynamics and boundaries because such mechanisms allow us to predict whether climate change is likely to change a species' geographic range and, if so, how abundance in marginal populations compares to the core. The bagworm Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) is a major native pest of cedars, arborvitae, junipers, and other landscape trees throughout much of North America. Across dozens of bagworm populations spread over six degrees of latitude in the American Midwest we find latitudinal declines in fecundity and egg and pupal survivorship as one proceeds toward the northern range boundary. A spatial gradient of bagworm reproductive success emerges, which is associated with a progressive decline in local abundance and an increase in the risk of local population extinction near the species' geographic range boundary. We developed a mathematical model, completely constrained by empirically estimated parameters, to explore the relative roles of reproductive asynchrony and stage‐specific survivorship in generating the range limit for this species. We find that overwinter egg mortality is the biggest constraint on bagworm persistence beyond their northern range limit. Overwinter egg mortality is directly related to winter temperatures that fall below the bagworm eggs' physiological limit. This threshold, in conjunction with latitudinal declines in fecundity and pupal survivorship, creates a nonlinear response to climate extremes that sets the geographic boundary and provides a path for predicting northward range expansion under altered climate conditions. Our mechanistic modeling approach demonstrates how species' sensitivity to climate extremes can create population tipping points not reflected in demographic responses to climate means, a distinction that is critical to successful ecological forecasting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus 3aThyridopteryx ephemeraeformis 3aanimals 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aeggs 3aextinction 3afecundity 3ageographical distribution 3alatitude 3amechanistic models 3aornamental plants 3apests 3aprediction 3apupae 3areproductive success 3arisk 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3awinter 3aNorth America1 aRhainds, Marc1 aCalabrese, Justin M.1 aCantrell, Robert Stephen,1 aCosner, Chris1 aFagan, William F.0 tEcological monographs.g2014 Feb., v. 84, no. 1 p.131-149dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-2235.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006800164300001800232500002000250520191000270592002802180596005802208596003902266596007802305596001602383650002002399650001302419650001102432650001702443650001902460650002002479650001602499650001702515650001102532650001702543650001602560650001202576650002202588651001102610700001702621700001702638700001802655700002202673700002902695773013502724856008302859852000902942655001202951IND60786300920221119155241.0220803e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078630092DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2019.03.01912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamar, Hada10aCyclic Yield Stability of Ley Farming System in Northern Quebec  ap. 3310-3319.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPredicted climate change is a threat to dairy farming operations in northern Quebec. Soil conservation measures and the timeframe of crop management may contribute to reducing yield variability and also support dairy herd populations. Our objective was to compare annual and cyclic barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and forage yield stability for 3‐yr ley farming system (barley‐mixed, forage‐mixed, forage) over 24 yr of experimentation under contrasting soil conservation practices. Treatments were chisel or moldboard plowing, and mineral fertilization (MIN) or liquid dairy manure (LDM) applied cyclically (across eight 3‐yr cycles) at 85 to 209 kg LDM‐N ha⁻¹ and 90 to 146 kg MIN‐N ha⁻¹ to forage and 87 to 127 kg LDM‐N ha⁻¹ and 70 kg MIN‐N ha⁻¹ to barley. Yield stability assessment was initialized in 1993, 1994, and 1995 and ended in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. While the cyclic assessment showed no significant effect of tillage practice, LDM outperformed MIN, confirming the benefits of manure‐based ley farming systems for dairy farming. Coefficients of variation ranged from 7.8% to 14.4% for barley grain yield, 14.4% to 18.7% for barley straw yield, and 11.8% to 15.3% for forage yield. Coefficients of variation were reduced by factors of 1.86 ± 0.57, 1.87 ± 0.24, and 2.00 ± 0.25 for grain, straw, and forage, respectively, using cyclic assessments. To face the more frequent extreme meteorological events predicted by regional climatic models, feed supply could be stabilized locally and regionally at cyclic rather than yearly timescales to support dairy farming. Core Ideas Long term 24‐year experiment comparing annual and cyclic grain and forage yield stability. Cyclic assessment of yield stability provide low coefficient of variation for grain, straw, and forages. Crop supply and storage could be managed on a cyclic, rather than yearly basis.  aPublisher supplied data  cSustainable Agriculture Environmental Systems (SAGES)  cAgriculture and Agri‐Food Canada  aNSERC-DG 2254cNatural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada  ccentre SEVE 3aHordeum vulgare 3aagronomy 3abarley 3abarley straw 3aclimate change 3acrop management 3adairy herds 3adairy manure 3aforage 3aforage yield 3agrain yield 3aliquids 3asoil conservation 3aQuebec1 aZiadi, Noura1 aLafond, Jean1 aPageau, Denis1 aLajeunesse, Julie1 aParent, Léon‐ Etienne0 tAgronomy journal.g2019 Nov., v. 111, no. 6 p.3310-3319dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2019.03.01913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007100171300001400242520146600256592002801722650002201750650001101772650001201783650001201795650003401807650002101841650001901862650001201881650001301893651001001906653002001916653003101936653002501967653001201992653001602004700002102020700001902041700001902060773010302079856008402182852000902266655001202275IND60545820520221120181216.0160903e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054582052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.07.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, Rama Kant10aPhytoextraction and dissipation of lindane by Spinacia oleracea L.  ap. 22-26.  aRemediation and management of organochlorine pesticide (OCPs) contaminated soil is becoming a global priority as they are listed in the Stockholm list of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) for global elimination. Lindane is a OCPs candidate recently included in the Stockholm list. However, India has an exemption to produce lindane for malaria control. Because of its widespread use during the last few decades, lindane contaminated soils are found in almost all parts of India. Since phytoremediation is widely acknowledged as an innovative strategy for the clean-up of contaminated soils; the present study was aimed to evaluate the phytoextraction and dissipation of lindane by a leafy vegetable Spinacia oleracea L (Spinach). The test plant was grown in different concentrations of lindane (5, 10, 15 and 20mgkg−1) and harvested at 10, 30 and 45 days. At 45 days, the concentrations of lindane in root and leaf of Spinach growing in four different concentrations were reached up to 3.5, 5.4, 7.6 and 12.3mgkg−1 and 1.8, 2.2, 3 and 4.9mgkg−1, respectively. There was a significant difference (p<0.01) in the dissipation of lindane in vegetated and non-vegetated soil. Moreover, the residual lindane in four experiments was reduced to 81, 76, 69 and 61 percent, respectively. The experimental results indicate that Spinach can be used for the phytoremediation of lindane. However, more studies are required to prevent the toxicity of harvested parts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aleaves 3alindane 3amalaria 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3aspinach 3atoxicity 3aIndia 0aPhytoextraction 0aOrgancohclorine pesticides 0aSpinacia oleracea L. 0aLindane 0aDissipation1 aTripathi, Vishal1 aSingh, Nandita1 aAbhilash, P.C.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2014 Nov., v. 109 p.22-26dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.07.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
