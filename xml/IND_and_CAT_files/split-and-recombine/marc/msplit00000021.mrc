An extensive screening program for potential new oilseed crops has led to the discovery of many good sources of new lipid classes and fatty acids. Among them are long-chain acids (Crambe, Limnanthes, Lunaria), medium-chain acids (Cuphea, Umbelliferae, Lauraceae), hydroxy acids (Lesquerella), epoxy acids (Vernonia, Stokesia), acids with special unsaturation (conjugated; acetylenic; Δ3, Δ5, Δ6, Δ17 monoenes) and liquid wax esters (Simmondsia). Many of these plant species have received further attention in terms of germplasm collection and evaluation; breeding and agronomic studies; and processing and utilization research on oil and byproduct meal. Some have been developed sufficiently for early commercialization. Recent history has shown this last step to be the most difficult. No satisfactory mechanism has been devised as yet to simplify the process of transferring research information on a developed new crop to reach the ultimate goal of sustained, large-scale commerical production. Close cooperation between governments and private sector institutions, with some financial support, may be required for the first few years to achieve successful commercialization. 3aoil crops 3aoilseed crops 3anew crops 3afats and oils industry 3afatty acid composition 3amedium chain fatty acids 3ahydroxy fatty acids 3along chain fatty acids 3awax esters 3aLimnanthes 3arapeseed 3aLunaria annua 0aliterature reviews1 aRothfus, J.A.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1984 Feb., v.  61, no.  2 p.281-289x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/262093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF026787823Available from publisher's Web site  a20090310b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/03/10  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02748naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100002300175245015900198300001400357500002400371500001500395520092700410650001501337650002701352650001701379650001301396650001301409650002401422650002001446650001401466650002301480650002101503650001601524653002401540653002201564653001501586653002601601653002201627653003301649653002201682700001501704700001701719700001501736700001901751773011001770852000901880856008501889856011201974930003302086945002502119946001302144961001302157655001202170IND4413790320221121221221.0081212e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441379032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-008-0085-82doi7 a10113/231932hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aFinkenstadt, V.

The plasticizer was incorporated into sugar beet pulp (SBP) at 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% w/w at low temperature and shear and then compounded with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) using twin-screw extrusion and injection molding. The SBP:PLA ratio was maintained at 30:70. As expected, tensile strength decreased by 25% and the elongation increased. Acoustic emission (AE) showed correlated debonding and fracture mechanisms for up to 20% w/w plasticizer and uncorrelated debonding and fracture for 30-40% sorbitol and 30% glycerol content in SBP-PLA composites. All samples had a well dispersed SBP phase with some aggregation in the PLA matrix. However, at 40% glycerol plasticized SBP-PLA composites exhibited unique AE behavior and confocal microscopy revealed the plasticized SBP and PLA formed a co-continuous two phase system. 3amicroscopy 3abiodegradable products 3aplasticizers 3asorbitol 3aglycerol 3aacoustic properties 3asugar beet pulp 3aextrusion 3acomposite polymers 3atensile strength 3alactic acid 0aconfocal microscopy 0aacoustic emission 0aelongation 0amechanical properties 0ainjection molding 0aplastticized sugar beet pulp 0apoly(lactic acid)1 aLiu, C.-K.1 aCooke, P.

The object was to identify possible associations between the manifestations that zinc deficiency and cystic fibrosis have in common, particularly growth retardation and impaired taste acuity. No correlation was found between biochemical indicators of zinc status and growth attainment; there were no significant differences in plasma zinc between patients and controls; however, hair zinc and taste sensitivity were lower in cystic fibrosis patients, indicating altered zinc metabolism. 3azinc 3acystic fibrosis 3anutrient deficiencies 3amineral metabolism 3ataste sensitivity 3anutritional status 0agrowth1 aRieger, Christian H.L.1 aJacob, Robert A.1 aRothberg, Richard.1 aSandstead, Harold H.0 tNutrition research.g1981, v.  1, no.  1 p.13-24x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/450023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aUSDA 7aarticle02610naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002000119040001800139072000900157100001700166245012400183300001800307500002400325500001500349520114200364650002701506650001601533650002301549650001101572650001501583650002201598650001101620650002601631650001601657653001301673700001401686700001601700700001501716700001801731773009801749852000901847856007701856856011101933930003302044945002502077946001302102961001302115655001202128IND4394361320221116204851.0070824e20030516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439436132DNAL7 a10.1002/app.117362doi7 a10113/27662hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aGarlotta, D.10aMechanical and Thermal Properties of Starch-Filled Poly(D,L-lactic acid)/Poly(hydroxy ester ether) Biodegradable Blends  ap. 1775-1786.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe mechanical, structural, and thermal properties of injection-molded composites of granular cornstarch, poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA), and poly(hydroxy ester ether) (PHEE) were investigated. These composites had high tensile strengths, ranging from 17 to 66 MPa, at starch loadings of 0-70 wt %. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs of fracture specimens revealed good adhesion between the starch granule and the polymer matrix, as evidenced by broken starch granules. The adhesion of the starch granules to the polymer matrix was the greatest when the matrix PDLLA/PHEE ratios ranged from zero to unity. At a PDLLA/PHEE ratio of less than unity, as the starch content increased in the composites, there was an increase in the tensile strength and modulus, with a concurrent decrease in elongation. The effects of starch on the mechanical properties of starch/PDLLA composites showed that as the starch content of the composite increased, the tensile strength and elongation to break decreased, whereas Young's modulus increased. In contrast, the tensile strength of starch/PHEE composites increased with increasing starch content. 3abiodegradable products 3acorn starch 3athermal properties 3amixing 3apolyesters 3afilling materials 3aethers 3amechanical properties 3alactic acid 0apolymers1 aDoane, W.1 aShogren, R.1 aLawton, J.1 aWillett, J.L.0 tJournal of applied polymer science.g2003 May 16, v.  88, no.  7 p.1775-1786x1097-46287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/app.117363Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/27663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/09/04  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03381naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125024001900146024002100165040001800186072000900204072000900213072000900222100001100231245010100242300001800343500002400361500001500385506007600400520125700476506003701733650002701770650001801797650001701815650001501832650002201847650002501869650003001894650001801924650001401942650002001956650001201976650002401988650003602012650001002048650001102058650001502069653003402084653003002118653002702148700001302175700001402188700001202202700001702214700001402231700001702245773014502262852000902407856008302416856011202499930003302611945002502644946001302669961001302682655001202695IND4379119020221207075500.0060328e20030415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437911902DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08311661002doi7 aPMC1536592pmcid7 a126687662pmid7 a10113/136942hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aK001 0aF6001 aLi, L.10aCombinatorial modification of multiple lignin traits in trees through multigene cotransformation  ap. 4939-4944.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLignin quantity and reactivity [which is associated with its syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) constituent ratio] are two major barriers to wood-pulp production. To verify our contention that these traits are regulated by distinct monolignol biosynthesis genes, encoding 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) and coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase (CAld5H), we used Agrobacterium to cotransfer antisense 4CL and sense CAld5H genes into aspen (Populus tremuloides). Trees expressing each one and both of the transgenes were produced with high efficiency. Lignin reduction by as much as 40% with 14% cellulose augmentation was achieved in antisense 4CL plants; S/G-ratio increases as much as 3-fold were observed without lignin quantity change in sense CAld5H plants. Consistent with our contention, these effects were independent but additive, with plants expressing both transgenes having up to 52% less lignin, a 64% higher S/G ratio, and 30% more cellulose. An S/G-ratio increase also accelerated cell maturation in stem secondary xylem, pointing to a role for syringyl lignin moieties in coordinating xylem secondary wall biosynthesis. The results suggest that this multigene cotransfer system should be broadly useful for plant genetic engineering and functional genomics.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3atransgenic plants 3acarbohydrate content 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aantisense DNA 3acellulose 3agene expression 3aligases 3aPopulus tremuloides 3achemical constituents of plants 3axylem 3alignin 3aoxygenases 0aconiferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0a4-coumarate-coa ligase1 aZhou, Y.1 aCheng, X.1 aSun, J.1 aMarita, J.M.1 aRalph, J.1 aChiang, V.L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2003 Apr. 15, v.  100, no.  8 p.4939-4944x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08311661003Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/136943Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080424b20080502c00000000  aINDdCMMe2006/10/24  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02033naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002900149245008400178300001600262500002400278520074500302650002301047650001501070650001901085650001001104650001301114650001501127650001601142650002401158650001001182650001101192650001401203650001601217653001801233700002401251773009601275852000901371856011201380930003301492945002501525946001301550961001201563655001201575IND4411807320221118022218.0081023e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441180732DNAL7 a10113/212142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aK0011 aKochenderfer, Jeffrey D.10aEfficacy of Stem Injection Treatments on Striped Maple in Central West Virginia  ap. 106-108.  aIncludes references  aHack-and-squirt injection treatments were applied to individual striped maple (Acer pennsylvanicum L.) stems and to the largest stem in sprout clumps in a 25-year-old clearcut in central West Virginia to evaluate seasonal efficacy of imazapyr as Arsenal (28.7%) and glyphosate as Glypro Plus (41.0%) in water carriers.

Fermentors were incubated with filtered ruminal contents and allowed to adapt for 4 d to diets followed by 3 d of sample collection. Five dietary treatments were tested: 1) gamagrass hay (GH) + no corn (GHNC), 2) gama grass silage (GS) + no corn (GSNC), 3) GS + low corn (GSLC), 4) GS + medium corn (GSMC); and 5) GS + high corn (GSHC). The experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design with five treatments and three replications. Total VFA concentrations were not affected by diets. Corn addition linearly decreased (P < 0.001) molar proportion of acetate. In contrast, molar proportion of propionate was reduced in GSLC (cubic effect, P < 0.001) but remained similar across other diets. Corn supplementation linearly increased molar proportion of butyrate (P < 0.001). The acetate + butyrate-to-propionate ratio was highest in cultures offered GSLC (cubic effect, P < 0.001) but similar across other diets. Feeding GSNC resulted in a higher ruminal pH compared with GHNC (P < 0.03). Increasing the level of corn supplementation in GS linearly decreased culture pH (P < 0.001). All diets resulted in similar methane production, with the exception of GSMC, which lowered methane output (quadratic effect, P < 0.004). Total substrate fermented to VFA and gas tended to be greater with GHNC than with GSNC (P < 0.06) and linearly increased with the addition of corn (P < 0.004). Neutral detergent fiber digestibility was similar between GH and GS and was not affected by supplemental corn. Microbial N flow increased in cultures offered GSHC (quadratic effect, P < 0.02). Corn supplementation at the medium and high level linearly decreased C 18:0 (P < 0.02) and increased trans-C18:1 (P < 0.004). Including corn at the high level with GS did not have a detrimental effect on fermentation in dual-flow fermentors. 3arumen fluids 3apH 3avolatile fatty acids 3arumen microorganisms 3arumen fermentation 3aTripsacum dactyloides 3aforage grasses 3agrass silage 3acorn 2aAcetatesxanalysis 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aButyratesxanalysis 2aCattle 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPoaceaexmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPropionatesxanalysis 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aZea maysxmetabolismxmicrobiology.1 aFellner, V.1 aBurns, J.C.1 aGumpertz, M.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Jan., v.  82, no.  1 p.170-178x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/342833Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091005b20091106c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/04/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03245naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182072000900191100002400200245015700224300001600381500002400397500001500421520116900436650002901605650001501634650002301649650001001672650001701682650002201699650002901721650001401750650001701764650003101781650001601812650002201828650002301850651001601873653001501889653002101904653004701925653000901972653004001981653001202021653002202033700002202055700001802077700001402095700002202109700003302131773013602164852000902300856011202309856009202421930003302513945002502546946001102571961001302582655001202595IND4400555820221123033644.0080127e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440055582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01625.x2doi7 a10113/172362hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ404 0aQ5041 aAbu-Ghoush, Mahmoud10aEffect of antimicrobial agents and dough conditioners on the shelf-life extension and quality of flat bread, as determined by near-infrared spectroscopy  ap. 365-372.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aMiddle Eastern Countries are experiencing the emergence of high volume production and retail marketing over traditional unit baking and retailing. This phenomenon has revealed a shortcoming in quality issues in Arabic flat bread (AFB) manufacture. Therefore, shelf-life extension and quality improvement are in demand to limit economic loss. Five improvers and a control (without any improver) were selected for improving shelf-life and quality of AFB. The improver treatments included: (1) sodium 9 stearoyl-2-lactylate (SSL), (2) monoglycreides (MG), (3) hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose gum (HPMC), (4) high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and (5) a combination of all the aforementioned improvers. The texture analysis data indicated that the presence of HFCS may act as a plasticizer through contributing to the longer tearing time. The other treatments exhibited a significant decline in tearing time throughout storage. The NIRS data indicated that after 3 days, the control was less fresh than AFB formulated with HFCS or improver combinations. The sensory evaluation of AFB exhibited that the improver combination significantly improved the quality attributes. 3aantimicrobial properties 3ashelf life 3asensory evaluation 3adough 3aplasticizers 3amonoacylglycerols 3ahigh fructose corn syrup 3afreshness 3afood quality 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aflat breads 3atraditional foods 3afood preservatives 3aMiddle East 0ashelf-life 0atexture analysis 0ahydroxy propyl methyl cellulose gum (HPMC) 0agums 0asodium 9 stearoyl-2-lactylate (SSL) 0astaling 0aArabic flat bread1 aHerald, Thomas J.1 aDowell, Floyd1 aXie, Feng1 aAramouni, Fadi M.1 aWalker, Charles F.c(Lawyer)0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2008 Feb., v.  43, no.  2 p.365-372dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/172363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01625.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080724b20080801c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/07/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03308naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182072000900191072000900200100001600209245013300225300001600358500002400374520172100398650002402119650001602143650001102159650002302170650001602193650001002209650002002219650002702239650002302266650001902289650001702308650002902325653001602354700001802370773011902388852000902507856011202516856009202628930003302720945002502753946001102778961001302789655001202802IND4414304020221121115919.0090102e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441430402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2008.01335.x2doi7 a10113/231992hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL500 0aL001 0aL3001 aChang, C.L.10aMating competitiveness of the adult oriental fruit fly reared as larvae in liquid vs. those raised on standard wheat-based diets  ap. 806-811.  aIncludes references  aThree strains (standard laboratory, dorsalis translocation white pupae (DTWP) pupal colour sexing strain and wild strain) of adult oriental fruit flies, which were reared as larvae on liquid diet (LD), mill-feed diet (MF) (Tanaka's diet) or natural host fruit diet, were evaluated for mating competitiveness in both indoor and outdoor Boller's mating cages and outdoor field cages. The Relative Sterility Index (RSI) was used as an indicator of mating capability. The RSI between standard strain adults that grew as larvae in LD and those in Tanaka's MF indicated no statistically significant difference in Boller's mating cage results after irradiation and dye marking. These results show that irradiation and dye marking had no effect on laboratory mating ability. Adults of the DTWP genetic sexing strain based on pupal colour that were reared as larvae in a LD (DTWP-LD) or MF (DTWP-MF) had a lower mating ability than the standard laboratory strain in Boller's cages, and against the wild strain in both Boller's and field cages. However, there was no statistically significant difference between irradiated DTWP-LD strains in competition with non-irradiated standard laboratory strain or DTWP-MF strain in Boller's cages. These findings indicate that (i) the quality of the DTWP sexing strain may be less capable in mating than the standard laboratory and wild strains and (ii) LD reared larvae can produce adults of equal mating ability compared with adults reared on a conventional diet. LD reared fruit flies should therefore be ready for mass scale rearing for Sterile Insect Technique programmes following the completion of other field quality control tests, including those measuring dispersal abilities. 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3afruit flies 3alarvae 3aexperimental diets 3aliquid diet 3awheat 3amating behavior 3amating competitiveness 3astrain differences 3ainsect rearing 3amass rearing 3asterile insect technique 0alarval diet1 aMcInnis, D.O.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2008 Dec., v.  132, no.  9-10 p.806-811dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2008.01335.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/02/03  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02145naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001600148245007700164500002400241500001500265520073200280650002001012650002201032650001201054650001001066650001201076650002001088650001401108650002001122650001201142650001701154650000901171650002401180650001101204651001801215653002001233653002301253700002101276700001701297700002001314773009701334852000901431856011101440930003301551945002501584946000901609961000901618655001201627IND4397602620221122202404.0071108e20010227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439760262DNAL7 a10113/65702hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aD5001 aPerkins, A.10aMethod of sire selection using naloxone challenge tests and kits thereof  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThere is variation in the sexual performance of male mammals. The purpose of this invention is to help identify high sexual performing males, particularly for livestock such as sheep. Testosterone is necessary for the normal execution of male behavior, but baseline levels are not predictive of libido. When a male mammal is given an injection of naloxone (an endorphin antagonist), his testosterone or LH response to the injection predicts whether he is a sexually active or inactive individual. This test is based on the premise that libido is more closely linked to the ability to secrete testosterone rather than baseline concentrations. Naloxone challenge may be used as a general method to predict libido in male mammals. 3asire evaluation 3ahormone secretion 3apatents 3amales 3atesting 3aopium alkaloids 3ainjection 3aanalytical kits 3amammals 3atestosterone 3aUSDA 3aluteinizing hormone 3alibido 3aUnited States 0asexual behavior 0asexual performance1 aFitzgerald, J.A.1 aLavoie, V.A.1 aStellflug, J.N.0 tUnited States Department of Agriculture patents.g2001 Feb. 27, , no.

II10aFuture research challenges for incorporation of uncertainty in environmental and ecological decision-making  ap. 383-399.  aIncludes references  aEnvironmental decision-making is extremely complex due to the intricacy of the systems considered and the competing interests of multiple stakeholders. Additional research is needed to acquire further knowledge and understanding of different types of uncertainty (e.g., knowledge, variability, decision, and linguistic uncertainty) inherent in environmental decision-making, and how these areas of uncertainty affect the quality of decisions rendered. Modeling and decision support tools (e.g., integrated assessment models, optimization algorithms, and multicriteria decision analysis tools) are being used increasingly for comparative analysis and uncertainty assessment of environmental management alternatives. If such tools are to provide effective decision support, the uncertainties associated with all aspects of the decision-making process need to be explicitly considered. However, as models become more complex to better represent integrated environmental, social and economic systems, achieving this goal becomes more difficult. Some of the important issues that need to be addressed in relation to the incorporation of uncertainty in environmental decision-making processes include: (1) the development of methods for quantifying the uncertainty associated with human input; (2) the development of appropriate risk-based performance criteria that are understood and accepted by a range of disciplines; (3) improvement of fuzzy environmental decision-making through the development of hybrid approaches (e.g., fuzzy-rule-based models combined with probabilistic data-driven techniques); (4) development of methods for explicitly conveying uncertainties in environmental decision-making through the use of Bayesian probability theory; (5) incorporating adaptive management practices into the environmental decision-making process, including model divergence correction; (6) the development of approaches and strategies for increasing the computational efficiency of integrated models, optimization methods, and methods for estimating risk-based performance measures; and (7) the development of integrated frameworks for comprehensively addressing uncertainty as part of the environmental decision-making process. 3aecosystem management 3aenvironmental management 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3arisk assessment 3amodels1 aMaier, H.R.1 aRavalico, J.K.1 aStrudley, M.W.0 tEcological modelling.g2008 Dec. 10, v.  219, no.  3-4 p.383-3997nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/269143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2008.07.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20090319b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/19  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02533naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092024002100132040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189100001600198245008200214300001400296500002400310520106400334650002801398650001301426650001301439650001901452650002501471650001401496650002701510650001501537653002301552700001401575700001701589700001301606700001801619700001601637773009301653852000901746856011201755856009001867930003301957945002501990946001102015961001302026655001202039IND4438037520221121220647.0100604e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443803752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0912doi7 a10113/430932hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aT300 0aX3801 aQu, Wenjuan10aPreparation and antihypertensive activity of peptides from Porphyra yezoensis  ap. 14-20.  aIncludes references  aThis research was to develop a antihypertensive peptide, an efficient angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEI), from Porphyra yezoensis. Seven commercial enzymes were screened and then enzymatic hydrolysis conditions were optimised. The results showed that alcalase was the most effective for hydrolysis and its optimum conditions for achieving the highest antihypertensive activity of peptide were 1.5% substrate, 5% alcalase, pH 9.0, and temperature of 50°C at a hydrolysis time of 60min. The antihypertensive peptide produced under the optimum conditions had a high ACE inhibition rate of 55.0% and a low IC ₅₀ value of 1.6g/l and remained at high stability at temperatures of 4, 25, and 37°C, pH values of 2.0 and 8.0, and after pepsin and trypsin treatments. Major proteins from P. yezoensis were glutelin, albumin, and gliadin. The albumin and glutelin had higher hydrolysis rates than the gliadin, but the IC ₅₀ value of glutelin was the lowest, which indicated that the antihypertensive peptide from glutelin was more functional. 3aantihypertensive effect 3apeptides 3aPorphyra 3aedible seaweed 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aglutelins 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3asubtilisin 0aPorphyra yezoensis1 aMa, Haile1 aPan, Zhongli1 aLuo, Lin1 aWang, Zhenbin1 aHe, Ronghai0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Nov. 1, v.  123, no.  1 p.14-20dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/430933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0913Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/18  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02743naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194072000900203100001600212245009700228300001600325500002400341520117500365650001401540650002901554650004301583650001101626650001201637650001901649650000901668650002401677650005001701650001401751650004001765650002001805650001101825700001601836700001701852773006601869852000901935856008501944856011202029930003302141945002502174946001302199961001302212655001202225IND2303210820221123031151.0010503e200103  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND230321082DNAL7 a113379882pmid7 a10.1007/s11745-001-0723-72doi7 a10113/261992hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aQ500 0aX5001 aAdlof, R.O.10aChanges in conjugated linoleic acid composition within samples obtained from a single source  ap. 315-317.  aIncludes references  aConjugated linoleic acid (CLA; 9c,11t-18:2) and CLA isomers have been reported in animals to exhibit a variety of health-related benefits. Silver ion high-performance liquid chromatography (Ag-HPLC) was found to provide better resolution of the isomers than gas chromatography. Most commercially available samples of CLA, prepared by base-catalysed isomerization of linoleic acid (9c,12c-18:2), are composed of mixtures of four major isomers. While these isomers have been characterized, we found significant changes in CLA isomer ratios within samples obtained from the same producer/commercial supplier over a period of one-and-a-half years (June 1998 and December 1999). In the first sample, the four cis/trans isomers (8t,10c-18:2, 9c,11t-18:2, 10t,12c-18:2 and 11c,13t-18:2) were present in a ratio of approximately 1:2:2:1, while in the 2nd sample they were present in almost equal proportions. If indeed certain daily levels of CLA intake are required to produce suggested health benefits in humans, changes in concentrations of specific CLA isomers could significantly impact these effects. Care must be taken to analyse the CLA used in human and animal studies. 3anutrition 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asilver 3aisomers 3adairy products 3abeef 2aChromatography, Gas 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aIsomerism 2aLinoleic Acidxanalysisxchemistry. 2aQuality Control 2aSilver1 aCopes, L.C.1 aWalter, E.L.0 tLipids.g2001 Mar., v.  36, no.  3 p.315-317x0024-42017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-001-0723-73Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/261993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090309b20090508c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/03/09  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02289naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002300140245008700163300001600250500002400266500001500290520097200305650002101277650002601298650002601324650001101350650001701361650002001378650001501398650002101413650002401434651001201458653002501470700002001495700001601515773010701531852000901638856011201647930003301759945002501792946001301817961001301830655001201843IND4438601920221121221134.0100617e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443860192DNAL7 a10113/430942hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ5001 aJokela, William E.10aManure Nutrient Content on Vermont Dairy Farms: Long-Term Trends and Relationships  ap. 623-637.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aManure nutrient analysis is an important component of nutrient-management planning on dairy farms. The University of Vermont Agricultural and Environmental Testing Laboratory analyzed more than 2,300 dairy manure samples from 1992 to 2006. Means of nutrient content were consistent with published values, but variability among the sample results supports the need for laboratory analysis to determine manure application rates. Phosphorus (P) content of manure decreased by about 30% from 1992 to 2004, presumably reflecting a shift in dairy diets to avoid feeding excess P, but P content increased in the following 2 years. The copper (Cu) content of liquid manure increased four-fold, mostly after 1998, a change attributed to increased use of copper sulfate (CuSO4) in foot baths. While not reliable for making nutrient-management decisions on individual farms, long-term summaries can be useful to detect trends and to put individual analytical results in context. 3anutrient content 3along term experiments 3aquantitative analysis 3acopper 3adairy manure 3asoil amendments 3aphosphorus 3aapplication rate 3anutrient management 3aVermont 0achemical composition1 aTilley, Joel P.1 aRoss, D.

Thermal alkaline degradation was used with impact shear in the first stage, followed by alkaline peroxidation and shear in the second stage. The degradation products were removed in the liquid supernatants at each stage. The maize fiber gels are characterized by high viscosities and hydration capacities. After drying, they can be reconstituted to the original gel form by using shear forces. The fiber gels were also dried together with hydrophilic materials to more easily reconstitute the gel form. The alkaline-extracted hemicellulose effluents from the fiber gel preparation, including the second stage peroxidized extract, were purified and used as hydrophilic material. Oat flour hydrolyzate, an amylodextrin, also was used as a hydrophilic material. The physical properties of the gels were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and rheological evaluations. 3arehydration 3adietary fiber 3acell walls 3aviscosity 3acorn 3afood processing 3agels 3acellulosic fibers 3aultrastructure 3aalkali treatment 3abeta-glucans 3ahulls 0agel reconstitution 0agums 0ahydrophilic materials1 aCarriere, C.J.0 tCereal chemistry.g2001 , v.  78, no.  4 p.471-475x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.2001.78.4.4713Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02097naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001800149245010300167300001600270500002500286500001500311520080700326650002201133650001701155650001501172650002901187650001201216650002601228650002301254653002301277653001201300653002401312700001701336700001901353773007401372852000901446856011201455930003301567945002501600946001301625961001301638655001201651IND8309503420221121052117.0830921s1983    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND830950342DNAL7 a10113/262022hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aX3501 aKaneshiro, T.10aTryptophan catabolism to indolepyruvic and indoleacetic acids by Rhizobium japonicum L-259 mutants  ap. 301-306.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-05  aTan-colored (tan) mutants, which retain the capacity to reduce acetylene, were selected and isolated from Rhizobium japonicum L-259 after growth in a glutamate-limited medium supplemented with tryptophan (trp). The mutants catabolized trp (500 mg per liter) to produce orange-colored fermentation broths containing extracellular indolepyruvic (IPA) and indoleacetic (IAA) acids. In contrast, parental strain L-259 produced a colorless broth containing only IAA when grown on the trp-supplemented medium. Trp alone was determined to be an incomplete nitrogen source for mutant growth and did not stimulate acetylene-reduction activity. Studies of symbiotic tan mutants may lead to an understanding of the in situ roles of extracellular auxina IAA and IPA during the establishment of rhizobial symbioses. 3anitrogen fixation 3abiosynthesis 3atryptophan 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3amutants 3aamino acid metabolism 3aindole acetic acid 0aindolepyruvic acid 0aindoles 0aindole pyruvic acid1 aSlodki, M.E.1 aPlattner, R.D.0 tCurrent microbiology.g1983, v.  8, no.  5 p.301-306x0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/262023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090309b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/09  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02877naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100002300187245009500210300001600305500002400321500001500345520103400360650001301394650001201407650001301419650001501432650002301447650001301470650002701483650001601510650003001526650001601556650001801572650002201590650003101612650002201643653003201665653001701697653002501714653001501739700001701754700002301771700001901794700001301813700001601826700001301842773011701855852000901972856011201981856008802093930003302181945002502214946001102239961001302250655001202263IND4413107120221121021546.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.07.0032doi7 a10113/231882hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aAbdul-Careem, M.F.10aCellular and cytokine responses in feathers of chickens vaccinated against Marek's disease  ap. 362-366.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aIn Marek's disease virus infection, feather follicle epithelium (FFE) constitutes the site of formation of infectious virus particles and virus shedding.

Analysis of feather tips collected between 4 and 28 days post-immunization (d.p.i.) from chickens vaccinated post-hatch with either CVI988/Rispens or herpesvirus of turkeys revealed that replication of these vaccine viruses started at 7d.p.i., peaked by 21d.p.i., and subsequently, showed a declining trend. This pattern of viral replication, which led to viral genome accumulation in feather tips, was associated with infiltration of T cell subsets particularly CD8+ T cells into the feather pulp area and the expression of cytokine genes such as interferon-γ, which is an indication of elicitation of cell-mediated immune responses at the site of virus shedding. 3achickens 3astrains 3afeathers 3abiomarkers 3adisease prevention 3avaccines 3acell-mediated immunity 3ainterferons 3aGallid alphaherpesvirus 2 3avaccination 3aMarek disease 3avirus replication 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aprotective effect 0afeather follicle epithelium 0afeather pulp 0aGallid herpesvirus 2 0aintegument1 aHunter, D.B.1 aShanmuganathan, S.1 aHaghighi, H.R.1 aRead, L.1 aHeidari, M.1 aSharīf.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2008 Dec. 15, v.  126, no.  3-4 p.362-366dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231883Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.07.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/12/30  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01574naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002400140245006700164300001400231500002500245520059500270650001500865650001200880650000900892650002000901650000900921653001600930700002300946773007500969852000901044856011201053930003301165946001301198961001301211655001201224IND8900705020221123035326.0890130e198601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890070502DNAL7 a10113/471832hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aJohnson, Phyllis E.10aAvailability of iron to rats from Spirulina, a blue-green alga  ap. 85-94.  aIncludes references.  aBoth cultured Spirulina platensis (Nordst.)

The boreal species acclimated more rapidly and deeply than the temperate species, acquiring LN2-quench tolerance by late November, despite unusually warm conditions throughout the autumn and early winter. Maximum LT tolerance in the temperate species was in the -25 to -35 °C range, and was reached only after a period of freezing temperatures in late January and February. During LT acclimation in the temperate species, sigmoid temperature-relative electrolyte leakage (REL) curves shifted toward lower temperatures, whereas in boreal species there was both a temperature shift and a lowering of the maximum REL until it fell below a threshold associated with irreversible injury. These differences may reflect differences in mechanisms of LT acclimation and LT tolerance. The concentrations of total and individual sugars did not show a clear pattern that could differentiate the boreal and temperate groups. Raffinose and, in three of the six species, stachyose showed the closest association with LT tolerance. Sugar concentrations, principally sucrose, decreased during mild weather, perhaps because of respiratory losses or phloem export, and increased after periods of freezing temperatures. Low-temperature acclimation in boreal species appears to follow a rigid program that may affect their ability to avoid excessive respiratory losses in the event of continued climate warming in boreal regions. 3achemical concentration 3ainterspecific variation 3awinter hardiness 3ageographical distribution 3aPinus 3aforest trees 3asugars 3aAbies 3acold stress 3aacclimation 3aconifer needles 3aprovenance 3aPicea 3atemperature 3aconifers 2aAcclimatization 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCold Climate 2aCold Temperature 2aNitrogenxpharmacology 2aPinaceaexdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aspecies differences 0aliquid nitrogen quench 0aboreal species 0atemperate species 0acold tolerance1 aKjellsen, Trygve D.1 aSchaberg, Paul G.1 aMurakami, Paula F.0 tTree physiology.g2008 Sept., v.  28, no.  9 p.1365-1374x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/28.9.13653Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/212063Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/10/22  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02937naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001700150245017800167300001400345500002400359520127400383650002001657650002301677650001101700650001701711650004401728650002201772650001001794650001801804650002001822650004701842650003601889650005401925650004601979650002402025650003302049700001402082700001902096700001202115700001302127700001602140773007202156852000902228856011202237930003302349945001302382946001102395961001302406655001202419IND2333532520221123023846.0030714e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233353252DNAL7 a124756192pmid7 a10113/136882hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarita, J.M.10aStructural and compositional modifications in lignin of transgenic alfalfa down-regulated in caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase and caffeoyl coenzyme A 3-O-methyltransferase  ap. 53-65.  aIncludes references  aIsolated lignins from alfalfa deficient in caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase contained benzodioxanes resulting from the incorporation of the novel monomer, 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol. Due to the high level incorporated into the soluble lignin fraction and the use of sensitive NMR instrumentation, unique structural features were revealed. A new type of end-unit, the 5-hydroxyguaiacyl glycerol unit, was identified. It was possible to establish that coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and the novel 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol can cross-couple with the 5-hydroxyguaiacyl units that are formed in the lignin, the latter giving rise to extended chains of benzodioxane units. There is also evidence that 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol couples with normal (guaiacyl or syringyl) lignin units. Lignin in the alfalfa deficient in caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase was structurally similar to the control lignin but the transgenic exhibited a dramatic decrease in lignin content (approximately 20%) and modest increase in cellulose (approximately 10%) reflecting a 30% increase in cellulose:lignin ratio. The compositional changes in both transgenics potentially allow enhanced utilization of alfalfa as a major forage crop by increasing the digestibility of its stem fraction. 3aMedicago sativa 3achemical structure 3alignin 3atransferases 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atransgenic plants 3astems 3adigestibility 2aDown-Regulation 2aLigninxanalysisxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMedicago sativaxchemistryxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlants, Genetically Modified1 aRalph, J.1 aHatfield, R.D.1 aGuo, D.1 aChen, F.1 aDixon, R.A.0 tPhytochemistry.g2003 Jan., v.  62, no.  1 p.53-65x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/136883Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080424b20080502c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02053naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002300140245007500163300001800238500002500256520108900281650000901370650000901379650001501388650001901403650000901422700002401431773008001455852000901535856011201544930003301656946001301689961001301702655001201715IND8900884220221123035324.0890207e198610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890088422DNAL7 a10113/471862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aJohnson, W.

Two weeks after starting the dietary regimen, the two dietary groups were each divided into three treatment groups receiving continuous intravenous infusions from surgically implanted osmotic pumps of either 0.9% NaC1 or picolinic acid (PA) solutions containing 200 mg or 50 mg PA/m1. True zinc absorption and excretion of endogenous zinc were measured using a 65Zn isotope dilution technique. PA treatment increased dietary zinc absorption as well as serum tibia zinc concentrations compared to controls treated with NaC1. However, PA treatment had no effect on either intestinal excretion of endogenous zinc or urinary zinc excretionFurthermore, the effects of PA on zinc absorption and distribution were independent of either the concentration of PA in the infusion solutions or the level of dietary zinc. These results indicate that although PA of endogenous origin can promote zinc absorption and affect zinc distribution, it is unlikely that PA can regulate zinc metabolism. 3adiet 3azinc 3ametabolism 3apicolinic acid 3arats1 aCanfield, Wesley K.0 tNutrition research.g1986 Oct., v.  6, no.  10 p.1189-1200x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/471863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110113b20110205c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02325naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092024002100142040001800163072000900181072000900190100001600199245002400215300001600239500002400255500001500279520082300294650001701117650001901134650002201153650002201175650001801197650002501215650003601240650002101276650001101297650002301308653002001331653001501351653002301366653001801389700001401407700001601421773007701437852000901514856011201523856010001635930003301735945001301768946001301781961001301794655001201807IND2334244220221123024025.0031002s2003    cau|||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND233424422DNAL7 a10.1146/annurev.arplant.54.031902.1349382doi7 a10113/136902hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aBoerjan, W.10aLignin biosynthesis  ap. 519-546.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe lignin biosynthetic pathway has been studied for more than a century but has undergone major revisions over the past decade. Significant progress has been made in cloning new genes by genetic and combined bioinformatics and biochemistry approaches. In vitro enzymatic assays and detailed analyses of mutants and transgenic plants altered in the expression of lignin biosynthesis genes have provided a solid basis for redrawing the monolignol biosynthetic pathway, and structural analyses have shown that plant cell walls can tolerate large variations in lignin content and structure. In some cases, the potential value for agriculture of transgenic plants with modified lignin structure has been demonstrated.

Forests provide non-market goods and services that people are implicitly willing to pay for through hedonic housing and labor markets. But it is unclear if compensating differentials arise in these markets at the regional level. This empirical question is addressed in a study of Arizona and New Mexico. Hedonic regressions of housing prices and wages using census and geographic data show that forest area carries an implicit price of between $27 and $36 per square mile annually. Compensating differentials at the regional level suggest that care must be taken when applying the travel cost method to value regionally delineated characteristics. 3acensus data 3aprices 3awages and remuneration 3alabor market 3aregression analysis 3ageographic information systems 3anational forests 3aeconometric models 3awillingness to pay 3arural areas 3aforests 3aArizona 3aNew Mexico 0aSouthwestern States. 0ahousing1 aThacher, Jennifer A.1 aMcCollum, Daniel W.1 aBerrens, Robert P.0 tLand economics.g2008 Nov., v.  84, no.  4 p.635-651x0023-76397nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/212093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3368/le.84.4.6353Available from publisher's Web site  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/10/31  aOther US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle03721naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001800158245005900176300001600235500002400251520219900275650001502474650001602489650002002505650001902525650001202544650001502556650002302571650001402594650001302608650001702621650002402638650002002662650002302682653001802705653002602723653002102749700001602770700001802786700001902804700001802823700002002841773010102861852000902962856011202971930003303083945002503116946001303141961001303154655001203167IND4446635020221120135305.0101222s2010    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND444663502DNAL7 a10113/466692hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL200 0aL5001 aRoberts, C.A.10aFactors affecting spermatozoa morphology in beef bulls  ap. 122-125.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate factors affecting sperm morphology of bulls (n=908) collected at 320 days of age. Bulls were a composite breed (50% Red Angus, 25% Charolais, and 25% Tarentaise) born from 2002 to 2008 to dams fed levels of feed during mid and late gestation that were expected to provide marginal or adequate nutrition while grazing dormant winter forage. After weaning, bulls were fed to appetite (CON) or restricted (REST) to 80% of that consumed by CON on BW basis. Semen samples were collected using an electroejaculator and evaluated using standard BSE procedures. Spermatozoa morphology was evaluated by classifying 100 spermatozoa per bull at 400 X magnification into the following categories: normal spermatozoa, knobbed acrosome, head defects, distal midpiece reflex, dag defect, bowed midpiece, proximal droplet, distal droplet, coiled principle piece, and bent principle piece. Each morphological trait, along with scrotal circumference (SC), gross motility, and percent progressive motility was analyzed using MTDFREML and pedigree information from 8163 relatives born from 1974 to 2008 to provide heritability estimates. Heritability estimates for these traits were: SC (h2 = 0.67), normal sperm (h2 = 0.18), dag defect (h2 = 50), bowed midpiece (h2 = 0.19), proximal droplets (h2 = 0.37), bent principle piece (h2 = 0.18), gross motility (h2 = 0.20), and progressive motility (h2 = 0.20). The moderate heritability of percent normal sperm and several of the other sperm defects suggest that selection for improved sperm morphology is possible. Further analysis with MTDFREML determined genetic correlations between the above traits and pre-weaning gain direct, pre-weaning gain maternal, post-weaning gain, and scrotal circumference. Maternal pre-weaning gain was highly correlated with scrotal circumference (r = 0.70 ± 0.24) but pre-weaning gain direct (r = 0.29 ± 0.20) and post-weaning gain (r = 0.01 ± 0.17) were not. Scrotal circumference and post-weaning gain were not highly correlated with morphology and therefore are not good indicators of spermatozoa morphology. Neither in utero nor postweaning diet affected any of the traits measured. 3abeef bulls 3aspermatozoa 3acell structures 3asperm motility 3ascrotum 3adimensions 3arestricted feeding 3apregnancy 3apedigree 3aheritability 3agenetic correlation 3aliveweight gain 3amaternal nutrition 0asperm defects 0ascrotal circumference 0asperm morphology1 aGeary, T.W.1 aMacNeil, M.D.1 aWaterman, R.C.1 aRoberts, A.J.1 aAlexander, L.J.0 tProceedings / Western Section, American Society of Animal Science.g2010, v.  61 p.122-1257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/466693Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101227b20110101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/12/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03078naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112100003400130245016700164300001400331500002400345500001500369520141200384650001701796650002401813650000801837650001401845650002601859650001001885650001901895650002201914650002601936650001701962653004501979653004602024653001302070653004402083653004102127653004302168653004302211653003702254700001802291773007102309852000902380856011102389930003302500945001302533946001302546961001302559655001202572IND2063300420221118221912.0980422e199701  inu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206330042DNAL7 a10113/34262hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, Aurelio Rodriguez.10aChloroplast DNA analysis of Solanum bulbocastanum and S. cardiophyllum, and evidence for the distinctiveness of S. cardiophyllum subsp. ehrenbergii (sect. Petota)  ap. 31-43.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aChloroplast DNA restriction site analysis was used to test hypotheses of sister group relationships of the diploid Mexican wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum (ser. Bulbocastana) and S. cardiophyllum (ser. Pinnatisecta). A prior chloroplast DNA study including two accessions each of these two species supported them as sister taxa, widely separated from their presumed closest Mexican diploid species relatives. The present study samples more widely by examining 28 accessions of all three subspecies of S. bulbocastanum, and 20 accessions of all three subspecies of S. cardiophyllum. The results support two main clades exclusive of the outgroup: 1. Solanum bulbocastanum (all subspecies) and S. cardiophyllum (all subspecies except subsp. ehrenbergii), and 2. S. cardiophyllum subsp. ehrenbergii and members of ser. Pinnatisecta other than subsp. ehrenbergii. In the first clade, there was little resolution and some chloroplast types were shared by three subspecies of S. bulbocastanum and two subspecies of S. cardiophyllum. These results, in combination with an earlier chloroplast DNA study of the Mexican and Central American species, suggest that subsp. ehrenbergii is related to other members of ser. Pinnatisecta, possibly S. brachistotrichum or S. stenophyllidium, or alternatively that subsp. ehrenbergii obtained the chloroplast genome of a species in ser. Pinnatisecta by introgression. 3achloroplasts 3arestriction mapping 3aDNA 3aphylogeny 3aSolanum cardiophyllum 3agenes 3anew subspecies 3agenetic variation 3aSolanum bulbocastanum 3abiogeography 0asolanum cardiophyllum ssp. cardiophyllum 0asolanum bulbocastanum ssp. dolichophyllum 0ataxonomy 0aolanum bulbocastanum ssp. bulbocastanum 0asolanum bulbocastanum ssp. partitium 0asolanum cardiophyllum ssp. ehrenbergii 0asolanum cardiophyllum ssp. lanceolatum 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aSpooner, D.M.0 tSystematic botany.g1997 , v.  22, no.  1 p.31-43x0363-64457nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/34263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01932naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001900157245010200176500002400278520046500302650002600767650002300793650002800816650002300844650001100867650002500878650002300903650002000926650002200946650002200968650001700990650001801007650000901025650001201034651001801046653002501064700001601089700001801105773010701123852000901230856011101239930003301350945002501383946000901408961000901417655001201426IND4397343620221120045835.0071101e20020528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439734362DNAL7 a10113/71092hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aX380 0aD5001 aMandrell, R.E.10aMonoclonal antibodies against Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli outer membrane antigens  aIncludes references  aThe present invention is directed to a method of producing monoclonal antibodies that are highly specific for (1) unique epitopes of Campylobacter jejuni (Cj) only and (2) epitopes conserved between Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli (Cc) outer membranes; to specific monoclonal antibodies made by the methods of the instant invention; and uses thereof The invention is drawn further to immunogens comprising the outer membrane complexes of Cj and Cc. 3amonoclonal antibodies 3abacterial antigens 3aouter membrane proteins 3abacterial proteins 3aporins 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aCampylobacter coli 3agastroenteritis 3adisease detection 3adisease diagnosis 3ahuman health 3aanimal health 3aUSDA 3apatents 3aUnited States 0aantibody specificity1 aBates, A.H.1 aBrandon, D.L.0 tUnited States Department of Agriculture patents.g2002 May 28, , no.

Greenhouse and microplot experiments were conducted with the runner type peanut genotypes C724-19-15, C724-19-25 and Georgia-02C with different levels of resistance to nematode and CBR to better understand the interactions between the two pathogens. In the greenhouse, inoculation of 500-3000 eggs per plant of M. arenaria did not affect the level of root rot induced by 1·0 to 5·0 microsclerotia of C. parasiticum per g soil. In microplots, the root rot ratings from Georgia-02C and C724-19-25 were higher in plots infested with M. arenaria (0·4-2·0 eggs per cm³ soil) and C. parasiticum than in plots with C. parasiticum alone; however, M. arenaria did not increase the root rot ratings on the nematode resistant C724-19-15. This was inconsistent with results in the greenhouse. Gall indices were not affected by C. parasiticum inoculations in the greenhouse or microplots. In both 2006 and 2007, a significant interaction between C. parasiticum inoculum densities and nematode level was observed on plant mortality. CBR inoculum greatly increased mortality on C724-19-25 and Georgia-02C, but not on C724-19-15, in the presence of M. arenaria. The mortality increase was more apparent at lower inoculum levels of both pathogens, but on the nematode-susceptible cultivars plant mortality was more with co-inoculations of the two pathogens than from either alone. Simultaneous inoculation with the two pathogens decreased yield of C724-19-25 and Georgia-02C as C. parasiticum inoculum levels increased, but even the largest inoculum of M. arenaria (2·0 eggs per cm³ soil) did not decrease yield of C724-19-15. 3aMeloidogyne arenaria 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aCylindrocladium 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aroot rot 3adisease severity 3adisease resistance 3apeanuts 3aArachis hypogaea 3agenetic variation 3agreenhouse experimentation 0aCylindrocladium parasiticum1 aBrenneman, T.B.1 aHolbrook, C.C.1 aTimper, P.1 aCulbreath, A.K.0 tPlant pathology.g2009 Feb., v.  58, no.  1 p.71-79dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/358283Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2008.01932.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100719b20100807c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/11/20  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03656naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001600150245009100166300001800257500002400275520207000299650001002369650001602379650001902395650002002414650002002434650002002454650002402474650001602498650003002514650001202544650002102556650002802577650002002605650000902625650004502634650001202679650002802691653001602719653001602735700001402751700001902765700001902784700002002803773008602823852000902909856011202918930003303030945001303063946001303076961001303089655001203102IND2327961320221120132946.0020710e200205  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232796132DNAL7 a120196022pmid7 a10113/117162hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrumm, M.C.10aEffect of removal and remixing of lightweight pigs on performance to slaughter weights  ap. 1166-1172.  aIncludes references  aTwo experiments were conducted to determine the effect of lightweight pig removal and remixing on performance to slaughter. Experiment 1 was a growing-finishing trial utilizing a total of 900 pigs (26.2 +/- 0.1 kg initial weight) that were sorted and remixed at a mean replicate BW of 72 kg. Experiment 2 was a wean-to-finish trial (17 d mean wean age; 4.8 kg +/- 0.1 BW) utilizing 225 barrows with sorting and remixing occurring 3 wk after weaning. Treatments were 15 pigs/pen from initial weight to slaughter (15S), 20 pigs/pen from initial weight to time of sort and remix and then reduced to 15 pigs/pen (20/15), and 15 pigs/pen from time of sort and remix to slaughter comprised of the five lightest pigs from each of three 20/15 pens per replicate (15M). Space allocation was 0.56 m2/pig from 26 to 70 kg and 0.74 m2/pig thereafter in Exp. 1. In Exp. 2, pen size was fixed at 2.44 x 4.27 m. In Exp. 1, there was no effect (P > 0.20) of treatment on performance prior to 70 kg. Least squares means for ADG from time of sort and remix to first pig removal from a pen for slaughter at 113 kg were 0.93, 0.87, and 0.91 kg/d for the 20/15, 15M, and 15S treatments, respectively (P < 0.05). When comparing the population represented by the 20/15 + 15M treatments vs the 15S population, there was no difference (P > 0.20) in ADG, ADFI, feed conversion, or carcass lean content. In Exp. 2, pigs in the 20/15 treatment grew slower (P < 0.05) than 15S pigs for the first 21 d (0.20 vs 0.22 kg/d, respectively) with a lower ADFI (P = 0.06) and no difference in feed conversion. When comparing the population represented by the 20/15 + 15M treatments vs the 15S population after sorting and remixing, there was no effect (P > 0.15) of experimental treatments on ADG, ADFI, feed conversion efficiency, carcass lean content, or daily lean gain. These results suggest that removal of light-weight pigs and remixing of the removed pigs into pens of similar-weight pigs is ineffective in improving the overall performance of a population of pigs during the postweaning period. 3aswine 3abody weight 3aanimal housing 3aanimal behavior 3afeed conversion 3aliveweight gain 3acarcass composition 2aAge Factors 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aSwinexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aWeaning 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 0agrowth rate 0aperformance1 aEllis, M.1 aJohnston, L.J.1 aRozeboom, D.W.1 aZimmerman, D.R.0 tJournal of animal science.g2002 May, v.  80, no.  5 p.1166-1172x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/117163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03990naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100001500194245015400209300001800363500002400381500001500405520236500420650001102785650001802796650001402814650002802828650002502856650001502881650003702896650002202933650001402955650001602969650001202985650001302997653001603010653002103026653001703047653002103064700001903085773005503104852000903159856011203168856008603280930003303366945002503399946001103424961001303435655001203448IND4405275420221117235940.0080505e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440527542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2005.01.0162doi7 a10113/144272hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aX500 0aS0001 aKnothe, G.10aKinematic viscosity of biodiesel fuel components and related compounds. Influence of compound structure and comparison to petrodiesel fuel components  ap. 1059-1065.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aBiodiesel, defined as the mono-alkyl esters of vegetable oils and animal fats is an alternative diesel fuel that is steadily gaining attention and significance. One of the most important fuel properties of biodiesel and conventional diesel fuel derived from petroleum is viscosity, which is also an important property of lubricants. Ranges of acceptable kinematic viscosity are specified in various biodiesel and petrodiesel standards. In this work, the kinematic viscosity of numerous fatty compounds as well as components of petrodiesel were determined at 40 °C (ASTM D445) as this is the temperature prescribed in biodiesel and petrodiesel standards. The objective is to obtain a database on kinematic viscosity under identical conditions that can be used to define the influence of compound structure on kinematic viscosity. Kinematic viscosity increases with chain length of either the fatty acid or alcohol moiety in a fatty ester or in an aliphatic hydrocarbon. The increase in kinematic viscosity over a certain number of carbons is smaller in aliphatic hydrocarbons than in fatty compounds. The kinematic viscosity of unsaturated fatty compounds strongly depends on the nature and number of double bonds with double bond position affecting viscosity less. Terminal double bonds in aliphatic hydrocarbons have a comparatively small viscosity-reducing effect. Branching in the alcohol moiety does not significantly affect viscosity compared to straight-chain analogues. Free fatty acids or compounds with hydroxy groups possess significantly higher viscosity. The viscosity range of fatty compounds is greater than that of various hydrocarbons comprising petrodiesel. The effect of dibenzothiophene, a sulfur-containing compound found in petrodiesel fuel, on viscosity of toluene is less than that of fatty esters or long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. To further assess the influence of the nature of oxygenated moieties on kinematic viscosity, compounds with 10 carbons and varying oxygenated moieties were investigated. A reversal in the effect on viscosity of the carboxylic acid moiety vs. the alcohol moiety is noted for the C10 compounds compared to unsaturated C18 compounds. Overall, the sequence of influence on kinematic viscosity of oxygenated moieties is COOH approximately equal to C-OH>COOCH3 approximately equal to C==O>C-O-C> no oxygen. 3asulfur 3avegetable oil 3aviscosity 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3aanimal fats and oils 3akinematics 3astructure-activity relationships 3afatty acid esters 3abiodiesel 3atemperature 3atoluene 3aalcohols 0afatty acids 0adibenzothiophene 0ahydrocarbons 0acarboxylic acids1 aSteidley, K.R.0 tFuel.g2005 June, v.  84, no.  9 p.1059-10657nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/144273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2005.01.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/05/09  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02312naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113100001800131245009700149300001600246500002400262520094000286650000901226650001801235650002101253650002501274650001901299650002301318650002401341650001601365650002401381651001101405653001501416653001501431700001601446700002001462700002001482700001701502700001801519700001601537773008601553852000901639856011201648930003301760945001301793946001101806961001301817655001201830IND2328136620120607153405.0020720e20020603ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232813662DNAL7 a10113/151142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGennari, S.M.10aOccurrence of Neospora caninum antibodies in sera from dogs of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil  ap. 177-179.  aIncludes references  aNeospora caninum is an important cause of abortion in dairy cattle worldwide. Dogs are important in the epidemiology of this parasite because they are the only hosts known to excrete N. caninum oocysts. In order to understand the prevalence of N. caninum in dogs, sera from 500 owned dogs and from over 600 feral street dogs from the city of São Paulo, Brazil were assayed for antibodies to N. caninum. Sera were examined by the Neospora agglutination test (NAT) using mouse-derived tachyzoites. Antibodies (>or=1:25) to N. caninum were found in nearly 10% (49/500) of owned dogs and in 25% (151/611) of stray dogs. NAT titers for owned dogs were 1:25 in 28 (5.6%) dogs, 1:50 in 20 (4%) dogs, and >or=1:500 in 1 (0.2%) dog. NAT titers for stray dogs were 1:25 in 79 (12.9%) dogs, 1:50 in 68 (11.1%) dogs, and >or=1:500 in 4 (0.6%) dogs. These data indicate that feral dogs may be important in the epidemiology of N. caninum infection. 3adogs 3astray animals 3aNeospora caninum 3aprotozoal infections 3aseroprevalence 3aantibody detection 3aagglutination tests 3aurban areas 3aserological surveys 3aBrazil 0aowned dogs 0aferal dogs1 aYai, L.E.O.1 aD'Auria, S.N.R.1 aCardoso, S.M.S.1 aKwok, O.C.H.1 aJenkins, M.C.1 aDubey, J.P.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2002 June 3, v.  106, no.  2 p.177-179x0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/151143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080527b20080606c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03627naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002300128040001800151100002200169245012200191300001800313520180600331596008002137650002202217650002602239650001502265650002102280650002402301650002402325650001702349650001902366650002102385650001702406650002602423650001402449650001502463650001502478650002402493650002402517650002902541650002202570650002102592650002202613650002102635650001802656650001702674651003102691700002002722700002002742700002202762700001702784700002702801773013202828856008002960852000903040655001203049IND60738280320221122131535.0210523e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073828032DNAL7 a10.1177/08901171177481222doi7 a10113/73828032hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeguin,Rebecca A.11aACivic Engagement Approach to Encourage Healthy Eating and Active Living in Rural Towns: The HEART Club Pilot Project  ap. 1591-1601.  aPurpose: To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a civic engagement curriculum (encouraging Healthy Eating and Activity in Rural Towns [HEART] Club) designed to engage rural residents in improving their local food or physical activity environment. Design: Pre–post surveys and focus groups. Setting: Three rural Northeastern towns in the United States. Participants: Twenty-six rural residents (7-12 per town) recruited by local extension educators. Measures: Online surveys were used to assess outcomes related to feasibility (satisfaction) and effectiveness (knowledge, awareness, motivation, self-efficacy, and group efficacy for community change). Feasibility was also assessed through attendance logs, benchmark achievement records, and post-implementation focus groups. Analysis: Participant characteristics and feasibility measures were summarized using descriptive statistics. Pre–post changes in effectiveness outcomes were assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Focus group data were thematically examined to identify barriers to and facilitators of HEART Club progress. Results: Meeting attendance and program satisfaction were high (88% and 91%). Participants reported improvements in awareness; however, no other significant changes were observed. All HEART Clubs accomplished 3 or more project benchmarks after 6 months of implementation. Despite competing priorities and limited finances, groups effectively leveraged existing resources to achieve their goals. Important facilitators of success included stakeholder support, effective leadership, and positive group dynamics. Conclusion: These findings suggest that resident-driven initiatives that build upon local resources and establish feasible goals can successfully foster environmental change in rural communities.  cUnited States Department of Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3acommunity service 3aconsumer satisfaction 3acurriculum 3aextension agents 3aextension education 3afeasibility studies 3afocus groups 3agroup behavior 3ahealth education 3ahealthy diet 3ahealthy eating habits 3aknowledge 3aleadership 3amotivation 3anutrition education 3anutrition knowledge 3aparticipation (behavior) 3aphysical activity 3aregional surveys 3arural communities 3arural population 3aself-efficacy 3astakeholders 3aNortheastern United States1 aSriram, Urshila1 aConnor, Leah M.1 aSilver, Ashley E.1 aNiu, Beining1 aBartholomew, Alexis N.0 tAmerican journal of health promotion.g2018 Feb. 1, v. 32, no. 7 p.1591-1601dSAGE PublicationswJournal:28064x2168-66027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08901171177481223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100002500184245005900209300001600268500002400284500001500308520110400323650001501427650001901442650001401461650001701475650001801492650002101510650001901531650001401550650001301564653001901577653002101596653001901617653001601636653001601652653001501668700002101683773008201704852000901786856011201795856008501907930003301992945002502025946001302050961001202063655001202075IND4430542920221121013621.0091228e20071030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443054292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2006.09.0342doi7 a10113/375612hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK250 0aX1001 aMcRoberts, Ronald E.10aRemote sensing support for national forest inventories  ap. 412-419.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aNational forest inventory programs are tasked to produce timely and accurate estimates for a wide range of forest resource variables for a variety of users and applications. Time, cost, and precision constraints cause these programs to seek technological innovations that contribute to measurement and estimation efficiencies and that facilitate the production and distribution of an increasing array of inventory data, estimates, and derived products. Many of the recent innovations have involved remotely sensed data and related statistical estimation techniques. Current applications of remote sensing in support of national forest inventories are reviewed for three areas: (1) observation or measurement, meaning using remotely sensed data in lieu of field observations or measurements; (2) estimation, meaning calculation of traditional inventory areal estimates such as forest area or volume per unit area; and (3) mapping. Future applications focus on two areas: augmenting field measurements with remotely sensed data obtained from lidar sensors and Internet accessible map-based estimation. 3aestimation 3aimage analysis 3aequations 3aspatial data 3adata analysis 3aforest inventory 3aremote sensing 3aprecision 3aaccuracy 0aforest mapping 0anearest neighbor 0anew technology 0amethodology 0anew methods 0atechnology1 aTomppo, Erkki O.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2007 Oct. 30, v.  110, no.  4 p.412-4197nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/375613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2006.09.0343Available from publisher's Web site  a20100119b20100205c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/01/19  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02110naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001300157245003400170500002400204500001500228520062500243650001300868650002700881650001200908650001500920650000900935650001700944650002300961650001500984650001500999650002701014650001801041650001001059650001201069651001801081653002601099653002301125653002001148653001801168700001501186700001601201700002001217700002001237773009101257852000901348856011101357930003301468945002501501946000901526961000901535655001201544IND4397600220221120133405.0071108e20001031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439760022DNAL7 a10113/65662hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL200 0aD5001 aTsai, H.10aAvian blastodermal cell lines  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDisclosed herein are cultures of undifferentiated avian primordial germ cells/blastodermal cells.

The objective of this study was to determine the ability of soil solarization to reduce E. coli O157:H7 in feedlot surface material (FSM). A feedlot pen was identified in which naturally occurring E. coli O157:H7 was prevalent and evenly distributed in the FSM. Forty plots 3 by 3 m were randomly assigned such that five plots of each of the solarization times of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks were examined. Temperature loggers were placed 7.5 cm below the surface of each plot, and plots to be solarized were covered with clear 6-mil polyethylene. At each sampling time, five FSM samples were collected from each of five solarized and five unsolarized plots. E. coli concentrations and E. coli O157:H7 presence by immunomagnetic separation and plating were determined for each FSM sample. Initial percentages of E. coli O157:H7-positive samples in control and solarized FSM were 84 and 80%, respectively, and did not differ (P > 0.05). E. coli O157:H7 was no longer detectable by 8 weeks of solarization, but was still detected in unsolarized FSM at 10 weeks. The average initial concentration of E. coli in FSM was 5.56 log CFU/g and did not differ between treatments (P > 0.05). There was a 2.0-log decrease of E. coli after 1 week of solarization, and a >3.0-log reduction of E. coli by week 6 of solarization (P, 0.05). E. coli levels remained unchanged in unsolarized FSM (P > 0.05). Daily peak FSM temperatures were on average 8.7°C higher for solarized FSM compared with unsolarized FSM, and reached temperatures as high as 57°C. Because soil solarization reduces E. coli O157:H7, this technique may be useful for reduction of persistence and transmission of this pathogen in cattle production, in addition to remediation of E. coli O157:H7-contaminated soil used to grow food crops. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aanimal pens 3acattle 3acattle production 3adisinfection 3afeedlots 3afood crops 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3apolyethylene 3aremediation 3asoil 3asoil solarization 3atemperature 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEscherichia colixgrowth & development 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & development 2aFloors and Floorcoverings 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aHumans 2aManurexmicrobiology 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTemperature1 aWells, James E.0 tJournal of food protection.g2012 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.7-13wJournal:2024x1944-90977nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/539823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-2833Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/112408_2012_J_Food_Prot_75_1_7_13_Berry.pdf  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03100naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176100002300185245010900208300001800317500002400335500001500359520157200374650001201946650001101958650001201969650002601981650001302007650001302020650001402033650001102047651003102058653001502089700002302104700002202127700002002149700002402169700002302193700002102216773005602237852000902293856011202302856008602414930003302500945002502533946001102558961001302569655001202582IND4428085520221118225827.0091105e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442808552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2009.05.0232doi7 a10113/358322hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aP1201 aBoateng, Akwasi A.10aEnergy-dense liquid fuel intermediates by pyrolysis of guayule (Parthenium argentatum) shrub and bagasse  ap. 2207-2215.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aGuayule is a perennial shrub grown in the southwestern United States that is used to produce high quality, natural rubber latex. However, only about 10% of the plant material is used for latex production; the remaining biomass, called bagasse, can be used for renewable fuel production. Fast pyrolysis of guayule, both whole shrub and bagasse was performed. From both feedstocks a very viscous, high energy content (approximately 30 MJ/kg) pyrolysis liquid (bio-oil) was produced in yields averaging over 60% without any catalyst. The properties and compositions of the bio-oils were found to be similar in the two feedstocks. Co-products, charcoal (20-30 wt%) and non-condensable gas (5-15%), were also dense and had a high energy content. Of the two feedstocks, the whole shrub yielded higher quantities of charcoal that also had a higher energy content than the charcoal produced from bagasse. As a result, the energy recovery, estimated as the percentage of the energy products, to energy input into the reactor was lower (60%) for guayule bagasse than for the whole shrub (73%). This notwithstanding, the bagasse is a more attractive feedstock for thermochemical conversion, not only because it is a residue from a primary process (latex extraction) that is on-site, but also because it has a high energy content. Moreover, it produces high quality pyrolysis products. Co-production of latex rubber from the whole shrub and renewable fuels from the residual bagasse by pyrolysis should improve the already positive economics of the guayule latex rubber industry. 3abagasse 3ashrubs 3aguayule 3aParthenium argentatum 3abiofuels 3acharcoal 3apyrolysis 3ayields 3aSouthwestern United States 0abyproducts1 aMullen, Charles A.1 aGoldberg, Neil M.1 aHicks, Kevin B.1 aMcMahan, Colleen M.1 aWhalen, Maureen C.1 aCornish, Katrina0 tFuel.g2009 Nov., v.  88, no.  11 p.2207-22157nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/358323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2009.05.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/11/20  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01309naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001600157245008100173500002400254520011000278650002100388650001400409650002200423650002000445650001400465650001100479650000900490650001200499651001800511653001700529653002000546700001600566773009700582852000900679856011100688930003300799945002500832946000900857961000900866655001200875IND4397311420221120032516.0071029e20070619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439731142DNAL7 a10113/71052hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aX300 0aD5001 aMayer, G.E.10aAssays employing novel substrates for measuring P450-mediated N-dealkylation  aIncludes references  aMethods and compositions for measuring N-dealkylating activity of cytochromes P450 enyzmes are disclosed. 3acytochrome P-450 3aoxidation 3aenzyme substrates 3aenzyme activity 3aacridines 3aamines 3aUSDA 3apatents 3aUnited States 0adealkylation 0adrug metabolism1 aMayer, R.T.0 tUnited States Department of Agriculture patents.g2007 June 19, , no.

The dynamic mechanical properties of the highly modified and cuticle-rich forewings (elytra) from Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle) wild-type and body color mutant strains were investigated to relate body coloration and elytral mechanical properties. There was no statistically significant variation in the storage modulus E′ among the elytra from jet, cola, sooty and black mutants or between the mutants and the wild-type GA-1 strain: E′ averaged 5.1 ± 0.6 GPa regardless of body color. E′ is a power law function of oscillation frequency for all types. The power law exponent, n, averaged 0.032 ± 0.001 for elytra from all genotypes except black; this small value indicated that the elytra are cross-linked. Black elytra, however, displayed a significantly larger n of 0.047 ± 0.004 and an increased loss tangent (tan δ), suggesting that metabolic differences in the black mutant strain result in elytra that are less cross-linked and more pigmented than the other types. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that black elytra have a β-alanine-deficient and dopamine-abundant metabolism, leading to greater melanin (black pigment) production, probably at the expense of cross-linking of cuticular proteins mediated by N-β-alanyldopamine quinone. 3aTribolium castaneum 3amutants 3ainsect morphology 3ainsect cuticle 3apigmentation 3amechanical properties 3awings 3asclerotization1 aArakane, Yasuyuki1 aKramer, Karl J.1 aBeeman, Richard W.1 aKanost, Michael R.1 aGehrke, Stevin H.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2010 Dec., v.  56, no.  12 p.1901-1906x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/458743Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.08.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20101124b20101204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/11/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03280naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092024002100132040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189245015000198300001800348500002400366500001500390520176800405650001302173650001802186650001402204650001602218650001902234650001302253650002102266650001302287650001102300650001402311653001802325700002102343700002102364720001702385773009102402852000902493856011202502856009002614930003302704945002502737946001102762961001302773655001202786IND4444525920221121222459.0101105e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444452592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.08.0172doi7 a10113/458752hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL300 0aL00110aTiming of eclosion affects diapause development, fat body consumption and longevity in Osmia lignaria, a univoltine, adult-wintering solitary bee  ap. 1949-1957.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMost insects from temperate areas enter diapause ahead of winter. Species diapausing in a feeding stage and accumulating metabolic reserves during permissive pre-wintering conditions are expected to enter diapause shortly before the onset of winter. In contrast, species diapausing in a non-feeding stage are expected to lower their metabolism as soon as possible to avoid excessive consumption of metabolic reserves. The solitary bee Osmia lignaria winters as a non-feeding adult within its cocoon, but previous studies show important weight losses and increased winter mortality in populations pre-wintered for extended periods. We measured respiration rates to assess diapause initiation and maintenance during pre-wintering, and tested whether timing of adult eclosion affected fitness by measuring fat body depletion, winter mortality and post-winter longevity. We worked with different cohorts of a population reared under natural conditions, and manipulated pre-wintering duration in a population reared under artificial conditions. In agreement with our expectation, O. lignaria lower their metabolic rates within a few days of adult eclosion, but nonetheless suffer strong weight loss during pre-wintering. Early developing individuals suffer greater weight loss and fat body depletion, and have short post-winter longevity. Although, we found no differences in winter mortality among treatments, our results indicate that increased mortality may occur in years with late winter arrivals. We discuss fundamental ecophysiological differences between adult and prepupal diapause within the Megachilidae, and hypothesize that species wintering as adults will be more negatively affected by a situation of extended summers under a scenario of global warming. 3aeclosion 3aoverwintering 3alongevity 3abody weight 3aOsmia lignaria 3afat body 3acell respiration 3adiapause 3aimagos 3amortality 0aadult insects1 aSgolastra, Fabio1 aKemp, William P.  aBosch, Jordi0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2010 Dec., v.  56, no.  12 p.1949-1957x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/458753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.08.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20110908b20111007c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/11/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02220naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092024002100118040001800139072000900157072000900166100001600175245010200191300001800293500002400311500001500335520077200350650001401122650002201136650002001158650002001178650001401198650001701212650001301229650002301242653002201265653001001287653002201297700001401319700002301333773010301356852000901459856011201468856007601580930003301656945002501689946001101714961001301725655001201738IND4418148220221121071959.0090323e20081031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441814822DNAL7 a10.1002/esp.17352doi7 a10113/276502hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aX1001 aHuang, Ning14aThe effects of slope and slope position on local and upstream fluid threshold friction velocities  ap. 1814-1823.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aIn deserts, dunes are common aeolian landforms, and parallel ridges are common in cultivated land. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is used to simulate a stable wind blowing over slope beds of varying height and coupled with the slope-compensating fluid threshold friction velocity formula. The model accurately reproduced patterns of flow deceleration at the slope toe and stoss flow acceleration. Based on the CFD-based model, quantitative analyses of slope gradient and particle position on the initiation of particle movement are performed. Results indicate that the slope has a great influence on particle saltation in the windward slope, and the initiation of particle movement is particularly sensitive to particle position with respect to the slope. 3aparticles 3asimulation models 3aeolian deposits 3afluid mechanics 3aequations 3awind erosion 3avelocity 3alandscape position 0aflow acceleration 0aslope 0afriction velocity1 aShi, Feng1 aVan Pelt, R.

Candargy is a diploid, wild relative of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Previous studies showed that D. villosum chromosome 1V has genes that encode seed storage proteins that may be used to enhance the grain quality of bread wheat. As a first step in genetic transfer, the present study was initiated to develop compensating Robertsonian translocations involving wheat chromosome 1D and D. villosum chromosome 1V and to analyze their effects on grain quality. A monosomic 1D stock was crossed with the disomic addition stock DA1V#3 and the double monosomic plants (20" + 1D' + 1V#3') were self pollinated. Two co-dominant STS markers (BE499250 and BE591682) polymorphic for the short arm of 1V#3S and two dominant STS markers (BE518358 and BE585781) polymorphic for the long arm of 1V#3L were developed to screen a large number of progeny to identify plants that had only the 1V#3S or 1V#3L arms. Five compensating Robertsonian heterozygous translocations, two (plants #56 and #83) for the short arm (T1DL·1V#3S) and three (plants #7, #123, and #208) for the long arm (T1DS·1V#3L) were identified from 282 F₂ plants and confirmed by genomic in situ hybridization and C-banding analyses. Two homozygous translocations T1DL·1V#3S (plants #14 and #39) were identified from 52 F₃ plants derived from F₂ plant #83. Four homozygous translocations T1DS·1V#3L (plants #3, #22, #29, and #30) were identified from 68 F₃ plants derived from F₂ plant #208. The homozygous translocation T1DL·1V#3S had a significantly higher (37.4 ml) and T1DS·1V#3L had significantly lower (10 ml) Zeleny sedimentation values compared to Chinese Spring wheat (30.7 ml). Our results showed that 1V#3S increased gluten strength and enhanced wheat quality, but 1V#3L decreased gluten strength and did not enhance wheat quality. 3awheat 3aDasypyrum villosum 3achromosome translocation 3agenetic markers 3awild plants 3aintergeneric hybridization 3adiploidy 3aTriticum aestivum 3awild relatives 3aselfing 3agenetic polymorphism 3astorage proteins 3atranslocation lines 3achromosomes 3adominance (genetics) 3awheat gluten 3acrop quality 3aheterozygosity 3aagronomic traits 3ahomozygosity 3agermplasm screening 0aRobertsonian translocation 0agluten 0aplant breeding 0asedimentation values1 aQi, Lili1 aGao, Xiang1 aZhang, Gaisheng1 aDong, Jian1 aChen, Qijiao1 aFriebe, Bernd1 aGill, B.

The most immediate threat to butternut restoration is the spread of butternut canker disease, caused by the exotic fungus Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum Nair, Kostichka & Kuntz. Other threats include the hybridization of butternut with the exotic Japanese walnut (Juglans ailantifolia Carr.) and poor regeneration. The hybrids, known as buartnuts, are vegetatively vigorous, highly fecund, more resistant than butternut to butternut canker disease and difficult to identify. We review the vegetative and reproductive morphological traits that distinguish butternut from hybrids and identify those that can be used by field biologists to separate the taxa. No single trait was sufficient to separate butternut from hybrids, but pith color, lenticel size, shape and abundance, and the presence or absence of a notch in the upper margin of leaf scars, can be used in combination with other traits to identify butternuts and exclude most hybrids. In at least one butternut population, reduced symptoms of butternut canker disease were significantly associated with a dark barked phenotype. We also describe two randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers that differentiate butternuts from hybrids based on DNA polymorphism. Together, these results should assist in the identification and testing of non-hybrid butternut for breeding and reintroduction of the species to its former habitats. 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aJuglans ailantifolia 3ahybrids 3afungal diseases of plants 3aJuglans cinerea 3agenotype 3adisease resistance 3acankers (plants) 3agenetic variation 3aSirococcus 3aplant morphology 3agenetic polymorphism 0atraits 0aconservation genetics 0ahybrid identification1 aHuang, Zhonglian1 aMcKenna, James1 aOstry, Michael1 aWoeste, Keith0 tTree physiology.g2008 July, v.  28, no.  7 p.1127-1133x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/212043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/10/20  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle04070naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024001900134024002200153024002100175040001800196072000900214100002400223245008600247300001800333500002400351506007600375520208900451506003702540650003302577650003202610650001902642650001402661650001402675650001402689650002102703650001602724650001302740650003302753650003402786650001402820650008002834650001102914650001302925650002502938650003302963650003402996700002103030700002003051700001603071773008203087852000903169856011203178856009203290930003303382945002503415946001303440961001503453655001203468IND4431211020221207125236.0100112e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443121102DNAL7 a10.1128/JVI.79.13.8506-8518.20052doi7 a159565932pmid7 aPMC11437412pmcid7 a10113/375502hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aO’Donnell, Vivian10aAnalysis of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Internalization Events in Cultured Cells  ap. 8506-8518.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt has been demonstrated that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) can utilize at least four members of the αV subgroup of the integrin family of receptors in vitro. The virus interacts with these receptors via a highly conserved arginine-glycine-aspartic acid amino acid sequence motif located within the ssG-ssH loop of VP1. While there have been extensive studies of virus-receptor interactions at the cell surface, our understanding of the events during viral entry into the infected cell is still not clear. We have utilized confocal microscopy to analyze the entry of two FMDV serotypes (types A and O) after interaction with integrin receptors at the cell surface. In cell cultures expressing both the αVss3 and αVss6 integrins, virus adsorbed to the cells at 4°C appears to colocalize almost exclusively with the αVss6 integrin. Upon shifting the infected cells to 37°C, FMDV capsid proteins were detected within 15 min after the temperature shift, in association with the integrin in vesicular structures that were positive for a marker of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In contrast, virus did not colocalize with a marker for caveola-mediated endocytosis. Virus remained associated with the integrin until about 1 h after the temperature shift, when viral proteins appeared around the perinuclear region of the cell. By 15 min after the temperature shift, viral proteins were seen colocalizing with a marker for early endosomes, while no colocalization with late endosomal markers was observed. In the presence of monensin, which raises the pH of endocytic vesicles and has been shown to inhibit FMDV replication, viral proteins were not released from the recycling endosome structures. Viral proteins were not observed associated with the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi. These data indicate that FMDV utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway to infect the cells and that viral replication begins due to acidification of endocytic vesicles, causing the breakdown of the viral capsid structure and release of the genome by an as-yet-unidentified mechanism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3acultured cells 3ainfection 3areceptors 3aintegrins 3abinding capacity 3aendocytosis 3aclathrin 3aprotein-protein interactions 2aAntibodies, Viralxphysiology 2aCell Line 2aFoot-and-Mouth Disease Virusxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aReceptors, Virusxphysiology 2aVirus Replicationxphysiology1 aLaRocco, Michael1 aDuque, Hernando1 aBaxt, Barry0 tJournal of virology.g2005 July, v.  79, no.  13 p.8506-8518x1098-55147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/375503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.79.13.8506-8518.20053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/15  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02409naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092024002100135040001800156072000900174072000900183100002000192245007400212300001600286500002400302500001500326520078700341650002201128650001901150650002201169650001701191650001901208650002001227650001901247650000901266650002301275650002101298650002101319650002601340650001601366650002101382650002101403653001901424700001701443773012301460852000901583856011201592856009301704930003301797945002501830946001101855961001301866655001201879IND4430525220221120234156.0091226e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443052522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.10.0052doi7 a10113/393972hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ2011 aRasooly, Reuven10aShiga toxin Stx2 is heat-stable and not inactivated by pasteurization  ap. 290-294.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli have been associated with food-borne illnesses. Pasteurization is used to inhibit microbial growth in milk, and an open question is whether milk pasteurization inactivates Shiga toxins. To answer this question we measured Shiga toxin's inhibition effect on Vero cell dehydrogenase activity and protein synthesis. Our data demonstrate that Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) is heat-stable and that pasteurization of milk, at the various suggested temperatures and times by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, (63°C for 30min, or 72°C for 15s or 89°C for 1s), did not reduce the biological activity of Stx2. However, treatment at 100°C for 5min inactivated the toxin. These data demonstrate that Stx2 is not inactivated by conventional pasteurization. 3aprotein synthesis 3aheat stability 3apathogen survival 3ainactivation 3apasteurization 3arisk assessment 3afood pathogens 3amilk 3aShiga-like toxin 2 3amicrobial growth 3ain vitro studies 3abiological resistance 3afood safety 3apasteurized milk 3aEscherichia coli 0aheat treatment1 aDo, Paula M.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2010 Jan. 1, v.  136, no.  3 p.290-294dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393973Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.10.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/02/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02370naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092024002100132040001800153072000900171072000900180100001700189245010300206300001600309500002400325520101400349650002301363650002901386650001201415650002601427650002201453650002501475650001901500650002101519700002101540773009401561852000901655856011201664856009001776930003301866945002501899946001101924961001301935655001201948IND4430224820221120223252.0091218e20100501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.09.0832doi7 a10113/393982hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS2001 aLin, Long-Ze10aIdentification of the phenolic components of chrysanthemum flower (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat)  ap. 319-326.  aIncludes references  aA standardised profiling method based on liquid chromatography with diode array and electrospray ionisation/mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI/MS) was used to identify 46 flavonoids and 17 caffeic acid derivatives in the aqueous methanol extract of Flos chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat) (Compositae), an important Chinese herb. Fifteen caffeoylquinic acids and 15 flavonoids were positively identified and the remaining compounds were provisionally identified. The detected phenolics were present at concentrations greater than 0.001% of the dry plant material. Many of these phenolics have been reported to have human health benefits. Twenty-five compounds, including C-glycosylated flavones and aliphatic acid-containing caffeoylquinic acids, are reported for the first time in chrysanthemum flower, and this comprehensive analysis of the phenolic components of herb Flos chrysanthemum will be helpful for the quality control of this herb and its products, and to understand the usage and function. 3aphenolic compounds 3aChrysanthemum morifolium 3aflowers 3aliquid chromatography 3achemical analysis 3achemical composition 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal plants1 aHarnly, James M.0 tFood chemistry.g2010 May 1, v.  120, no.  1 p.319-326dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393983Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.09.0833Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/10  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02620naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001400149245004100163300001800204500005600222500002400278520108700302650002101389650001101410650003101421650001601452650002201468650001901490650001601509650001301525650002801538650001401566650002501580650002201605650001801627650002001645653001701665653002701682653003201709653001501741700001801756700002101774773007801795852000901873856011201882930003301994945002502027946001302052961001302065655001202078IND4402933820221119140524.0080318s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440293382DNAL7 a10113/123572hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX2001 aFoulk, J.10aTrash identification in mill laydown  ap. 2402-2410.  aConference held January 5-9, 2004, San Antonio, TX.  aIncludes references  aCotton trash is known to affect textile-processing efficiency. Removal of cotton trash has often been a means to improve textile spinning. To combat trash and efficiency problems, Hamrick Mills (as do other textile mills) specifies cotton bales, which they acquire, should be no higher than a 3 leaf for processing on their Murata Airjet Spinner (MJS) or Murata Vortex Spinner (MVS). This leaf grade cut-off point is based on their past spinning experiences which point toward processing problems during weaving and excessive loom stops. This research determined how HVI Trashmeter software evaluates cotton trash and its particle size distribution in a 40-bale textile mill laydown. This study compared the distribution of particles within all bales and how similar these bales were to one another. The study further compared the change in trash particle distribution and HVI properties through the bales. Further work is needed to determine if leaf grade or trash particle distribution provide enough information for the measurement of cotton trash in high speed textile spinning. 3acotton gin trash 3aleaves 3aparticle size distribution 3aseed cotton 3acomputer software 3acotton ginning 3alint cotton 3aspinning 3ahigh volume instruments 3aparticles 3aspatial distribution 3acomputer analysis 3afiber quality 3aproblem solving 0acotton bales 0aHVITrashmeter software 0atrash particle distribution 0aleaf grade1 aMcAlister, D.1 aKulasekera, K.B.0 tProceedings of the Beltwide Cotton Conferences.g2004,  p.2402-24107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03132naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162072000900171100001800180245008300198300001800281500002400299520166000323650002301983650003202006650002102038650002402059650002302083650001302106650001402119650001802133650001002151650001202161650001502173700002402188700002502212700002102237700002102258773007502279852000902354856011202363856008102475930003302556945002502589946001102614961001302625655001202638IND4431212620221121035603.0100112e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443121262DNAL7 a10.1099/mic.0.27824-02doi7 a10113/375522hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aX3501 aPham, Vinh D.10aMutations affecting predation ability of the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus  ap. 1865-1874.  aIncludes references  aMyxococcus xanthus genetic mutants with characterized phenotypes were analysed for the ability to prey on susceptible bacteria. Quantification of predatory ability was scored by a newly developed method under conditions in which prey bacteria provided the only source of nutrients. These results were corroborated by data derived using a previously published protocol that measures predation in the presence of limited external nutrients. First, early developmental regulatory mutants were examined, because their likely functions in assessing the local nutrient status were predicted to be also important for predation. The results showed that predation efficiency is reduced by 64-80 % for mutants of three A-signalling components, AsgA, AsgC and AsgE, but not for AsgB. This suggests that an Asg regulon function that is separate from A-signal production is needed for predation. Besides the Asg components, mutations in the early developmental genes sdeK and csgA were also consistently observed to reduce predatory efficacy by 36 and 33 %, respectively. In contrast, later developmental components, such as DevRS, 4406 and PhoP4, did not appear to play significant roles in predation. The predatory abilities of mutants defective for motility were also tested. The data showed that adventurous, but not social, motility is required for predation in the assay. Also, mutants for components in the chemotaxis-like Frz system were found to be reduced in predation efficiency by between 62 and 85 %. In sum, it was demonstrated here that defects in development and development-related processes affect the ability of M. xanthus to prey on other bacteria. 3aMyxococcus xanthus 3apredator-prey relationships 3aEscherichia coli 3aSerratia marcescens 3amicrobial genetics 3amutation 3apredation 3asoil bacteria 3agenes 3amutants 3achemotaxis1 aShebelut, Conrad W.1 aDiodati, Michelle E.1 aBull, Carolee T.1 aSinger, Mitchell0 tMicrobiology.g2005 June, v.  151, no.  6 p.1865-1874x1608-32377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/375523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.27824-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/15  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01686naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148072000900157100001600166245002800182500002400210520038900234650002200623650001900645650001500664650002000679650002500699650002000724650001400744650002000758650001300778650001700791650001200808650000900820651001800829653001900847700002000866700001900886773009100905852000900996856011101005930003301116945002501149946000901174961000901183655001201192IND4397597920221120133515.0071108e20000425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439759792DNAL7 a10113/65642hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL001 0aD5001 aMayer, M.S.10aSex pheromone synergist  aIncludes references  aDisclosed is the compound 6-vinyldecanal and its use as a sex pheromone synergist.

The objective of this study was to examine management and landscape effects on water stable soil aggregates (WSA), soil carbon, soil nitrogen, enzyme activity, and microbial community DNA content. Treatments were row crop (RC), grass buffer (GB), agroforestry buffer (AG), and grass waterways (GWW). A corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation under no-till management was established in a watershed in northeast Missouri in 1991; grass buffers were implemented in 1997. Grass buffers, 4.5m wide and 36.5m apart, consisted of a mixture of redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth), brome grass (Bromus spp.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) on contour within the watershed. Agroforestry buffers have pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.) trees distributed down the center of the grass buffers on one half of the watershed. Soils were collected from two transects extending from the summit to lower landscape positions within the grass and agroforestry portions of the watershed in June 2006. Soil enzymes studied include: fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, β-glucosidase, glucosaminidase, and dehydrogenase. Soil DNA content was determined as an alternative for microbial biomass. WSA was significantly different among treatments and landscape positions. WSA decreased from GWW>AG>GB>RC management treatments and also decreased from lower>middle>summit landscape positions. Soil carbon and nitrogen were highest for the GWW treatment and lowest for RC. The landscape position effect was significant for RC and AG treatments. Fluorescein diacetate, β-glucosidase and glucosaminidase enzyme activities were significantly higher in buffers and GWW areas than RC areas. Dehydrogenase activity was different between grass (GB and GWW) and crop areas. The landscape effect was insignificant for enzyme activity. Although soil DNA may be a good indicator of microbial biomass, it did not appear to differentiate among management systems as selectively as other microbial parameters.

Despite recent measurement in United States streams, caffeine's effect on freshwater organisms is not well documented. The present study measured caffeine's lethal and sublethal effects on the freshwater species, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Pimephales promelas, and Chironomus dilutus. These organisms, which are used in standard testing or effluent monitoring, were exposed to aqueous caffeine solutions under static exposure for 48 hours and daily renewed static exposure for 7 days. Averaged responses of 48-hour acute end points indicated that C. dubia was more sensitive to caffeine exposures (LC₅₀ = 60 mg/L) than either P. promelas (LC₅₀ = 100 mg/L) or C. dilutus (LC₅₀ = 1,230 mg/L). Exposure-response slopes confirmed these findings (3% mortality/mg/L for C. dubia; 0.5% mortality/mg/L for P. promelas; and 0.07% mortality/mg/L for C. dilutus). Comparative 7-day responses between C. dubia and P. promelas (LC₅₀ = 46 and 55 mg/L, respectively) were more similar than the broad range of acute values. Sublethal effects measured for caffeine exposure included impaired C. dubia reproduction (IC₅₀ = 44 mg/L) and inhibited P. promelas growth (IC₅₀ = 71 mg/L). According to the results of this study, combined with earlier studies reporting environmental concentrations and product half-lives, caffeine should pose negligible risk for most aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. 3awater pollution 3amidges 3acaffeine 3afreshwater 3aanimal growth 3alethal dose 50 3adose response 3aCeriodaphnia dubia 3aChironomus dilutus 3aanimal reproduction 3apollutants 3afreshwater fish 3aaquatic arthropods 3aPimephales promelas 3atoxicity testing 3awastewater 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aCaffeinextoxicity 2aChironomidaexdrug effects 2aCladoceraxdrug effects 2aCyprinidae 2aLethal Dose 50 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aChironomus1 aGreenway, S.

  1 aDjonović, S.10aSm1, a Proteinaceous Elicitor Secreted by the Biocontrol Fungus Trichoderma virens Induces Plant Defense Responses and Systemic Resistance  ap. 838-853.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe soilborne filamentous fungus Trichoderma virens is a biocontrol agent with a well-known ability to produce antibiotics, parasitize pathogenic fungi, and induce systemic resistance in plants. Even though a plant-mediated response has been confirmed as a component of bioprotection by Trichoderma spp., the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification, purification, and characterization of an elicitor secreted by T. virens, a small protein designated Sm1 (small protein 1). Sm1 lacks toxic activity against plants and microbes. Instead, native, purified Sm1 triggers production of reactive oxygen species in monocot and dicot seedlings, rice, and cotton, and induces the expression of defense-related genes both locally and systemically in cotton. Gene expression analysis revealed that SM1 is expressed throughout fungal development under different nutrient conditions and in the presence of a host plant. Using an axenic hydroponic system, we show that SM1 expression and secretion of the protein is significantly higher in the presence of the plant. Pretreatment of cotton cotyledons with Sm1 provided high levels of protection to the foliar pathogen Colletotrichum sp. These results indicate that Sm1 is involved in the induction of resistance by Trichoderma spp. through the activation of plant defense mechanisms. 3arice 3aOryza sativa 3areactive oxygen species 3aColletotrichum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asystemic acquired resistance 3aTrichoderma virens 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abiological control agents 3afungal diseases of plants 3agene expression 3ahost plants 3aamino acid sequences 3aresistance mechanisms 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3acotton 3asoil fungi 3aphytotoxicity 3anutrient availability 3acotyledons 3afungal proteins 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aColletotrichumxphysiology 2aCotyledonxanatomy & histologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxphysiologyxsecretion. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGossypiumxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aImmunity, Innatexphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aTrichodermaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aTrichoderma 0aHypocrea virens 0amolecular sequence data 0afungal elicitors1 aPozo, M.J.1 aDangott, L.J.1 aHowell, C.R.1 aKenerley, C.M.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2006 Aug., v.  19, no.  8 p.838-853wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-19-08383Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071128b20071210c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03048naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150072000900168072000900177100002400186245009100210300001600301500002400317520116200341650001801503650002501521650002901546650002701575650002201602650001801624650002201642650004801664650004301712650002101755650001201776650002301788650002401811650002601835650002001861651001201881653003301893653002301926653002201949700001601971700001801987700002002005700001802025700001602043773009702059852000902156856011202165856008702277930003302364945002502397946001102422961001302433655001202446IND4403531820221119140727.0080325e20071206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440353182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2007.07.0032doi7 a10113/123642hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aM0011 aOlivares-Fuster, O.10aHost-specific association between Flavobacterium columnare genomovars and fish species  ap. 624-633.  aIncludes references  aA total of 90 Flavobacterium columnare isolates were recovered from predominant wild fish species in the Mobile River, Alabama, USA. Isolates were identified and confirmed by fatty acid methyl ester analysis and specific PCR amplification. Genomovar ascription was performed using 16S-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The majority of genomovar I isolates were recovered from threadfin shad while genomovar II isolates came from catfish (including channel and blue catfish). Additional genotyping methods, including multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), internal spacer region-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (ISR-SSCP) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), confirmed a clear division of the isolates into two groups that matched genomovar ascription. Fingerprinting methods revealed a higher genetic diversity within genomovar II isolates. Our data confirmed the coexistence of F. columnare genomovars I and II in a natural environment. A statistically significant association between genomovar I and threadfin shad was demonstrated while genomovar II strains were mainly recovered from catfish species. 3afish diseases 3abacterial infections 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aGram-negative bacteria 3agenetic variation 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3ahost specificity 3acatfish 3aIctalurus furcatus 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aAplodinotus grunniens 3afreshwater fish 3aAlabama 0amultilocus sequence analysis 0acolumnaris disease 0aDrosoma petenense1 aBaker, J.L.1 aTerhune, J.S.1 aShoemaker, C.A.1 aKlesius, P.H.1 aArias, C.R.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2007 Dec. 6, v.  30, no.  8 p.624-633x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123643Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2007.07.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/03/31  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04343naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150100001700168245007000185300001200255500001500267506017300282520208700455592002802542650001502570650001502585650002002600650001602620650001502636650001402651650001702665650001502682650001002697650001102707650001302718650003002731650002502761650002002786650000902806650001502815650001402830650001502844650002402859650002202883650001502905650001902920650002202939650001202961650001902973650000902992650001703001650001803018650001003036651001603046653002303062653002303085653002303108653001403131653003303145653002503178773008603203852000903289856011203298856008703410956011103497961001303608655001203621IND4462627520221123011244.0120119e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446262752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2011.11.0112doi7 a10113/539792hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCullum, R.F.10aInfluence of tillage on maize yield in soil with shallow fragipan  ap. 1-6.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA genuine concern for landowners and other stake holders is whether conservation tillage contaminates shallow groundwater even though it greatly reduces erosion. A six-year continuous maize (Zea mays L.) study that compared yields from no-tillage (NT), reduced-tillage (RT), and conventional-tillage (CT) was conducted in the upland hills of northern Mississippi on 4–6% sloping soils overlying a shallow fragipan. The objective was to test the hypothesis that neither no-tillage nor reduced-tillage has the same effect on maize crop as conventional-tillage on soils with a shallow water restricted layer. The study showed conservation tillage had fewer detrimental effects on the water quality in runoff and shallow groundwater and promoted more soil water for crop use during the growing season than conventional tillage. With adequate weed control, NT produced higher yields than CT on these silt loam soils due to soil water conservation. However, inadequate weed control occurred in several years of the study along with above normal rain resulting in lower NT maize yields than CT yields. Significant differences in maize yield were found for type of tillage, year, and tillage-year interaction. These differences were explained by a tillage system's ability to conserve soil water and control weeds. Other results included low sediment amounts lost from NT maize plots and insignificant free water quantities at the fragipan's surface during the cropping season for all tillage systems. Maximum groundwater movement across the surface of the fragipan occurred during the non-cropping season under soil profile saturation. Amount, timing, and distribution of rainfall rather than tillage system primarily influenced agrichemical movement from maize systems in this study. Some form of conservation tillage that decreases or prevents erosion will be required on sloping lands with shallow fragipan to sustain long term continuous corn production. Information from this study provides additional guidance for making tillage and pesticide management recommendations to farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3ano-tillage 3acrop yield 3asilt loam soils 3agroundwater 3alandowners 3asediments 3aweed control 3airrigation 3ahills 3arunoff 3aZea mays 3agroundwater contamination 3aconventional tillage 3areduced tillage 3acorn 3acorn soils 3ahighlands 3asoil water 3adiagnostic horizons 3atopographic slope 3apesticides 3awater quantity 3asoil conservation 3afarmers 3agrowing season 3arain 3asoil erosion 3asoil profiles 3acrops 3aMississippi 0a

To date, there have been no reports of the parasite in cattle residing in northern portions of the US. An 8-year-old cow (MaineAnjouxAnguscross-bred) in Michigan presented with hemoglobinuria and a packed cell volume of 9. Blood films stained with Giemsa showed numerous intraerythrocytic parasites morphologically consistent with T. buffeli. The parasite was confirmed to be T. buffeli by SSU rRNA gene sequence analysis (SSU rRNA sequence, Type A).

This watershed encompasses 280,000 ha, and 60% the area is in agricultural crops of corn and soybeans. Daily streamflow calibration and validation were completed before starting pesticide calibration. During the validation period, Nash-Sutcliffe values varied from 0.33 to 0.60 for daily streamflow and between 0.64 and 0.74 for monthly streamflow. The estimation of the timing of atrazine application was very important in the calibration-validation process, and it proved to be a key input for predicting the amount and timing of pesticide released to streams. Monthly atrazine concentrations were predicted with average R2 values of 0.60 and 0.49 and average Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.38 and -0.91 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. The total mass of atrazine released by the whole basin between 2000 and 2003, for the period April to September, was closely predicted by the model. The observed average amount of atrazine released during the four seasons was 1002.1 kg/season, and SWAT predicted 950.1 kg/season. Risk analysis was performed based on the outputs generated by the model by computation of exceedance probability curves and thematic and probability maps. The model was suitable to estimate levels of atrazine released to streams in rural watersheds and to conduct NPS pollution risk analysis at a basin scale to evaluate long-term effects of management practices and environmental changes. 3aatrazine 3awater quality 3aagricultural runoff 3arisk assessment 3awatersheds 3astreams 3anonpoint source pollution 3amodel validation 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 3aIndiana 3aMichigan 3aOhio 0apesticides1 aEngel, B.A.1 aFlanagan, D.C.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v.  49, no.  3 p.667-6787nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/13673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110825b20110902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/05/12  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03374naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130100001900139245012000158300001600278500002400294520204200318650001102360650002002371650001402391650001402405650001802419650002002437650001902457650001902476650002202495650002402517650001102541651001402552700001602566700001602582700002002598773009402618852000902712856011102721930003302832945002502865946001302890961001302903655001202916IND4369277820221123004834.0050426e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436927782DNAL7 a10113/17212hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ8001 aKornecki, T.S.10aPolyacrylamide (PAM) application effectiveness in reducing soil erosion from sugarcane fields in southern Louisiana  ap. 189-196.  aIncludes references  aIntense storm events on slowly permeable alluvial soils in southern Louisiana sugarcane fields cause significant soil erosion. Sediment-bonded pesticides and nutrients are washed from the field and sediment fills surface drainage channels (quarter-drains) within the field and increases the cost of maintaining the ditch system. A field experiment was conducted in the spring of 2002 to determine the effectiveness of Polyacrylamide (PAM) in reducing soil erosion from quarter-drains in fields planted to sugarcane. Eroded quarter-drain depth and soil loss per meter were measured after six rainfall events that occurred between 28 March and 1 July and produced a total cumulative rainfall of 368 mm. In March 2002 PAM was sprayed as an aqueous solution directly on newly installed quarter-drains at a rate of 18 kg ha(-1). The relative depth of erosion was measured after each storm event using plastic rulers, which were inserted into the bottom of quarter-drains using a custom made tool. When applied directly to the primary quarter-drains, PAM significantly reduced erosion depth by 76% compared with the no-PAM application. PAM was most effective for the first three storm events (cumulative rainfall depth of 161 mm) with an average 88% reduction in soil depth loss. Based on one year of study in St. Gabriel, Louisiana, PAM sprayed as an aqueous solution in a single application was effective in reducing soil erosion for the quarter-drain systems during the 4-month period after PAM application under normal Southern Louisiana weather condition. For soil with an average bulk density of 1500 kg m(-3), the average reduction in soil loss for PAM treated quarter-drain was 0.65 kg m(-1) of the primary quarter-drain for six events. At transition points between primary and secondary quarter-drains where PAM was not applied, a gradual deterioration of the side walls of the quarter-drain was visible. The original shape of semicircular quarter-drains was preserved through six consecutive storms events for plots treated with PAM. 3afields 3acrop production 3asugarcane 3aSaccharum 3awater erosion 3aerosion control 3apolyacrylamide 3asoil treatment 3adrainage channels 3aagricultural runoff 3astorms 3aLouisiana1 aGrigg, B.C.1 aFouss, J.L.1 aSouthwick, L.M.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2005 Mar., v.  21, no.  2 p.189-196x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/17213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070801b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01923naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002000149245009900169300001600268500014400284500002400428520061000452650004001062650001701102650001401119650002101133650001401154650002101168651001501189700001601204700001701220773007301237852000901310856011201319930003301431945002501464946001101489961001301500655001201513IND4411821420221121041607.0081023e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441182142DNAL7 a10113/231802hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF9001 aHarivandi, M.A.13aAn on-site study of bentgrasses for quality, speed, thatch depth and annual bluegrass invasion  ap. 133-138.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Horticultural Plants in Urban and Peri-Urban Life, held August 13-19, 2006, Seoul, Korea.  aIncludes references  aThe industry trend to faster golf putting greens has led to recent development of high density creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.) cultivars that tolerate very close mowing.

Approximately 15,000 cal. yrs B.P, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) overrode the watershed during the last glacial maximum and deposited glacial drift that provides the substratum for soil formation today. Since then, the watershed has been blanketed by tephra from Mount Mazama, Glacier Peak, and Mount St. Helens. Soils with the gross morphology of Spodosols (Podzols) and Andisols (Andosols) occur in a complex landscape mosaic in TCW and along the entire Washington Cascade Range. The pedologic conundrum addressed in this paper is whether true Spodosols are forming in these areas, or are they mimics of Spodosols? Based on field morphology and lab analysis, soils in TCW are andic subgroups of Spodosols and Andisols in approximately equal abundance, with lesser areas of Inceptisols (Cambisols) and some Entisols (Gleysols). Field morphology and electron microprobe analysis of glass shards shows that the major volume of tephra, about 8 cm compacted thickness, is predominantly from the eruption of Mount Mazama 7600 cal. yrs BP. Tephra from this eruption has been mixed into the upper 50 cm of glacial drift and colluvium. Fallout from other eruptions in TCW had individual compacted thicknesses less than 2 cm. We conclude that true Spodosols are widespread in TCW; they have albic and spodic horizons. No pseudo-albic horizons of white, unweathered tephra layers were found in TCW. The cold, wet, and dominantly conifer-covered landscape supports podzolization in tephra-rich materials on parts of landforms that have been stable for several thousand years. Andisols are forming in drier microclimates, on gravitationally active landscapes, and under herbaceous vegetation. Inceptisols dominate landforms controlled by water erosion and deposition, where tephra has not been preserved in the soil, and on active avalanche chutes. Entisols were found only on active or recent floodplains. The distribution of each soil order in TCW corresponds to the preservation of tephra, vegetation type, and stability of the landform. 3atopography 3aglacial deposits 3aAndisols 3alandforms 3awatersheds 3aSpodosols 3asoil morphology 3aInceptisols 3atephra 3asoil parent materials 3asoil formation 0aWashington1 aBusacca, A.J.1 aMcDaniel, P.A.0 tGeoderma.g2006 Dec. 31, v.  137, no.  1-2 p.192-2047nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/276433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2006.08.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/04/03  aNon-US  aUSDA/NRCS 7aarticle03191naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100001500193245011100208300001600319500002400335500001500359520160400374650001601978650002301994650001602017650001902033650002702052650002602079650002002105650001702125650002402142650001402166650001802180650001502198650001902213653001102232700001702243773012302260852000902383856008502392856011202477930003302589945002502622946001302647961001302660655001202673IND4410187820221118022228.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441018782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-008-1275-12doi7 a10113/211962hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ114 0aQ5041 aWarner, K.10aMid-Oleic/Ultra Low Linolenic Acid Soybean Oil: A Healthful New Alternative to Hydrogenated Oil for Frying  ap. 945-951.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aTo determine the frying stability of mid-oleic/ultra low linolenic acid soybean oil (MO/ULLSBO) and the storage stability of food fried in it, tortilla chips were fried in MO/ULLSBO, soybean oil (SBO), hydrogenated SBO (HSBO) and ultra low linolenic SBO (ULLSBO). Intermittent batch frying tests were conducted up to 55 h of frying, and then tortilla chips were aged up to 4 months at 25 °C. Frying oils were analyzed for total polar compounds to determine the frying stability of the oil. Tortilla chips were analyzed for hexanal as an indicator of oxidative deterioration and by sensory analysis using a trained, experienced analytical panel. Results showed no significant differences between the total polar compound levels for MO/ULLSBO and HSBO after 55 h of frying, indicating a similar fry life. However, total polar compound levels for ULLSBO and SBO were significantly higher than for either MO/ULLSBO or HSBO, indicating a lower oil fry life. Hexanal levels in aged tortilla chips fried in SBO were significantly higher than in chips fried in any of the other oils. Tortilla chips fried in MO/ULLSBO and HSBO had significantly lower hexanal levels than in chips fried in ULLSBO. A sensory analysis of rancid flavor intensity showed similar trends to those for hexanal formation. The chips fried in SBO had the highest rancid flavor intensity, with significantly lower hexanal levels in chips fried in HSBO and MO/ULLSBO. Based on these results, MO/ULLSBO not only had a good fry life but also produced oxidatively stable fried food, and therefore would be a healthful alternative to HSBO. 3atocopherols 3asensory evaluation 3asoybean oil 3alinolenic acid 3afatty acid composition 3acooking fats and oils 3adeep fat frying 3afood storage 3aoxidative stability 3aoxidation 3ahydrogenation 3aoleic acid 3atortilla chips 0afrying1 aFehr, Walter0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2008 Oct., v.  85, no.  10 p.945-951dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-008-1275-13Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/211963Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/11/06  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03643naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111024002100136040001800157072000900175072000900184100001900193245009900212300001800311500002400329500001500353520144200368650002701810650002801837650001101865650000901876650002001885650002301905650001901928650002401947650002401971650002201995650001502017650002102032650001402053650002502067650001902092650001302111650001502124650001602139650001602155650003102171650003402202650004002236650002402276650003302300650003702333650002302370650004102393650001302434653002402447653001302471653002902484700001902513773011102532852000902643856011202652856007502764930003302839945002502872946001102897961001302908655001202921IND4412622920221121064515.0081114e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441262292DNAL7 a185611512pmid7 a10.1002/ps.16192doi7 a10113/231822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH0001 aKroger, Robert10aUtilization of common ditch vegetation in the reduction of fipronil and its sulfone metabolite  ap. 1212-1217.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Fipronil, a phenylpyrazole insecticide, and its oxidative sulfone metabolite are two potential pollutants from treated rice and cotton production. A consequence of these pollutants occurring in surface runoff is degradation of downstream aquatic ecosystems. Utilization of primary intercept drainage ditches as management practices to reduce fipronil concentrations and loads has not been examined. This study used ditch mesocosms planted with monospecific stands of common emergent wetland vegetation to determine if certain plant species were more proficient in fipronil mitigation.RESULTS: Three replicates of four plant species were compared against a non-vegetated control to determine differences in water column outflow concentrations (μg L⁻¹) and loads (μg). There were no significant differences between vegetated and control treatments in outflow concentrations (F = 0.35, P = 0.836) and loads (F = 0.35, P = 0.836). The range of fipronil reduction was 28-45% for both concentration and load. Unlike fipronil, fipronil sulfone concentrations and load increased by 96-328%.CONCLUSION: The increase in fipronil sulfone was hypothesized as a direct consequence of oxidation of fipronil within each mesocosm. The type of ditch vegetation had no effect on fipronil reduction. Future research needs to examine initial concentrations and hydraulic retention times to examine potential changes in reduction capacities. 3achemical concentration 3ainterspecific variation 3acotton 3arice 3acrop production 3atemporal variation 3awetland plants 3aagricultural runoff 3aaquatic environment 3adrainage channels 3apollutants 3aphytoremediation 3aoxidation 3ainsecticide residues 3apollution load 3afipronil 3avegetation 3ametabolites 2aAgriculture 2aMagnoliopsidaxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aInsecticidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aPyrazolesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSulfonesxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWetlands 0aspecies differences 0asulfones 0ahydraulic retention time1 aMoore, Matt T.0 tPest management science.g2008 Dec., v.  64, no.  12 p.1212-1217dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.16193Available from publisher's Web site  a20110719b20110805c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/29  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03248naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001600140245007900156300001600235500002400251500001500275520206800290650002202358650002202380650001502402650001502417650000902432650001302441650001602454650002302470653001502493700001602508700001502524773009402539852000902633856011202642930003302754945001302787946001302800961001302813655001202826IND2046303820221118090644.0950602e199503  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204630382DNAL7 a10113/306442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB2001 aLentz, R.D.10aMeasuring wind and low-relief topographic effects on rainfall distribution  ap. 241-248.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aAdvances in agricultural technology are giving farmers the capability to selectively manage soils of smaller and smaller a real dimension, and the capacity to alter management practices on the go. Farmers need to better understand the nature of within-field variability if they are to adjust their management accordingly. We hypothesized that wind interacts with low-relief topographic features and significantly alters rainfall distribution in the landscape. To determine wind and topographic effects on rainfall distribution across agricultural landscapes, rainfall intensity measurements have typically been made in situ. Problems associated with this method involve finding appropriate field sites, observational uncertainties, and logistical complications. For a study of rain on low hills, we avoided such problems by using a full-sized replica of a hill. Design and construction of this hill model are described. The apparatus emulated the slope and summit components of a low hill, and summit elevation was adjustable [1 to 3 m (3 to 10 ft)]. It was equipped with wind speed and direction sensors, and tipping-bucketflow-gages that measured natural precipitation intercepted by catchments located on windward and leeward slope positions. It automatically maintained a windward orientation during precipitation events, thus increasing the number of relevant measurements obtained in a given season. Results, obtained over two field seasons, indicate that hydrological rainfall varied significantly across different portions of the hill model. On average, hill positions experiencing maximum intensity received 1.5x more rain than those positions with the least precipitation. The rainfall pattern differed, depending on meteorological rainfall (intensity measured on level ground beyond the hill model), incident wind speed, and hill-summit elevation. This study shows that rainfall can vary across landscapes that include low-relief topographic features. The amount of variation is large enough to influence crop or plant growth, and other soil processes. 3asimulation models 3aagricultural land 3aautomation 3awind speed 3arain 3aaltitude 3ameasurement 3awater distribution 0atopography1 aDowdy, R.H.1 aRust, R.H.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1995 Mar., v.  11, no.  2 p.241-248x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/306443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090702b20090801c00000000  aINDdGSO  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03311naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002100117040001800138100001400156245009100170300001600261500002400277500002300301500001500324520168400339650002302023650002702046650002202073650002302095650001702118650002002135650002502155650002002180650001402200650001402214650004302228653002802271653003702299700001702336700001802353700001902371700001902390773011802409852000902527856007502536856011202611930003302723945001302756946001102769961001302780655001202793IND2327295420221123023959.0020529e200203  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232729542DNAL7 a10.1139/b02-0042doi7 a10113/136762hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, J.R.10aGenetic analysis of pathogenic and nonpathogenic Fusarium oxysporum from tomato plants  ap. 271-279.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aForty-three Fusarium oxysporum strains and one Fusarium solani strain were analyzed for genetic diversity. These strains represent a wide range of geographic locations and were collected primarily from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) roots. Among all 43 F. oxysporum strains, 21 were not pathogenic to tomato, 20 were pathogenic, including 13 strains of Fusarium oxysporum lycopersici and seven strains of Fusarium oxysporum radicis-lycopersici, and two were other formae speciales of the fungus. Genetic diversity of all 43 strains was assessed by vegetative compatibility group (VCG), sequence analysis of the rDNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the 5.8S rRNA gene, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Most of the F. o. lycopersici strains were assigned to VCG 0030, while most nonpathogenic ones were incompatible with each other. ITS region analysis grouped the strains into four clusters. The nonpathogenic F. oxysporum strains were in two groups, while the pathogenic strains were placed in two different groups. Pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains were also separated into different clusters based on AFLP data, although some nonpathogenic strains grouped with pathogenic strains. The population of pathogenic strains was less diverse than that of the nonpathogenic strains, suggesting that the pathogenic strains were possibly of monophyletic origin. For both pathogenic and nonpathogenic F. oxysporum strains, no relationship was observed between the genetic profiles and geographic origin; this may indicate that pathogens did not originate independently at each locality.Key words: Fusarium oxysporum, VCG, rDNA (ITS) sequence, AFLP. 3aFusarium oxysporum 3ageographical variation 3agenetic variation 3astrain differences 3apathogenesis 3agenetic markers 3anucleotide sequences 3aFusarium solani 3avirulence 3apathogens 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aFravel, D.R.1 aO'Neill, N.R.1 aLazarovits, G.1 aVan Berkum, P.0 tCanadian journal of botany = Journal canadien de botanique.g2002 Mar., v.  80, no.  3 p.271-279x0008-40267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b02-0043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/136763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080424b20080502c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03628naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100002200205245011200227300001600339500002400355520211600379650001802495650001802513650002102531650001502552650002202567650002202589650001202611650001902623650001802642650001102660650001302671650001702684651002702701651001702728700001602745773005802761852000902819856011202828856008802940930003303028945002503061946001103086961001303097655001203110IND4428485920221121061322.0091109e20080131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442848592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2007.07.0072doi7 a10113/375442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aM001 0aW000 0aF3001 aPhillips, Rebecca14aThe role of hydropedologic vegetation zones in greenhouse gas emissions for agricultural wetland landscapes  ap. 386-394.  aIncludes references  aNet greenhouse gas (GHG) source strength for agricultural wetland ecosystems in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is currently unknown. Information is lacking to constrain spatial variability associated with GHG emissions (CH4, CO2, and N2O). GHG fluxes typically vary with edaphic, hydrologic, biologic, and climatic factors. In the PPR, characteristic wetland plant communities integrate hydropedologic factors and may explain some variability associated with trace gas fluxes at ecosystem and landscape scales. We addressed this question for replicate wetland basins located in central North Dakota stratified by hydropedologic vegetation zone on Jul 12 and Aug 3, 2003. Data were collected at the soilatmosphere interface for six plant zones: deep marsh, shallow marsh, wet meadow, low prairie, pasture, and cropland. Controlling for soil moisture and temperature, CH4 fluxes varied significantly with zone (pb0.05). Highest CH4 emissions were found near the water in the deep marsh (277,800 microgram m-2 d-1 CH4), which declined with distance from water to -730 microgram m-2 d-1 CH4 in the pasture. Carbon dioxide fluxes also varied significantly with zone. Nitrous oxide variability was greater within zones than between zones, with no significant effects of zone, moisture, or temperature. Data were extrapolated for a 205.6 km2 landscape using a previously developed synoptic classification for PPR plant communities. For this landscape, we found croplands contributed the greatest proportion to the net GHG source strength on Jul 12 (45,700 kg d-1 GHG-C equivalents) while deep marsh zones contributed the greatest proportion on Aug 3 (26,145 kg d-1 GHG-C equivalents). This was driven by a 30-fold reduction in cropland N2O-N emissions between dates. The overall landscape average for each date, weighted by zone, was 462.4 kg km-2 d-1 GHG-C equivalents on Jul 12 and 314.3 kg km-2 d-1 GHG-C equivalents on Aug 3. Results suggest GHG fluxes vary with hydropedologic soil zone, particularly for CH4, and provide initial estimates of net GHG emissions for heterogeneous agricultural wetland landscapes. 3awetland soils 3agas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3avegetation 3aplant communities 3aspatial variation 3amethane 3acarbon dioxide 3anitrous oxide 3abasins 3awetlands 3aspatial data 3aPrairie Pothole region 3aNorth Dakota1 aBeeri, Ofer0 tCatena.g2008 Jan. 31, v.  72, no.  3 p.386-3947nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/375443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2007.07.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/11/27  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03477naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002000117040001800137072000900155072000900164072000900173072000900182100001600191245011400207300001400321500002400335500002300359500001500382520166300397650001502060650001602075650001702091650003102108650002602139650001702165650002502182650001602207650001502223650001502238650002702253651001202280653004302292653001402335653002202349653002002371653002902391700002002420700001602440700001802456700001802474773009502492852000902587856007502596856011102671930003302782945002502815946001102840961001202851655001202863IND4369714520221119080127.0050509e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436971452DNAL7 a10.1139/x04-1602doi7 a10113/12352hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK510 0aX100 0aF400 0aK0011 aJones, P.D.10aNondestructive estimation of Pinus taeda L. wood properties for samples from a wide range of sites in Georgia  ap. 85-92.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aPreliminary studies based on small sample sets show that near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has the potential for rapidly estimating many important wood properties. However, if NIR is to be used operationally, then calibrations using several hundred samples from a wide variety of growing conditions need to be developed and their performance tested on samples from new populations. In this study, 120 Pinus taeda L. (loblolly pine) radial strips (cut from increment cores) representing 15 different sites from three physiographic regions in Georgia (USA) were characterized in terms of air-dry density, microfibril angle (MFA), and stiffness. NIR spectra were collected in 10-mm increments from the radial longitudinal surface of each strip and split into calibration (nine sites, 729 spectra) and prediction sets (six sites, 225 spectra). Calibrations were developed using untreated and mathematically treated (first and second derivative and multiplicative scatter correction) spectra. Strong correlations were obtained for all properties, the strongest R2 values being 0.83 (density), 0.90 (MFA), and 0.93 (stiffness). When applied to the test set, good relationships were obtained (R(p)2 ranged from 0.80 to 0.90), but the accuracy of predictions varied depending on math treatment. The addition of a small number of cores from the prediction set (one core per new site) to the calibration set improved the accuracy of predictions and importantly minimized the differences obtained with the various math treatments. These results suggest that density, MFA, and stiffness can be estimated by NIR with sufficient accuracy to be used in operational settings. 3aestimation 3acalibration 3awood density 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3amechanical properties 3awood quality 3astatistical analysis 3aPinus taeda 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 3anondestructive methods 3aGeorgia 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy 0astiffness 0amicrofibril angle 0awood properties 0awood physical properties1 aSchimleck, L.R.1 aPeter, G.F.1 aDaniels, R.F.1 aClark, A.

Weighing lysimeters were used to determine actual evapotranspiration (ET) rates of lowbush blueberry at one nonirrigated and two irrigated sites within 7 km of the Maine coast. For the three-year study period, overall mean weekly ET rates (with standard errors) during June, July, and August were calculated to be 2.13 (±0.05), 2.39 (±0.07), and 2.19 (±0.07) cm/wk, respectively. Mean monthly ET rates did not differ significantly between irrigated and nonirrigated sites. Crop coefficient (Kc) values were determined from the ratio of daily Penman-Montieth grass reference ET to measured daily ET. The combined mean monthly Kc values for the two irrigated sites varied between 0.61 and 0.74 from May through September, with an overall mean Kc value for all sites of 0.69 (±0.02). The Kc values showed no significant rotation-year component. Consequently, the Kc value determined in this study can be used in conjunction with meteorological data to provide Maine lowbush blueberry growers with the ability to better predict water demand by their crop. Fog at the irrigated sites was found to contribute approximately 13.5 cm of net water equivalent per growing season. However, the effects of dew formation and fog deposition are already reflected in the Kc value for each site, enabling growers to determine water demand from these values and grass reference ET data alone. These findings may substantially contribute to improved water use efficiency for irrigated lowbush blueberry in Maine. 3ameteorological data 3aevapotranspiration 3aVaccinium angustifolium 3airrigation 3awater use efficiency 3adew 3awater requirement 3afog (meteorology) 3acrop yield 3asoil water 3ablueberries 3aclimatic factors 3aMaine 0aplant-water relations1 aHoneycutt, C.W.1 aStarr, G.1 aYarborough, D.0 tInternational journal of fruit science.g2008 Dec.,  p.282-298x1553-83627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/375453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/155383608025975493Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/11/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04378naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003100132024002100163040001800184072000900202072000900211072000900220072000900229100001800238245013300256300001600389500002400405506007600429520180700505506003702312650001302349650000902362650001602371650001302387650002602400650002302426650001402449650001802463650002002481650001302501650001402514650001902528650002502547650001202572650003002584650002802614650005202642650002102694650003502715650004002750650001402790650003302804650003102837650005102868650002302919650003302942650005402975650006303029653001403092700001703106700001903123700002003142773007803162852000903240856008103249856011203330856007003442930003303512945002503545946001303570961001303583655001203596IND4381763820221207115254.0060708e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438176382DNAL7 a129704952pmid7 aPMC1966062pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.103.0241742doi7 a10113/144152hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF600 0aF821 0aL0011 aSchmelz, E.A.10aNitrogen deficiency increases volicitin-induced volatile emission, jasmonic acid accumulation, and ethylene sensitivity in maize  ap. 295-306.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInsect herbivore-induced plant volatile emission and the subsequent attraction of natural enemies is facilitated by fatty acid-amino acid conjugate (FAC) elicitors, such as volicitin [N-(17-hydroxylinolenoyl)-L-glutamine], present in caterpillar oral secretions. Insect-induced jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (E) are believed to mediate the magnitude of this variable response. In maize (Zea mays) seedlings, we examined the interaction of volicitin, JA, and E on the induction of volatile emission at different levels of nitrogen (N) availability that are known to influence E sensitivity. N availability and volicitin-induced sesquiterpene emission are inversely related as maximal responses were elicited in N-deficient plants. Plants with low N availability demonstrated similar volatile responses to volicitin (1 nmol plant⁻¹) and JA (100 nmol plant⁻¹). In contrast, plants with medium N availability released much lower amounts of volicitin-induced sesquiterpenes compared with JA, suggesting an alteration in volicitin-induced JA levels. As predicted, low N plants exhibited greater sustained increases in wound- and volicitin-induced JA levels compared with medium N plants. N availability also altered volicitin-E interactions. In low N plants, E synergized volicitin-induced sesquiterpene and indole emission 4- to 12-fold, with significant interactions first detected at 10 nL L⁻¹ E. Medium N plants demonstrated greatly reduced volicitin-E interactions. Volicitin-induced sesquiterpene emission was increased by E and was decreased by pretreatment the E perception inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene without alteration in volicitin-induced JA levels. N availability influences plant responses to insect-derived elicitors through changes in E sensitivity and E-independent JA kinetics.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agrain crops 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3avolatile compounds 3aemissions 3ajasmonic acid 3abioaccumulation 3aethylene 3aglutamine 3alinolenic acid 3aphytophagous insects 2aAnimals 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aGlutaminexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aImmunity, Innate 2aInsectaxgrowth & development. 2aNitrogenxdeficiencyxpharmacology. 2aOxylipins 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aSesquiterpenesxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aStress, Mechanical 2aVolatilizationxdrug effects 2aZea maysxdrug effectsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 0avolicitin1 aAlborn, H.T.1 aEngelberth, J.1 aTumlinson, J.H.0 tPlant physiology.g2003 Sept., v.  133, no.  1 p.295-306x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.103.0241743Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/144153Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090205b20090301c00000000  aINDdCMMe2006/09/12  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03366naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002100142040001800163072000900181100002200190245009500212300001800307500002400325500001500349520141500364650001601779650001201795650001501807650001101822650001101833650001301844650003701857650001501894650001501909650001201924650001401936650002201950650002301972650001201995650003802007650002902045650002802074650004102102650001702143650001502160650003202175650002002207653001202227653002202239653001602261653002302277700002502300773010502325852000902430856008102439856011202520930003302632945002502665946001302690961001302703655001202716IND4431199620221121061415.0100112e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443119962DNAL7 a159917232pmid7 a10.1081/ESE-2000606302doi7 a10113/375462hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX5001 aDungan, Robert S.10aPyrolysis of Foundry Sand Resins: A Determination of Organic Products by Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1557-1567.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) was used to identify the major organic products produced by pyrolysis of three foundry sand resins: (i) Novolac and (ii) phenolic urethane (PU) (both phenol-formaldehyde based resins) and (iii) furan (furfuryl alcohol based resin). These resins are used in the metal casting industry as a "sand binder" for making cores (used to produce cavities in molds) and molds for nonferrous castings. During the casting process, the cores and molds are subjected to intense heat from the molten metal. As a result, the organic resins undergo thermal decomposition and produce a number of complex organic compounds. In this study, the organics were tentatively identified by MS after pyrolysis of the resins at 750°C. The major thermal decomposition products from the Novolac, PU, and furan resins were derivatives of phenol, benzene, and furan, respectively. Compounds identified that are of potential environmental concern were benzene, toluene, phenol, o- and p-xylene, o- and m-cresol, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis of the Novolac resin resulted in the generation of the most compounds of environmental concern. Because there is interest in beneficially using foundry molding sands in manufactured soils and other agricultural products, it is necessary that organic thermal decomposition products be identified to ensure environmental protection. 3atemperature 3abenzene 3ametallurgy 3aresins 3axylene 3aurethane 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3abyproducts 3apollutants 3atoluene 3apyrolysis 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3acresols 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEpoxy Resinsxchemistry 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aIncineration 2aMetallurgy 2aOrganic Chemicalsxanalysis 2aSilicon Dioxide 0aphenols 0aorganic compounds 0asand resins 0aphenolic compounds1 aReeves, James B.

A four-year (2001 to 2005) study on land application of CLDM as an option for disposal was conducted on a beef cattle pasture in south central Florida. The objectives of this study were (i) to assess CLDM as a soil amendment to improve quality of sandy soils in most subtropical beef cattle pastures and (ii) to determine the effect of CLDM on productivity and nutritive values of bahiagrass (BG, Flügge) in subtropical beef cattle pasture. The five treatment combinations arranged in randomized complete block design were represented by plots with different ratios (R) of natural soil (NS) to CLDM: R1 (1000 g kg:0 g kg); R2 (750 g kg:250 g kg); R3 (500 g kg:500 g kg); R4 (250 g kg:750 g kg); and R5 (0 g kg:1000 g kg). Addition of CLDM had significant (≤ 0.001) effects on soil quality and favorable influence on forage establishment and nutritive values. Compared with the control plots (0 g kg), the soils in plots amended with CLDM exhibited (i) lower penetration resistance, (ii) an increase in soil pH and exchangeable cations (Ca and Mg), and (iii) decrease in the levels of soil trace metals (Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Si). Results disclosed consistently and significantly (≤ 0.001) higher BG biomass production (forage yield = −106.3x + 1015.8x − 39.2; = 0.99**) and crude protein content (CP = 1.24x + 6.48; = 0.94**) from plots amended with CLDM than those of BG planted on plots with no CLDM treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3alakes 3adredged materials 3aland application 3alandfills 3asandy soils 3asoil amendments 3abeef cattle 3apastures 3asubtropics 3aPaspalum notatum 3aforage production 3anutritive value 3adry matter accumulation 3aphosphorus 3anitrogen content 3asoil penetration resistance 3asoil chemical properties 3aprotein content 3achemical constituents of plants 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aPaspalumxgrowth & development 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aSoil 3aFlorida 0aFlorida1 aColeman, Samuel W.1 aHoltkamp, Mike L.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2006 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.1784-1794dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2006.00603Available from publisher's Web site  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/10/30  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03448naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130100001800139245015100157300001800308500002400326500001500350520194400365650001402309650002702323650001202350650001402362650002102376650002002397650002202417650001902439650001302458650002202471650002002493651001002513651001002523651001702533651001802550700001402568700001902582700001502601700001702616773009502633852000902728856011102737930003302848945002502881946001102906961001302917655001202930IND4378067720221119085317.0060223e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437806772DNAL7 a10113/26182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aSpooner, D.M.10aNuclear and chloroplast DNA reassessment of the origin of Indian potato varieties and its implications for the origin of the early European potato  ap. 1020-1026.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe modern cultivated potato was first recorded in Europe in 1562, but its area(s) of exportation has long been in dispute. Two competing hypotheses have proposed an "Andean" area (somewhere from upland Venezuela to northern Argentina) or a lowland south central "Chilean" area. Potato landraces from these two areas can be distinguished, although sometimes with difficulty, by (1) cytoplasmic sterility factors, (2) morphological traits, (3) daylength adaptation, (4) microsatellite markers, and (5) co-evolved chloroplast (cp) and mitochondria (mt) DNA. The Chilean introduction hypothesis originally was proposed because of similarities among Chilean landraces and modern "European" cultivars with respect to traits 2 and 3. Alternatively, the Andean introduction hypothesis suggests that (1) traits 2 and 3 of European potato evolved rapidly, in parallel, from Andean landraces to a Chilean type through selection following import to Europe, and (2) the worldwide late blight epidemics beginning in 1845 in the United Kingdom displaced most existing European cultivars and the potato was subsequently improved by importations of Chilean landraces. We reassess these two competing hypotheses with nuclear microsatellite and cpDNA analyses of (1) 32 Indian cultivars, some of which are thought to preserve putatively remnant populations of Andean landraces, (2) 12 Andean landraces, and (3) five Chilean landraces. Our microsatellite results cluster all Indian cultivars, including putatively remnant Andean landrace populations, with the Chilean landraces, and none with the "old Andigenum" landraces. Some of these Indian landraces, however, lack the cpDNA typical of Chilean landraces and advanced cultivars, indicating they likely are hybrids of Andean landraces with Chilean clones or more advanced cultivars. These results lead us to reexamine the hypothesis that early introductions of potato to Europe were solely from the Andes. 3acultivars 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3alandraces 3acenter of origin 3achloroplast DNA 3aSolanum tuberosum 3anuclear genome 3apotatoes 3agenetic variation 3agenetic markers 3aChile 3aIndia 3aAndes region 0aSouth America1 aNunez, J.1 aRodríguez, F.1 aNaik, P.S.1 aGhislain, M.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2005 Apr., v.  110, no.  6 p.1020-1026x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/26183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070828b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/13  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02324naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001700158245011800175300001300293500002400306500001500330520096700345650001201312650001801324650002701342650001401369650001801383651001801401653002201419653002201441653004601463653001701509653002001526700001501546700001801561700001501579773005301594852000901647856011201656930003301768945001301801946001301814961001501827655001201842IND2041604120221118230501.0940823s199209  cou|||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND204160412DNAL7 a10113/358172hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL100 0aE2001 aCrooks, A.C.10aEconomic cost of piglet mortality in the farrowing to weaning phase: a report of the NAHMS' national swine survey  ap. 9-14.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aData collected for the National Animal Health Monitoring Systems' (NAHMS') National Swine Survey were used to estimate the number and associated opportunity costs of piglet mortalities in the USA in 1990. Opportunity costs are the profit opportunities that were lost by the producer, and in the aggregate by the industry, for each animal death event. Cases of preweaning mortality were prospectively reported by each study participant for a 90-day interval during the study period from November 1989 to February 1991. Cost advantages from relative efficiencies that accrue to the largest herds were accounted for. Herds participating in the NAHMS' National Swine Survey were stratified into 4 groups according to the number of breeding females in the herd (49 or less, 50 to 99, 100 to 199, and 200 or greater). The associated opportunity costs of piglet mortality were approximately $193.7 million, with 49% of these costs occurring among herds with > 200 sows. 3apiglets 3aprofitability 3ageographical variation 3amortality 3aorganizations 3aUnited States 0apiglet production 0alivestock numbers 0anational animal health monitoring systems 0aproductivity 0aestimated costs1 aHurd, H.S.1 aDargatz, D.A.1 aHill, G.W.0 tAnimal health insight.g1992 Fall,  p.9-147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/358173Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02595naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169100001900178245011700197300001800314500002400332500001500356520102800371592002801399650002301427650001001450650002201460650002201482650001901504650002001523650001401543650001501557650001101572650002501583651001301608653002301621700001801644700002001662700001701682773012001699852000901819856011201828856008801940930003302028945002502061961001502086655001202101IND4450453420221122005027.0110309e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445045342DNAL7 a10.1637/0005-2086-47.s3.11072doi7 a10113/486712hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aSlemons, R.

Cloacal swabs collected between May 28 and July 15, 1998, were negative for influenza A virus recovery (0/233), whereas 13.9%% (29/209) of swabs collected between August 27 and September 2, 1998, were positive for influenza A virus recovery. Five hemagglutinin subtypes (H2, H3, H6, H9, and H12), six neuraminidase subtypes (N1, N2, N4, N5, N6, and N8), and nine HA-NA combinations were identified among 29 influenza A isolates. Interestingly, 18 of the 29 isolates initially appeared to contain two or more HA and/or NA subtypes. The free-flying, nonmigratory ducks served as excellent sentinels for the early detection of type A influenza viruses in the southern half of the Atlantic Migratory Waterfowl Flyway during the earliest phase of the yearly southern migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3amigratory behavior 3aducks 3aInfluenza A virus 3awildlife diseases 3ahemagglutinins 3aavian influenza 3asialidase 3aprevalence 3acloaca 3adisease surveillance 3aMaryland 0amigration behavior1 aHansen, W.

The experimental sheep (n = 12, mean weight 28.5 kg) were a local Croatian mixed breed. The experimental goats (n = 12, mean weight 13.4 kg) were a mixture of domestic goats crossed with Saanen and Alpine breeds. Sheep and goats differed (P < 0.01) in consumption of almost all of the shrubs. Goats had higher intakes (g/kg B.W., P < 0.01) than sheep of each shrub except Quercus ilex. In Trial 1, shrub intake for goats ranged from 17.7 ± 0.72 g/kg B.W. for Pistacia lentiscus to 33.1 ± 1.40 g/kg B.W. for Erica multiflora. Goats ate more Arbutus unedo (P = 0.004; 19.9 g/kg versus 14.2 g/kg B.W., respectively); E. multiflora (33.1 g/kg versus 21.9 g/kg B.W., respectively) and Pistacia lenticus (17.2 g/kg versus 10.6 g/kg B.W., respectively) than did sheep. Goats ate twice as much Juniperus phoeniceae (P = 0.002) as did sheep (21.0 g/kg versus 10.9 g/kg B.W.), and also ate more Viburnum tinus (P = 0.02) than did sheep (22.6 g/kg versus 13.9 g/kg B.W.). There was a day x treatment interaction (P = 0.001), with goats eating more A. unedo, E. multiflora, J. phoeniceae, P. lenticus and V. tinus than sheep. In Trial 2, the rank order of preference (highest to least) for goats were Q. ilex, E. multiflora, V. tinus, A. unedo, J. phoeniceae and P. lentiscus. The rank order by sheep was similar: Q. ilex, E. multiflora, V. tinus, J. phoeniceae, P. lentiscus and A. unedo. Overall, goats ate 50.5 g/kg B.W. of shrubs per day, while sheep averaged 26.7 g/kg B.W. each day. Goats are better suited to graze Mediterranean maquis in terms of potential shrub use. 3atemporal variation 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3afood animals 3asheep 3abody weight 3agoats 3asheep feeding 3anutritive value 3afeed intake 3afeeding preferences 3achoice feeding 0afeed preferences 0amaquis shrubs 0aforage 0aanimal feeding1 aPfister, J.A.1 aProvenza, F.D.1 aGrbesa, D.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2006 July, v.  64, no.  1-2 p.169-179x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2005.04.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/12/27  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02523naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169100001400178245014000192300001600332500002400348520108200372650002301454650001701477650002201494650001601516650002001532650001801552650001801570651001501588653002201603653002801625653001701653700001901670773009601689852000901785856011201794856008801906930003301994945002502027946001102052961001402063655001202077IND4383945220221121173323.0060929e20060915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438394522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2006.05.0302doi7 a10113/331912hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK1201 aPetit, B.10aGrowth in pure and mixed plantations of tree species used in reforesting rural areas of the humid region of Costa Rica, Central America  ap. 338-343.  aIncludes references  aThis paper compares productivity of native tree species plantations, in monoculture and mixtures, at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. In monocultures, Jacaranda copaia, Vochysia guatemalensis, and Vochysia ferruginea were the most productive of 10 species compared. However, J. copaia and V. guatemalensis grew significantly faster in mixtures than in monocultures. A mixture of J. copaia, V. guatemalensis, and Calophyllum brasiliense produced 21% more merchantable volume than a monoculture of J. copaia, which grew the fastest of the three species. Mixed plantations of Dipteryx panamensis, Virola koschnyi, and Terminalia amazonia had productivity rates similar to monocultures of the fastest growing of these species (Virola koschnyi). The productivity of mixed plantations of V. ferruginea, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Genipa americana, and Balizia elegans was intermediate from the respective species' productivities in monocultures. Cultivating tree species in mixtures affected species' growth forms and ability to persist on the site. 3aforest plantations 3aforest trees 3aspecies diversity 3atree growth 3astand structure 3amixed forests 3areforestation 3aCosta Rica 0amixed plantations 0amonoculture plantations 0anative trees1 aMontagnini, F.0 tForest ecology and management.g2006 Sept. 15, v.  233, no.  2-3 p.338-343x0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/331913Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2006.05.0303Available from publisher's Web site  a20090916b20091002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/09/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/NRCS 7aarticle01831naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001500140245008700155300001600242500002400258500001500282520072200297650002401019650001901043650002601062650001701088650002201105653001001127653002301137653001201160773008001172852000901252856011201261930003301373945001301406946001301419961001301432655001201445IND2326749020221122182946.0020426e200103  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232674902DNAL7 a10113/246512hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP1201 aKnothe, G.10aAnalytical methods used in the production and fuel quality assessment of biodiesel  ap. 193-200.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aBiodiesel, an alternative diesel fuel derived from vegetable oil, animal fats, or waste vegetable oils, is obtained by reacting the oil or fat with an alcohol (transesterification) in the presence of a basic catalyst to give the corresponding mono-alkyl esters. Two major categories of methods besides other miscellaneous ones have been reported in the literature for assessing biodiesel fuel quality and/or monitoring the transesterification reaction by which biodiesel is produced. The two major categories comprise chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. This article considers the various methods in each category, including advantages and drawbacks, and offers suggestions on selection of appropriate methods. 3aphysical properties 3achromatography 3abiological production 3aspectroscopy 3aalternative fuels 0afuels 0aanalytical methods 0aquality0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2001 , v.  44, no.  2 p.193-200x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246513Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04540naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131072000900149072000900158100002000167245012700187300001800314500002400332500001500356520227500371650001302646650001402659650002802673650001902701650001702720650001302737650001602750650002302766650001602789650001702805650002202822650002002844650003002864650001902894650002302913650001802936650002602954650001302980650001902993650000903012650001203021650001103033650002103044650003703065650002803102650002903130650005203159650003303211650002203244650001303266650001103279650002503290650003203315650003903347650001703386653002903403653001703432700001503449773010203464852000903566856011103575930003303686945002503719946001303744961001303757655001203770IND4394214620221118182140.0070817e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439421462DNAL7 a176853402pmid7 a10113/35822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ112 0aQ2021 aFratamico, P.M.10aComparison of Methods for Detection and Isolation of Cold- and Freeze-Stressed Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Raw Ground Beef  ap. 1663-1669.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA comparison was made of the relative efficiencies of three enrichment media, RapidChek Escherichia coli O157:H7 enrichment broth (REB), R&F broth (RFB), and modified E. coli broth containing novobiocin (mEC+n), and four selective plating media for detection of cold- and freeze-stressed E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef. Ground beef (25 g) was inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 at <=0.5 and <=2 CFU/g, and samples were then enriched immediately or were stored at 4°C for 72 h or at -20°C for 2 weeks and then enriched. After 8 or 20 h of enrichment, the cultures were plated onto R&F E. coli O157:H7 chromogenic plating medium, cefixime-tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar, CHROMagar O157, and Rainbow agar O157 and tested using the RapidChek E. coli O157 lateral flow immunoassay and a multiplex PCR assay targeting the E. coli O157:H7 eae, stx1, and stx2 genes. Recovery of E. coli O157:H7 on the four agar media was 4.0 to 7.9 log CFU/ml with the REB enrichment, 1.4 to 7.4 log CFU/ml with RFB, 1.7 to 6.7 log CFU/ml with mEC n incubated at 42°C, and 1.3 to 3.3 log CFU/ml from mEC+n incubated at 35°C. The percentages of positive ground beef samples containing nonstressed, coldstressed, and freeze-stressed E. coli O157:H7 as obtained by plating, the immunoassay, and the PCR assay were 97, 88, and 97%, respectively, with REB, 92, 81, and 78%, respectively, with RFB, 97, 58, and 53%, respectively, with mEC+n incubated at 42°C, and 22, 31, and 25%, respectively, with mEC+n incubated at 35°C. Logistic regression analyses of the data indicated significant main effects of treatment, type of medium, enrichment time, inoculum concentration, and detection method. In particular, a positive result was 1.1 times more likely to occur after 20 h of enrichment than after 8 h, 25 times more likely with RFB and REB than with mEC+n at 35°C, 3.7 times more likely with an initial inoculum of <=2.0 CFU/g than with <=0.5 CFU/g, 2.5 to 3 times more likely using freeze-stressed or nonstressed bacteria than with cold-stressed bacteria, and 2.5 times more likely by plating than by the immunoassay or the PCR assay. REB had better overall performance for enrichment of cold- and freeze-stressed E. coli O157:H7 present in ground beef than did the other media examined. 3afreezing 3aviability 3abacterial contamination 3afrozen storage 3aimmunoassays 3afreezers 3aground beef 3afood contamination 3acold stress 3afood storage 3apathogen survival 3aselective media 3apolymerase chain reaction 3afood pathogens 3aenrichment culture 3arefrigeration 3aEscherichia coli O157 3araw meat 3acold tolerance 2aAgar 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCold Temperature 2aColony Count, Microbialxmethods 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aEscherichia coli O157xisolation & purification 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aFreezing 2aHumans 2aImmunoassayxmethods 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aTime Factors 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0acold storage1 aBagi, L.K.0 tJournal of food protection.g2007 July, v.  70, no.  7 p.1663-1669wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/35823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070920b20071002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/09/05  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03870naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001700140245009800157300001800255500002400273520249100297650001702788650001202805650002802817650001602845650001902861650001902880650001402899650001102913650001302924650001202937650001002949653001902959700001602978700001802994700001803012700001403030700001603044700001703060700001803077773007603095852000903171856011203180930003303292945001303325946001303338961001303351655001203364IND2124028220221118034844.0980716e199712  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212402822DNAL7 a10113/342162hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aSeidel, G.E.10aUterine horn insemination of heifers with very low numbers of nonfrozen and sexed spermatozoa  ap. 1255-1264.  aIncludes references  aExperiments were conducted to determine 1) pregnancy rates of heifers inseminated with very low numbers of spermatozoa under ideal field conditions, and 2) pregnancy rates with low doses of sexed spermatozoa. In Experiment 1, semen from 3 Holstein bulls was extended to 1 x 10(5) or 2.5 x 10(5) sperm/0.1 ml; 2.5 x 10(6) total sperm/0.21 ml were used for the control. Semen was cooled to 5 degrees C, packaged into modified 0.25-ml French straws, and used 26 to 57 h after collection. Spermatozoa were inseminated 24 h after detection of estrus into the uterine horn of Holstein heifers ipsilateral to the ovary with the largest follicle, as determined by ultrasound 12 h after estrus was detected; side of ovulation was verified by detection of a corpus luteum (CL) by ultrasound 7 to 9 d post estrus. Pregnancy was determined 40 to 45 d post estrus. The side of ovulation was determined correctly in 262 of 286 heifers (92%), and pregnancy rates were nearly identical for ipsilateral and contralateral inseminations. Pregnancy rates were 48/118 (41%), 56/111 (50%), and 35/57 (61%) for 1 x 10(5), 2.5 x 10(5) and 2.5 x 10(6) sperm per insemination (P<.05 between 1 x 10(5) and 2.5 x 10(6). There were no significant differences in pregnancy rates (P>.05) among the heifers for the 3 AI technicians or the 3 bulls. In Experiment 2, freshly collected semen was transported from Lancaster, Pennsylvania to Beltsville, Maryland, and sorted into X- and Y-sperm populations based on DNA difference using a flow cytometer/cell sorter over a 6-h period. Sorting rates were about 100 sperm/sec of each sex at approximately 90% purity. Sorted spermatozoa were shipped approximately 2600 km by air, and in most cases cooled to 5 degrees C during shipping over 6 h in an Equitainer. Heifers were inseminated with 1 to 2 x 10(5) sorted X- or Y-spermatozoa in 0.1 ml within 9 to 29 h of sorting. The inseminate was either deposited into the uterine horn ipsilateral to the ovary with the largest follicle as determined by ultrasound at the time of insemination, or half of the inseminate was deposited into each uterine horn. None of 10 heifers became pregnant when inseminated with sexed spermatozoa shipped at ambient temperature. Of the 155 heifers inseminated with sexed spermatozoa cooled to 5 degrees C, 15 of 67 females (22.4%) inseminated 9 to 13 h post sorting calved, but only 2 of 78 (2.6%) inseminated at 17 to 29 h calved, Fourteen of the 17 calves born (82%) were of the selected sex. 3adairy cattle 3aheifers 3aartificial insemination 3aspermatozoa 3aflow cytometry 3apregnancy rate 3asex ratio 3acalves 3aaccuracy 3acooling 3asemen 0ax-y separation1 aAllen, C.H.1 aJohnson, L.A.1 aHolland, M.D.1 aBrink, Z.1 aWelch, G.R.1 aGraham, J.K.1 aCattell, M.B.0 tTheriogenology.g1997 Dec., v.  48, no.  8 p.1255-1264x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/342163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091002b20091106c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03362naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111024002100151040001800172072000900190072000900199072000900208072000900217072000900226072000900235100001600244245008800260300001800348500002400366500001500390520111600405650001101521650001801532650001901550650002101569650001401590650001801604650001001622650001601632650001101648650001201659650002701671650001901698650002601717650001601743650001101759650001401770650002301784650002001807650001401827650002601841650002001867650004201887650001201929650002201941650002101963650001101984650002201995650002802017650000902045650002802054650002402082653001702106653001802123700001602141700001502157773009102172852000902263856011202272856009002384930003302474945002502507946001102532961001302543655001202556IND4441673720221121231755.0100823e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444167372DNAL7 a206093672pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.06.0112doi7 a10113/458612hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aL500 0aL600 0aL210 0aL001 0aL8211 aVrzal, E.M.10aAmino acids in nectar enhance longevity of female Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes  ap. 1659-1664.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCulex mosquitoes feed on a wide range of nectars consisting of mostly carbohydrates and amino acids, however, little is known about the utilization and effects of these different carbohydrates and their accompanying amino acids on longevity. Culex quinquefasciatus larvae were reared on low- and high-quantity food diets to produce adults that were nutritionally representative of wild-caught and laboratory-reared mosquitoes. Emerging adults reared on low- or high-quantity food diets as larvae were then provided Lantana camara nectar mimics containing mixtures of carbohydrates and amino acids to evaluate effects of nectar amino acids on longevity. Carbohydrates (with or without amino acids) were a critical component of the adult diet, and in their absence, adult mosquitoes died within 3–5 days. The nectar mimic that contained both carbohydrates and amino acids did not increase adult longevity of males originating from either poorly or well-fed larvae. However, females receiving adult diets containing both carbohydrates and amino acids lived 5% longer than females fed adult diets with only sugar. 3anectar 3afeeding level 3ainsect rearing 3ainsect nutrition 3alongevity 3acarbohydrates 3amales 3aamino acids 3aimagos 3afemales 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aLantana camara 3anutrient requirements 3afeed intake 3alarvae 3amortality 3agender differences 3anutritive value 3abody size 3ahematophagous insects 3amating behavior 2aAmino Acidsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aCulexxphysiology 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aLongevityxdrug effects 2aMale 2aPlant Nectarxchemistry 2aSex Characteristics 0ainsect pests 0aadult insects1 aAllan, S.A.1 aHahn, D.A.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2010 Nov., v.  56, no.  11 p.1659-1664x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/458613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.06.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20101206b20110101c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/11/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03137naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164072000900173100002100182245014200203300001600345500002400361500001500385520161000400650002302010650002802033650002002061650002302081650003502104650002202139650001002161650001102171650002102182650002002203653002202223700001802245700002002263773008402283856011202367856008302479930003302562945002502595946001302620961001302633852000902646655001202655IND4443842020221121043132.0101021e199402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444384202DNAL7 a10.1002/jbmr.56500902062doi7 a10113/449802hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aHunt, Curtiss D.10aDietary boron modifies the effects of vitamin D3 nutrition on indices of energy substrate utilizagion and mineral metabolism in the chick  ap. 171-182.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn experiment was designed to test part of the hypothesis that physiologic amounts of dietary boron enhance utilization of or, alternatively, compensate for, inadequate concentrations of active vitamin D metabolites to normalize energy substrate utilization and mineral metabolism. Day-old cockerel chicks were fed a ground corn, high-protein casein, corn oil-based diet (<0.18 mg B/kg) supplemented with physiologic amounts of boron (as orthoboric acid) at 0 (non-PSB) or 1.4 (PSB) mg/kg and vitamin D3 (as vitamin D3 powder in corn endosperm carrier) at 3.13 (inadequate, IVD) or 15.6 (adequate, AVD) μg/kg. After 26 days, IVD decreased food consumption and plasma calcium concentrations and increased plasma concentrations of glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, triglycerides, triiodothyronine, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase activity. In the IVD chicks, PSB returned plasma glucose and triglycerides to concentrations exhibited by the AVD chicks and increased food consumption in both IVD and AVD chicks. Histologic findings suggested that PSB enhanced maturation of the growth plate. A ninefold increase in dietary boron yielded only a twofold increase in plasma boron concentration and no increase in femur boron concentration, which suggests that boron is under homeostatic control. The findings suggest that boron acts on at least three separate metabolic sites because it compensates for perturbations in energy substrate utilization induced by vitamin D3 deficiency, enhances major mineral content in bone, and, independently of vitamin D3, enhances some indices of growth cartilage maturation. 3avitamin metabolism 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3abone metabolism 3amineral metabolism 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aenergy metabolism 3aboron 3achicks 3alipid metabolism 3acholecalciferol 0aanimal physiology1 aHerbel, Jo L.1 aIdso, Joseph P.0 tJournal of bone and mineral research.g1994 Feb., v.  9, no.  2 p.171-1827nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/449803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jbmr.56500902063Available from publisher's Web site  a20101103b20101204c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/11/03  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007100092024002100163040001800184100001800202245009800220300001400318500002400332500001500356520120300371650001301574650002201587650001101609650001501620650001901635650002201654650001501676650002601691650002301717650002501740650003601765650002001801650001101821650001501832650001401847653002301861653002301884653001501907653001301922700001401935700001901949773010501968852000902073856012102082856011202203930003302315945001302348946001102361961001302372655001202385IND2197097620221123005615.0990219e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219709762DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199809)78:1<81::AID-JSFA86>3.0.CO;2-N2doi7 a10113/136662hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrabber, J.H.10aSevere inhibition of maize wall degradation by synthetic lignins formed with conifer aldehyde  ap. 81-87.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aAlthough the enzymatic or ruminal degradability of plants deficient in cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) is often greater than their normal counterparts, factors responsible for these degradability differences have not been identified. Since lignins in CAD deficient plants often contain elevated concentrations of aldehydes, we used a cell-wall model system to evaluate what effect aldehyde-containing lignins have on the hydrolysis of cell walls by fungal enzymes. Varying ratios of coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol were polymerised into non-lignified primary walls of maize (Zea mays L) by wall-bound peroxidase and exogenously supplied H2O2. Coniferaldehyde lignins formed fewer cross-linked structures with other wall components, but they were much more inhibitory to cell wall degradation than lignins formed with coniferyl alcohol. This suggests that the improved degradability of CAD deficient plants is not related to the incorporation of p-hydroxycinnamaldehyde units into lignin. Degradability differences were diminished if enzyme loadings were increased and if hydrophobic aldehyde groups in lignins were reduced to their corresponding alcohols by ethanolic sodium borohydride. 3aZea mays 3aconiferyl alcohol 3asugars 3acell walls 3apolymerization 3ahydrogen peroxide 3acellulases 3abiological resistance 3achemical structure 3acell wall components 3achemical constituents of plants 3aenzyme activity 3alignin 3aperoxidase 3aaldehydes 0aaromatic compounds 0achemical reactions 0ahydrolases 0aalcohols1 aRalph, J.1 aHatfield, R.D.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1998 Sept., v.  78, no.  1 p.81-87x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199809)78:1<81::AID-JSFA86>3.0.CO;2-N3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/136663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080424b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02610naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001900196245007300215300001600288500002400304500001500328520099200343650002601335650001801361650002001379650002401399650000901423650002101432650002501453650001801478650001701496650002401513650001601537651001801553653001401571653002601585653002001611653003401631700001801665773009501683852000901778856011201787856008801899930003301987945002502020946001102045961001202056655001202068IND4398357420221118225938.0071130e20071215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439835742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2007.07.0142doi7 a10113/358072hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK250 0aK810 0aX1001 aWestfall, J.A.10aMeasurement repeatability of a large-scale inventory of forest fuels  ap. 171-176.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aAbstract: An efficient and accurate inventory of forest fuels at large scales is critical for assessment of forest fire hazards across landscapes. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the USDA Forest Service conducts a national inventory of fuels along with blind remeasurement of a portion of inventory plots to monitor and improve data quality. The goal of this study was to evaluate the measurement repeatability/biases of FIA''s national inventory of fuels and suggest opportunities for improving data quality and application of sampling protocols. Results indicated that more than half of the attributes did not attain the desired levels of repeatability and about one-third exhibited a non-zero measurement bias. However, the bias generally had little affect on plot-level estimates. A number of factors that contributed to these results were examined and a holistic approach that considers all aspects of inventory was suggested to improve measurement repeatability. 3afire hazard reduction 3aforest litter 3adata collection 3aUSDA Forest Service 3abias 3aforest inventory 3astatistical analysis 3arepeatability 3aforest fires 3acoarse woody debris 3ameasurement 3aUnited States 0adead wood 0acombustible materials 0afuels inventory 0aForest Inventory and Analysis1 aWoodall, C.W.0 tForest ecology and management.g2007 Dec. 15, v.  253, no.  1-3 p.171-176x0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/358073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2007.07.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/12/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03652naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150100001700159245008600176300001800262500002400280500001500304520190400319650001302223650002002236650001402256650001702270650002502287650002102312650001502333650002102348650001202369650004202381650002302423650001102446650002102457650001402478650001202492650003202504650001702536650002102553651001802574651001802592653001902610653001602629653002202645653000902667653001102676653001202687700001802699700001702717773008702734852000902821856011202830930003302942945001302975946001302988961001303001655001203014IND2325186320221122051548.0020205e200109  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232518632DNAL7 a115737902pmid7 a10113/246402hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL1001 aNorman, H.D.10aAccuracy of recorded birth and calving dates of dairy cattle in the United States  ap. 2089-2096.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aFrequencies of births that were reported for specific days of the month were documented for US dairy cattle born since 1987 by birth year, herd size, and registry status and compared with calving frequencies for those dates. Because birth dates are expected to be random and uniformly distributed throughout each month, percentages of births on individual dates were expected to be equal (3.3% for d 1 to d 28, 3.2% for d 29, 3.0% for d 30, and 1.9% for d 31). However, percentages of reported birth dates for d 1, 2, 10, 15, and 20 were higher than expected. The percentage of reported births for d 1 was highest (5.3%) of all days of the month regardless of herd size or registry status. The nonuniform distribution of birth dates within month indicated that a substantial number of birth dates were unknown and that estimated birth dates had been reported. About one-third of the birth dates recorded on d 1 appeared to have been estimated, or altered to gain an advantage in cattle shows. The highest frequencies for birth dates on d 1 (5.9 to 7.4%) were found for registered cows during months that initiated age groupings for dairy shows (March, June, September, and December). Birth dates for some registered cows were intentionally misreported as confirmed by comparison of birth dates of individual cows with calving dates of their dams. Reported calving dates appeared to be more accurate than reported births; the inflated frequency of recorded calvings on d 1 was only about 30% as large as the inflated frequency of recorded births. Because cow age is determined by birth date, proper reporting of birth dates is important to ensure the accuracy of standardized yield and fitness records and the genetic evaluations that are based on those records. When animals' recorded birth dates and their dams' calving dates differ, more credence should be given to the latter to improve accuracy. 3aaccuracy 3adata collection 3afrequency 3adairy cattle 3astatistical analysis 3acalving interval 3amilk yield 2aAge Distribution 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxstatistics & numerical data 2aCattlexphysiology 2aFemale 2aLabor, Obstetric 2aPregnancy 2aSeasons 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTime Factors 2aVital Statistics 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0acalving season 0aparturition 0alivestock numbers 0adate 0aerrors 0afitness1 aEdwards, J.L.1 aWright, J.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Sept., v.  84, no.  9 p.2089-2096x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090223b20090301c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03021naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002000120040001800140072000900158072000900167072000900176100001800185245008600203300001600289500002400305500001500329520165100344650001501995650002602010650002802036650002802064650002702092650001902119651001202138651001502150653002302165700002002188773007302208852000902281856007802290856011102368930003302479945002502512946001302537961001302550655001202563IND4372087920221116193627.0050707e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437208792DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-07672doi7 a10113/15102hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF400 0aF7001 aPaulitz, T.C.12aA new method for the quantification of Rhizoctonia solani and R. oryzae from soil  ap. 767-772.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aRhizoctonia solani anastomosis group (AG) 8 and R. oryzae are important root pathogens on wheat and barley in the dryland production areas of the inland Pacific Northwest. R. solani AG-8 is difficult to isolate from root systems and quantify in soil because of slow growth and low population densities. However, both pathogens form extensive hyphal networks in the soil and can grow a considerable distance from a food base. A quantitative assay of active hyphae was developed, using wooden toothpicks as baits inserted into sample soils. After 2 days in soil, toothpicks were placed on a selective medium, and the numbers of colonies that grew after 24 h were counted under a dissecting microscope. R. solani and R. oryzae could be distinguished from other fungi based on hyphal morphology. This method was tested in natural soils amended with known inoculum densities of R. solani AG-8 and R. oryzae. Regressions were used to compare the inoculum density or toothpick colonization curves to a predicted curve based on the volume of the toothpicks. The slopes and y intercept of log-log transformed regressions did not differ from the predicted curves in most cases. This technique was used to assess the hyphal activity of R. solani AG-8 and R. oryzae from soil cores taken from various positions in and around Rhizoctonia bare patches at two locations. Activity of R. solani was highest in the center and inside edge of the patch, but there was no effect of patch position on R. oryzae. This simple and inexpensive technique can be used for detection and diagnosis in grower fields and to study the ecology and epidemiology of Rhizoctonia spp. 3asoil fungi 3aquantitative analysis 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3apathogen identification 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal anatomy 3aWyoming 0aWashington 0aRhizoctonia oryzae1 aSchroeder, K.L.0 tPlant disease.g2005 July, v.  89, no.  7 p.767-772x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-07673Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/15103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/07/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03730naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092024002100135040001800156072000900174072000900183100001700192245011500209300001400324500002400338500001500362520200300377650002202380650002402402650002402426650002502450650001502475650000902490650000802499650001202507650002002519650002202539650001802561650001002579650001602589650001902605650000902624650001702633650001802650650001502668650001602683653000902699653000902708700001602717700001802733773008102751852000902832856011202841856009302953930003303046945002503079946001103104961001303115655001203128IND4372373420221120042208.0050718e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437237342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2004.11.0072doi7 a10113/110592hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aTurner, K.E.10aIntake, performance, and blood parameters in young goats offered high forage diets of lespedeza or alfalfa hay  ap. 15-23.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aJuly-born F1 Boer x Spanish (BoerX), Nubian, and Spanish buck kids (n = 18) were used in an experiment to evaluate the use of lespedeza hay in goat diets. Bucklings were weaned at 60 d of age and maintained on pasture and in pens, before being assigned to the experiment at 6 months of age. Kids were randomly assigned to six pens and stratified by breed. The two diets were ad libitum: (1) sericea lespedeza [Lespedeza cuneata (Dum.-Cours) G. Don; LESP] hay, or (2) alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.; ALF) hay. All animals received a 16% crude protein (CP) corn/cottonseed-based supplement offered at 0.5% of body weight (BW) per head/d. Total dry matter intake (DMI) was higher (P < 0.001) for LESP-based (42.1 g/kg BW per day) than for ALF-based (38.7 g/kg BW per day) diets, and increased with time on trial for LESP, but not ALF (diet x time interaction: P < 0.05). Bucks offered ALF had higher average daily gain (ADG; 103 versus 56 g/d; P < 0.01) and final BW (31.3 versus 26.6 kg; P < 0.05) than those offered LESP. Initial body weights were higher (P < 0.001) for Nubian (24.7 kg) compared to BoerX (18.5 kg) or Spanish (19.7 kg) which were similar. This same trend was observed for final body weights (P < 0.05; Nubian 33.4 kg; BoerX 25.9 kg; Spanish 27.3 kg). There were no breed differences (P > 0.10) in ADG (mean 79 g/d). Bucks offered the ALF-based diet had higher (P < 0.001) plasma concentrations (mg/dl) of blood urea nitrogen (BUN; 21.1 versus 10.7) and glucose (67.7 versus 59.5) and lower (P < 0.001) creatinine (0.53 versus 0.62 mg/dl) compared to kids offered the LESP-based diet. Blood glucose concentrations were highest (P < 0.001) for Nubian (66.3 mg/dl) and lowest for Boer cross (60.9 mg/dl); Spanish was intermediate (63.6 mg/dl). Creatinine levels were similar among breeds (mean 0.57 mg/dl). More research is needed to evaluate goat breed, forage species, stage of forage maturity, condensed tannins, and supplementation effects on nutrient utilization by finishing goats. 3abreed differences 3aNubian (goat breed) 3aprotein supplements 3aSpanish (goat breed) 3acottonseed 3acorn 3ahay 3aalfalfa 3aliveweight gain 3aLespedeza cuneata 3acrude protein 3abucks 3afeed intake 3aanimal feeding 3aurea 3ablood plasma 3ablood glucose 3acreatinine 3ametabolites 0aBoer 0akids1 aWildeus, S.1 aCollins, J.R.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2005 July, v.  59, no.  1 p.15-23x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110593Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2004.11.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20080710b20080801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/01/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02536naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001700140245006600157300001600223500002400239500002400263520123000287650002201517650001001539650002301549650001901572650001101591650002301602650002301625650001801648650001801666650002501684651001401709700002201723700001701745700001601762700001601778773006701794852000901861856011201870930003301982945002502015946001302040961001302053655001202066IND4450450320221118031914.0110308e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445045032DNAL7 a10113/486652hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aHanson, B.A.10aAvian Influenza Viruses in Minnesota Ducks During 1998–2000  ap. 867-871.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aAlthough wild ducks are known to be a major reservoir for avian influenza viruses (AIV), there are few recent published reports of surveillance directed at this group. Predominant AIV hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes reported in previous studies of ducks in North America include H3, H4, and H6, with the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes not well represented in these host populations. The objective of this study was to determine whether these subtype patterns have persisted. Each September from 1998 to 2000, cloacal swabs were collected from wild ducks banded in Roseau and Marshall counties, MN. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were sampled all years, and northern pintails (A. acuta) were sampled only in 1999. Influenza viruses were isolated from 11%, 14%, and 8% of birds during 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. Prevalence, as expected, was highest in juveniles, ranging from 11% to 23% in mallards. Viruses representative of the HA subtypes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 were isolated. Viruses in the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes, which are associated with high-pathogenicity influenza in poultry or recent infections in humans, were not uncommon, and each of these subtypes was isolated in 2 out of the 3 years of surveillance. 3aInfluenza A virus 3aducks 3adisease reservoirs 3ahemagglutinins 3acloaca 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3adisease prevalence 3ayoung animals 3apathogenicity 3adisease surveillance 3aMinnesota1 aStallknecht, D.E.1 aSwayne, D.E.1 aLewis, L.A.1 aSenne, D.A.0 tAvian diseases.g2003 Sept., v.  47 p.867-871x1938-43517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/486653Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110414b20110507c00000000  aINDdYLPe2011/04/11  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02502naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182100001800191245008400209300001800293500012100311500002400432520095600456650003101412650002301443650002401466650001801490650003401508650001701542650002401559651001801583700001401601700001801615700001501633773009901648852000901747856011201756856009201868930003301960945002501993946001302018961001302031655001202044IND4366267120221121200532.0041228s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436626712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0002-9092.2004.00669.x2doi7 a10113/331822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE720 0aT0001 aHuffman, W.E.10aWho do consumers trust for information: the case of genetically modified foods?  ap. 1222-1229.  aPaper presented at the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association annual meeting, August 2004, Denver, Colorado.  aIncludes references  aTo be effective, groups that disseminate information need the trust of consumers.  When multiple groups provide conflicting information on a new product or process like GM-foods, consumers place different levels of trust in the various sources.  We present a model of the contributions of personal and social capital of a consumer, and test a multinominal logit model of relative trust in five different sources of information on genetic modification using a unique data set.  Among our findings is that an increase in consumer's education lowers the probability of trusting information from government, private industry/organizations, consumer and environmental groups, or other sources relative to information from an independent, third-party source, and conservative religious affiliation reduces the odds of a consumer trusting private industry/organization and increases the odds of trusting nobody relative to an independent, third-party source. 3agenetically modified foods 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer acceptance 3afood industry 3anongovernmental organizations 3afood beliefs 3ainformation sources 3aUnited States1 aRousu, M.1 aShogren, J.F.1 aTegene, A.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2004, v.  86, no.  5 p.1222-1229x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/331823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0002-9092.2004.00669.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090916b20091002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/09/16  aOther US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle02619naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001800140245003900158300001700197500027300214500002400487500001500511520116700526650003001693650002001723650001701743650002301760650001901783650001501802650002001817651001501837651001801852653001001870653001601880700001601896773007001912852000901982856011201991930003302103945001302136946001102149961001302160655001202173IND2201231820221118230313.0991022e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220123182DNAL7 a10113/358112hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE2001 aDuxbury, J.M.10aAgriculture and dietary guidelines  ap. 197- 231.  aIn the special issue: US dietary guidelines: research and policy needs in the nutrition, health, and agricultural sectors / edited by C.

The western US, especially California, dominates current production of both fresh and processed fruits and vegetables. Constraints in land and water resources in California suggest that some shifts in production could occur in the future if production is matched to self sufficiency. Opportunities exist for production to increase in the eastern half of the US where water is abundant, especially for processed products. Even regions with long winters, such as the northeast, could be self sufficient in fruits and vegetables. Past responses of agriculture to producing more healthy products include vegetable oils, low fat milk and greater production of poultry. Crop improvement programs have not included nutrition and health characteristics as a guiding principle and much potential to improve these traits in fruits and vegetables exists. Greater understanding of the effects of environmental and management factors on crop 'quality' is needed and strategies to produce nutritionally consistent products should be developed. 3ageographical distribution 3acrop production 3acrop quality 3aDietary Guidelines 3aland resources 3avegetables 3awater resources 3aCalifornia 0aUnited States 0afruit 0aconstraints1 aWelch, R.M.0 tFood policy.g1999 , v.  24, no.  2/3 p.197- 231x0306-91927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/358113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02808naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173100002400182245019300206300001400399500002400413520108200437650001701519650001601536650002701552650001501579650002101594650002501615650001501640650002101655650003001676650002301706650002101729650001401750650001901764651001601783653002101799700002401820700002001844700002001864773011101884852000901995856009202004856011202096930003302208945002502241946001102266961001302277655001202290IND4402823520221119140641.0080314e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440282352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1445-6664.2007.00272.x2doi7 a10113/123472hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF9001 aBoyette, C.

Ditmar: Fr., was tested alone and in combination with a glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl]glycine) product for controlling natural infestations of the invasive vines, redvine (Brunnichia ovata[Walt.] Shinners) and trumpetcreeper (Campsis radicans[L.] Seem. ex Bureau). After 12 days, redvine and trumpetcreeper were controlled by 88% and 90%, respectively, through a synergistic interaction between the fungus and the herbicide, glyphosate. The disease symptomatology was characterized by rapid necrosis of the leaf and stem tissues, with mortality occurring within 72 h. Neither glyphosate alone, nor M. verrucaria alone, controlled these weeds at commercially acceptable levels (>=80%). No visual disease or herbicide damage occurred to the soybean in the treated test plots 12 days after planting. These results suggest that some formulations of glyphosate, mixed with M. verrucaria, can effectively control redvine and trumpetcreeper. 3aweed control 3awoody weeds 3aMyrothecium verrucaria 3aglyphosate 3achemical control 3apesticide synergists 3aBrunnichia 3aCampsis radicans 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3ainvasive species 3asynergism 3amycoherbicides 3aMississippi 0aBrunnichia ovata1 aHoagland, Robert E.1 aWeaver, Mark A.1 aReddy, Krishnan0 tWeed biology and management.g2008 Mar., v.  8, no.  1 p.39-45dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1444-61627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1445-6664.2007.00272.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110510b20110603c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/03/27  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02287naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003100132024002100163040001800184072000900202100001500211245014700226300001800373500002400391506007600415520031700491506003700808650002100845650002600866650001300892650001900905650001900924650002100943650002200964650001200986650005500998650004001053650002201093650002501115650005801140650002501198653002301223653002401246700001601270773007901286852000901365856011201374856007001486856008101556930003301637945002501670946001301695961001301708655001201721IND4365938020221207100937.0041207e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436593802DNAL7 a155424982pmid7 aPMC5271432pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.104.0517222doi7 a10113/144042hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aHerman, E.10aEndoplasmic reticulum to vacuole trafficking of endoplasmic reticulum bodies provides an alternate pathway for protein transfer to the vacuole  ap. 3440-3446.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper discusses the deposition of protein precursors and other substances in the vacuole that constitutes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to vacuole trafficking pathway.

Compared to most other habitats, natural or man-made, a filled grain silo constitutes a unique and fairly homogeneous habitat in which food availability for many grain-feeding insects is unlimited. A fundamental aspect of stored-grain insect ecology is a better understanding of associations among common beetle species. We analyzed the densities of three important stored-grain beetle species, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) (Coleoptera: Laemophloeidae), and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) in wheat samples collected in 1999–2001 from 129 grain silos in Kansas. The beetles studied here are highly mobile, and the number of insects in each grain sample is a result of the beetles' preference for favorable micro-environmental conditions and possibly of intra- and interspecific associations. In general, the number of T. castaneum in a grain sample increased as the number of R. dominica increased, but the number of C. ferrugineus was not correlated with the number of R. dominica. The densities of both T. castaneum and R. dominica decreased as the number of C. ferrugineus increased. Cryptolestes ferrugineus and T. castaneum can be predators and the species composition of insects in a grain sample may be modified by predation. As T. castaneum populations increased, so did R. dominica but not C. ferrugineus. Our analysis of the species composition in grain samples is discussed in an ecological context. 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aCryptolestes ferrugineus 3aTribolium castaneum 3astorage insects 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3aspecies diversity 3ainterspecific competition 3ainsect ecology 3awheat 3agrain storage facilities 3asilos 0aspecies interactions1 aFlinn, Paul1 aHagstrum, David1 aToews, Michael D.1 aMeikle, William G.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2009 Oct., v.  45, no.  4 p.254-260x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/358013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2009.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/11/18  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02576naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002300176245005000199300001600249500002500265500001500290520089200305650001801197650001301215650001701228650001101245650001701256650002301273650001701296650001601313650003001329650001901359650001001378650002501388650001201413650001101425650001301436650002801449650004001477650002601517650001101543650001901554650001001573653001501583653002301598700001901621773011701640852000901757856011201766930003301878945002501911946001301936961001301949655001201962IND8111176820221118191343.0811130e198107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND811117682DNAL7 a72759122pmid7 a10113/268852hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aQ202 0aQ2031 aStubblefield, R.D.10aDetermination of aflatoxins in animal tissues  ap. 964-968.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-05  aA method for the determination of aflatoxins in animal tissues has been developed, and applied successfully to beef, swine, chicken, and human livers, and to beef kidney, heart, spleen, muscle, and blood. Blended tissue is denatured with citric acid and extracted with dichloromethane on a wrist-action shaker. After filtration, the extract is partially purified on a silica gel column, and aflatoxins B1 and M1 are determined by 2-dimensional thin layer chromatography and densitometry. Recoveries of B1 and M1 added to meat tissues and blood were approximately 90 and 80%, respectively. The method gave results for a contaminated freeze-dried liver comparable to analyses by 3 other published meat tissue methods. The method is rapid and has a determination limit less than or equal to 0.1 ng/g. In addition, the method uses less toxic and smaller quantities of solvents and chemicals. 3ameat products 3achickens 3adensitometry 3ahumans 3aaflatoxin M1 3afood contamination 3aaflatoxin B1 3abeef cattle 3athin layer chromatography 3aanimal tissues 3aswine 2aAflatoxinsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aChickens 2aChromatographyxmethods 2aChromatography, Thin Layerxmethods 2aDensitometryxmethods 2aHumans 2aMeatxanalysis 2aSwine 0aaflatoxins 0aanalytical methods1 aShotwell, O.L.0 tJournal of the Association of Offical Analytical Chemists.g1981 July, v.  64, no.  4 p.964-968x0004-57567nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/268853Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/03/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03833naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002000131040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100002000196245009500216300001600311500002400327520218100351650001502532650002402547650002002571650002002591650001902611650001502630650004502645650001502690650000902705650002402714650001802738650001202756650001302768650001002781650002602791651001302817651000902830700001502839700002002854700001502874773008702889852000902976856011102985856008903096930003303185945002503218946001103243961001303254655001203267IND4384372020221122092729.0061016e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438437202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.07.0062doi7 a10113/68772hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ200 0aJ7001 aBlackwood, C.B.10aEubacterial communities in different soil macroaggregate environments and cropping systems  ap. 720-728.  aIncludes references  aDifferent positions within soil macroaggregates, and macroaggregates of different sizes, have different chemical and physical properties which could affect microbial growth and interactions among taxa. The hypothesis that these soil aggregate fractions contain different eubacterial communities was tested using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the 16S ribosomal gene. Communities were characterized from two field experiments, located at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS), MI, USA and the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC), Wooster, OH, USA. Three soil management regimes at each site were sampled and management was found to significantly affect T-RFLP profiles. The soil aggregate erosion (SAE) method was used to isolate aggregate regions (external and internal regions). Differences between eubacterial T-RFLP profiles of aggregate exteriors and interiors were marginally significant at KBS (accounting for 12.5% of total profile variance), and not significant at OARDC. There were no significant differences among macroaggregate size classes at either site. These results are in general agreement with previous studies using molecular methods to examine microbial communities among different soil macroaggregate size fractions, although further study of communities within different aggregate regions is warranted. Analysis of individual macroaggregates revealed large inter-aggregate variability in community structure. Hence the tertiary components of soil structure, e.g. arrangement of aggregates in relation to shoot residue, roots, macropores, etc., may be more important than aggregate size or intra-aggregate regions in the determination of the types of microbial communities present in aggregates. Direct microscopic counts were also used to examine the bacterial population size in aggregate regions at KBS. The proportion of bacterial cells with biovolumes >0.18 micrometer 3 was higher in aggregate interiors than in exteriors, indicating potentially higher activity in that environment. This proportion was significantly related to percent C of the samples, while total bacterial cell counts were not. 3aEubacteria 3acommunity structure 3apopulation size 3asoil aggregates 3asoil structure 3aloam soils 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3amicroscopy 3acorn 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3aalfalfa 3asoybeans 3awheat 3afield experimentation 3aMichigan 3aOhio1 aDell, C.J.1 aSmucker, A.J.M.1 aPaul, E.A.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 Apr., v.  38, no.  4 p.720-728x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/68773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.07.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20071121b20071210c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/11/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02865naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110024002100141040001800162072000900180072000900189100001600198245013800214300001600352500002400368520110800392650003001500650001901530650003201549650003601581650001201617650003601629650003601665650002601701650003601727650001701763650001301780650002101793650003001814650009401844650002401938700001701962773008401979852000902063856008102072856011202153930003302265945002502298946001102323961001302334655001202347IND2058889520221116141915.0970809e199705  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205888952DNAL7 a90942262pmid7 a10.1007/s0020300504462doi7 a10113/150952hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aX3501 aSchocke, L.10aPurification and characterization of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from the anaerobic ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens  ap. 289-294.  aIncludes references  aPhosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase was purified 42-fold with a 25% yield from cell extracts of Ruminococcus flavefaciens by ammonium sulfate precipitation, preparative isoelectric focusing, and removal of carrier ampholytes by chromatography. The enzyme had a subunit molecular mass of approximately 66.3 kDa (determined by mass spectrometry), but was retained by a filter having a 100-kDa nominal molecular mass cutoff. Optimal activity required activation of the enzyme by Mn2+ and stabilization of the nucleotide substrate by Mg2+. GDP was a more effective phosphoryl acceptor than ADP while IDP was not utilized. Under optimal conditions the measured activity in the direction of PEP carboxylation was 17.2 micromoles min-1 (mg enzyme)-1. The apparent Km values for PEP (0.3 mM) and GDP (2.0 mM) were 9- and 14-fold lower than the apparent Km values for the substrates of the back reaction (oxaloacetate and GTP, respectively). The data are consistent with the involvement of PEP carboxykinase as the primary carboxylation enzyme in the fermentation of cellulose to succinate by this bacterium. 3aRuminococcus flavefaciens 3arumen bacteria 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 2aAnimals 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxenzymology 2aCations, Divalentxpharmacology 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aFermentation 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Weight 2aOxaloacetatesxmetabolism 2aPhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP)xchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRumenxmicrobiology1 aWeimer, P.J.0 tArchives of microbiology.g1997 May, v.  167, no.  5 p.289-294x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020300504463Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/150953Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080528b20080606c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/05/28  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02697naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001100185245011100196300001800307500007800325500002400403520112500427650003401552650002201586650001501608650001801623650001201641650001301653650002101666650001301687650002401700650001801724650002801742650002601770650002601796653002301822700001601845700001701861773007201878852000901950856011201959930003302071945002502104946001302129961001302142655001202155IND4402700720221119140756.0080311e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440270072DNAL7 a10113/123422hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aW000 0aJ500 0aJ700 0aJ710 0aX1001 aMa, L.10aSystems Modeling for Soil and Water Research and Management: Current Status and Needs for the 21st Century  ap. 1705-1713.  aPart of the ASABE 100th Anniversary Soil and Water Invited Review Series.  aIncludes references  aQuantitative system approaches, provided by process-based models of agricultural systems, are essential for optimizing the use of increasingly limited water and soil resources, guiding tactical management, and addressing the environmental concerns and global issues of the 21st century.

In this brief review, we present: (1) the current status of system model development and applications in soil and water research and management, with examples from the USDA-ARS Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM); (2) lessons learned from RZWQM development and applications; and (3) future needs and directions in system model enhancements and applications to make them more effective. We make a strong case for international collaborations among modelers and experimentalists and for a common development/applications protocol and platform for the future. 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3awater quality 3atillage 3anitrogen 3alosses from soil 3aleaching 3anutrient management 3acrop rotation 3acrop residue management 3airrigation management 3apesticide application 0aliterature reviews1 aAhuja, L.R.1 aMalone, R.W.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2007 , v.  50, no.  5 p.1705-17137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123423Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/31  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03353naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159100001700168245010000185300001800285500002400303500001500327520164800342650002201990650002002012650001002032650001002042650001702052650002002069650002802089650001602117650001202133650001302145650003402158650001102192650004102203650002402244650000902268650001302277650002702290651001802317651001802335653001102353653002402364653002002388700001702408700001702425700001802442773008602460852000902546856011202555930003302667945001302700946001302713961001302726655001202739IND2325054420221122051524.0020128e200108  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232505442DNAL7 a115183162pmid7 a10113/246382hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL2101 aNorman, H.D.10aOverview of progeny-test programs of artificial-insemination organizations in the United States  ap. 1899-1912.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aCharacteristics of progeny-test (PT) programs of artificial insemination (AI) organizations in the United States were examined for changes since 1960. Mean number of bulls that were progeny tested annually by major AI organizations during the mid 1990s was 11 for Ayrshires, 24 for Brown Swiss, 21 for Guernseys, 1261 for Holsteins, 112 for Jerseys, and 3 for Milking Shorthorns. Mean parent age at progeny-test (PT) bull birth decreased except for Milking Shorthorns; mean age of maternal grandsire at bull birth decreased for Holsteins and Jerseys but increased for other breeds. For Holsteins, mean ancestor ages at PT bull birth were 85 mo for sires, 47 mo for dams, and 136 mo for maternal grandsires during the mid 1990s. Percentage of PT bulls that resulted from embryo transfer increased to 78% for Brown Swiss and 80% for Holsteins by 1999. Inbreeding in PT bulls increased over time and ranged from 3.8% for Brown Swiss to 6.4% for Jerseys (5.6% for Holsteins) during the mid 1990s. Mean numbers of daughters and herds per PT bull generally declined except for Holsteins, which increased during the early 1990s to 61 daughters and 44 herds. Mean number of states in which PT daughters are located increased; for Holstein PT bulls during 1994, 22% of daughters were in California, 13% in Wisconsin, 12% in New York, and 10% in Pennsylvania and Minnesota. Percentage of first-lactation cows that were PT daughters increased and ranged from 6% for Milking Shorthorns to 22% for Ayrshires (14% for Holsteins) during 1998. Percentage of PT daughters that were registered declined and was 19% for Holsteins and around 80% for other breeds. 3abreed differences 3asire evaluation 3asires 3abulls 3adairy breeds 3aprogeny testing 3aartificial insemination 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMale 2aPedigree 2aReproductionxgenetics 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0acattle 0ageneration interval 0aanimal breeding1 aPowell, R.L.1 aWright, J.R.1 aSattler, C.G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Aug., v.  84, no.  8 p.1899-1912x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246383Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090223b20090301c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03151naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150072000900168100001500177245010800192300001400300500002400314500001500338520151700353650001801870650001201888650002301900650001101923650002001934650003001954650002201984650002302006650002002029650001802049650002602067650001902093650002402112650002502136650002302161653002502184653001602209700001502225773009102240852000902331856008702340856011202427930003302539945002502572946001102597961001302608655001202621IND4364830620221120042308.0041006e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436483062DNAL7 a10.1080/09583150210000543952doi7 a10113/110542hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aDowd, P.F.10aAutodissemination of Beauveria bassiana by sap beetles (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) to overwintering sites  ap. 65-75.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aAn autoinoculative device was used to test the ability of sap beetles (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) to carry a specific strain of Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin to overwintering sites in a multiyear field study. The device was baited with the pheromone and coattractants for the dusky sap beetle (Carpophilus lugubris Murray) and placed in the field in the fall of each year. The introduced strain occurred at high frequency among the B. bassiana isolated in the fall of all four years tested (100% of all isolates from 21 of 22 collection dates). The introduced strain of B. bassiana was isolated at high frequency from all the B. bassiana-contaminated sap beetles recovered from the overwintering traps (100% of all isolates from 13 of 23 trap/beetle species combinations) and was highest after the longest fall exposure. The introduced strain was primarily isolated from C. lugubris and C. antiquus, but species distribution was also dependent on the overwintering trap design used. Few non-sap beetles species of insects were recovered from the artificial overwintering sites. Although B. bassiana was isolated from free flying sap beetles caught in traps in the spring of each year, none were infected with the introduced strain. The autoinoculating device provides selective contamination of sap beetles in overwintering sites when used in the fall. It may be useful in providing some control of sap beetles or other insects where limited numbers of mass overwintering sites (such as tree holes) occur. 3aoverwintering 3astrains 3ainsect attractants 3aautumn 3aspore dispersal 3abiological control agents 3ainsect pheromones 3aBeauveria bassiana 3apheromone traps 3afungal spores 3afield experimentation 3ainsect control 3ainoculation methods 3aCarpophilus lugubris 3abiological control 0aCarpophilus antiquus 0aCarpophilus1 aVega, F.E.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2003 Feb., v.  13, no.  1 p.65-75x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583150210000543953Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/07  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02853naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092024001800135024002100153040001800174072000900192072000900201100002000210245011200230300001800342500002400360520106700384650001201451650001501463650001801478650001701496650001101513650004701524650001201571650003301583650001101616650004401627650001101671650001801682650001901700651001801719651001801737653002801755653002001783653002201803700001601825700001501841700001501856700001801871773008601889852000901975856011201984856009302096930003302189945001302222946001302235961001502248655001202263IND2041726720221120214636.0940831e199406  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204172672DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77096-X2doi7 a80834142pmid7 a10113/430692hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL1001 aHeinrichs, A.J.14aThe National Dairy Heifer Evaluation Project: a profile of heifer management practices in the United States  ap. 1548-1556.  aIncludes references  aThe National Dairy Heifer Evaluation Project was a cooperative, USDA-sponsored project involving state agricultural departments, the Cooperative Extension Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

Information collected pertained primarily to dairy neonates and replacement heifers. Much of the study was related to observational information on health and management characteristics that can be related to the animals' long-term physical and economic performance. The data reflect herds representing 78% of the national dairy cow population. Average herd size was 86 milking and dry cows and 66 heifers. Many characteristics of these herds reflect accepted and recommended practices in the area of dairy replacement management and nutrition. Data summarized in this national study can be utilized to evaluate the impact of management practices on dairy operations. 3aheifers 3adairy cows 3aanimal health 3acalf feeding 3acalves 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxphysiology 2aCattle 2aDairyingxorganization & administration 2aFemale 2aHealth Status 2aHealth Surveys 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0arepresentative sampling 0acalf production 0alivestock numbers1 aWells, S.J.1 aHurd, H.S.1 aHill, G.W.1 aDargatz, D.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 June, v.  77, no.  6 p.1548-1556x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/430693Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77096-X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle04520naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111024002100139040001800160100001800178245011200196300001800308500002400326500001500350520306500365650001603430650001003446650001103456650001703467650001503484650003603499650002603535653001503561653001403576653001903590700001803609700001803627700001603645700001703661773008903678852000903767856011203776856007803888930003303966945001303999946001304012961001304025655001204038IND2061622820221116141932.0980202e199606  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206162282DNAL7 a242259342pmid7 a10.1007/BF020279512doi7 a10113/150962hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfister, J.A.10aInfluence of alkaloid concentration on acceptability of tall larkspur (Delphinium spp.) to cattle and sheep  ap. 1147-1168.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aTall larkspur (Delphinium spp.) is a serious toxic plant problem on western U.S. ranges. The major toxins in tall larkspur are methyllycaconitine (MLA) and 14-deacetylnudicauline (14-DAN); the sum of both is termed the toxic alkaloid concentration. Toxic alkaloids compose about 20-50% of the total alkaloid concentration in tall larkspur. Toxic and total alkaloid concentration generally declines with maturity, whereas cattle and sheep consumption of larkspur typically increases with plant maturity. We hypothesized that cattle and sheep consumption of tall larkspur was negatively related to higher concentrations of total or toxic alkaloid. We compared consumption of several collections of dried, ground larkspur and fresh larkspur in a series of trials. In another trial, a crude alkaloid fraction was extracted with ethanol, added to alfalfa hay, and consumption compared to untreated alfalfa hay, alcohol-treated hay, and the essentially alkaloid free plant residue. In all cases we correlated amounts eaten with total and toxic alkaloid concentration. A grazing trial was also conducted to relate larkspur consumption over time to alkaloid concentrations. Total alkaloid concentrations in dried, whole-plant collections ranged from 9.3 to 38.8 mg/g of dry weight, whereas toxic alkaloid concentrations varied from 0.0 to 7.1 mg/g. In one pen trial, cattle preferred a larkspur collection (P < 0.01) that contained no toxic alkaloids but had a high total alkaloid concentration (39 mg/g). There was no correlation (p > 0.05), however, between concentrations of total or toxic alkaloids and amount of dry plant consumed in this or any other trial. Conversely, sheep consumption tended to be negatively influenced by total and toxic alkaloid concentration (P < 0.08). In the trials with extract, cattle preferred the alcohol-treated hay and rejected the alkaloid-free residue (P < 0.01), whereas the alkaloid treated hay was of intermediate acceptability. Cattle preferred the alkaloid-treated hay over the alkaloid-free residue, indicating that alkaloids did not deter consumption. Conversely, the alkaloid-treated hay was less preferred than either untreated or alcohol-treated hay, suggesting a negative effect on acceptability. There was no correlation between alkaloid concentration and amount of treated feed eaten. In field trials, the amount of composited, fresh leaves or flowers eaten by cattle was influenced by plant part (P = 0.04), but was not related (P > 0.05) to alkaloid concentration. Cattle preferred leaves over flowers when offered individual plants differing in phenological stage and/or amount of shade, but alkaloid concentration was not related to consumption. We conclude that knowledge of the concentration of total or toxic alkaloid in tall larkspur will give little or no indication of plant acceptability to cattle. Even though accurate predictions can be made about the potential toxicity of larkspur based on the concentration of toxic alkaloids, predictions about consumption must be based primarily on plant phenology. 3aphytotoxins 3asheep 3acattle 3apalatability 3aDelphinium 3achemical constituents of plants 3aditerpenoid alkaloids 0aterpenoids 0aalkaloids 0agrazing trials1 aManners, G.D.1 aGardner, D.R.1 aPrice, K.W.1 aRalphs, M.H.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1996 June, v.  22, no.  6 p.1147-1168x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/150963Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF020279513Available from publisher's Web site  a20080529b20080606c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03574naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245011900212520182600331592002802157650001402185650001202199650001302211650002302224650001502247650001102262650002902273650001002302650002102312650001302333650001502346650001502361650000902376650001502385650001902400650000902419650001902428650001702447650001602464650001602480650002102496650001202517651001202529653001402541653001502555653001502570653001402585653002002599653001202619700002502631700002602656700002202682700002102704700002502725773011502750856008602865852000902951655001202960IND60674957020221118234916.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067495702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1058722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonroe, Adrian P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0934-822510aUsing remote sensing products to predict recovery of vegetation across space and time following energy development  aUsing localized studies to understand how ecosystems recover can create uncertainty in recovery predictions across landscapes. Large archives of remote sensing data offer opportunities for quantifying the spatial and temporal factors influencing recovery at broad scales and predicting recovery. For example, energy production is a widespread and expanding land use among many semi-arid ecosystems of the Western United States dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), a keystone species providing a variety of ecological services. With remotely-sensed (Landsat) estimates of vegetation cover collected every 2–5 years from southwestern Wyoming, USA, over nearly three decades (1985–2015), we modeled changes in sagebrush cover on 375 former oil and gas well pads in response to weather and site-level conditions. We then used modeled relationships to predict recovery time across the landscape as an indicator of resilience for vegetation after well pad disturbances, where faster recovery indicates a greater capacity to recover when similarly disturbed. We found the rate of change in sagebrush cover generally increased with moisture and temperature, particularly at higher elevations. Rate of change in sagebrush cover also increased and decreased with greater percent sand and larger well pads, respectively. We predicted 21% of the landscape would recover to pre-disturbance conditions within 60 years, whereas other areas may require >100 years for recovery. These predictions and maps could inform future restoration efforts as they reflect resilience. This approach also is applicable to other disturbance types (e.g., fires and vegetation removal treatments) across landscapes, which can further improve conservation efforts by characterizing past conditions and monitoring trends in subsequent years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aLandsat 3aaltitude 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental indicators 3afires 3akeystone species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3aoils 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asand 3aspace and time 3aspatial data 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3avegetation cover 3aweather 3aWyoming 0aArtemisia 0aMonitoring 0aResilience 0aSagebrush 0aSoil properties 0aWeather1 aAldridge, Cameron L.1 aO'Donnell, Michael S.1 aManier, Daniel J.1 aHomer, Collin G.1 aAnderson, Patrick J.0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Mar., v. 110 p.105872-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1058723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002500167245012600192300001600318520144600334592002801780650001601808650001501824650002001839650003101859650001001890650001101900650001901911650001801930650001601948650000901964650001401973650002801987650002402015650002902039650002602068650001202094650002902106650001802135650001602153650001902169650001102188650003902199650004202238650003002280650000902310650002602319650004002345650007102385700002502456700002502481700002302506700001802529773008002547856008202627990002302709852000902732655001202741IND60094345420221123023341.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009434542DNAL7 a224842412pmid7 a10.1016/j.cyto.2012.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodward, Eleanor A.14aThe anti-inflammatory actions of IL-4 in human monocytes are not mediated by IL-10, RP105 or the kinase activity of RIPK2  ap. 415-423.  aThe anti-inflammatory actions of IL-4 in activated human monocytes may reflect transcriptional regulation of genes involved in TLR signaling pathways. Tailored gene arrays were conducted to profile the expression of 84 genes central to TLR-mediated signal transduction in human monocytes treated with the TLR4 ligand, LPS, with or without IL-4. In the first 3h, IL-4 down-regulated mRNA levels of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, without altering mRNA levels of TLRs, TLR-related signaling molecules or multiple transcription factors. The down-regulation of inflammatory genes by IL-4 was preceded by an early up-regulation of IL-10 mRNA and protein and mRNA for receptor-interacting serine–threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2), the TLR homolog, RP105, and c-Maf, a transcription factor required for IL-10 gene expression. However, IL-4 still suppressed LPS-induced TNFα production in bone-marrow derived macrophages from IL10⁻/⁻ mice, and in the presence of a neutralizing antibody to IL-10 in human monocytes. The up-regulation of RIPK2 and RP105 mRNA by IL-4 occurred independently of IL-10. IL-4 maintained the ability to suppress LPS-induced TNFα and enhance IL-10 production in the presence of RIPK2 kinase inhibitors. Further, IL-4 failed to up-regulate expression of RP105 at the cell surface. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-4 occur independently of IL-10, RP105, and the kinase activity of RIPK2.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone marrow 3achemokines 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-4 3amacrophages 3amice 3amonocytes 3aneutralizing antibodies 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, CDxphysiology 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aFlow Cytometry 2aHumans 2aInflammationxprevention & control 2aInterleukin-10xgeneticsxphysiology. 2aInterleukin-4xphysiology 2aMice 2aMonocytesxphysiology 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aReceptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinase 2xphysiology1 aKolesnik, Tatiana B.1 aNicholson, Sandra E.1 aPrêle, Cecilia M.1 aHart, Prue H.0 tCytokine.g2012 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.415-423dElsevier Ltdx1043-46667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.03.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170300001600269500001900285520129300304536012401597592002801721650001601749650001401765650001201779650001501791650000901806650001701815651001001832653003401842653003201876653002801908653002001936653002501956700001901981700001502000700001602015700001902031700001702050700001802067700001602085773011302101856008502214852000902299655001202308IND60701184320221119234312.0200708e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070118432DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2020.17353722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVallefuoco, M.10aShallow marine sediments characterisation of the Bagnoli brownfield site, Pozzuoli Bay (Italy)  ap. 550-564.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe adopted a combined geophysical-stratigraphic approach to identify grain size anomalies in sediment distribution of the Bagnoli coastal brownfield site. A large industrial plant occupied this area during most of the 20th Century. We used 18 core logs to identify macroscopic variation in sediment stratigraphy, and 72 supplemental cores to mark changes between sandy- and silt-dominated intervals. The stratigraphy evidenced the presence of anomalous lens of silt within a sandy coastal sector inside the Bagnoli industrial harbour. Cores description helped us to calibrate the interpretation of 4 subbottom profiles, that we used to obtain information on geometries of silty deposits. The spatial layout of sediments revealed that silt intervals are present in the area bounded by the old industrial wharfs. We suggest that these silty sediments are likely the result of uncontrolled discharge occurred during the last century. Once calibrated, high-resolution mono-channel seismic profiles helped us to define the shape as well as the real extent and thicknesses of silty deposits, resulted to be ca. 515.000 m², with an overall volume of 480.000 m³. These results are a first attempt to define the amount of polluted sediments in the area facing the Bagnoli industrial harbour.  aThis paper was partially funded by the ABBaCo Project, coordinated by Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn of Naples (Italy).  aPublisher supplied data 3abrownfields 3achemistry 3aecology 3ageophysics 3asilt 3astratigraphy 3aItaly 0aMono-channel seismic profiles 0aDismantled industrial plant 0acoastal brownfield site 0amarine sequence 0asediment correlation1 aTamburrino, S.1 aSacchi, M.1 aGuarino, A.1 aDi Martino, G.1 aTonielli, R.1 aSprovieri, M.1 aPassaro, S.0 tChemistry in ecology.g2020 July 2, v. 36, no. 6 p.550-564dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12214x1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2020.17353723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001900172245011000191300001600301520105000317592002801367650002801395650002301423650001401446650001701460650001301477650002101490650002101511650001001532650001801542650002501560650001701585650004301602650002201645650004401667650002201711650003001733650002501763650001201788650003601800650004701836650004101883650003101924650002801955650001701983650006202000650003602062650002302098650004802121650004402169650002702213650004502240650001902285650003702304650006302341653001502404653001402419653001702433653003702450653001602487653001702503700002302520700002002543700002102563700002202584700002002606700002502626700001802651700002002669773010602689856008702795852000902882655001202891IND50069059520221122135044.0160902e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006905952DNAL7 a238200102pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.05.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTemussi, Fabio10aSildenafil and tadalafil in simulated chlorination conditions: Ecotoxicity of drugs and their derivatives  ap. 366-373.  aChlorination experiments on two drugs (sildenafil and tadalafil) were performed mimicking the conditions of a typical wastewater treatment process.

The environmental effects of the parent compounds and transformation products were evaluated using an overall toxicity approach that considered aquatic acute and chronic toxicity on Brachionus calyciflorus and Ceriodaphnia dubia as well as mutagenesis and genotoxicity on bacterial strains. The results revealed that both parent drugs did not show high acute and chronic toxicity for the organisms utilized in the bioassays while, chronic exposure to chlorine derivatives caused inhibition of growth population on rotifers and crustaceans.

The introduced methodology uses a defined approach when determining the dynamic stability of agricultural vehicles following the standard STN 47 017. Records of the centre of gravity accelerations were obtained from driving manoeuvres at every instance of time during the drive. From records of accelerations and by using Euler‘s parameters with respect to the inertial system, there were evaluated contact points of the wheel with the terrain. Performed driving manoeuvres consisted of movement in the direction of down grade slope as well as in the direction of tractive movement on the slope. We created a model of terrain surface in the Surfer® program from obtained experimental data. Next, by using supporting commands in Matlab®, we created an algorithm for visualisation of terrain surface. Following this algorithm, there was created another model of terrain surface. Both visualisations of terrain surface are depicted in Figs 4 and 5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3agravity 3amodels 3arelief (geological) 3atopographic slope 3avehicles (equipment) 3awheels 0amathematical modelling 0aterrain modelling 0avehicle manoeuvre1 aVáliková, Veronika1 aAntl, Ján0 tActa technologica agriculturae.g2014 Apr. 23, v. 17, no. 1 p.17-20dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:6159x1338-52677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ata-2014-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012900163300001800292520142100310592002801731650001801759650002101777650001901798650001601817650001901833650001501852650001901867650001801886650001101904650001801915650002001933650001501953650002101968700002201989700001802011700001702029700002202046700001902068773012402087856007502211852000902286655001202295IND60534824620221118161105.0160803e20130219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053482462DNAL7 a10.1021/es30404722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Kilian
E. C.10aBaseline Toxic Mixtures of Non-Toxic Chemicals: “Solubility Addition” Increases Exposure for Solid Hydrophobic Chemicals  ap. 2026-2033.  aThis study addresses the question whether hydrophobic organic chemicals exerting no toxicity at their solubility limit (saturation) can form a toxic mixture. Spiking methods generally do not allow testing exactly at saturation without introducing microcrystals. Passive dosing was thus applied to test the acute toxicity of several high melting point PAHs and their mixtures at the respective saturation levels to aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates. With the aquatic Daphnia magna, anthracene, chrysene, and benzo(a)pyrene resulted in no or limited acute toxicity (0–20%), whereas binary and tertiary mixtures of these resulted in significant acute toxicity (70–88%). Toxicity of PAHs and their mixtures could be fitted with one (sum) chemical activity-response curve in accordance with a similar mode of toxic action (i.e., concentration addition). The effective chemical activity (Ea-50) of 0.029 and the effective concentration on a lipid basis (ECₗᵢₚᵢd, ₑq.-50) of 95.7 mM were well within the range for baseline toxicity. Similar mixtures showed less toxicity to the terrestrial Folsomia candida due to steady-state body-burdens being below equilibrium partitioning levels. The results of the present study raise questions about the focus of risk assessment schemes and toxicity testing guidelines on individual substances, since apparently non-toxic chemicals might become toxic in a mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aFolsomia candida 3aacute toxicity 3aanthracenes 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3aguidelines 3ahydrophobicity 3ainvertebrates 3alipids 3amelting point 3arisk assessment 3asolubility 3atoxicity testing1 aSchmidt, Stine N.1 aDom, Nathalie1 aBlust, Ronny1 aHolmstrup, Martin1 aMayer, Philipp0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Feb. 19, v. 47, no. 4 p.2026-2033dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes30404723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245010500169300001400274520094000288592002801228650001101256650002701267650002601294650003001320650001601350650002301366650001801389653002501407653001601432653002101448653002201469653001001491700002501501773012001526856007701646852000901723655001201732IND60519733220221123035635.0160510e20140423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051973322DNAL7 a10.2478/ata-2014-00052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCviklovič, Vladimír10aUsing Selected Transient Methods for Measurements of Thermophysical Parameters of Building Materials  ap. 21-23.  aThis article deals with thermophysical properties of red and white bricks.

The most important for building materials are mainly thermophysical, mechanical parameters and parameters which can determine the structure of materials. The article presents results of thermophysical parameters measurements of red and white bricks during the temperature stabilization for different values of moisture content. For our measurements, we have chosen a hot wire method and a dynamic plane source method. Both methods are classified as transient methods and they are very convenient for measurements of thermophysical parameters of materials with a compact structure. The results of measurements show that temperature and moisture content have a significant effect on thermophysical parameters of bricks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abricks 3aconstruction materials 3amechanical properties 3aproduct quality standards 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3awater content 0athermal conductivity 0atemperature 0amoisture content 0abuilding material 0abrick1 aPaulovič, Stanislav0 tActa technologica agriculturae.g2014 Apr. 23, v. 17, no. 1 p.21-23dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:6159x1338-52677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ata-2014-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014700169520193000316592002802246650002002274650002302294650002902317650002602346650000902372650001002381650001302391650003302404650001902437650002202456650002302478650001802501650001302519651001002532653004802542653003602590653003502626653003302661700005402694700001502748700002002763700002502783700002302808773011502831856008602946852000903032655001203041IND60674957220221118235041.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067495722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1058742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Yunqing10aAssessment of spatial and temporal variation of ecological environment quality in Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve, Xinjiang, China  aRemote sensing technology can objectively and quantitatively evaluate spatial-temporal change of ecological environmental quality. This paper uses images from Landsat5 Thematic Mapper (TM) in 2007 and Landsat8 operational land imager (OLI) in 2013 and 2016 to extract indicators such as greenness, wetness, heat, and dryness that reflect the ecological environment quality of arid area. The principal component analysis (PCA) used the evaluating ecological environment quality of the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve to explore the characteristics of spatial differentiation for ecological quality in environment as indicated in the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). The results showed that the greenness and wetness have positive effects on the ecological environment while the heat and dryness have negative effects. Wetness has a greater impact on the ecological environment than the other three indicators. The proportion of RSEI of degeneration, invariability, and improvement were 20.57%, 42.98%, 36.44%. Thus, the ecological environment had improved. The improved area in 2016 was once located in bad level in 2007. The ecological environment had degraded in the southern part of the lake. The value of Moran's I showed an increased trend first and then decreased. The value of Moran's I increased in 2013, in comparison with 2007, indicating a strong positive correlation and certain internal connection between the ecological environment qualities in the study area. The spatial distribution was clustered rather than random. In comparison with 2013, the auto-correlation in 2016 was relatively weak, an indication that the spatial distribution was random and disperse. The area of High-High (HH) mostly reached to the significant level of 0.05 in 2007 and then to 0.01 in 2013 and 2016. This study offered important results and information for ecological environment protection and region planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aconservation areas 3aenvironmental indicators 3aenvironmental quality 3aheat 3alakes 3aplanning 3aprincipal component analysis 3aremote sensing 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3athematic maps 3awetlands 3aChina 0aEbinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve 0aRemote sensing ecological index 0aEcological environment quality 0aPrincipal component analysis1 aZhang, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1194-85131 aHe, Yufeng1 aKung, Hsiang-te1 aJohnson, Verner Carl1 aArikena, Muhadaisi0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Mar., v. 110 p.105874-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1058743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010300161300001600264500002000280520172500300592002802025650001602053650001602069650001902085650000902104650001102113650002002124650001602144650001002160650001202170650001202182650001302194650001002207650001002217650001002227650000902237650001202246650001902258650001002277650001602287651001102303700002002314700002402334700001802358700001602376773015002392856007302542852000902615655001202624IND60588446220221120043140.0180117e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058844622DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.126722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlinger, A.

Thus, this study was carried out to determine the dietary effect of dry sweet potato vines (SPV) on the performance and some carcass characteristics of rabbits. A total of twenty‐seven weaned White New Zealand rabbits (14 male and 13 female) 35 days old with an average initial weight of 755 g were allocated into three treatments. Nine rabbits were assigned to each treatment in a completely randomized design. Three diets were formulated to similar protein and energy levels: 0SPV – diet without inclusion of dry sweet potato vines; 10SPV – diet with 10% alfalfa hay replaced by dry sweet potato vines; and 15SPV – diet with 15% of alfalfa hay replaced by dry sweet potato vines. The experiment lasted for 49 days during which data for feed intake and body weight were recorded. The daily feed intake ranged from 73.17 to 78.02 g; daily weight gain from 22.32 to 23.17 g; feed conversion ratio (FCR) from 3.16 to 3.49 and final live weight ranged from 1839.44 to 1880.55 g. None of the evaluated performance parameters as well as carcass weight, heart weight and percentages of fat and protein in meat were significantly affected by any of the tested dietary treatments. However, the liver weight was statistically lower in animals fed the diets containing 10% of SPV, mainly due to lower glucose content. Glycogen within the tissue, did not differ significantly among treatments. It was therefore concluded that up to 15% of SPV can successfully be included in the diet of rabbits as a cheaper replacement for alfalfa hay without adversely affecting performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa hay 3abody weight 3acarcass weight 3adiet 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3afemales 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aheart 3aliver 3amales 3ameat 3arabbits 3asweet potatoes 3avines 3aweight gain 3aBrazil1 ada Silva, L.

It was hypothesized that different functions of RGCs may in part result from various expressions of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propinoic acid (AMPA), and kainic acid (KA) receptors on their dendrites. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the functional expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors of morphologically identified RGCs in the wholemount rabbit retina. The agmatine (AGB) activation assay was used to reveal functional expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors after the RGCs were targeted by injecting Neurobiotin. To examine the excitability of these glutamate receptors in an agonist specific manner, the lower concentrations of AMPA (2μM) and NMDA (100μM) were chosen to examine G7 (ON–OFF direction selective ganglion cells) and G11 (alpha ganglion cells) types of RGCs. We found that less than 40% of G7 type RGCs had salient AGB activation when incubated with 2μM AMPA or 100μM NMDA. The G11 type RGCs also showed similar activation frequencies, except that all of the OFF subtype examined had no AGB permeation under the same AMPA concentration. These results suggest that RGCs with large somata (G7 and G11 types) may express various heterogeneous functional ionotropic glutamate receptors, thus in part rendering their functional diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagmatine 3aagonists 3abrain 3adendrites 3afunctional diversity 3aganglia 3aglutamic acid 3arabbits 3areceptors 3aretina 2aAction Potentialsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aExcitatory Amino Acid Agonistsxpharmacology 2aN-Methylaspartatexpharmacology 2aOrgan Culture Techniques 2aRabbits 2aReceptors, AMPAxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aReceptors, Ionotropic Glutamatexbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aReceptors, Kainic Acidxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartatexphysiology 2aRetinal Ganglion Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSynaptic Transmissionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aalpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acidxpharmacology1 aChiao, Chuan-Chin0 tBrain research.g2012 Jan. 3, v. 1427 p.10-22dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.10.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010900165300001600274520129100290592002801581650001401609650001101623650001301634650002401647650001401671650002301685650001001708650001401718700001701732700001801749700001601767773008701783856008201870990002301952852000901975655001201984IND60088828820221122084619.0141102e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008882882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apor.2013.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Gangfeng10aMigration of sediment deposition due to the construction of large-scale structures in Changjiang Estuary  ap. 148-156.  aThe paper presents measurements of sediment deposition in the navigation channel of Changjiang Estuary during the construction of the world largest jetty-spur system. A significant change of sediment deposition pattern is found after the second stage of the project, which extended the previous 25 km long jetties built in the first stage to about 50 km. The measurements show that the main deposition region migrated from the lower reach to upper reach of the navigation channel, with the strongest deposition occurred at the upper middle reach. The physical mechanisms inducing the migration of the sediment deposition region are studied numerically using the finite-volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM). Model results reveal that the tidal currents as well as the sediment processes in the northern passage are greatly changed by the structures. With the extension of the structures, suspended sediment concentration decreases at the upper reach and increases at the lower reach, resulting in a seaward migration of turbidity maximum in the northern passage. The changes of suspended sediment concentration distributions are mainly caused by the adjustments of tidal currents at ebb. The analysis based on the local momentum balance identifies two mechanisms causing these adjustments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3amodels 3amomentum 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3atides 3aturbidity1 aShi, Fengyan1 aLiu, Shuguang1 aQi, Dingman0 tApplied ocean research.g2013 Oct., v. 43 p.148-156dElsevier Ltdx0141-11877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apor.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011900171300001400290520166100304592002801965650001201993650001902005650001902024650002002043650001402063650000902077650002202086650001102108650001602119650001502135700001902150700001702169700001702186700001402203773009402217856008402311852000902395655001202404IND60557856420221119202518.0180907e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055785642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cliser.2016.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkström, Marie,14aThe method of producing climate change datasets impacts the resulting policy guidance and chance of mal-adaptation  ap. 13-29.  aImpact, adaptation and vulnerability (IAV) research underpin strategies for adaptation to climate change and help to conceptualise what life may look like in decades to come. Research draws on information from global climate models (GCMs) though typically post-processed into a secondary product with finer resolution through methods of downscaling. Through worked examples set in an Australian context we assess the influence of GCM sub-setting, geographic area sub-setting and downscaling method on the regional change signal. Examples demonstrate that choices impact on the final results differently depending on factors such as application needs, range of uncertainty of the projected variable, amplitude of natural variability, and size of study region. For heat extremes, the choice of emissions scenario is of prime importance, but for a given scenario the method of preparing data can affect the magnitude of the projection by a factor of two or more, strongly affecting the indicated adaptation decision. For catchment level runoff projections, the choice of emission scenario is less dominant. Rather the method of selecting and producing application-ready datasets is crucial as demonstrated by results with opposing sign of change, raising the real possibility of mal-adaptive decisions. This work illustrates the potential pitfalls of GCM sub-sampling or the use of a single downscaled product when conducting IAV research. Using the broad range of change from all available model sources, whilst making the application more complex, avoids the larger problem of over-confidence in climate projections and lessens the chance of mal-adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adata collection 3aemissions 3aheat 3aissues and policy 3arunoff 3auncertainty 3awatersheds1 aGrose, Michael1 aHeady, Craig1 aTurner, Sean1 aTeng, Jin0 tClimate services.g2016 Dec., v. 4 p.13-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23241x2405-88077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2016.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01600naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014600163300001800309520038100327592002800708650002100736650001600757650001500773650002300788650001800811650002200829650002000851650001900871653002000890653001800910653001600928653002100944653001700965653002200982700002701004773008101031856008101112852000901193655001201202IND60551487220221119184735.0161018e20150610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055148722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.04.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJana, Manas10aSynthesis of trisaccharide and a tetrasaccharide repeating unit corresponding to the O-antigen of Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli O177  ap. 3960-3965.  aA trisaccharide and a tetrasaccharide repeating unit corresponding to the cell wall O-antigen of verotoxin producing Escherichia coli O177 strain have been synthesized in excellent yield using sequential stereoselective glycosylation strategy.

In this study, we reported the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel camptothecin derivative called compound 2–47. The changes in structure did not reduce its activity to inhibit DNA topoisomerase I. Compound 2–47 induced apoptosis of many tumor cells including leukemia cells K562, Jurkat, HL-60, breast cancer cell BT-549, colon cancer cell HT-29 and liver cancer cell HepG2 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2- to 3-fold lower than HCPT as a control. In particular, 2–47 inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells with an IC50 of as low as 40 nM. By making use of Jurkat cell as a model, following treatment of Jurkat cells, compound 2–47 activated caspase-3 and PARP, resulting in a decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These data showed that compound 2–47 induces Jurkat cell death through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In addition, compound 2–47 showed a decreased cytotoxic activity against normal cells and an improved solubility in low-polar solvent. For example, compound 2–47 solutes in CHCl3 130-fold higher than HCPT. Taken together, our data demonstrated that camptothecin derivative 2–47 notably inhibits the tumor cell proliferation through mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA topoisomerase 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acaspase-3 3acell proliferation 3achloroform 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3ahuman cell lines 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aliver neoplasms 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3asolubility 3asolutes 3asolvents 0aCamptothecin derivatives 0aApoptosis 0aDNA topoisomerase I1 aZhao, Hong-Ye1 aJiang, Du1 aWang, Luyao,1 aXiang, Cen1 aWen, Shao-Peng1 aFan, Zhen-Chuan1 aZhang, Yong-Min1 aGuo, Na1 aTeng, Yu-Ou1 aYu, Peng0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Apr. 08, v. 472 p.477-481dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017500169300001400344520173700358592002802095650001602123650001502139650002002154650002002174650002602194650001202220650002702232650001102259650002902270650001002299653001902309653001602328653009202344653002702436653001502463700001502478700001702493700001402510700001302524700001502537700001802552700001302570700001702583773009502600856008502695852000902780655001202789IND60554439020221119100923.0161024e20140615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055443902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yajiao10aSimultaneous determination of four sulfur mustard–DNA adducts in rabbit urine after dermal exposure by isotope-dilution liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 29-35.  aSulfur mustard (SM) is a classic vesicant agent, which has been greatly employed in several wars or military conflicts. The most lesion mechanism is its strong alkylation of DNAs in vivo. Until now there are four specific DNA adducts of SM identified for further retrospective detection, i.e., N7-(2-hydroxyethylthioethyl)-2′-guanine (N7-HETEG), bis(2-ethyl-N7-guanine)thioether (Bis-G), N3-(2-hydroxyethylthioethyl)-2′-adenine (N3-HETEA) and O6-(2-hydroxyethylthioethyl)-2′-guanine (O6-HETEG), respectively. Here, a novel and sensitive method of isotope-dilution ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) combining with solid phase extraction was reported for the simultaneous determination of four SM–DNA adducts. A lower limit of detection of 2–5ngL−1, and a lower limit of quantitation of 5–10ngL−1 were achieved, respectively, and the recoveries ranged from 87% to 116%. We applied this method in the determination of four SM–DNA adducts in rabbit urine after dermal exposure by SM in three dose levels (2, 5, 15mgkg−1), so as to investigate the related metabolic behavior in vivo. For the first time, in SM exposed rabbit urine, our results revealed the relative accumulation abundance of four SM–DNA adducts, i.e., 67.4% for N7-HETEG, 22.7% for Bis-G, 9.8% for N3-HETEA, 0.1% for O6-HETEG, and significant dose and time dependent responses of these SM–DNA adducts. The four adducts were detectable after 8h, afterwards, their contents continuously increased, achieved maximum in the first two or three days and then gradually decreased till the end of one month. Meanwhile, the amounts of SM–DNA adducts were positively correlated with the exposure doses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA adducts 3aalkylation 3adermal exposure 3adetection limit 3aliquid chromatography 3arabbits 3asolid phase extraction 3asulfur 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 0aSulfur mustard 0aDNA adducts 0aIsotope-dilution ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry 0aSolid-phase extraction 0aMetabolism1 aYue, Lijun1 aNie, Zhiyong1 aChen, Jia1 aGuo, Lei1 aWu, Bidong1 aFeng, Jianlin1 aLiu, Qin1 aXie, Jianwei0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 June 15, v. 961 p.29-35dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245007900211300001800290520098300308592002801291596010301319650002301422650001501445650001201460650001901472650001401491650002401505700002301529700002501552700002301577700002601600700002701626773012201653856008301775852000901858655001201867IND60773423020221116165954.0220414e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077342302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-07106-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorbunova, Oxana V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5497-314810aEffect of thermal pretreatment on porous structure of asphalt-based carbon  ap. 7239-7249.  aThe effect of thermal pretreatment on the porous structure and adsorption properties of asphalt-based carbons activated with potassium hydroxide was investigated by FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, N₂ and CO₂ adsorption. Two series of the activated carbons were prepared by a one-stage method using KOH as the activating agent and a two-stage method including pretreatment of asphalt at 450 °C. A cross-effect of the KOH/asphalt ratio and pretreatment conditions on the characteristics of the porous structure of the activated carbons was revealed. The pretreatment of asphalt before activation is demonstrated to be a necessary stage for the effective control of the carbon porous structure by variation the KOH/asphalt ratio from 2 to 4. The porous carbon derived from petroleum asphalt exhibited the high CO₂ adsorption capacity of 3.8 mmol/g at 25 °C and 1 atm and good selectivity for CO₂ over N₂, indicating possible applications in CO₂ capture technology.  aPublisher supplied data  aАААА-АА21-121011890076-8cMinistry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abitumen 3acarbon dioxide 3apetroleum 3apotassium hydroxide1 aBaklanova, Olga N.1 aGulyaeva, Tatiana I.1 aArbuzov, Alexey B.1 aTrenikhin, Mikhail V.1 aLavrenov, Alexander V.0 tJournal of materials science.g2022 Apr., v. 57, no. 14 p.7239-7249dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-022-07106-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01857naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008300166300001600249520100400265592002801269650001701297650001401314650001001328650000901338650001701347700002001364700002001384773009401404856004801498852000901546655001201555IND4485408920221119232633.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448540892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-011-0312-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, Frauke10aUltrasonic courtship vocalizations in wild house mice: spectrographic analyses  ap. 173-180.  aHouse mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during courtship, which are sexually dimorphic and function to attract mates. Spectrographic analyses of laboratory mice show that USVs are surprisingly complex and have features of song. In this study, we conducted the first spectral and temporal analyses of recordings from wild house mice (F1 from wild-caught Mus musculus musculus). Inspection of the spectral shape of syllables shows that the USVs from wild mice can be classified by both frequency and duration, and the most apparent distinction is between low- versus high-frequency calls. High-frequency calls of wild mice seem to be emitted at a much higher frequency range than previously found in some laboratory mice. Interestingly, we found that 20% of males do not vocalize at all, though the reason for their behaviour is unclear. Future studies are needed to determine what kind of information is conveyed in these complex vocalizations, and why some males appear to be non-vocalizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMus musculus 3acourtship 3amales 3amice 3avocalization1 aMusolf, Kerstin1 aPenn, Dustin J.0 tJournal of ethology.g2012 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.173-180dSpringer-Verlagx0289-07717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-011-0312-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011500168520148900283592002801772650001601800650001201816650002601828650000901854650002001863650001601883650001701899650001101916650001501927650001401942650001301956653002701969653001301996653001902009653001202028653001102040653002502051700001902076700001802095700001802113700001602131773012102147856008302268852000902351655001202360IND60757284820221119053316.0220509e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075728482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1092442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorng, Jiun-Lin10aDifferential effects of silver nanoparticles on two types of mitochondrion-rich ionocytes in zebrafish embryos  aSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly used in our daily life and have become a potential environmental hazard. However, the toxic effects of AgNPs on the early stages of fish are not fully understood, and little is known about their effects on specific types of ionocytes. Using zebrafish embryos as a model, this study examined the effects (changes in cell number, morphology, NH₄⁺ secretion and gene expression) of sublethal concentrations of AgNPs (0.1, 1, and 3 mg/L) on two major types of ionocytes: H⁺ pump-rich (HR) ionocytes, and Na⁺ pump-rich (NaR) ionocytes in the skin of embryos. After exposure to AgNPs for 96 h, the number of HR ionocytes significantly declined by 30% and 41% in the 1 and 3 mg/L AgNP groups, respectively. In addition, the apical opening of HR ionocytes became smaller, suggesting that AgNPs impaired the critical structure for ion transport. NH₄⁺ secretion by HR ionocytes of embryos also declined significantly after AgNP exposure. In contrast, the number of NaR ionocytes increased by 29% and 43% in the 1 and 3 mg/L AgNP groups, respectively, while these cells deformed their shape. AgNPs altered mRNA levels of several ion channel and transporter genes involved in the functions of HR ionocytes and NaR ionocytes, and influenced hormone genes involved in regulating calcium homeostasis. This study shows that AgNPs can cause differential adverse effects on two types of ionocytes and the effects can threaten fish survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3acalcium 3aenvironmental hazards 3afish 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3aion channels 3amodels 3ananosilver 3asecretion 3atoxicity 0aMitochondria-rich cell 0aIonocyte 0aIon regulation 0aHormone 0aEmbryo 0aSilver nanoparticles1 aLee, Chih-Ying1 aLiu, Sian-Tai1 aHung, Giun-Yi1 aLin, Li-Yih0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Feb., v. 252 p.109244-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1092443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245011200216300001600328500001100344520124200355592002801597650003401625650003201659650002201691650001701713650002501730650001701755650001801772650001801790650001601808650002401824650000701848650001801855650001801873650003301891650001301924650002401937650001101961700006701972700006502039773013202104856008302236852000902319655001202328IND60684370920221120022123.0200626e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068437092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-019-00280-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera-Ramirez, Juliana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9006-854010aOptimizing the extraction of anthocyanins from purple passion fruit peel using response surface methodology  ap. 185-193.  aReview  aPurple passion fruit peel (PPFP) is a waste with high antioxidant capacity. Therefore, in this work, the conditions for solvent extraction of anthocyanins from that peel were studied according to the following variables: temperature, pH, solvent: raw material ratio and time, using the response surface methodology. Additionally, the antioxidant capacity of the extract was characterized, and its respective anthocyanin degradation kinetics were performed at three storage temperatures. The best conditions were pH 2.0, 52.03 °C, 29.79 g of solvent per g of raw material and 180 min, which gave an anthocyanins extraction yield of 577.59 mg of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside per 100 g of dry raw material. The extract also showed 490.12 ± 2.57 and 528.85 ± 27.17 µmol Trolox per 100 g of antioxidant capacity by DPPH and FRAP essays respectively, a low content of vitamin C, as well as activation energy of 41.4 kJ per mole. Consequently, this study shows PPFP as a potential raw material in anthocyanins and antioxidants extracts, which have a great value in the food industry with their stability under refrigeration. Above mentioned displays an alternative strategy for using this waste as a source of high-value products.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPassiflora edulis f. edulis 3aactivation energy 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3afood industry 3afruit peels 3ahigh-value products 3apH 3araw materials 3arefrigeration 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 3astorage temperature 3awastes1 aMeneses-Marentes, Nixon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5924-54891 aTarazona Díaz, M.

The experimental setup was performed using a laboratory-scale MSL system (depth 30 × width 36 × height 65 cm). The MSL system was composed of soil mixture blocks (SMB) arranged in a brick-like pattern and surrounded by permeable gravel layers (PL). The SMB comprised sandy soil, charcoal, sawdust and metal iron at a dry weight ratio of 7:1:1:1. The hydraulic loading rate was 200 L m ⁻² day ⁻¹. Bacteriological analyses comprised total bacterial count at 22 and 37°C, fecal coliforms, total coliforms, Escherichia coli , streptococci, intestinal enterococci and pathogenic bacteria: Clostridium sp., Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Salmonella sp. The best removal efficiency was achieved for Staphylococcus sp. by 1.42 log unit, while the lowest removal efficiency was found for E. coli by 1.01 log unit. The mean removal efficiencies of total suspended solids (SS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) were 93, 86, 81, 78 and 80%, respectively. Based on these results, the MSL system could efficiently remove organic matter, phosphorus and nitrogen. However, the performance to reduce bacterial indicators and pathogens was still moderate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus 3aStreptococcus 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acharcoal 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoliform bacteria 3agravel 3airon 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3apathogens 3aphosphorus 3aplate count 3asandy soils 3asawdust 3atotal suspended solids 3awastewater 0afecal coliform 0apathogens 0amulti-soil-layering system 0aorganic matter 0anutrients1 aMasunaga, Tsugiyuki1 aOuazzani, Naaila1 aHejjaj, Abdessamad1 aMahi, Mustapha1 aMandi, Laila0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 61, no. 2 p.337-346dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2014.9744803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03885naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245009600179300001300275500001500288520205800303592002802361650002202389650001102411650001302422650001702435650002102452650001902473650001202492650001002504650001602514650002102530650002002551650001502571650002202586650001202608650001502620650002602635650001102661650001702672650001102689650004302700650001002743650004502753650001202798650000902810650001302819650001702832650001802849650003602867650001702903650002202920650001302942650000902955650001802964653004002982773009703022856008403119990002303203852000903226655001203235IND60088829320221122120924.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008882932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.arabjc.2010.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeen Abdulmajeed, Nadia10aTherapeutic ability of some plant extracts on aflatoxin B1 induced renal and cardiac damage  ap. 1-10.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of aqueous extracts of some traditional medicinal plants (including Camellia sinensis leaves, Carum carvi seeds, Alpinia galangal rhizomes, Boswellia serrata resins and Cenchona officinalis bark) compared to the anticancer drug, methotrexate (MTX) against aflatoxicosis induced by aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1) in both kidneys and hearts of rats. Administration of AFB1 induces oxidative stress in kidneys of AFB1-treated rats through elevating the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and depleting the levels of tissue antioxidants, glutathione reductase (GR), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) and vitamin C. Also the result revealed that aflatoxicosis interfere with the cellular energy supply of rat hearts through its inhibitory action on some markers of energy metabolism indicated by a decrease in glucose and glycogen contents of heart and a reduction in the activities of some glycolytic enzymes, phosphogluco-isomerase (PGI), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared to normal healthy animals. Supplementation of the aqueous extracts of the different plant used, effectively ameliorated the deviation induced in both kidneys and hearts of animals in response to AFB1 administration. This effect was evident through reducing MDA level and up-regulating the inhibitory effect of AFB1 on the levels of antioxidants in kidneys as well as the energetic biomarkers in hearts. However, administration of MTX to AFB1-treated rats dramatically amplified the toxic effect of aflatoxicosis, indicated by marked increment in MDA level and decrease in the levels of antioxidants in kidneys of AFB1-MTX group in relation to AFB1 group. Also the same response was found in the bioenergetic markers of hearts. From the current investigation, it can be suggested that supplementation of the extracts of the different plants presented in this study was beneficial in modulating the alterations induced in kidney and heart under the toxic effects of AFB1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aresins 3aglycogen 3aaflatoxin B1 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aAlpinia 3aheart 3aCarum carvi 3aoxidative stress 3amalondialdehyde 3abiomarkers 3aenergy metabolism 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aleaves 3amethotrexate 3aenergy 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aseeds 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3akidneys 3arats 3atoxicity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3atherapeutics 3aBoswellia serrata 3arhizomes 3abark 3aaflatoxicosis 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase0 tArabian journal of chemistry.g2011 Jan., v. 4, no. 1 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.x1878-53527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arabjc.2010.06.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013200167300001600299520147100315592002801786650001701814650001101831650002501842650001701867650001401884650002001898650001701918650001701935650001101952650002101963650001501984650001501999650004302014650002102057650002002078650001502098650001302113650002002126650001302146650000902159650002102168650001202189650001902201650001402220650002202234650002502256700002002281700002202301700002102323700002202344700005802366700002102424700002502445700002202470700002602492773013202518856008302650852000902733655001202742IND60684371120221117155752.0200626e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068437112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-019-00285-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChelly, Meryam10aCharacterization, antioxidant and protective effects of edible Rumex roseus on erythrocyte oxidative damage induced by methomyl  ap. 229-243.  aThe present work explored the characterization, antioxidant and protective effects of edible Rumex roseus on erythrocyte oxidative damage induced by methomyl in mice. In a preliminary in vitro study, luteolin and ferulic acid were detected, using HPLC–DAD, as the most abundant phenols; Rumex roseus extract showed also a promising antioxidant effect. In the in vivo experiment, mice were subjected to methomyl intoxication demonstrating a significant decrease in red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels coupled by a significant increase in bilirubin, LDH, osmotic fragility, reticulocyte and white blood cells number. Erythrocyte specific alterations were also detected as sphercytosis, schistocytosis, dacryocytosis and Howell-jolly bodies; these features are characteristic of a normocytic normochromic regenerative anemia. The oxidative status was also altered, showing a significant increase in malondialdehyde concentration, GSH level and SOD activity while CAT and GPx activities significantly decreased. All the above-cited alterations showed signs of reversal when mice received the methanolic extract of Rumex roseus. The present data suggest that Rumex roseus could be classified as a novel functional food due to its dual role; further to being traditionally used as a flavor food, it was proven by the present work that the new Rumex was capable to alleviate mice erythrocyte oxidative stress known as one of the most critical health issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRumex roseus 3aanemia 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abilirubin 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3aferulic acid 3aflavor 3afunctional foods 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aleukocytes 3aluteolin 3amalondialdehyde 3amethomyl 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3aphenols 3aplant extracts 3apoisoning 3aprotective effect 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aChelly, Sabrine1 aBen Salah, Hichem1 aAthmouni, Khaled1 aBitto, Alessandra1 aSellami, Hanen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5479-17071 aKallel, Choumous1 aAllouche, Noureddine1 aGdoura, Radhouane1 aBouaziz-Ketata, Hanen0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2020 Feb., v. 14, no. 1 p.229-243dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00285-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01699naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008200165300001600247520078200263592002801045650001401073650002201087650000901109650001201118650001901130650002001149650001901169773011801188856008201306852000901388655001201397IND60619884720221117231455.0181102e195905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061988472DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517559029005072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Koichi14aThe Silver Staining Method for Cross Sections of Regenerated Cellulose Fibers  ap. 409-415.  aA staining technique is discussed which has been presented as an alternate method for differentiating the skin-core effect of viscose rayons. This technique, using silver nitrate solution, furnishes good results, generally corresponding to those obtained by the usual methods employing normal dyes. The staining, however, proceeds in a quite different manner from these dye methods, thus suggesting a different mechanism. Several cellulosic rayons have been examined and a number of factors have been evaluated regarding their influences upon the silver staining. The staining in question is chemical, immediately associated with the accessible reducing end groups in cellulose; therefore it is possibly a measure of the degree of accessibility of regenerated cellulose fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3adyes 3afabrics 3asilver nitrate 3asilver staining 3atextile fibers0 tTextile research journal.g1959 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.409-415dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517559029005073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011600176300001400292520118400306592002801490650001901518650002101537650001401558650002401572650001101596650001201607650002001619650002401639650001301663650001401676650001401690650002201704650002401726650002701750700002101777773009801798856008401896990002301980852000902003655001202012IND60088829520221122120935.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008882952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.arabjc.2010.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno-Pirajàn, J.C.10aStudy of immobilized candida rugosa lipase for biodiesel fuel production from palm oil by flow microcalorimetry  ap. 55-62.  aEnzymatic transesterification of palm oil with methanol and ethanol was studied. Of the four lipases that were tested in the initial screening, lipase Candida Rugosa (CR) resulted in the highest yield of mono alkyl esters. Lipase CR was further investigated in immobilized form within an activated carbon as support. The activated carbon was prepared by activation physical. Using the immobilized lipase CR, the effects of water and alcohol concentration, enzyme loading and enzyme thermal stability in the transesterification reaction were investigated. The optimal conditions for processing 50g of palm oil were: 37°C, 1:14.5 oil/methanol molar ratio, 1.0g water and 500mg lipase for the reactions with methanol, 35°C, 1:15.0 oil/ethanol molar ratio, 1.0g water, 500mg lipase for the reactions with ethanol, and 35°C, 1:10.0 oil/n-butanol molar ratio, 1.0g water, 500mg lipase for the reactions with ethanol. Subject to the optimal conditions, methyl and ethyl esters formation of 70 and 85mol% in 1h of reaction were obtained for the immobilized enzyme reactions.

O3-type NaCrO₂ shows anisotropic thermal expansion on heating, which is a common character as layered materials, without phase transition in the temperature range of 27–527 °C. In contrast, for the desodiated phase, in-plane distorted P3-type layered oxide (P′3 Na₀.₅CrO₂), phase transition occurs in the following order. Monoclinic distortion associated with Na/vacancy ordering is gradually lost on heating, and its symmetry increases and changes to a rhombohedral lattice at 207 °C. On further heating, phase segregation to two P3 layered metastable phases, which have different interlayer distances (17.0 and 13.5 Å, presumably sodium-rich and sodium-free P3 phases, respectively) are observed on heating to 287–477 °C, but oxygen loss is not observed. Oxygen loss is observed at temperatures only above 500 °C, resulting in the formation of corundum-type Cr₂O₃ and O3 NaCrO₂ as thermodynamically stable phases. From these results, possibility of NaₓCrO₂ as a positive electrode material for safe rechargeable sodium batteries is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abatteries 3aelectrodes 3aheat 3aoxygen 3aozone 3aphase transition 3asodium 3atemperature 3athermal expansion 3athermal stability 0asodium battery 0achromium oxide 0ahigh-temperature X-ray diffraction 0aphase transition 0athermal stability1 aIkeuchi, Issei1 aKubota, Kei1 aKomaba, Shinichi0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Nov. 30, v. 8, no. 47 p.32292-32299dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b092803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013400172300001600306520176200322592002802084650001802112650002102130650002502151650002102176650001102197650002502208650001502233650002002248650002102268650002202289650002302311650001402334650001802348650002302366650002202389650001902411650001702430650002002447650001602467700002702483700002902510700002102539700002002560700002502580700002302605773009802628856008102726990002302807852000902830655001202839IND60093282720221120155905.0141103e20130715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009328272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.05.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Tânia F.C.V.10aSanitary landfill leachate treatment using combined solar photo-Fenton and biological oxidation processes at pre-industrial scale  ap. 850-866.  aThis work proposes a new strategy for the treatment of leachates from sanitary landfills after lagooning pretreatment, using a solar photo-Fenton oxidation process to eliminate the most recalcitrant organic compounds, leading to a biodegradability enhancement of the leachate and promoting its subsequent oxidation in an activated sludge biological reactor. The integrated leachate treatment process was conducted in a pre-industrial plant, incorporating a photocatalytic system with 39.52m² of compound parabolic collectors (CPCs) and an activated sludge biological reactor, with 3.5m³ capacity, operated under aerated and anoxic conditions. An extensive physico-chemical characterization of the leachate after lagooning was performed during one year, from June 2010 to May 2011, showing its high recalcitrant character mainly associated with the presence of humic substances. The efficiency of the combined treatment was evaluated concerning the leachate characteristics’ variability after lagooning, availability of solar radiation during the year, and different operational process variables, such as the amount of hydrogen peroxide necessary to reach the required COD target value, biodegradability enhancement during the photo-oxidation process, iron reutilization in consecutive oxidation processes, removal of acidic sludge resulting from the acidification process and leachate temperature/average solar power.

This contributes to the selection of candidate landing sites and the understanding of the geological processes. This paper improves the state-of-the-art object detection method of YOLOv5 with attention mechanism and designs a pyramid based approach to detect boulders from planetary images. A new feature fusion layer has been designed to capture more shallow features of the small boulders. The attention modules implemented by combining the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and efficient channel attention network (ECA-Net) are also added into YOLOv5 to highlight the information that contribute to boulder detection. Based on the Pascal Visual Object Classes 2007 (VOC2007) dataset which is widely used for object detection evaluations and the boulder dataset that we constructed from the images of Bennu asteroid, the evaluation results have shown that the improvements have increased the performance of YOLOv5 by 3.4% in precision. With the improved YOLOv5 detection method, the pyramid based approach extracts several layers of images with different resolutions from the large planetary images and detects boulders of different scales from different layers. We have also applied the proposed approach to detect the boulders on Bennu asteroid. The distribution of the boulders on Bennu asteroid has been analyzed and presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adesign 3aimage analysis 3aland 3aremote sensing1 aGeng, Xun 1 aLi, Zheng 1 aLiu, Chun 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 13, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131837763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245017900166300001600345520238700361592002802748650001302776650001902789650001102808650001102819650002202830650001102852650001302863650004402876650001902920650001802939650001702957650001102974650002402985650002003009653001403029653003203043653003203075653002603107653002303133700001603156773011003172856008403282852000903366655001203375IND60125861920221118054158.0150428e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012586192DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2014.9824922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsano, Maki10aDistinctive organic matter pools among particle-size fractions detected by solid-state 13C-NMR, δ13C and δ15N analyses only after strong dispersion in an allophanic Andisol  ap. 242-248.  aWe previously showed the first clear evidence of aggregate hierarchy in an Andisol by comparing the particle-size fractions released upon different levels of dispersion energy up to the maximum dispersion – sonication at 5 kJ mL ⁻¹ following sodium saturation. While smaller particles (< 2 μm) appeared to act as major binding agents, the variation in organic matter (OM) chemistry among the size fractions remains unstudied. Here, we focused on comparing the carbon structure and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratio (δ ¹³C and δ ¹⁵N) among the particle-size fractions isolated by limited dispersion (mechanical shaking) and by the maximum dispersion treatments for the allophanic Andisol previously examined. Both solid-state carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (¹³C NMR)and stable isotope ratios showed clear differences among the size fractions after the maximum dispersion but not after the limited dispersion. From 2–53 μm toward the < 0.2 μm fraction, we observed a progressive decline in the proportion of aromatic-C and an increase in that of O -alkyl-C. Similarly, the enrichment of ¹³C and ¹⁵N toward the smaller particle size fractions was observed after the maximum dispersion. While δ ¹⁵ N had progressive enrichment from 3.6‰ (53–4000 μm) to 6.4‰ (< 0.2 μm fraction), δ ¹³C showed a 2.5–3.0‰ enrichment from the 53–4000 μm fraction (−24.0‰) to 2–53 μm fraction and remained largely constant between 0.2–2 μm and < 0.2 μm fractions. The sonication-induced redistribution and chemical alternation of OM appeared to be minor due to the small pool sizes of low-density materials (e.g., plant litter) and microbial biomass. The emergence of the size-dependent changes in C chemistry after the maximum dispersion was consistent with the Andisol aggregate hierarchy model we previously proposed. The observed difference in C/N ratio and isotopic ratios as well as C composition implies that the OM present in the sonication-resistant particles of < `2 μm sizes (that account for roughly 70% of total C and N) are highly recycled by and/or largely originated from soil microbes. The applicability of current findings to other samples (e.g., non-allophanic Andisols) should be examined to establish the unique role of OM-enriched, micron to submicron particles in the aggregate hierarchy of Andisols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndisols 3abinding agents 3acarbon 3aenergy 3amicrobial biomass 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size 3aplant litter 3asodium 3asoil microorganisms 3astable isotopes 0aaggregate 0aorgano-mineral associations 0aparticle size fractionation 0aultrasound sonication 0avolcanic-ash soils1 aWagai, Rota0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 61, no. 2 p.242-248dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2014.9824923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100005400190245009200244300001400336520167300350592002802023653000902051653001802060653001202078653002302090653000802113653000702121653000702128653000702135653000802142700001602150700002402166700002202190700005502212773007402267856008302341852000902424655001202433IND60557857320221119202557.0161103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055785732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibror.2016.10.0022doi7 aPMC60848902pmcid7 a301359272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuchti, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1211-233610aProtein targeting to glycogen is a master regulator of glycogen synthesis in astrocytes  ap. 46-53.  aThe storage and use of glycogen, the main energy reserve in the brain, is a metabolic feature of astrocytes. Glycogen synthesis is regulated by Protein Targeting to Glycogen (PTG), a member of specific glycogen-binding subunits of protein phosphatase-1 (PPP1). It positively regulates glycogen synthesis through de-phosphorylation of both glycogen synthase (activation) and glycogen phosphorylase (inactivation). In cultured astrocytes, PTG mRNA levels were previously shown to be enhanced by the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. To achieve further insight into the role of PTG in the regulation of astrocytic glycogen, its levels of expression were manipulated in primary cultures of mouse cortical astrocytes using adenovirus-mediated overexpression of tagged-PTG or siRNA to downregulate its expression. Infection of astrocytes with adenovirus led to a strong increase in PTG expression and was associated with massive glycogen accumulation (>100 fold), demonstrating that increased PTG expression is sufficient to induce glycogen synthesis and accumulation. In contrast, siRNA-mediated downregulation of PTG resulted in a 2-fold decrease in glycogen levels. Interestingly, PTG downregulation strongly impaired long-term astrocytic glycogen synthesis induced by insulin or noradrenaline. Finally, these effects of PTG downregulation on glycogen metabolism could also be observed in cultured astrocytes isolated from PTG-KO mice. Collectively, these observations point to a major role of PTG in the regulation of glycogen synthesis in astrocytes and indicate that conditions leading to changes in PTG expression will directly impact glycogen levels in this cell type.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGlia 0aNoradrenaline 0aInsulin 0aGlucose metabolism 0aPTG 0aGS 0aGP 0aNA 0aIns1 aRoach, P.J.1 aDePaoli-Roach, A.A.1 aMagistretti, P.J.1 aAllaman, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7525-05360 tIBRO Reports.g2016 Dec., v. 1 p.46-53dElsevier Ltdx2451-83017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibror.2016.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245011900212300001600331520280600347592002803153653002603181653000803207653002703215653003303242700001803275700002103293773011103314856008403425852000903509655001203518IND60557857420221119202435.0161103e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055785742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.conctc.2016.09.0022doi7 aPMC59358992pmcid7 a297364792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Prajna P.10aRisk Based Monitoring (RBM): A global study focusing on perception and merits among clinical investigational sites  ap. 155-160.  aSeveral approaches to clinical trial monitoring, including the Risk Based Monitoring (RBM) are aimed at the protection of the human subjects (safety), improved data quality, and ultimately, reducing the cost of drug development and operations. There exists minimal evidence globally about the perceptions and the level of confidence among the clinical staff on the merits of RBM. The present study assessed the perception among clinical research staff globally (developed and emerging countries) on the applicability and adaptability of RBM.An electronic questionnaire survey consisting of twelve items was developed, validated, and then circulated globally via email to three thousand clinical research staff members at various investigational sites. This survey collected information on the use of RBM and factors that relate to clinical trial cost, data quality, subject safety, and the readiness to adopt RBM practices. The survey responses were summarized and analyzed by using the information e.g. responder's age, sex, clinical research role, global location, and experience in clinical research trials.Responses were received from ten countries, six emerging and four developed. Of the 3000 surveys sent to emerging (1,000) and developed (2,000) countries, a total response of 595 (261 vs 334) participants was received, respectively. The emerging versus developed group had 100 vs 137 participants with complete responses (CR); 34 vs 35 participants with partial responses (PR); and 127 vs 162 participants were disqualified with no exposure (NE) responses. About 67% of the overall responders were investigators, followed by 23%, 10% coordinator and other staff respectively. There was not significant difference in feedback between the researchers in developing versus emerging countries (p = 0.20) with regards to their perception of RBM reducing the overall cost of conducting a clinical research. Responders from emerging countries had a more favorable response than in the developed countries. Similarly, when asked if RBM will be more effective in addressing data quality (p = 0.006), patient safety (p = 0.05) and findings fraud/fabrication (p = 0.01), researchers from emerging countries indicated more confidence than researchers from developed countries. There was also a significant difference in the readiness to adopt RBM between responders of emerging versus developed markets (p < 0.0001).This unique study performed across ten emerging and developed countries strongly supported the need for systematic global training, education, and implementation of RBM regulatory guidance, with an aim for better safety of subjects and improved quality of clinical trial data. Furthermore, studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to provide an evidence-based approach.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRisk Based Monitoring 0aRBM 0aClinical investigators 0aGlobal implementation of RBM1 aDalal, Jeroze1 aJadhav, Manoj P.0 tContemporary Clinical Trials Communications.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 4 p.155-160dElsevier Inc.x2451-86547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2016.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245024200165300001400407500001500421520122900436592002801665650002601693650001301719650001501732650001901747650001301766650002201779650002101801650001601822653001001838653001701848653002601865653001501891653001001906653001201916700001401928700001901942700001801961773010801979856008602087852000902173655001202182IND60554439720221119100847.0190502e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055443972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Di10aSimultaneous determination of 1-β-d-Arabinofuranosylcytosine and two metabolites, 1-β-d-Arabinofuranosyluracil and 1-β-d-Arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate in leukemic cell by HPLC-MS/MS and the application to cell pharmacokinetics  ap. 14-19.  a2019-12-06  aA specific and reliable HPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of 1-β-d-Arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), 1-β-d-Arabinofuranosyluracil (ara-U) and 1-β-d-Arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate (ara-CTP) in the leukemic cells for the first time. The analytes were separated on a C18 column (100mm×2.1mm, 1.8μm) and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used for detection. The ion-pairing reagent, NFPA, was added to the mobile phase to retain the analytes in the column. The cell homogenates sample was prepared by the simple protein precipitation. The calibration curves were linear over a concentration range of 3.45–3450.0ng/mL for ara-C, 1.12–1120.0ng/mL for ara-U and 4.13–4130.0ng/mL for ara-CTP. The intra-day and inter-day precision was less than 15% and the relative error (RE) were all within ±15%.

The birds on the deficient diet were then provided with a diet supplemented with either D,L‐methionine or D,L‐HMTBA from 5 to 7 weeks. The diet of the control birds was supplemented with L‐methionine from hatch till 7 weeks of age. We studied the mRNA expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 1, alpha, methionine adenosyltransferase 1, beta, 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate‐homocysteine methyltransferase, 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate‐homocysteine methyltransferase reductase, betaine‐homocysteine S‐methyltransferase, glycine N‐methyltransferase, S‐adenosyl‐L‐homocysteine hydrolase and cystathionine beta synthase genes in the liver, duodenum, Pectoralis (P.) major and the gastrocnemius muscle at 5 and 7 weeks. Feeding a diet deficient in dietary methionine affected body composition. Birds that were fed a methionine‐deficient diet expressed genes that indicated that remethylation occurred via the one‐carbon pathway in the liver and duodenum; however, in the P. major and the gastrocnemius muscles, gene expression levels suggested that homocysteine received methyl from both folate and betaine for remethylation. Birds who were switched from a methionine deficiency diet to one supplemented with either D,L‐methionine or D,L‐HMTBA showed a downregulation of all the genes studied in the liver. However, depending on the tissue or methionine form, either folate or betaine was elicited for remethylation. Thus, mRNA expressions show that genes in the remethylation and transsulphuration pathways were regulated according to tissue need, and there were some differences in the methionine form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosylhomocysteinase 3abetaine 3abetaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 3abody composition 3abroiler chickens 3acystathionine beta-synthase 3adiet 3aduodenum 3afolic acid 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycine N-methyltransferase 3ahomocysteine 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amethionine 3amethionine adenosyltransferase 3amuscles1 aGonzález‐Cerón, F.1 aRekaya, R.1 aMercier, Y.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2018 Feb., v. 102, no. 1 p.e468-e475dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.127793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008300157520221800240592002802458650002502486650001302511650001402524650001802538650002502556651001002581651001902591700001202610700001602622700002002638700002202658700001602680773013002696856007402826852000902900655001202909IND60751724820221119062056.0210925e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075172482DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131837782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qiang 10aProgress and Trends in the Application of Google Earth and Google Earth Engine  aEarth system science has changed rapidly due to global environmental changes and the advent of Earth observation technology. Therefore, new tools are required to monitor, measure, analyze, evaluate, and model Earth observation data. Google Earth (GE) was officially launched by Google in 2005 as a ”geobrowser”, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was released in 2010 as a cloud computing platform with substantial computational capabilities. The use of these two tools or platforms in various applications, particularly as used by the remote sensing community, has developed rapidly. In this paper, we reviewed the applications and trends in the use of GE and GEE by analyzing peer-reviewed articles, dating up to January 2021, in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection using scientometric analysis (i.e., by using CiteSpace) and meta-analysis. We found the following: (1) the number of articles describing the use of GE or GEE increased substantially from two in 2006 to 530 in 2020. The number of GEE articles increased much faster than those concerned with the use of GE. (2) Both GE and GEE were extensively used by the remote sensing community as multidisciplinary tools. GE articles covered a broader range of research areas (e.g., biology, education, disease and health, economic, and information science) and appeared in a broader range of journals than those concerned with the use of GEE. (3) GE and GEE shared similar keywords (e.g., “land cover”, “water”, “model”, “vegetation”, and “forest”), which indicates that their application is of great importance in certain research areas. The main difference was that articles describing the use of GE emphasized its use as a visual display platform, while those concerned with GEE placed more emphasis on big data and time-series analysis. (4) Most applications of GE and GEE were undertaken in countries, such as the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. (5) GEE is an important tool for analysis, whereas GE is used as an auxiliary tool for visualization. Finally, in this paper, the merits and limitations of GE and GEE, and recommendations for further improvements, are summarized from an Earth system science perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth system science 3aInternet 3aeducation 3ameta-analysis 3atime series analysis 3aChina 3aUnited Kingdom1 aYu, Le 1 aLi, Xuecao 1 aPeng, Dailiang 1 aZhang, Yongguang 1 aGong, Peng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 13, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131837783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011800165300001600283520139300299592002801692650001601720650002401736650003801760650002801798650001901826650001201845650001601857650002001873650002201893650001501915650001701930650001401947650003701961651001001998653002602008653002602034653003302060653001602093653001402109700001802123700001602141773011002157856008402267852000902351655001202360IND60125862220221118054222.0150428e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012586222DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2014.9855782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xin10aMycorrhizal effects on growth, P uptake and Cd tolerance of the host plant vary among different AM fungal species  ap. 359-368.  aIt has been documented that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis can enhance plant tolerance to heavy metal (HM) contamination. However, variations among different AM fungal species for their ability to make their host HM tolerant have rarely been examined. This study therefore aimed to compare the cadmium (Cd) tolerance of plants colonized by different AM fungi, and to test the relationship between phosphorus (P) uptake efficiency and the Cd tolerance of the symbiotic associations. Lotus japonicus L. inoculated with each of three different AM fungi, Gigaspora margarita Becker & Hall, Acaulospora longula Spain & Schenck and Rhizophagus irregularis Blaszk., Wubet, Renker & Buscot, was grown under three Cd addition levels (0, 5 and 50 mg kg ⁻¹) in a pot experiment, and growth, P and Cd uptake of the plants were examined. Significant linear correlations were observed between growth, P-uptake and Cd-uptake of the plant. R. irregularis was more resistant to Cd contamination compared with the other two AM fungal species in terms of higher colonization rate, P uptake efficiency and better plant growth, even in a Cd contaminated environment. Symbiotic P uptake might determine the Cd tolerance of mycorrhizal plants, and it could possibly serve as an important criterion for screening efficient AM fungal species/strains for bioremediation of HM-contaminated environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcaulospora 3aGigaspora margarita 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3abioremediation 3acadmium 3ahost plants 3ametal tolerance 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3ascreening 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aSpain 0aarbuscular mycorrhiza 0acadmium contamination 0aphosphorus uptake efficiency 0aheavy metal 0atolerance1 aChen, Baodong1 aOhtomo, Ryo0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 61, no. 2 p.359-368dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2014.9855783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245020700169300001400376520157300390592002801963650001701991650001902008650001302027650004602040650002702086650001602113650000902129650001502138650001702153650002902170650004402199650002102243653001702264653001502281653001902296653000902315653001502324700001402339700001202353700001502365700001502380700001402395700001802409773010802427856008602535852000902621655001202630IND60554439920221119100834.0190502e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055443992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Xiao-Lin10aDevelopment and validation of an ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for simultaneous determination of sulfonamides, quinolones and benzimidazoles in bovine milk  ap. 20-29.  aA simple, sensitive and reliable analytical method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 38 veterinary drugs (18 sulfonamides, 11 quinolones and 9 benzimidazoles) and 8 metabolites of benzimidazoles in bovine milk by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–ESI-MS/MS). Samples were extracted with acidified acetonitrile, cleaned up with Oasis® MCX cartridges, and analyzed by LC–MS/MS on an Acquity UPLC® BEH C18 column with gradient elution. The method allows such multi-analyte measurements within a 13min runtime while the specificity is ensured through the MRM acquisition mode. The method was validated according to the European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC determining specificity, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), recovery, precision, linearity and stability. For compounds which have MRLs in bovine milk, the CCα values fall into a range from 11 to 115μg/kg, and the CCβ values fall within a range of 12–125μg/kg. For compounds which have not MRLs in bovine milk, the CCα values fall into a range from 0.01 to 0.08μg/kg, and the CCβ values fall within a range of 0.02–0.11μg/kg. The mean recoveries of the 46 analytes were between 87 and 119%. The calculated RSD values of repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility experiments were below 11% and 15% for the 46 compounds, respectively. The method was demonstrated to be suitable for the simultaneous determination of sulfonamides, quinolones and benzimidazoles in bovine milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abenzimidazoles 3acleaning 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3amaximum residue limits 3ametabolites 3amilk 3aquinolones 3asulfonamides 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aveterinary drugs 0aSulfonamides 0aQuinolones 0aBenzimidazoles 0aMilk 0aLC–MS/MS1 aChen, Guo1 aZhu, Li1 aYang, Ting1 aZhao, Jian1 aWang, Lei1 aWu, Yin-Liang0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 July 01, v. 962 p.20-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007500169300001500244520071400259592002800973650001501001650002101016650001701037650000701054650001301061700002701074700002501101700002301126700001601149700002301165700002601188773009901214856008401313990002301397852000901420655001201429IND60088830020221117082544.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008883002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.arabjc.2010.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaconu, Ioana10aSeparation of nitrophenols.

Twelve Boer crossbred goats were used in the experiment: six goats were surgically fitted with rumen cannula, and the other six were used as controls. All goats were fed the same diet for 20 days, after which their rumen digesta were sampled once per week for three consecutive weeks. Total microbial DNA was extracted from the collected rumen fluid and was used as a template to amplify the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. High‐throughput sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq platform, and the sequences were analyzed primarily using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology pipeline software. The results showed that the Chao 1 index, the observed species index and the Shannon‐Wiener index were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between the two groups. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Tenericutes were the predominant phylum in both groups, and their relative abundance was 60.63%, 29.48%, 2.24% (n = 6, CT group) and 61.17%, 26.92%, 1.66% (n = 6, RC group) respectively. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the microbial communities of RC goats, and Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi were significantly lower (p = 0.02). The abundances of other phyla were not significantly different between treatments. A total of 19 lower‐level taxa also exhibited significant differences (p < 0.05) in relative abundance between the groups. In addition, there were 18 genera shared within the control group, 26 shared within the rumen‐cannulated group, and 16 shared by both groups. Prevotella was the most abundant shared genus, although its abundance was not significantly different (p > 0.05) between the groups. In conclusion, although the most abundant microbes kept stable, rumen cannulation had the potential to significantly change rumen microbial communities in goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChloroflexi 3aDNA 3aFirmicutes 3aPlanctomycetes 3aPrevotella 3aProteobacteria 3aTenericutes 3aanimal feeding 3acomputer software 3adiet 3adigesta 3agenes 3agoats 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobial communities 3aribosomal RNA 3arumen fluids 3arumen microorganisms1 aWu, D.1 aYan, T.1 aWang, L.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2018 Feb., v. 102, no. 1 p.175-183dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.126763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245017100171520145800342592002801800650001701828650002101845650001101866650001601877650002601893650001701919650001601936650001901952650002601971650001301997650001302010650000702023650002102030650001602051650000902067653003702076653001502113653001302128653001302141653000802154653000802162653000802170653000702178653000802185653000902193653000802202653000902210653000802219653001002227653000702237653000802244700002302252700002002275700006102295700002102356700001802377773011102395856008602506852000902592655001202601IND60757285920221119053415.0211213e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075728592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1230432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAboras, Sara I.10aHPLC with fluorescence detection for the bioanalysis and pharmacokinetic study of Doxorubicin and Prodigiosin loaded on eco-friendly casein nanomicelles in rat plasma  aA rapid, efficient, and sensitive liquid chromatographic assay hyphenated to fluorometric detector (HPLC-FLD) was developed and validated for the determination of doxorubicin (DXR) and prodigiosin (PDG) in rat plasma. The sample pre-treatment involves a protein precipitation with acetonitrile with satisfying extraction efficiency (98% and 85% for DXR and PDG, respectively). The chromatographic separation was accomplished using stationary phase: Agilent Zorbax Eclipse plus-C18 analytical column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) and gradient eluting mobile phase of ammonium acetate (pH = 3), acetonitrile and methanol with programmed fluorescence detection. As the proposed method has been validated, it was subsequently implemented to evaluate DXR and PDG loaded on novel eco-friendly Casein nano drug delivery system after intravenous injection in healthy rats. A comparative pharmacokinetics’ study was carried out in rats for DXR in free form, DXR alone entrapped in the nanomicelle and DXR with PDG entrapped in the nano micelle. After testing the differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of the different formulations using ANOVA, the results showed insignificant differences among the tested parameters. This indicates that the presented nanomicelle delivery system has succeeded to incorporate PDG and DXR in a hydrophilic, safe, and potent formulation. This novel nanomicelle has negligible effect on the distribution and elimination of DXR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium acetate 3acasein 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3ahydrophilicity 3aintravenous injection 3amethanol 3amicelles 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 3aprodigiosin 3arats 0aEco-friendly Casein nanomicelles 0aRat plasma 0aHPLC-FLD 0aHPLC-FLD 0aDXR 0aFDA 0aPDG 0aPK 0aLOQ 0aRD-B 0aACN 0aMeOH 0aI.S 0aNaCAS 0aQC 0a%EE1 aKorany, Mohamed A.1 aAbdine, Heba H.1 aRagab, Marwa A.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3233-36571 aEl Diwany, Ahmed1 aAgwa, Mona M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 1187 p.123043-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1230433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011600173300001600289500001500305520138000320592002801700650001401728650002701742650002601769650002101795650003001816650001901846650002801865650002601893650001201919650002801931650002101959650005001980650001402030653001002044700002202054700003702076700002102113700002602134773010702160856004802267852000902315655001202324IND50071909420221120032014.0140116e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007190942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-013-0632-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Anderson Tadeu10aCharacterization of a Putative Serk-Like Ortholog in Embryogenic Cell Suspension Cultures of Coffea arabica L.   ap. 176-184.  a2019-12-06  aThe acquisition of embryogenic cell suspension cultures (ECS) has been the objective of studies on in vitro induction of somatic embryogenesis with biotechnological tools, due to the high efficiency of ECS as plant material for genetic transformation and large-scale production and cryopreservation of germplasm. The objective of this work was to identify and analyze one of the main gene families involved in somatic embryogenesis, somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (SERK) in coffee (Coffea arabica L.). Coffee SERKs were identified by searching an EST (expression sequences tag) database generated by the Brazilian Coffee Genome Project starting from candidate sequences obtained from the NCBI database (National Center for Biotechnology Information) . In silico analysis and quantitative PCR results imply that the identified EST-contig C166 might directly be involved in somatic embryogenesis. The results suggest that C166 is the possible ortholog of SERK in C. arabica (CaSERK) and indicate that C166 might be a valuable bio-marker for ECS, and in that context can increase the methodological efficiency for ECS formation in C. arabica. Functional analysis of CaSERK with mutants of a more manageable species will lead to a better understanding of the molecular regulation as well as the specific functions of genes involved in somatic embryogenesis in coffee.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm 3agenetic transformation 3aquantitative analysis 3acryopreservation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aCoffea arabica 3aexpressed sequence tags 3asomatic embryogenesis 3amutants 3acell suspension culture 3ain vitro studies 3aNational Center for Biotechnology Information 3adatabases 0agenes1 aBarduche, Douglas1 ado Livramento, Kalynka Gabriella1 aLigterink, Wilco1 aPaiva, Luciano Vilela0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2014 Feb., v. 32, no. 1 p.176-184dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-013-0632-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100003400141245010000175300001800275520144000293592002801733650002001761650001701781650001601798650000901814650002101823650001001844650001401854650002401868650000901892650001601901651001001917773011301927856008102040852000902121655001202130IND4471270620221116214425.0120501e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447127062DNAL7 a10.3945/jn.111.1466132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarris, Wm.

Although obtaining the preformed fatty acids EPA and DHA from their traditional source (fish) is optimal, such an approach may not be realistic for meeting the worldâs growing demand for (n-3) fatty acids; therefore, a more sustainable and dependable source is needed. Stearidonic acid (SDA) is a metabolic precursor of EPA that can be provided by SDA-enhanced soybean oil. Such a product can provide a sustainable source of (n-3) fatty acids that does not endanger fish stocks. Two clinical trials have demonstrated that SDA-enhanced soybean oil can significantly improve an emerging marker of cardiovascular health, the omega-3 index (RBC EPA+DHA). The increase in the Index seen in these trials was used to estimate the potential clinical benefit of SDA consumption based on prior prospective cohort studies. In this analysis, risk for sudden cardiac death and the rate of cellular aging would both theoretically be reduced. The lower risk for major cardiac events seen in the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (which used EPA supplementation) suggests that raising EPA tissue levels, independent of changes in DHA, can have clinical benefit. Thus, the consumption of foods containing SDA-enhanced soybean oil may be both a practical and sustainable approach to enriching tissues with beneficial (n-3) fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical trials 3aerythrocytes 3afatty acids 3afish 3afood consumption 3afoods 3amortality 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3asoybean oil 3aJapan0 tJournal of nutrition.g2012 Mar., v. 142, no. 3 p.600S-604SdAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.111.1466133Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004000135040001800175100002200193245011100215300001400326520177900340592002802119650001302147650001402160650001102174650001602185650001102201650001802212650001102230650002002241650002502261650002202286650003202308650002602340650001102366650001102377650004002388650003102428650000902459650002302468650002102491650002702512650002602539650001702565650001802582650003402600650002002634650003002654650001902684650001602703700002002719773008202739856008602821990002302907852000902930655001202939IND60091808020221118054902.0141103e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009180802DNAL7 a211723252pmid7 aPMC30850562pmcid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpreng, R. Nathan10aI remember you: A role for memory in social cognition and the functional neuroanatomy of their interaction  ap. 43-50.  aRemembering events from the personal past (autobiographical memory) and inferring the thoughts and feelings of other people (mentalizing) share a neural substrate. The shared functional neuroanatomy of these processes has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis of independent task domains (Spreng, Mar & Kim, 2009) and within subjects performing both tasks (Rabin, Gilboa, Stuss, Mar, & Rosenbaum, 2010; Spreng & Grady, 2010). Here, we examine spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI BOLD signal during rest from two separate regions key to memory and mentalizing, the left hippocampus and right temporal parietal junction, respectively. Activity in these two regions was then correlated with the entire brain in a resting-state functional connectivity analysis. Although the left hippocampus and right temporal parietal junction were not correlated with each other, both were correlated with a distributed network of brain regions. These regions were consistent with the previously observed overlap between autobiographical memory and mentalizing evoked brain activity found in past studies. Reliable patterns of overlap included the superior temporal sulcus, anterior temporal lobe, lateral inferior parietal cortex (angular gyrus), posterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial and ventral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and the amygdala. We propose that the functional overlap facilitates the integration of personal and interpersonal information and provides a means for personal experiences to become social conceptual knowledge. This knowledge, in turn, informs strategic social behavior in support of personal goals. In closing, we argue for a new perspective within social cognitive neuroscience, emphasizing the importance of memory in social cognition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamygdala 3acognition 3acortex 3ahippocampus 3amemory 3ameta-analysis 3apeople 3asocial behavior 2aAmygdalaxphysiology 2aBrainxphysiology 2aCerebral Cortexxphysiology 2aCognitionxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aMale 2aMemoryxphysiology 2aMemory, Episodic 2aMotivationxphysiology 2aNerve Netxphysiology 2aNeuroanatomy 2aOxygenxblood 2aPrefrontal Cortexxphysiology 2aSocial Behavior 2aTemporal Lobexphysiology 2aTheory of Mind 2aYoung Adult1 aMar, Raymond A.0 tBrain research.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 1428 p.43-50dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130245004900148300001600197520071500213592002800928650001200956650001400968650001900982650001201001650000901013773011801022856008201140852000901222655001201231IND60619885220221117231456.0181102e195905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061988522DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517559029005122doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aPart II: Heavier Felting in a Worsted Fabric  ap. 439-443.  aThe configurations of the wool fibers in a worsted fabric have been studied at various stages of washing. Before there is any perceptible felting, small movements of portions of some fibers towards their root ends occur. These movements continue on further washing until loops are formed over some parts of the fibers while other parts are taut. At this stage felting and shrinkage become perceptible. At a later stage of felting, en tanglement of the loops occurs. The observed behavior of the fibers agrees well with that to be expected if Shorter's theory of felting is correct; there is no indication that the mechanism suggested by Martin plays any important part in the felting of this particular fabric.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3ashrinkage 3atextile fibers 3awashing 3awool0 tTextile research journal.g1959 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.439-443dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517559029005123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245014900209300001600358520119800374592002801572653002801600653002201628653002401650653002901674653002701703700001801730773011101748856008401859852000901943655001201952IND60557857920221119202536.0161103e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055785792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.conctc.2016.10.0042doi7 aPMC59359022pmcid7 a297364842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElfeddali, I.13aAn implicit pictorial methodology for measuring and retraining smokers' reactivity to pictures of pros and cons of smoking: development protocol  ap. 208-213.  aThe last decades, there has been increased interest in the application of implicit pictorial tasks (e.g. Visual Probe Task (VPT), Approach Avoidance Task (AAT)) to target addictive behaviors. The present study reports on the development of implicit pictorial assessment and modification tasks aimed at targeting cognitive biases underlying motivational smoking-related cognitions (i.e. the pros and cons of smoking).Respondents were adult daily smokers not motivated to quit smoking within six months (N = 33). A cross-sectional four-step approach using qualitative and quantitative strategies was utilized to identify and match pictures of pros and cons of smoking.The study resulted in 30 pro-con picture pairs matched on valence, arousal and complexity: the picture pairs were used to develop a VPT assessment and training for attentional biases and an AAT assessment and training for approach-avoidance biases.The developed measurement and training tasks will be used to explore and change cognitive biases regarding pros and cons of smoking. This may consequently influence the perceived pros and cons of smoking and yield positive effects with regard to the motivation to quit smoking.  aPublisher supplied data 0aImplicit pictorial task 0aSmoking cessation 0aUnmotivated smokers 0aPros and cons of smoking 0aStimuli identification1 aVries, H. de,0 tContemporary Clinical Trials Communications.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 4 p.208-213dElsevier Inc.x2451-86547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2016.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015300170300001600323520151300339592002801852650001501880650001101895650002201906650001901928650001701947650002001964650003001984650001902014650000902033650002602042650002202068650001102090653001402101653003602115653001102151653001402162653002102176700002102197773011002218856008402328852000902412655001202421IND60125862520221118054333.0150428e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012586252DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2014.9898032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaijo, Takanori12aA new detection tool for bioavailable copper utilizing transgenic plants carrying recombinant yeast ACE1 transcription factor and GFP reporter genes  ap. 281-286.  aCurrently, only total copper concentration in soil is normally measured and used as a regulatory standard, despite bioavailable copper in soil being limited due to absorption by soil components. Thus, it is important to distinguish between total copper concentration and bioavailable copper concentration. Unfortunately, a simple, convenient and beneficial tool for detection of bioavailable copper is lacking. In this study, we evaluated some transgenic plants carrying a copper-inducible reporter gene expression system, by transferring them to soil supplemented with various amounts of copper. When supplemented with copper sulfate (CuSO ₄) solution, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP, reporter) fluorescence was observed at 0.4 mg kg ⁻¹ (weight of copper/weight of soil) or more, but when supplemented with metallic copper, more than 20 mg kg ⁻¹ was required for GFP fluorescence. These results indicated that uptake of copper when supplemented with CuSO ₄ solution is 50 times easier than that when supplemented with metallic copper, and that the transgenic plants respond selectively to bioavailable copper. Sixty independent transgenic plants were generated with different copper detection sensitivity. Thus, the transgenic plant with the optimal target concentration range of bioavailable copper for the intended use can be chosen. This study successfully demonstrates a new transgenic plant-based system is able to detect bioavailable copper without any extraction and purification steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acopper 3acopper metabolism 3acopper sulfate 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3agreen fluorescent protein 3areporter genes 3asoil 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants 3ayeasts 0abiosensor 0achemically inducible expression 0acopper 0adetection 0atransgenic plant1 aNagasawa, Akitsu0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 61, no. 2 p.281-286dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2014.9898033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008600161300001600247520154900263592002801812650001401840650001401854650000901868650001901877650003701896650001301933650002001946650001301966650004301979650002402022650001302046653002702059653001402086653001902100653001102119653000702130653000902137653000802146653000802154653000802162700001502170700001402185700002002199700001702219773012102236856008202357852000902439655001202448IND60528652520221120181046.0160716e20160311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052865252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Jie10aP38/JNK signaling pathway mediates the fluoride-induced down-regulation of Fam83h  ap. 386-390.  aThe similar clinical and pathological feature in fluorosis and amelogenesis imperfect with FAM83H mutations imply that excess fluoride could have effects on the expression of FAM83H and could elaborate this process by some signal pathways regulation. The present study aims to investigate the effects of fluoride on Fam83h expression and try to explore the molecular signaling regulation between them as well as the association of high concentration fluoride with mineralization in ameloblast lineage cells.Protein expression and signaling pathways of mouse ameloblast-like LS8 cells, exposed to fluoride or MAPK inhibitors, were compared to control cells without exposure. Fam83h, proteins of MAPK signal pathways (ERK, P38 and JNK) were examined by Quantitative real-time PCR and/or Western-blot. ALP activity and ALP staining were used to detect the mineralization in the cells with exposure during 7-day mineralization inducing differentiation.The results showed that Fam83h protein level in LS8 cells decreased in the presence of fluoride and MAPK inhibitors. Down-regulation of Fam83h by fluoride was related to suppression of JNK and P38 phosphorylation, and the descending degree of P38 was more obvious. Fluoride and MAPK inhibitors treatment significantly decreased the mineralization level in LS8 cells.The findings suggest that JNK and P38 could be key regulatory element for Fam83h expression, and that LS8 cells can respond to fluoride by down-regulating Fam83h expression through the regulation of JNK and p38 signaling pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorides 3afluorosis 3amice 3amineralization 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutation 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astaining 0aAmelogenesis imperfect 0aFluorosis 0aMineralization 0aFam83h 0aAI 0aMAPK 0aERK 0aJNK 0aNaF1 aYang, Fang1 aYang, Mei1 aWang, Changning1 aSong, Yaling0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Mar. 11, v. 471 p.386-390dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011600158520151400274592002801788650000901816650002001825650001601845650001901861650001901880650001101899650002901910650002501939651001001964700001601974700001501990700001602005773013002021856007402151852000902225655001202234IND60751725220221119061946.0210925e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075172522DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131837822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Jiancun 10aImproving the Robustness of the MTI-Estimated Mining-Induced 3D Time-Series Displacements with a Logistic Model  aThe previous multi-track InSAR (MTI) method can be used to retrieve mining-induced three-dimensional (3D) surface displacements with high spatial–temporal resolution by incorporating multi-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations with a prior model. However, due to the track-by-track strategy used in the previous MTI method, no redundant observations are provided to estimate 3D displacements, causing poor robustness and further degrading the accuracy of the 3D displacement estimation. This study presents an improved MTI method to significantly improve the robustness of the 3D mining displacements derived by the previous MTI method. In this new method, a fused-track strategy, instead of the previous track-by-track one, is proposed to process the multi-track InSAR measurements by introducing a logistic model. In doing so, redundant observations are generated and further incorporated into the prior model to solve 3D displacements. The improved MTI method was tested on the Datong coal mining area, China, with Sentinel-1 InSAR datasets from three tracks. The results show that the 3D mining displacements estimated by the improved MTI method had the same spatial–temporal resolution as those estimated by the previous MTI method and about 33.5% better accuracy. The more accurate 3D displacements retrieved from the improved MTI method can offer better data for scientifically understanding the mechanism of mining deformation and assessing mining-related geohazards.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3adata collection 3adeformation 3ainterferometry 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atime series analysis 3aChina1 aYang, Zefa 1 aWu, Lixin 1 aQiao, Siyu 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 13, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131837823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009800168300001600266500001500282520124200297592002801539650002201567650002201589650001701611650001201628650001401640650001301654650001301667650001401680651001201694651001201706653001901718653001501737653001401752653002301766653002001789700002501809700002201834773008601856856008501942852000902027655001202036IND60558935520221119055047.0161120e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055893552DNAL7 a10.2989/00306525.2016.12077212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamza, Foued10aWintering waterbird assemblages in the central part of the Gulf of Gabès in southern Tunisia  ap. 217-223.  a2019-12-06  aAlthough the Gulf of Gabès is recognised as an Important Bird Area, several aspects of the ecology of waterbirds inhabiting this area still need to be investigated. We observed how waterbird foraging guilds varied among habitats. In total, 49 species belonging to 16 families were recorded. Winter visitors accounted for 73% of counts. The avifauna was dominated by shorebirds (52% of records), followed by large wading birds (25%), open-water birds (18%) and waterfowl (5%). However, the structure of local waterbird communities and their composition in terms of foraging guilds varied according to habitat type. The bird communities of sandy beaches were dominated by open-water birds, whereas large mudflats were dominated by shorebirds, and wadi estuaries showed a more even representation of foraging guilds. Locally rare species had narrow distributions, whereas locally abundant species were found widely within the gulf. For four species the 1% population level criterion of the Ramsar Convention was exceeded. Overall, our results show that the Gulf of Gabès hosts important numbers of waterbirds with different ecological requirements, which confirms the importance of this gulf as a wintering area for Palearctic waterbirds.  aPublisher supplied data 3awintering grounds 3aPalearctic region 3arare species 3abeaches 3awaterfowl 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3aestuaries 3aTunisia 0aTunisia 0aGulf of Gabès 0awaterbirds 0aabundance 0aPalaearctic region 0aforaging guilds1 aHammouda, Abdessalem1 aSelmi, Slaheddine0 tOstrich.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 87, no. 3 p.217-223dTaylor & Francisx1727-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2016.12077213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011400160300001800274520102400292592002801316650002901344650002201373650002701395650002201422650002301444650001601467650004801483650001101531650001901542650001801561650001501579650001001594650002301604650001101627700001801638700001501656700001701671700001801688700002001706773012101726856007401847852000901921655001201930IND60618175220221120181651.0181029e20180118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061817522DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra12280b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlahmadi, N.

The concentration of the silver nanoclusters on the substrate surface is roughly proportional to the initial silver salt concentration. However, there is a noticeable degree of nanocluster aggregation to larger agglomerates. The addition of small amounts of α-cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose or aminocellulose during the synthesis of the silver/cellulose nanocomposites suppresses this aggregation and significantly increases the concentration of the silver nanoclusters on the surface of the fibres of cellulose. These small, surface-stabilised silver nanoclusters, with the desired size and morphology, deposited from aqueous solutions on the surface of cellulosic cotton fibres, show enhanced antibacterial activity against MRSA compared to that of the corresponding silver/cotton nanocomposites prepared in the absence of a cellulosic surface stabiliser.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3aaqueous solutions 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3achemical reduction 3alint cotton 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apaper 3asalt concentration 3asilver1 aBetts, J. W.1 aHeinze, T.1 aKelly, S.

Therapeutic proteins and peptides are routinely estimated using ligand binding assay formats however LC-MS/MS technique which is routinely used in bioanalysis of small molecules has now gained importance in large molecule bioanalysis for the advantages it can offer over LBAs in terms of improved accuracy, selectivity and anti-body free method development. This paper presents a sensitive bioanalytical method for determination of teriparatide in human serum using ultra performance liquid chromatography aligned with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Teriparatide was isolated from human serum using solid phase extraction. The intact peptide was separated on a chromatograph and the multiply charged ion (+7) was detected using a mass spectrometer. The total run time was 4.0 min. The internal standard used was rat PTH 1–34 fragment. The mass transitions of m/z 589.3 > 656.3 for teriparatide and m/z 677.4 > 778.6 for internal standard were used for MS/MS detection. The sample extraction involved a solid phase extraction method followed by concentration of the eluent by evaporation and subsequent reconstitution. The non-specific binding effect caused by the adherence of the peptides/proteins to the vials/tube walls was significantly reduced by using BSA solution as blocking agent. The method has been validated over a linear range of 15.07–913.3 pg/mL with a correlation coefficient ≥ 0.99. The precision (%RSD) was 6.36 to 10.85 and accuracy was within 96.71% to 100.88%. A two-treatment, two-period, cross over study was conducted to establish bioequivalence between test and reference formulation (20 mcg/80 mL – solution for injection) and the method was successfully applied to quantify teriparatide in serum samples of this clinical study and about 1220 human serum samples were analyzed to determine teriparatide. This method is a promising anti-body free LC-MS/MS based methodology for estimation of teriparatide in human serum and may be applied as starting method for other such peptide molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aevaporation 3ahumans 3aligands 3aosteoporosis 3aparathyroid hormone 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3arecombinant peptides 3asolid phase extraction 3aspectrometers 3atherapeutics 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aTeriparatide 0aPTH 1–34 fragment 0aIntact peptide 0aLC–MS/MS 0aHuman serum 0aBioanalysis 0aMultiply charged ions 0aPTH 0aLC-MS/MS 0aLBA 0aLLOQ 0aULOQ 0aSPE 0aQC 0aCC1 aKashibhatta, Ravisekhar1 aGavande, Anil1 aKiran, Ravi1 aJagtap, Sandeep1 aVithala, Praveen1 aMoorkoth, Sudheer1 aBhat, Krishnamurthy0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 1187 p.123046-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1230463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008400169300001600253500001900269520217400288592002802462596005302490596005302543650003402596650001202630650001202642650002002654650002202674650002102696650001102717650001502728650001602743650001502759650001202774650002202786650001202808700005802820700002702878700002102905700002002926700001602946700002202962700001702984700002403001700001903025700002403044700001703068700003203085700002103117700001803138773012703156856008203283852000903365655001203374IND60712313220221119154223.0201009e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071231322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-020-00700-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodionov, Andrei10aBiogeochemical cycling of phosphorus in subsoils of temperate forest ecosystems  ap. 313-328.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTree roots penetrate the soil to several meters depth, but the role of subsoils for the supply of nutrient elements such as phosphorus (P) to the trees is poorly understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that increased P deficiency in the topsoil results in an increased microbial recycling of P from the forest subsoil. We sampled soils from four German temperate forest sites representing a gradient in total P stocks. We analyzed the oxygen isotopic composition of HCl-extractable phosphate (δ¹⁸OP) and identified differences in P speciation with increasing soil depth using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. We further determined microbial oxygen demand with and without nutrient supply at different soil depths to analyse nutrient limitation of microbial growth and used nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) to visualize spatial P gradients in the rhizosphere. We found that δ¹⁸OP values in the topsoil of all sites were close to the isotopic signal imparted by biological cycling when oxygen isotopes in phosphate are exchanged by enzymatic activity. However, with increasing soil depth and increasing HCl-P concentrations, δ¹⁸Ο values continuously decreased towards values expected for primary minerals in parent material at depths below 60 cm at sites with high subsoil P stocks and below more than 2 m at sites with low subsoil P stocks, respectively. For these depths, XANES spectra also indicated the presence of apatite. NanoSIMS images showed an enrichment of P in the rhizosphere in the topsoil of a site with high P stocks, while this P enrichment was absent at a site with low P stocks and in both subsoils. Addition of C, N and P alone or in combination revealed that microbial activity in subsoils of sites with low P stocks was mostly P limited, whereas sites with high P stocks indicated N limitation or N and P co-limitation. We conclude that subsoil P resources are recycled by trees and soil microorganisms. With continued weathering of the bedrock and mobilisation of P from the weathered rocks, P cycling will proceed to greater depths, especially at sites characterised by P limitation.  aPublisher supplied data  aDFG AM 134/18-1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aDFG KA1590/12-1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aapatite 3abedrock 3aenzyme activity 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobial growth 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3arhizosphere 3asoil depth 3asubsoil 3atemperate forests 3atopsoil1 aBauke, Sara L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2284-95931 avon Sperber, Christian1 aHoeschen, Carmen1 aKandeler, Ellen1 aKruse, Jens1 aLewandowski, Hans1 aMarhan, Sven1 aMueller, Carsten W.1 aSimon, Margaux1 aTamburini, Federica1 aUhlig, David1 avon Blanckenburg, Friedhelm1 aLang, Friederike1 aAmelung, Wulf0 tBiogeochemistry.g2020 Oct., v. 150, no. 3 p.313-328dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-020-00700-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245014500162300002000307520090400327592002801231650001301259650001401272650001501286650001701301650001101318650001401329650001201343650001301355650002001368653003201388653002101420653002601441653002301467653002201490653002401512700001801536700001801554700002001572700001801592773012601610856008001736852000901816655001201825IND60559202920221121084956.0161130e20161130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055920292DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b104192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jae-Hong10aImproved Cycling Performance of Lithium–Oxygen Cells by Use of a Lithium Electrode Protected with Conductive Polymer and Aluminum Fluoride  ap. 32300-32306.  aLithium–oxygen batteries have attracted great attention for advanced energy storage systems because of their high specific energy. The enhancement of the interfacial stability of lithium negative electrodes is one of the many technical challenges toward high safety and long life lithium–oxygen batteries due to their high reactivity toward organic electrolytes and the lithium dendrite growth during the repeated cycling. Herein, we demonstrate that the protective layer comprising conductive polymer and AlF₃ particles on lithium metal stabilized the lithium electrode by effectively reducing the reductive decomposition of the liquid electrolyte and suppressing the growth of lithium dendrite. As a result, the cycling performance of a lithium–oxygen cell assembled with a surface-modified lithium electrode was remarkably improved as compared to a cell with a pristine lithium electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abatteries 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3afluorides 3alithium 3apolymers 3aspecific energy 0aprotected lithium electrode 0alithium dendrite 0alithium−oxygen cell 0aconductive polymer 0aaluminum fluoride 0acycling performance1 aWoo, Hyun-Sik1 aKim, Won Keun1 aRyu, Kyoung Han1 aKim, Dong-Won0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Nov. 30, v. 8, no. 47 p.32300-32306dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b104193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016000170300001400330520113200344592002801476650001501504650001801519650001401537650002801551650002101579650001101600650001201611650000901623650002201632650001101654650002301665650001001688650001601698650001601714700001501730700001701745700001701762773009801779856008401877990002301961852000901984655001201993IND60088830520221117082131.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008883052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.arabjc.2010.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenabdellah, M.10aThermodynamic, chemical and electrochemical investigations of 2-mercapto benzimidazole as corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in hydrochloric acid solutions  ap. 17-24.  aThe inhibiting action of 2-mercapto benzimidazole (2MBI) on mild steel in 1.0M hydrochloric acid has been investigated at 308K using weight loss measurements and electrochemical techniques (impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarisation). Inhibition efficiency increases with 2MBI concentration to attain 98% at 10⁻³M. Polarisation curves indicate that 2MBI acts as a mixed-type inhibitor. Inhibition efficiency values obtained from various methods were in good agreement. EIS measurements showed an increase of the transfer resistance with the inhibitor concentration. The temperature effect on the corrosion behaviour of steel in 1.0M HCl without and with the 2MBI at various concentrations was studied in the temperature range from 308 to 353K. Thermodynamic parameters such as heat of adsorption (ΔHₐdₛ ∘), entropy of adsorption (ΔSₐdₛ ∘) and adsorption free energy (ΔGₐdₛ ∘) have been calculated. Kinetic parameters for the corrosion reaction at different concentrations of 2MBI were determined. Adsorption of 2MBI on the mild steel surface in 1.0M HCl follows the Langmuir isotherm model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abenzimidazole 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aentropy 3aheat 3ahydrochloric acid 3amodels 3asorption isotherms 3asteel 3atemperature 3aweight loss1 aTounsi, A.1 aKhaled, K.F.1 aHammouti, B.0 tArabian journal of chemistry.g2011 Jan., v. 4, no. 1 p.17-24dElsevier B.V.x1878-53527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arabjc.2010.06.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245012900162300001400291500001500305520167000320592002801990650002202018650001402040650001702054650001002071650001402081650003002095650003002125650001102155650001102166650002702177650001002204650002802214650002702242650001302269650001802282650001102300650001902311653003002330700001902360700002002379773009402399856008202493852000902575655001202584IND4476915020221116214449.0141112e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447691502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2012.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeale, M.A.10aAgrobacterium-mediated transformation of potato cv.

The Bacillus thuringiensis gene (cry1Ia1) was introduced into the South African potato cultivar Mnandi with Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harbouring the binary vector pSPUD5 carrying the cry1Ia1 gene under the transcriptional control of the (ocs)âmas promoter and the nptII gene (as selectable marker) was used to transform in vitro potato explants. In vitro potato explants were infected with Agrobacterium LBA4404, cultured on the pre-culture medium with 50Î¼M acetosyringone, co-cultivated on pre-culture media for two days, and then regenerated on medium containing MS basal medium, 0.27Î¼M NAA, 0.58Î¼M GAâ, 9.12Î¼M zeatin and 50mg lâ»Â¹ kanamycin. The regeneration frequency of 15% obtained with the potato cultivar Mnandi was an indication that this cultivar is sensitive to transformation with Agrobacterium. Verification of stable integration of the cry1Ia1 gene was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot hybridization procedures. The level of resistance to the potato tuber moth was investigated using leaf and tuber bio-assays which involved feeding studies of potato tuber moth larvae on the leaves and tubers of putatively transformed plants. Seven transformed lines expressed potato tuber moth resistance during the leaf and tuber assays. The Southern blot hybridization analysis verified that one to three copies of the cry1Ia1 gene was integrated into the genome of five transformed lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSouthern blotting 3acultivars 3ainsect pests 3amoths 3akanamycin 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3apolymerase chain reaction 3azeatin 3atubers 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3agenes 3aPhthorimaea operculella 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3apotatoes 3ainsect larvae 3aleaves 3aacetosyringone 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aSlabbert, M.M.1 aVan Emmenes, L.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2012 May, v. 80 p.67-74dElsevier B.V.x0254-62997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245012400210300001600334520166300350592002802013653004202041653001902083653002402102653003402126653001602160653000802176653000802184653000802192653000802200653001102208700002102219700001402240700001902254700001802273700001702291700002402308700001802332700002502350700001802375700002202393773011102415856008402526852000902610655001202619IND60557858120221119203720.0161103e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055785812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.conctc.2016.09.0012doi7 aPMC50665892pmcid7 a277663182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnhart, Dale10aIntra-cluster correlation estimates for HIV-related outcomes from care and treatment clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania  ap. 161-169.  aResearchers planning cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) require estimates of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) from previous studies for sample size calculations. This paper fills a persistent gap in the literature by providing estimates of ICCs for many key HIV-related clinical outcomes.Data from HIV-positive patients from 47 HIV care and treatment clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania were used to calculate ICCs by site of enrollment or site of ART initiation for various clinical outcomes using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. ICCs were estimated using linear mixed models where either clinic of enrollment or clinic of ART initiation served as the random effect.ICCs ranged from 0 to 0.0706 (95% CI: 0.0447, 0.1098). For most outcomes, the ICCs were large enough to meaningfully affect sample size calculations. For binary outcomes, the ICCs for event prevalence at baseline tended to be larger than the ICCs for later cumulative incidences. For continuous outcomes, the ICCs for baseline values tended to be larger than the ICCs for the change in values from baseline.The ICCs for HIV-related outcomes cannot be ignored when calculating sample sizes for future cluster-randomized trials. The differences between ICCs calculated from baseline data alone and ICCs calculated using longitudinal data demonstrate the importance of selecting an ICC that reflects a study's intended design and duration for sample size calculations. While not generalizable to all contexts, these estimates provide guidance for future researchers seeking to design adequately powered cRCTs in Sub-Saharan African HIV treatment and care clinics.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIntra-cluster correlation coefficient 0aHIV infections 0aMulticenter studies 0aCluster randomized controlled 0aSample size 0aART 0aCTC 0aICC 0aMDH 0aPEPFAR1 aHertzmark, Ellen1 aLiu, Enju1 aMungure, Ester1 aMuya, Aisa N.1 aSando, David1 aChalamilla, Guerino1 aUlenga, Nzovu1 aBärnighausen, Till,1 aFawzi, Wafaie1 aSpiegelman, Donna0 tContemporary Clinical Trials Communications.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 4 p.161-169dElsevier Inc.x2451-86547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2016.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245009900163520223700262592002802499650005302527650001102580650001502591650002302606650001402629650001102643650001202654650002202666650002402688651001802712700006002730700006002790700006502850773008702915856007603002852000903078655001203087IND60701181220221119234506.0200707e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070118122DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/38482562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFowler, James R.10aPhysical Activity and Insulin Resistance in 6,500 NHANES Adults: The Role of Abdominal Obesity  aThis cross-sectional investigation studied differences in insulin resistance across levels of physical activity in 6,500 US adults who were randomly selected as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Another important objective was to determine the influence of abdominal obesity on the physical activity and insulin resistance relationship. MET-minutes were utilized to quantify total activity based on participation in 48 different physical activities. Two strategies were employed to categorize levels of physical activity: one was based on relative MET-minutes (quartiles), and the other approach was based on the US physical activity guidelines. Insulin resistance was indexed using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). Abdominal obesity was indexed using waist circumference. Effect modification was tested by dividing waist circumferences into sex-specific quartiles and then evaluating the relationship between physical activity and HOMA-IR within each quartile separately. Results showed that relative physical activity level was associated with HOMA-IR after controlling for demographic and demographic and lifestyle covariates (F = 11.5, P<0.0001 and F = 6.0, P=0.0012, respectively). Adjusting for demographic and demographic and lifestyle covariates also resulted in significant relationships between guideline-based activity and HOMA-IR (F = 8.0, P<0.0001 and F = 4.9, P=0.0017, respectively). However, statistically controlling for differences in waist circumference with the other covariates nullified the relationship between total physical activity and HOMA-IR. Effect modification testing showed that when the sample was delimited to adults with abdominal obesity (Quartile 4), relative (F = 5.6, P=0.0019) and guideline-based physical activity (F = 3.7, P=0.0098) and HOMA-IR were significantly associated. Physical activity and HOMA-IR were not related within the other three quartiles. In conclusion, it appears that differences in physical activity may play a meaningful role in insulin resistance in those with abdominal obesity, but total activity does not seem to account for differences in insulin resistance among US adults with smaller waists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3aguidelines 3ainsulin resistance 3alifestyle 3amodels 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3awaist circumference 3aUnited States1 aTucker, Larry A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4591-882X1 aBailey, Bruce W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9294-48901 aLeCheminant, James D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2368-03740 tJournal of obesity.g2020 Apr. 1, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:21567x2090-07167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/38482563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01080naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245009100158300001600249520015500265592002800420650005100448650001000499650003300509650001900542650002000561700001800581773010700599856007500706852000900781655001200790IND60637546320221120073656.0190419e20130823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063754632DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1981.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, V.

The source of this fluid was examined using Cycas revoluta Thunb. ovules placed in culture. Dissected female gametophytes just before fertilization produced copious fluid on their upper surface. The fluid first appeared around the archegonial chamber and then on the inside of the archegonial chamber. When this fluid was applied to dry turgid pollen tubes, they discharged spermatozoids 12 h later. The archegonial neck appeared as two semi-spherical swellings, whereas the four neck cells later became visible and they separated in a schizogenous manner. Many globose particles appear on the top of the archegonial neck cells when the fluid is present. The contents of pollen tubes, spermatozoids and surrounding liquid intermingle with the secreted fluid. The female gametophyte differs in ultrastructure during the stages before and after fluid secretion, the latter showing changes suggestive of fluid secretion from the female gametophyte.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCycas revoluta 3afemales 3agametophytes 3aovules 3aparticles 3aplant reproduction 3apollen tubes 3asecretion 3aultrastructure1 aKimoto, Yukitoshi1 aOwens, John N.1 aKono, Masumi1 aMimura, Tetsuro0 tPlant reproduction.g2013 Mar., v. 26, no. 1 p.17-23dSpringer-Verlagx2194-79537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-012-0204-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245006900161300001600230520150900246592002801755650001301783650001401796650001401810650001601824650001401840650001101854650002401865650001701889650001701906650001201923650002101935650001701956650002501973773010701998856007502105852000902180655001202189IND60637546420221120073911.0190419e20130823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063754642DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1981.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosina, Romuald10aSome genetic parameters of the spring wheat caryopsis characters  ap. 169-194.  aNineteen characters of the single caryopsis of many pure lines and their F2 generation hybrids of spring wheat were analyzed. A large differentiation of forms was ascertained. "Manitoba" cultivar, sphaerococcum and spelta forms, hybrids of durum forms, hybrids of spelta and sphaerococcum forms were foud to have the higest values of the DBC parameter. The characters were found to show a differentiated relative varirtion from a few to more than 100%. A great variation of F2 generation as well as transgressions of characters appeard more marked in hybrids between various subspecies than between varietes of one subspecies. A specific gravity of the caryopsis is marked by a high value of coefficients of heritability in broad sense. An influence of asymetry of distribution on the h2 value was stated. The distributions of characters with a deviation from normal curve are only leptokurtic. The heigh of endosperm cavity revealed the largest number of deviations characterized by asymmetry and kurtosis. These deviations appeared smaller in the distributions of homozygous forms than of herterozygous forms. The interspecies hybrids are marked by numerous genetic correlations in matrix of correlation coefficients than hybrids of less differentiated forms. Many reciprocal hybrids revelated a differentiation in the mean values of characters as well as in the range of transgession. These hybrids are similar to their maternal forms. A short consideration of an ideotype of wheat caryopsis was made.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3aasymmetry 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3aendosperm 3afruits 3agenetic correlation 3aheritability 3ahomozygosity 3ahybrids 3aspecific gravity 3aspring wheat 3astatistical analysis0 tActa agrobotanica.g, v. 34, no. 2 p.169-194dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:14720x2300-357X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.1981.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002500197245010100222300001500323520198500338592002802323650001602351650002502367650002602392650001402418650001102432650001502443650001102458650001302469650002502482650001902507650001302526650001402539650001702553650001902570650001302589650001402602650001102616700002102627773010802648856009002756990002302846852000902869655001202878IND60111751320221122222420.0141110s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011175132DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-398264-3.00002-42doi7 aPMC41009462pmcid7 a226330592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerchant, Sabeeha S.10aElemental Economy: Microbial Strategies for Optimizing Growth in the Face of Nutrient Limitation  ap. 91-210.  aMicroorganisms play a dominant role in the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients. They are rightly praised for their facility for fixing both carbon and nitrogen into organic matter, and microbial driven processes have tangibly altered the chemical composition of the biosphere and its surrounding atmosphere. Despite their prodigious capacity for molecular transformations, microorganisms are powerless in the face of the immutability of the elements. Limitations for specific elements, either fleeting or persisting over eons, have left an indelible trace on microbial genomes, physiology, and their very atomic composition. We here review the impact of elemental limitation on microbes, with a focus on selected genetic model systems and representative microbes from the ocean ecosystem. Evolutionary adaptations that enhance growth in the face of persistent or recurrent elemental limitations are evident from genome and proteome analyses. These range from the extreme (such as dispensing with a requirement for a hard to obtain element) to the extremely subtle (changes in protein amino acid sequences that slightly, but significantly, reduce cellular carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur demand). One near-universal adaptation is the development of sophisticated acclimation programs by which cells adjust their chemical composition in response to a changing environment. When specific elements become limiting, acclimation typically begins with an increased commitment to acquisition and a concomitant mobilization of stored resources. If elemental limitation persists, the cell implements austerity measures including elemental sparing and elemental recycling. Insights into these fundamental cellular properties have emerged from studies at many different levels, including ecology, biological oceanography, biogeochemistry, molecular genetics, genomics, and microbial physiology. Here, we present a synthesis of these diverse studies and attempt to discern some overarching themes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aamino acid sequences 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3agenome 3agenomics 3amicrobial physiology 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aoceanography 3aorganic matter 3aproteome 3arecycling 3asulfur1 aHelmann, John D.0 tAdvances in Microbial Physiology.g2012, v. 60 p.91-210dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-29117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-398264-3.00002-43Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245017200162500001900334520198300353592002802336596003702364650002002401650001302421650001202434650001102446650001502457650001402472650001102486650002302497650001402520650002602534650001002560650002002570650002302590650001202613650003102625700006502656773009602721856007602817852000902893655001202902IND60701181620221119234728.0200707e20200627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070118162DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/84972592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, Gareth10aAnalysis of Apple Flavours: The Use of Volatile Organic Compounds to Address Cultivar Differences and the Correlation between Consumer Appreciation and Aroma Profiling  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the selection of apple (Malus domestica Borkh) fruits, consumers predominantly use visual and organoleptic responses, such as aroma and texture, as quality/preference markers. Previous studies profiling the sensory properties and aroma profiles of apple varieties have provided a lexicon describing important attributes within the modalities of aroma, texture, and flavour. The range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by four apple cultivars was assessed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). To facilitate automated dynamic headspace extraction of the VOCs from bulk samples, a small multichamber thermal extraction system was used. Forty compounds were detected and putatively identified by mass spectral comparison with NIST libraries. Eight compounds were not previously identified in apples. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) and canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) done on the whole volatile organic compound profiles show separation of the four cultivars. The use of random forest classification enabled the determination of a minimum set of fifteen potential VOC markers that successfully differentiate the cultivars under study. Trends across samples, VOCs, and sensory evaluation are revealed. The association between 4-hexen-1-ol acetate with texture/consistency, and crispiness, and correlation of 2-methylbut-2-en-1-yl acetate with juiciness and acidity is shown for the first time. These sensory correlations indicate that the compounds determined by this experiment could be used as objective markers for the consumer appreciation of fresh apples, enabling the optimum conditions for processing and storage of individual cultivars to be identified without recourse to expensive sensory panels in every case. Such tests could also be used as part of routine quality control by the producer and retailer, reducing costs and eliminating waste due to batches of inferior product.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-0245cFondazione CON IL SUD 3aMalus domestica 3aacetates 3aacidity 3aapples 3aautomation 3acultivars 3aflavor 3aheadspace analysis 3ajuiciness 3amultivariate analysis 3aodors 3aquality control 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3avolatile organic compounds1 aSpadafora, Natasha D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7273-63220 tJournal of food quality.g2020 June 27, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/84972593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245011400212300001600326506007600342520091700418592002801335506003701363650001501400650001001415650001901425650001201444650000901456650000901465650001401474650002501488650002301513650001301536650001201549650002301561650000901584650003501593700002201628700002301650700002201673700001901695700001901714700001601733700002001749700002101769700001801790700003201808700002101840700002201861700001901883700001801902700002201920700001801942700001901960700001901979700001801998700002902016700002202045700002002067700002202087700002002109700002302129700001602152700002202168700002302190700001802213700001602231700002002247700002302267700002502290700001902315700002102334700002302355773009402378856008102472852000902553655001202562IND50058868420221207083318.0150212e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005886842DNAL7 a228928382pmid7 aPMC35867632pmcid7 a10.1007/s00335-012-9411-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhazalpour, Anatole10aHybrid mouse diversity panel: a panel of inbred mouse strains suitable for analysis of complex genetic traits  ap. 680-692.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have developed an association-based approach using classical inbred strains of mice in which we correct for population structure, which is very extensive in mice, using an efficient mixed-model algorithm. Our approach includes inbred parental strains as well as recombinant inbred strains in order to capture loci with effect sizes typical of complex traits in mice (in the range of 5 % of total trait variance). Over the last few years, we have typed the hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) strains for a variety of clinical traits as well as intermediate phenotypes and have shown that the HMDP has sufficient power to map genes for highly complex traits with resolution that is in most cases less than a megabase. In this essay, we review our experience with the HMDP, describe various ongoing projects, and discuss how the HMDP may fit into the larger picture of common diseases and different approaches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3agenes 3agenetic traits 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amice 3aphenotype 3apopulation structure 3astatistical models 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strainsxgenetics1 aRau, Christoph D.1 aFarber, Charles R.1 aBennett, Brian J.1 aOrozco, Luz D.1 avan Nas, Atila1 aPan, Calvin1 aAllayee, Hooman1 aBeaven, Simon W.1 aCivelek, Mete1 aDavis, R.

In modern times, the propagation of high-spatial-resolution image analysis techniques and automated workflows have further strengthened this synergy, leading to the inquiry into more complex, local-scale, ecosystem characteristics. To appropriately inform decisions in forestry ecology and management, the most reliable and efficient methods should be adopted. For this reason, our research compares visual interpretation to digital (automated) processing for forest plot composition and individual tree identification. During this investigation, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the process of classifying species groups within complex, mixed-species forests in New England. This analysis included a comparison of three high-resolution remotely sensed imagery sources: Google Earth, National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery, and unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery. We discovered that, although the level of detail afforded by the UAS imagery spatial resolution (3.02 cm average pixel size) improved the visual interpretation results (7.87–9.59%), the highest thematic accuracy was still only 54.44% for the generalized composition groups. Our qualitative analysis of the uncertainty for visually interpreting different composition classes revealed the persistence of mislabeled hardwood compositions (including an early successional class) and an inability to consistently differentiate between ‘pure’ and ‘mixed’ stands. The results of digitally classifying the same forest compositions produced a higher level of accuracy for both detecting individual trees (93.9%) and labeling them (59.62–70.48%) using machine learning algorithms including classification and regression trees, random forest, and support vector machines. These results indicate that digital, automated, classification produced an increase in overall accuracy of 16.04% over visual interpretation for generalized forest composition classes. Other studies, which incorporate multitemporal, multispectral, or data fusion approaches provide evidence for further widening this gap. Further refinement of the methods for individual tree detection, delineation, and classification should be developed for structurally and compositionally complex forests to supplement the critical deficiency in local-scale forest information around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aautomation 3aecosystems 3aforest ecology 3aforestry 3ahardwood 3aimage analysis 3ameta-analysis 3aqualitative analysis 3aremote sensing 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aNew England region1 aCongalton, Russell G.0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120912903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003600166245009300202300001800295520087200313592002801185650002101213650000701234650002701241650000901268650000901277650001801286650001801304650002101322650002901343650004601372650003901418650002001457650004101477651001301518651001101531700003501542700002901577700003901606773013601645856004801781852000901829655001201838IND50069466920221116161145.0130926e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006946692DNAL7 a236250502pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1723-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza Braz, Anderson Martins10aDistribution coefficients of potentially toxic elements in soils from the eastern Amazon  ap. 7231-7242.  aThe solid-solution distribution or partition coefficient (Kd) is a measure of affinity of potentially toxic elements (PTE) for soil colloids. Kd plays a key role in several models for defining PTE guideline values in soils and for assessing environmental risks, and its value depends on edaphic and climatic conditions of the sites where the soils occur. This study quantified Kd values for Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn from representative soil samples from Brazil’s eastern Amazon region, which measures 1.2 million km². The Kd values obtained were lower than those set by both international and Brazilian environmental agencies and were correlated with the pH, Fe and Mn oxide content, and cationic exchange capacity of the soils. The following order of decreasing affinity was observed: Pb > Cu > Hg > Cr > Cd ≈ Co > Ni > Zn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3apH 3apartition coefficients 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil colloids 3asoil sampling 3atoxic substances 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHazardous Substancesxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxtoxicity. 3aAmazonia 0aBrazil1 aFernandes, Antônio Rodrigues,1 aFerreira, José Roberto,1 aAlleoni, Luís Reynaldo Ferracciú0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.7231-7242dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1723-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011300166300001600279520121800295592002801513650002301541650001501564650001701579650001601596650002301612650001101635650002001646650001301666650001901679650001801698650001401716650001901730650001801749650001101767650001501778650001501793650002201808650001401830653003701844653003401881653003001915653002601945653002901971653001402000700001702014700001602031700001402047700001502061700001802076700001502094700001702109773009202126856008502218852000902303655001202312IND60606490620221121063936.0180726e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060649062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSocaci, C.10aGraphene oxide vs. reduced graphene oxide as carbon support in porphyrin peroxidase biomimetic nanomaterials  ap. 511-517.  aThe paper describes the preparation of supramolecular assemblies of tetrapyridylporphyrin (TPyP) and its metallic complexes with graphene oxide (GO) and thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO). The two carbon supports are introducing different characteristics in the absorption spectra of the investigated nanocomposites. Raman spectroscopy shows that the absorption of iron-tetrapyridylporphyrin is more efficient on GO than TRGO, suggesting that oxygen functionalities are involved in the non-covalent interaction between the iron-porphyrin and graphene. The biomimetic peroxidase activity is investigated and the two iron-containing composites exhibit a better catalytic activity than each component of the assembly, and their cobalt and manganese homologues, respectively. The main advantages of this work include the demonstration of graphene oxide as a very good support for graphene-based nanomaterials with peroxidase-like activity (KM=0.292mM), the catalytic activity being observed even with very small amounts of porphyrins (the TPyP:graphene ratio=1:50). Its potential application in the detection of lipophilic antioxidants (vitamin E can be measured in the 10⁻⁵–10⁻⁴M range) is also shown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aantioxidants 3abiomimetics 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3aenzyme activity 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3alipophilicity 3amanganese 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3aoxygen 3aperoxidase 3aporphyrins 3aspectral analysis 3avitamin E 0aThermally reduced graphene oxide 0aGraphene oxide nanocomposites 0aSupramolecular assemblies 0aTetrapyridylporphyrin 0aPeroxidase-like activity 0aVitamin E1 aPogacean, F.1 aBiris, A.R.1 aCoros, M.1 aRosu, M.C.1 aMagerusan, L.1 aKatona, G.1 aPruneanu, S.0 tTalanta.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 148 p.511-517dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.11.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245013400153520200300287592002802290650001802318650001802336650002302354650002402377650001202401650001502413650001102428650002302439650001802462651001802480700002102498700001402519700001802533700001802551700001702569773012102586856007302707852000902780655001202789IND60751541620221122035442.0210925e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075154162DNAL7 a10.3390/f120912912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Enxu 14aThe Development and Application of a GIS-Based Tool to Assess Forest Landscape Restoration Effects on Water Conservation Capacity  aIn forest landscape restoration, one of the key objectives is to improve the water conservation capacity of the deforested land. A rapid, accurate assessment of the effects of the restoration measures on the water conservation capacity of targeted forests can help forest managers to identify the best practices for forest restoration. However, the traditional assessment tools of forest water conservation function lack a description of forest growth, and are featured by complex computation, which fails to evaluate the effects of forest restoration on the regional forest water conservation capacity in an efficient way. To address this issue, through combining the forest restoration evaluation model (equivalent recovery area, ERA), classic forest water storage capacity estimation (total water storage capacity), this study has taken advantage of ENVI/IDL, ArcGIS Engine/C#.Net to develop the Forest and Water Assessment Tool (FWAT) for assessing the changes of the regional forest landscape and the associated forest water conservation capacity in various forest restoration scenarios. This tool has been successfully applied in the Upper Zagunao watershed, a large forested watershed in the Upper Yangtze River basin. According to the assessment, the forest water conservation capacity of the study watershed consistently increased from about 1580.76 t/hm² in 2010 to a projected 2014.34 t/hm² by natural restoration, and 2124.18 t/hm² by artificial restoration by 2030. The artificial restoration measures yield a better effect on forest water conservation function than natural restoration. By 2030, the forest water conservation capacity of artificial restoration scenario is expected to be about 7% higher than that of natural restoration scenario. The FWAT as an efficient tool to assess the effects of forest restoration measures on regional forest water conservation capacity can provide scientific support for the design of forest restoration and management strategies worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeforestation 3aforest growth 3aforest restoration 3aforested watersheds 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amodels 3awater conservation 3awater storage 3aYangtze River1 aZhang, Mingfang 1 aXu, Yali 1 aZhang, Sheng 1 aMeng, Zuozhu 1 aHou, Yiping 0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120912913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100002200187245007300209300001600282506002800298506006400326520123000390592002801620596008501648596008301733596005601816596005701872596007401929506003702003650001902040650000902059650001302068650001102081650002002092650002002112650001402132650002102146650001602167650002202183700002202205700002302227700001902250700006302269773009802332856008302430903002202513852000902535655001202544IND60675176520221207095643.0200305e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067517652DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-019-00680-12chorus7 a10.1007/s13592-019-00680-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreston, Sarah R.14aThe impacts of maternal stress on worker phenotypes in the honey bee  ap. 704-719.  aResource is Open Access  aSpringer Science and Business Media LLC License Information  aMaternal stress is a common source of heritable health and behavioral variation. This type of maternal effect could be particularly important for honey bees (Apis mellifera), as a single queen is responsible for many generations of workers who perform all colony functions including raising subsequent worker generations. Multiple factors work synergistically to cause colony loss, but a role for maternal stress effects is unstudied. We used an artificial cold temperature treatment as a proof-of-concept approach to investigate whether acute queen stress causes changes in worker phenotypes, including egg hatching rate, development time, and adult behavior and immune function. We found that queen stress impacts early-life phenotypes (egg hatching and development time), with more limited impacts on adult phenotypes (behavior and immune function). Thus, if maternal stress impacts colony health, it is likely through cumulative impacts on worker population numbers, not through phenotypic effects that impact individual adult worker behavior or health resilience. This study addresses an important and overlooked question, and provides a baseline understanding of the likely impacts of queen stress on worker phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data  cFoundation for Food and Agriculture Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011929  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  a1012993cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  a549049cFoundation for Food and Agriculture Research  aNonecUniversity of Kentucky Bucks for Brains Summer Research Program0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApis mellifera 3aeggs 3ahatching 3aimagos 3aimmune response 3amaternal effect 3aphenotype 3aqueen honey bees 3atemperature 3aworker honey bees1 aPalmer, Joseph H.1 aHarrison, James W.1 aCarr, Hanna M.1 aRittschof, Clare C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0808-04580 tApidologie.g2019 Oct., v. 50, no. 5 p.704-719dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-019-00680-13Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100007800142245010900220520120400329592002801533650002501561650001401586650001601600650002501616650002301641650002401664650001101688650002701699650003201726650001001758700003201768773011701800856007601917852000901993655001202002IND60701181820221119234334.0200707e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070118182DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/88494132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNilmini Wijeyaratne, W.

The present study was conducted to develop an allometric model to determine the stem carbon content of Rhizophora mucronata in a conserved tropical mangrove ecosystem. The stepwise regression with backward elimination was used to identify the best fit model to predict the stem carbon content of Rhizophora mucronata. The allometric equation, Ln C = −2.403 + 2.247 Ln DBH, where C: stem carbon content and DBH: diameter at breast height, was constructed to be evaluated and validated as the most suitable and practically applicable model. The reliability of the model was 76.7%, and the model was significant at 95% level of significance. The model bias values and the model efficiency values for the best fit model suggested that the model is suitable to be used practically. The present study used a nondestructive method of measuring individual tree parameters to develop this allometric equation to predict the stem carbon content and it is considered as an environmentally friendly approach with minimum damage to the tree.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizophora mucronata 3aallometry 3ablue carbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acoastal ecosystems 3amangrove ecosystems 3amodels 3anondestructive methods 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees1 aLiyanage, Pawani Madhushani0 tInternational journal of forestry research.g2020 June 25, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:J000000092x1687-93767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88494133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010100160300001800261520137100279592002801650650002101678650001101699650002301710650002301733650001501756650001401771650000901785650001901794650002101813650001001834650002201844650002101866700002201887773012401909856007502033852000902108655001202117IND60534822520221118161508.0160803e20130219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053482252DNAL7 a10.1021/es303025c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrban, Robert
A.10aTechno-Ecological Synergy as a Path Toward Sustainability of a North American Residential System  ap. 1985-1993.  aFor any human-designed system to be sustainable, ecosystem services that support it must be readily available. This work explicitly accounts for this dependence by designing synergies between technological and ecological systems. The resulting techno-ecological network mimics nature at the systems level, can stay within ecological constraints, and can identify novel designs that are economically and environmentally attractive that may not be found by the traditional design focus on technological options. This approach is showcased by designing synergies for a typical American suburban home at local and life cycle scales. The objectives considered are carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and cost savings. Systems included in the design optimization include typical ecosystems in suburban yards: lawn, trees, water reservoirs, and a vegetable garden; technological systems: heating, air conditioning, faucets, solar panels, etc.; and behavioral variables: heating and cooling set points. The ecological and behavioral design variables are found to have a significant effect on the three objectives, in some cases rivaling and exceeding the effect of traditional technological options. These results indicate the importance and benefits of explicitly including ecosystems in the design of sustainable systems, something that is rarely done in existing methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aheat 3alawns and turf 3asolar collectors 3atrees 3avegetable gardens 3awater reservoirs1 aBakshi, Bhavik R.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Feb. 19, v. 47, no. 4 p.1985-1993dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes303025c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002500156245006800181300001600249520115000265592002801415650002301443650001101466650002301477650001401500650001001514650002601524650000901550650000901559650001601568650001601584650000901600650001101609650001601620650002201636650001801658650001801676650001701694700002101711700001801732773011601750856009001866961001301956852000901969655001201978IND60111751620221122222513.0150809s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011175162DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-385989-1.00005-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnwulata, Charles I.10aExtrusion Texturized Dairy Proteins: Processing and Application  ap. 173-200.  aThe primary proteins in milk, casein and the whey proteins α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin, have a number of health benefits and desirable functional properties. In a twin-screw extruder, mechanical shear forces, heat, and pressure cause considerable changes in the molecular structures of the dairy proteins, a process known as texturization. These changes further impart unique functional properties to dairy proteins, resulting in new protein-based food ingredients. The new functional behavior depends on the extent of texturization and the degree of structural change imparted and is controlled by adjusting parameters such as extrusion temperature and moisture level. Such texturized proteins can be used to produce puffed high-protein snacks. Softer gels and expanded structures can be made using supercritical fluid extrusion and cold extrusion, techniques that avoid elevated temperatures, minimizing possible damage to the nutritive components and functionality of the texturized dairy proteins. The uses of the texturized dairy ingredient in food products with improved functionality and enhanced nutritive profiles are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acasein 3achemical structure 3aextrusion 3afoods 3afunctional properties 3agels 3aheat 3aingredients 3alactalbumin 3amilk 3asnacks 3atemperature 3atextured proteins 3atexturization 3awater content 3awhey protein1 aTunick, Michael,1 aQi, Phoebe X.0 tAdvances in food and nutrition research.g2011, v. 62 p.173-200dElsevier Science & Technologyx1043-45267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-385989-1.00005-33Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015400171300001800325520139200343592002801735650001501763650001301778650002601791650001701817650001901834650001701853650001401870650001201884650002401896650001001920650002301930650001801953650001401971651002201985700002102007700002002028700001902048773010702067856008402174852000902258655001202267IND60084004720221121054442.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008400472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2011.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPischedda, Laura10aCharacterization of specificity of bacterial community structure within the burrow environment of the marine polychaete Hediste (Nereis) diversicolor  ap. 1033-1042.  aBioturbation is known to stimulate microbial communities, especially in macrofaunal burrows where the abundance and activities of bacteria are increased. Until now, these microbial communities have been poorly characterized and an important ecological question remains: do burrow walls harbor similar or specific communities compared with anoxic and surface sediments? The bacterial community structure of coastal sediments inhabited by the polychaete worm Hediste diversicolor was investigated. Surface, burrow wall and anoxic sediments were collected at the Carteau beach (Gulf of Fos, Mediterranean Sea). Bacterial diversity was determined by analyzing small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequences from three clone libraries (168, 179 and 129 sequences for the surface, burrow wall and anoxic sediments, respectively). Libraries revealed 306 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to at least 15 bacterial phyla. Bioinformatic analyses and comparisons between the three clone libraries showed that the burrow walls harbored a specific bacterial community structure which differed from the surface and anoxic environments. More similarities were nevertheless found with the surface assemblage. Inside the burrow walls, the bacterial community was characterized by high biodiversity, which probably results from the biogeochemical heterogeneity of the burrow system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiodiversity 3abioinformatics 3abioturbation 3aburrowing 3aburrows 3acommunity structure 3afauna 3amarine environment 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3aMediterranean Sea1 aMiliton, Cécile1 aGilbert, Franck1 aCuny, Philippe0 tResearch in microbiology.g2011 Dec., v. 162, no. 10 p.1033-1042dElsevier Masson SASx0923-25087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2011.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012600164300001200290520168800302592002801990650001302018650003502031650001502066650001402081650000702095650001702102650001402119650001102133650001302144650001102157650002302168650002102191650001802212651001502230651001002245700002302255700001802278773012802296856008102424852000902505655001202514IND60671502220221122044110.0191019e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067150222DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-019-1045-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShil, Sanjoy10aWater quality assessment of a tropical river using water quality index (WQI), multivariate statistical techniques and GIS  ap. 168.  aMahananda River is an important river in India and Bangladesh, as the people of both the countries use the water extensively, without sufficient and reliable information about water qualities and pollution status. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the water quality of the river and to analyse the suitability for drinking, agricultural and industrial uses. This is why this study on the Mahananda River is extremely important for the region. For this study, samples from fourteen sampling stations were collected in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in 2016 and water quality index (WQI), agriculture and industry-related indices were computed. WQI values designated two sampling stations out of fourteen sampling stations as ‘very bad’ category and another two sampling stations as ‘bad’ category. The pH values of some sampling stations slightly exceeded the upper permissible limit. USSL diagram analysis classified two samples of pre-monsoon season in C2S1 category which indicates a medium salinity and low sodium water. Magnesium hazard values of four sampling stations are above 50% suggesting not suitable for irrigation. However, some indices like sodium per cent, residual sodium carbonate and residual sodium bicarbonate, Kelly’s index, permeability index and potential salinity allow the water for use in irrigation purposes. Langelier Saturation Index and aggressive index values designate the water as moderately aggressive or non-aggressive. Ryznar Stability Index values designate the water as ‘aggressive’ or ‘very aggressive’ indicating unsuitability for industrial uses. Sampling stations S-1, S-2, S-8 and S-14 need special attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking 3ageographic information systems 3airrigation 3amagnesium 3apH 3apermeability 3apollution 3arivers 3asalinity 3asodium 3asodium bicarbonate 3asodium carbonate 3awater quality 3aBangladesh 3aIndia1 aSingh, Umesh Kumar1 aMehta, Pankaj0 tApplied water science.g2019 Oct., v. 9, no. 7 p.168-168dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-019-1045-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03772naa a2200997 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008800170520133000258592002801588650002901616650002501645650000901670650001601679650002601695650002001721650001001741650001601751650001401767650002201781650001501803650001501818650001801833650002001851650002001871650001601891650002101907650001101928653000801939653000801947653000801955653000801963653000801971653000801979653001101987653000901998653000902007653000902016653001002025653000802035653000802043653000802051653000902059653000802068653000702076653000702083653000702090653000702097653000802104653000802112653001102120653000702131653001402138653000802152653000802160653000902168653000702177653000802184653001302192653001902205653000702224653000802231653002002239653002102259653001002280653001702290653001702307653002002324653002102344653003702365653000902402700002302411700002702434700002402461700001902485700001902504700002602523773011902549856008502668852000902753655001202762IND60674954720221121074921.0200117e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067495472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2019.1585572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrieto, Jose A.10aPho85 and PI(4,5)P2 regulate different lipid metabolic pathways in response to cold  aLipid homeostasis allows cells to adjust membrane biophysical properties in response to changes in environmental conditions. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a downward shift in temperature from an optimal reduces membrane fluidity, which triggers a lipid remodeling of the plasma membrane. How changes in membrane fluidity are perceived, and how the abundance and composition of different lipid classes is properly balanced, remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P₂], the most abundant plasma membrane phosphoinositide, drop rapidly in response to a downward shift in temperature. This change triggers a signaling cascade transmitted to cytosolic diphosphoinositol phosphate derivatives, among them 5-PP-IP₄ and 1-IP₇, that exert regulatory functions on genes involved in the inositol and phospholipids (PLs) metabolism, and inhibit the activity of the protein kinase Pho85. Consistent with this, cold exposure triggers a specific program of neutral lipids and PLs changes. Furthermore, we identified Pho85 as playing a key role in controlling the synthesis of long-chain bases (LCBs) via the Ypk1-Orm2 regulatory circuit. We conclude that Pho85 orchestrates a coordinated response of lipid metabolic pathways that ensure yeast thermal adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiochemical pathways 3acold 3acold stress 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ainositols 3amembrane fluidity 3ametabolism 3aphosphates 3aphospholipids 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein kinases 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 3ayeasts 0aCer 0aCDK 0aCWI 0aDAG 0aDhC 0aDhS 0aDhS-1P 0aDPIP 0aICRE 0aLCBs 0aLCBPs 0aIPC 0aIPs 0aIP3 0aMAPK 0aNLs 0aPA 0aPC 0aPE 0aPG 0aPhC 0aPhS 0aPhS-1P 0aPI 0aPI(4,5)P2 0aPLC 0aPLs 0aPPIn 0aPS 0aSLs 0a5-PP-IP4 0a1-PP-IP5/1-IP7 0aSE 0aSPT 0aLow temperature 0aPhosphoinositide 0a1-IP7 0aSphingolipid 0aPhospholipid 0aSphingoid bases 0aTriacylglyceride 0aTORC2-Pkh1-Ypk1 signaling module 0aOrm21 aEstruch, Francisco1 aCórcoles-Sáez, Isaac1 aDel Poeta, Maurizio1 aRieger, Robert1 aStenzel, Irene1 aRandez-Gil, Francisca0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Feb., v. 1865, no. 2 p.158557-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2019.1585573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009100174300001600265520177000281592002802051650001302079650002102092650001202113650002602125650003002151653000802181653000802189653001002197653000902207653000802216653000802224653001102232653000702243653000802250653000802258653003002266653001202296653004402308653002602352653001302378653001902391700002102410700001702431700002102448700002202469773009202491856008502583852000902668655001202677IND60606490920221121145848.0180726e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060649092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisentin, Jonathan10aCalibration free concentration analysis by surface plasmon resonance in a capture mode  ap. 478-485.  aSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) is the gold standard for determining rate and equilibrium constants of bimolecular complexes. Accuracy of these parameters depends on the correct determination of the concentration of the injected analyte. Calibration free concentration analysis (CFCA) has been developed to overcome the limitation of measuring protein concentrations spectroscopically, which may overestimate the fraction of the protein that really binds to the immobilized ligand, i.e. the active concentration. In this work, we demonstrate that CFCA can also be implemented in a capture format for measuring active concentrations. Capture CFCA (CCFCA) was first validated by measuring the concentration of a HLA-B*44:02 antigen solution. The active concentration of this molecule determined by CCFCA was similar to that obtained by covalent CFCA. CCFCA was then used to determine the concentration of the W6/32 pan class I HLA monoclonal antibody over three different HLA molecules captured by another specific antibody. This could not have been performed by covalent CFCA because immobilized HLA molecules cannot withstand regeneration. By exploring different capture levels we also show that CCFCA gives consistent results even at low capture levels. Knowing the active concentration of W6/32, we then determined the rate and equilibrium constants of W6/32-HLA complexes on the same flow cell. CCFCA is of general use for measuring active concentrations and of great interest for analytes recognizing ligands that cannot be covalently immobilized on sensor chips. The capture mode also allows determining the kinetic constants of multiple analyte-ligand complexes on the same flow cell. This increases experiments throughput and reduces sensor chip consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3achemical bonding 3aligands 3amonoclonal antibodies 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aB2m 0aBCA 0aCCFCA 0aCFCA 0aDSA 0aHLA 0amAb(s) 0aRU 0aSCK 0aSPR 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aCapture 0aCalibration free concentration analysis 0aSingle cycle kinetics 0aAffinity 0aHLA antibodies1 aMinder, Laetitia1 aLee, Jar-How1 aTaupin, Jean-Luc1 aDi Primo, Carmelo0 tTalanta.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 148 p.478-485dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245009200160500001900252520156000271592002801831596004601859596009101905650001701996650001002013650002302023650001802046650000902064650001702073650001102090650001602101650001502117650002202132700002202154700002802176700001902204700006102223773009602284856007602380852000902456655001202465IND60701182020221119234642.0200707e20200622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070118202DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/88627382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalari, Nader10aAflatoxin M1 in Milk Worldwide from 1988 to 2020: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground. Aflatoxins are found in various types of food and animal feed. Food contamination with aflatoxin toxin is of particular importance today. Various studies have reported different prevalence of aflatoxin M1 in animal milk. Therefore, due to the importance of this toxin, its role in health, and lack of general statistics about it worldwide, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of aflatoxin M1 in milk worldwide with a systematic review and meta-analysis study. Methods. In this review study, national and international databases were extracted from SID, MagIran, IranMedex, IranDoc, Embase, ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science (ISI) between January 1988 and February 2020. A random effects model was used for analysis, and heterogeneity of studies with an I² index was investigated. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 2). Results. The prevalence of aflatoxin M1 in milk worldwide from January 1988 to February 2020 in 122 articles with a sample size of 18921 was 79.1% (95% CI: 75.5–82.3%). Regarding the heterogeneity based on metaregression, there was a significant difference between the effect of the year of study (p≤0.001) and sample size (p≤0.001) with the prevalence of aflatoxin M1 in animal milk. Conclusion. The results of this study show that the prevalence of aflatoxin M1 in milk is high worldwide. Therefore, considering the importance of the milk group and its products, special measures should be taken to protect the ration from aflatoxin molds and milk quality.  aPublisher supplied data  cKermanshah University of Medical Sciences  a3009778cDeputy for Research and Technology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences 3aaflatoxin M1 3afeeds 3afood contamination 3ameta-analysis 3amilk 3amilk quality 3amodels 3asample size 3astatistics 3asystematic review1 aKazeminia, Mohsen1 aVaisi-Raygani, Aliakbar1 aJalali, Rostam1 aMohammadi, Masoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5722-83000 tJournal of food quality.g2020 June 22, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88627383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245016900189300001600358520074100374592002801115650002201143650001401165650001901179650001401198650002201212650001201234650001801246650002001264650001001284650000901294650001601303650000801319650001001327650001701337650002701354650005701381650003801438650001301476650004001489650003801529650001701567650001701584650004201601650003901643650000901682650002601691700001701717700001801734773010801752856004801860852000901908655001201917IND4482528320221119155133.0120907e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448252832DNAL7 a225434142pmid7 a10.1007/s10142-012-0279-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuoki, Richard Chalo12aA shared response of thaumatin like protein, chitinase, and late embryogenesis abundant protein3 to environmental stresses in tea [Camellia sinensis (L.)

A common response of thaumatin like protein, chitinase, and late embryogenesis abundant protein3 across four stresses suggests these to be useful targets to generate “drought stress proof” tea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3abeverages 3acDNA libraries 3achitinase 3acomplementary DNA 3adrought 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheat 3asalt stress 3atea 3atrees 3awater stress 2aAdaptation, Biological 2aCamellia sinensisxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aChitinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDroughts 2aExpressed Sequence Tagsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSoil 2aStress, Physiological1 aPaul, Asosii1 aKumar, Sanjay0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2012 Aug., v. 12, no. 3 p.565-571dSpringer-Verlagx1438-793X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-012-0279-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03792naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002700188245008800215300001200303506007600315520161300391592002802004596004202032596007302074506003702147650001602184650001602200650002202216650002002238650003202258650001302290650001102303650002402314650001502338650001302353650001502366650002802381650001102409650001002420650002002430650003302450650000902483650001302492650001702505650002302522650001602545650002602561650001502587650002302602650002002625650001802645650002602663650001102689651001302700700002002713700002902733700002302762700001702785700002302802700001902825700001802844773011702862856008202979852000903061655001203070IND60671502320221207092256.0220411e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067150232DNAL7 a315883882pmid7 aPMC67544912pmcid7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1892-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalid, Nurshafika Abd10aInsights into microbial community structure and diversity in oil palm waste compost  ap. 364.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEmpty fruit bunch (EFB) and palm oil mill effluent (POME) are the major wastes generated by the oil palm industry in Malaysia. The practice of EFB and POME digester sludge co-composting has shown positive results, both in mitigating otherwise environmentally damaging waste streams and producing a useful product (compost) from these streams. In this study, the bacterial ecosystems of 12-week-old EFB-POME co-compost and POME biogas sludge from Felda Maokil, Johor were analysed using 16S metagenome sequencing. Over ten phyla were detected, with Chloroflexi being the predominant phylum, representing approximately 53% of compost and 23% of the POME microbiome reads. The main bacterial lineage found in the compost and POME was Anaerolinaceae (Chloroflexi) with 30% and 18% of the total gene fragments, respectively. The significant differences between compost and POME communities were abundances of Syntrophobacter, Sulfuricurvum and Coprococcus. No methanogens were identified due to the bias in general 16S primers to eubacteria. The preponderance of anaerobic species in the compost and high abundance of secondary metabolite fermenting bacteria is due to an extended composting time, with anaerobic collapse of the pile due to the tropical heat. Predictive functional profiles of the metagenomes using 16S rRNA marker genes suggest that the presence of enzymes involved in degradation of polysaccharides such as glucoamylase, endoglucanase and arabinofuranosidase, all of which were strongly active in POME. Eubacterial species associated with cellulytic methanogenesis were present in both samples.  aPublisher supplied data  a4B297cMinistry of Education Malaysia  aBB/P027717/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChloroflexi 3aCoprococcus 3aElaeis guineensis 3aSyntrophobacter 3aalpha-N-arabinofuranosidase 3abacteria 3abiogas 3acommunity structure 3acomposting 3acomposts 3aecosystems 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afruits 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3aheat 3aindustry 3ametagenomics 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3aoil mill effluents 3apolysaccharides 3aribosomal RNA 3asecondary metabolites 3asludge 3aMalaysia1 aRajandas, Heera1 aParimannan, Sivachandran1 aCroft, Laurence J.1 aLoke, Stella1 aChong, Chun Shiong1 aBruce, Neil C.1 aYahya, Adibah0 t3 Biotech.g2019 Oct., v. 9, no. 10 p.364-364dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1892-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010400161520185000265592002802115650001102143650001902154650001102173650001702184650001202201650001902213650001502232650001202247650001402259650002202273650001102295650001902306650001502325651002202340700002402362700002802386700002002414773012002434856007302554852000902627655001202636IND60751541920221121013520.0210925e20210825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075154192DNAL7 a10.3390/f120911522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiltiadou, Milto 10aDo People Understand and Observe the Effects of Climate Crisis on Forests? The Case Study of Cyprus  aRecent reports stress the vulnerability of forest ecosystems in the European Union (EU), especially in the south. Cyprus is an island in the south of EU and the eastern of the Mediterranean Sea. While Cyprus’ vulnerability is stressed, Cyprus was included in the worst-performing countries regarding EU carbon emission’s targets of 2020. For mitigating climate change, Cyprus could benefit for tailored education and improved policy making. This study analyses the perceptions of the Cypriot residents about climate change and forest degradation aiming (1) to gain a better understanding of whether Cypriot residents understand its importance, (2) to understand if the general public is able to observe the changes noted in the literature, (3) to understand how perceptions are differentiated across different demographic categories, and (4) to derive correlations between demographic data and perceptions. This is a quantitative study; a questionnaire was used as a tool and the responses received were 416. It was highlighted that 65.62% of the participants stated that they noticed moderate to very much degradation of Cypriot coniferous forests. A potential degradation reason was written down by 150 people, of whom 31.33% referred to tree die-back, while many stated decreased soil moisture and difficulty in regeneration. All these reasons of degradation were either stated or suspected in the literature. Additionally, the demographic analysis showed that there may be an association between employability and beliefs/observations about climate change. The results of the research could be used for tailored education, further research, and promoting environmentally friendly policies. This will support Cyprus and other countries in reaching their Green Deal targets and, consequently, mitigate the severe effects of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprus 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ademography 3adieback 3aeducation 3aissues and policy 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3asoil water 3aMediterranean Sea1 aAntoniou, Efrosyni 1 aTheocharidis, Christos 1 aDanezis, Chris 0 tForests.g2021 Aug. 25, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120911523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245008800185300001600273520147500289592002801764650002001792650002401812650002201836650001601858650002001874650001801894650001801912650001601930650001501946650000901961650004301970650001402013650001202027650001802039650001602057650003802073650001102111650003002122650003002152650002902182650002802211650003802239650000902277650002302286650004402309650004002353650004702393650001802440700001702458773007902475856008202554990002302636852000902659655001202668IND60094343320221117174052.0141104e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009434332DNAL7 a223706062pmid7 a10.1016/j.cyto.2012.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wei-Hua10aUp-regulation of IL-33 expression in various types of murine cells by IL-3 and IL-4  ap. 267-273.  aThe crucial roles of the novel cytokine IL-33 in allergic, inflammatory, infectious and autoimmune diseases are becoming characterized. However, the cytokines which regulate IL-33 expression and secretion are still largely unknown. In this study, IL-3 and IL-4 were found to up-regulate IL-33 mRNA expression in mouse peritoneal exudate cells by a two-color DNA microarray and further confirmed by real time PCR and ELISA. IL-3 and IL-4 synergistically promote IL-33 mRNA expression and IL-33 intracrine in the heterogeneous cell populations as peritoneal exudates cells, bone marrow cells and splenic cells. IL-3 and IL-4 also induced IL-33 introcrine in the peritoneal exudate cells from the macrophage-deficient op/op mice, suggesting that macrophage is not the only target of IL-3 and IL-4 in the heterogeneous peritoneal exudate cells. Furthermore, IL-3 and IL-4 were verified to promote the IL-33 intracrine in the homogeneous cell population as fibroblasts and mast cells. These results indicate that up-regulation of IL-33 expression by IL-3 and IL-4 is not a feature particular to a specific type of cells. Up to 100 cytokines were screened, but none of them stimulated the secretion or release of IL-33 in the culture system. In summary, we confirm for the first time that IL-3 and IL-4 are critical for IL-33 intracrine in murine cells of various types, indicating that IL-3 and IL-4 may play an important role in the constitutive expression of IL-33 in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA microarrays 3aautoimmune diseases 3abone marrow cells 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3ainterleukin-3 3ainterleukin-4 3amacrophages 3amast cells 3amice 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aInterleukin-3xphysiology 2aInterleukin-4xphysiology 2aInterleukinsxmetabolism 2aIonomycinxpharmacology 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTetradecanoylphorbol Acetatexpharmacology 2aUp-Regulation1 aHu, Zhi-Qing0 tCytokine.g2012 May, v. 58, no. 2 p.267-273dElsevier Ltdx1043-46667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.01.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012400167300001200291520166900303592002801972596007902000650002102079650001302100650001502113650001902128650002102147650002002168650001602188650002802204650002302232650001702255650001102272650002102283650001502304700002202319700002102341700006402362773014102426856008202567852000902649655001202658IND60608237420221117052742.0180904e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060823742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3928-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJesus, João M.10aComparison of Vegetative Bioremediation and Chemical Amendments for Non-calcareous Highly Saline-Sodic Soil Remediation  ap. 274.  aSalt-affected soils cover a wide area, limiting agricultural production worldwide. Several remediation options are available and include chemical and vegetative remediation, but several aspects of each process are not yet fully understood. Therefore, the goal of this work was to study the application of both techniques in a highly saline scenario and provide insights into the limits of the application of this technology. Two chemical amendments (CaSO₄ and CaCl₂) and two plant species (Juncus maritimus Lam. and Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald) were tested to remediate a non-calcareous soil with an electrical conductivity of 20 dS m⁻¹ (EC) and a sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of 45. Vegetative bioremediation experiments were performed under non-leaching conditions. As such, salts were redistributed and increased at the surface and decreased in depth due to capillary rise. In such conditions, there was no clear positive effect of plants on soil parameters. However, tested plants grew, accumulated, and excreted salts and sodium comparably to other research in the literature. Regardless, the obtained results suggest that plant salt uptake alone may not be sufficient for soil remediation, and therefore, other mechanisms may also play a significant role. As to chemical amendments, both chemicals used proved to be effective and reduced non-calcareous saline soil parameters to below threshold values of 4 dS m⁻¹ for EC and 7 for SAR. However, CaCl₂ was more effective and faster to remediate than CaSO₄, likely due to higher solubility. Therefore, CaCl₂ may be a viable, yet less tested, option for faster remediation processes.  aPublisher supplied data  aFCT - DFRH - SFRH/BD/84750/2012cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3aJuncus maritimus 3aSpartina 3aadsorption 3abioremediation 3acalcium chloride 3acalcium sulfate 3acapillarity 3aelectrical conductivity 3asaline sodic soils 3asaline soils 3asodium 3asoil remediation 3asolubility1 aDanko, Anthony S.1 aFiúza, António1 aBorges, Maria-Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4876-13540 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2018 Aug., v. 229, no. 8 p.274-274dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-018-3928-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245013500205300002000340500001900360520134500379592002801724650001501752650001001767650001901777650002101796650001501817650001101832650003101843650002301874650001201897650001901909650002001928650001301948700001701961773017301978856008002151852000902231655001202240IND60720687120221120064451.0201216e20201204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072068712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c047682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Hyungwoong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6862-789210aEquilibrium Theory Analysis of Vacuum Swing Adsorption for Separation of Ethanol from CO₂ in a Beverage Dealcoholization Process  ap. 21948-21956.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, a vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) process was designed to recover ethanol from a binary gas mixture of ethanol and CO₂. The VSA feed gas originates from the process of alcoholic beverage dealcoholization where ethanol is stripped off the standard beer by CO₂ flowing upward in the exchange column. The CO₂ recovery of the ethanol removal VSA has to be maintained as high as possible in order to improve the ethanol removal efficiency and reduce the energy consumption for both the vacuum pump and ethanol trap. To this end, an ethanol recovery four-step VSA unit using MFI zeolites was analyzed by equilibrium theory in which both non-linearity of ethanol isotherms and incomplete purging were taken into account. The theoretical study revealed that the extent of purging had to be slightly greater than its minimum usage to achieve maximum CO₂ recovery. In addition, the power consumption for evacuation and the process productivity per cycle were estimated. It turned out that, to minimize the specific power consumption, high desorption pressure and a low extent of purging would be favored. With a view of maximizing the process productivity per cycle, the extent of purging has to be large. At a high extent of purging, the specific energy consumption can be saved by having the VSA run at low desorption pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abeers 3acarbon dioxide 3adealcoholization 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aequilibrium theory 3aethanol 3aprocess design 3aspecific energy 3azeolites1 aLee, Ju Hyun0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Dec. 04, v. 59, no. 50 p.21948-21956dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c047683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245007000173300001300243520134800256592002801604650001301632650001101645650001101656650001201667650001501679650001501694650002801709650001301737650001701750650001101767650001501778650001001793650001101803700001501814773011301829856009001942852000902032655001202041IND60111752020221123004311.0150809s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011175202DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-384927-4.00001-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesniere, C.10aCarbonic Maceration Wines: Characteristics and Winemaking Process  ap. 1-15.  aInvented by Michel Flanzy in 1934, carbonic maceration involves placing the intact grape clusters into a closed tank with a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. The berries subsequently undergo an intracellular fermentation without yeast intervention. Complex changes occur during this process which entail the transformation of a small amount of sugar into alcohol (1.5–2% alcohol), the reduction of malic acid content by about half, and the generation of secondary products. Compared with wines produced by conventional techniques, carbonic maceration produces wines of distinctive character of superior quality possessing a harmonious balance. It can be used to generate a wide range of wines (red as well as rosé), to be drunk young or aged. The process is composed of four steps: vatting of intact berries, “maceration–fermentation,” pumping off, and pressing, followed by a second fermentation phase. Exchanges and interactions occur between grape berries, the gaseous atmosphere, and the must present at the bottom of the tank during the first step of the carbonic maceration winemaking process. Yeast fermentation starts at this stage, in the liquid phase, and continues throughout the second step as well, with the malolactic fermentation. The specific conditions required for a good handling of carbonic maceration are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acarbon 3agrapes 3aliquids 3amaceration 3amalic acid 3amalolactic fermentation 3apressing 3asmall fruits 3asugars 3awinemaking 3awines 3ayeasts1 aFlanzy, C.0 tAdvances in food and nutrition research.g2011, v. 63 p.1-15dElsevier Science & Technologyx1043-45267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-384927-4.00001-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01433naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015500166300001100321500002200332520021700354592002800571650001300599650002600612650002200638700002200660700002000682700001900702700002700721700002200748700002400770700002000794700002300814700002300837773010800860856008200968852000901050655001201059IND60675177120221119164458.0201024e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067517712DNAL7 a10.1186/s13750-019-0179-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoulas, Anaïs10aCorrection to: What are the effective solutions to control the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the environment?

Thus, the aim of this article is to investigate when and why the current debate on forest property rights came about, and its resemblance to discussion in an ‘echo-chamber’. This refers to an arena in which information is accessed from limited sources and a small number of actors with ideological homogeneity may exert substantial influence and reinforce established opinions. Hence, it may spread disinformation, increase polemic tensions, and hamper deliberative policy processes in society. We assess the resemblance by identifying where the issue is debated in printed news media, the active actors, the interests they represent and how they problematize property rights, i.e. the claims they make and the claims’ homogeneity. Our results show that the debate has intensified in recent years, but several issues are not new. The debate is mainly limited to the Swedish rural business press and rural conservative press. Moreover, the main claim-makers are representatives of land and forest owner organizations, and members of agrarian and conservative political parties, which have close organizational and individual connections, thereby forming a metaphorical ‘chamber’. The ‘echo’ consists of repetitive claims about withdrawal and management rights, with no efforts to examine and contextualize complex aspects of private property rights in a changing society. The debate about forest ownership in an echo-chamber is problematic in several ways. It hampers efforts of claim-makers in the chamber to reach out, undermines current systems’ legitimacy, and locks important questions about sustainable forestry and property rights into a narrow societal sphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aforest ownership 3aforests 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3alandowners 3apolitics 3aproperty rights 3asustainable forestry 3aSweden 0aForestry 0aConservation policy 0aEcho-chamber 0aForest property rights 0aPrinted press1 aMårald, Erland,0 tForest policy and economics.g2020 Feb., v. 111 p.102038-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2019.1020383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245011400210300001800324506007600342520095200418592002801370506003701398650002001435650001301455650002101468650002101489650002101510650001101531650001601542650001401558650001001572651001301582700002001595700002101615773009201636856005501728852000901783655001201792IND4501465720221207112012.0150416e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450146572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00361.x2doi7 aPMC15404062pmcid7 a164012792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Dongfeng10aMLE and Bayesian Inference of AgeâDependent Sensitivity and Transition Probability in Periodic Screening  ap. 1056-1063.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis article extends previous probability models for periodic breast cancer screening examinations. The specific aim is to provide statistical inference for age dependence of sensitivity and the transition probability from the disease free to the preclinical state. The setting is a periodic screening program in which a cohort of initially asymptomatic women undergo a sequence of breast cancer screening exams. We use age as a covariate in the estimation of screening sensitivity and the transition probability simultaneously, both from a frequentist point of view and within a Bayesian framework. We apply our method to the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York study of female breast cancer and give ageâdependent sensitivity and transition probability density estimates. The inferential methodology we develop is also applicable when analyzing studies of modalities for early detection of other types of progressive chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3abiometry 3abreast neoplasms 3achronic diseases 3ahealth insurance 3amodels 3aprobability 3ascreening 3awomen 3aNew York1 aRosner, Gary L.1 aBroemeling, Lyle0 tBiometrics.g2005 Dec., v. 61, no. 4 p.1056-1063dBlackwell Publishingx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00361.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002100148245012100169300001600290520157800306592002801884650002101912650001601933650001901949650001701968650001501985650001202000650001702012650001302029650001602042650001702058650001702075650002102092650001702113650002702130700002402157700002102181700001902202700001502221700002302236700002202259773011402281856008402395852000902479655001202488IND4456601820221117210852.0141111e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445660182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokuda, Yasunori10aBiosynthesis of proteins containing modified lysines and fluorescent labels using non-natural amino acid mutagenesis  ap. 402-407.  aThe preparation of posttranslationally modified proteins is required to investigate the function and structure of modified proteins. However, homogeneously modified proteins are not easily isolated from natural sources or prepared using modification enzymes. Non-natural amino acid mutagenesis has enabled us to incorporate modified amino acids into specific positions of proteins in both cell-free and in-cell translation systems using tRNAs that are aminoacylated with modified amino acids. Here, we developed a method of double incorporation of modified amino acids and fluorescent non-natural amino acids in a quantitative, position-specific manner to obtain modified and fluorescently labeled proteins. To introduce methyllysine, dimethyllysine, trimethyllysine, and acetyllysine, frameshift and amber suppressor tRNAs aminoacylated with modified lysines were synthesized by chemical aminoacylation and supplied to an Escherichia coli cell-free translation system. The immunodetection of the translation products indicated that the modified lysines were incorporated into streptavidin and histone H3 in a quantitative, position-specific manner. Calmodulin derivatives containing a fluorescent non-natural amino acid at the N-terminal region and modified lysines at the Lys115 position were also synthesized, and their binding activity to a calmodulin-binding peptide was analyzed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The results obtained here demonstrate that this method is useful in preparing and analyzing naturally occurring and non-natural modified proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3aaminoacylation 3abiosynthesis 3acalmodulin 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3ahistones 3amutagenesis 3aspectroscopy 3astreptavidin 3asuppressor genes 3atransfer RNA 3atranslation (genetics)1 aWatanabe, Takayoshi1 aHoriike, Kazushi1 aShiraga, Kaori1 aAbe, Ryoji1 aMuranaka, Norihito1 aHohsaka, Takahiro0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2011 Apr., v. 111, no. 4 p.402-407dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011100171520199100282592002802273650001902301650002002320650001702340650002502357650001202382650001502394650001802409650001202427650002402439650001502463650001202478650001202490650001702502650001202519651001202531653000902543653002202552653001402574653001102588653002002599653003102619653001502650773011202665856008502777852000902862655001202871IND60674955120221118235439.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067495512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2019.1020282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöthke, Margret10aImplementation of the European Timber Regulation by German importing operators: An empirical investigation  aIllegal logging causes damage to forests with consequences for climate, biodiversity, livelihoods and national economies. One of the causes is international trade driven by consumer-country demand. Since 2013, the European Timber Regulation (EUTR) prohibits the placement of timber and timber products from illegal sources on the European market. The implementation is still in progress in most EU Member States, and market operators are insufficiently aware of their respective duties.The study considers a causal chain necessary to result in the envisaged behaviour change of importing operators, i.e., a reduced import of timber products from illegal sources. Therefore, the extent to which importing operators meet the prerequisites of behaviour change (awareness, knowledge, compliance and change of timber trade activities) is analysed. Taking Germany as an example, an extensive survey is conducted on German importing operators. Operator characteristics are analysed to determine in how far the prerequisites of behaviour change are met.The study found gaps in the practical implementation process along the whole causal chain. While awareness, knowledge and compliance among importing operators in Germany is still low, those operators that show the envisaged behaviour changes cover the majority of total import value. The majority of operators import only small quantities of timber products, while a few operators dominate the market. Especially small operators outside the timber-related sector were found to be unaware of the EUTR and less often compliant. Their low information status hints on uneven information availability. Compliance was highest among larger enterprises, and those importing from risk countries.The study contributes to determining risk factors for better targeting gaps along the causal chain necessary for compliance with the EUTR, and the types of operators affected. Finally, needs and options for intervention and further research are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abehavior change 3abiodiversity 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate 3acompliance 3aforest damage 3aimports 3ainternational trade 3alivelihood 3alogging 3amarkets 3arisk factors 3asurveys 3aGermany 0aEUTR 0aTimber regulation 0aOperators 0aSurvey 0aIllegal logging 0aImplementation of policies 0aCompliance0 tForest policy and economics.g2020 Feb., v. 111 p.102028-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2019.1020283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015100164300001600315520138800331592002801719653002201747653002801769653001501797653000901812700001401821700001701835700002301852700001501875700001801890700001401908700001801922700001801940700001501958700001501973773012701988856008402115852000902199655001202208IND60128862020221122025613.0151116e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012886202DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-2585-41.5.9142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeparis, X.10aEfficacy of Permethrin-Treated Uniforms in Combination with DEET Topical Repellent for Protection of French Military Troops in Côte d’’Ivoire  ap. 914-921.  aIn 2000, 22,000 French military personnel were deployed overseas. The French military health service implemented a vector control strategy including personal protection by the use of permethrin preimpregnated battlefield uniforms (BFUs) and the application on the skin of a topical repellent (50% DEET). In 2000, French forces used an industrial process to impregnate cloth with permethrin by soaking it before cut-out of the BFU. A study was implemented in four experimental huts in Côte d’’Ivoire to assess the field efficacy of the impregnated BFUs and their resistance to washing. Taking into account the systematic variations in each variable in the field and using a modeling based on logistic regression and discriminant analysis, this study showed that after 6 h without reapplication, the protective effects of the use of DEET as skin repellent was not significant, perhaps due to the high density of Anopheles mosquitoes during the night catching sessions and an average time of effective repellency of <2 or 3 h in the field. The analysis also showed that the French process of industrial impregnation of permethrin of the BFU offered in 2000 some protection from mosquito bites but not enough to reduce significantly the incidence of malaria among nonimmune troops. No positive or negative interaction was noted when DEET and the impregnated BFUs were used together.  aPublisher supplied data 0aimpregnated cloth 0avector control strategy 0apermethrin 0aDEET1 aFrere, B.1 aLamizana, M.1 aN′′Guessan, R.1 aLeroux, F.1 aLefèvre, P.,1 aFinot, L.1 aHougard, J-M.1 aCarnevale, P.1 aGillet, P.1 aBaudon, D.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2004 Sept., v. 41, no. 5 p.914-921dEntomology Dept., B.P.

The disease mainly affected the stems and pods of sword beans that touched the ground. The stems that touched the ground were water-soaked at the start of the infection and rotted, slowly withered, and eventually died. White mycelia spread across the lesions, and numerous sclerotia formed on the petiole near the soil line. The sclerotia were globoid, 1–3 mm in diameter, and white to brown in color. Hyphae on PDA were 4–8 μm wide, and clamp connections were observed. Pathogenicity of isolated fungus on sword beans was confirmed according to Koch’s postulates. For molecular identification, we sequenced the entire ITS rDNA sequence of the causative fungus and analyzed its phylogenetic relationships. The fungi isolated from sword beans were in a clade r-1 containing the reference strains of A. rolfsii and S. delphinii. The 540-bp PCR amplicons corresponding to A. rolfsii-specific amplification were produced in all three isolates. Mycological characteristics, ITS rDNA sequencing, the species-specific PCR analysis, and pathogenicity in the host plant identified this fungus as Athelia rolfsii (Curzi) C.C. Tu & Kimbr. This is the first report of sclerotium rot on sword bean caused by A. rolfsii.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015R1A6A1A03031413cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aCanavalia gladiata 3aagricultural research 3abeans 3acolor 3afungi 3ahost plants 3ahyphae 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apetioles 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asclerotia 3asoil1 aKang, Dong-Wan1 aLee, Yeyeong1 aKang, Byeongsam1 aChoi, Okhee1 aSon, Daeyoung1 aKim, Jinwoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1104-80880 tAustralasian plant disease notes.g2022 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.22-22dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:2225x1833-928X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13314-022-00468-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007700170300001400247520105600261592002801317650002701345650001301372650001101385650001301396650001601409650002801425650001001453650001601463650002101479650001101500650001601511650001101527650001401538650001201552650001201564650002501576700002201601700002401623700002301647700002101670773010201691856008401793852000901877655001201886IND60084005420221121065334.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008400542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2011.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbersbach, Tine10aXylo-oligosaccharides inhibit pathogen adhesion to enterocytes in vitro  ap. 22-27.  aWe previously reported that the non-digestible carbohydrates inulin and apple pectin promoted Listeria monocytogenes infection in guinea pigs, whereas xylo- and galacto-oligosaccharides (XOS and GOS), prevented infection by this pathogen. In the present study, mechanisms that could explain the previous in vivo observations were explored. Mixing bacterial cultures with XOS significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the ability of two out of three strains of L. monocytogenes to adhere to Caco-2 cells. Additionally, 2 h incubation with XOS followed by washing of the bacteria significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the ability of all three strains to adhere to Caco-2 cells. Consistently, expression of the adhesion-relevant genes inlA and lap was reduced by the presence of XOS. The observation that XOS inhibit the adhesion of Listeria to the intestinal epithelium in vitro may explain the reported preventive effect of XOS on Listeria infection in guinea pigs in vivo, while the preventive effect of GOS was not explicable by the assays chosen here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aadhesion 3aapples 3abacteria 3aenterocytes 3agalactooligosaccharides 3agenes 3aguinea pigs 3ahuman cell lines 3ainulin 3alisteriosis 3amixing 3apathogens 3apectins 3awashing 3axylooligosaccharides1 aAndersen, Jens Bo1 aBergström, Anders,1 aHutkins, Robert W.1 aLicht, Tine Rask0 tResearch in microbiology.g2012 Jan., v. 163, no. 1 p.22-27dElsevier Masson SASx0923-25087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2011.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01747naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245015900162300001400321520075300335592002801088650002001116650001101136650001401147650002301161650001101184650002101195650001601216650001201232773010501244856007501349852000901424655001201433IND60637547820221120231413.0190419e20131220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063754782DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1980.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowak, Tomasz J.10aEffect of gibberellin, auxin and kinetin treatments combined with foliar applied NPK on the yield of Capsicum annuum L. fruits and their capsaicin content  ap. 81-92.  aThe Wrocław version of hydroponic culture was applied.

In both species morphactin strongly stimulated production of wood but xylary differentiation was abnormal. Cellular differentiation was altered in that vessels were considerably smaller on transverse section and shorter than normal. Fibers and tracheids were also much ,shorter. It appeared that all cell types were disorientated from their longitudinal axis. It is probable that the effect of morphactin is caused by an inhibition of basipetal auxin transport and by the disturbance of general cell polarity during cambial divisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpinus betulus 3aSyringa vulgaris 3aauxins 3acambium 3acell differentiation 3acell polarity 3atracheids 3awood1 aSaniewski, M.1 aPieniążek, J.,1 aPhelps, J.

For this purpose, the MP was added to the cement paste to replace up to 15% of the cement's weight. Waste MP was extracted as the byproduct from the production of marble in an aggregate quarry in Algeria. The most relevant physical and chemical properties of ordinary PC and MP were determined. The standard consistency, setting time, apparent density, compressive strength and porosity were studied using the methanol exchange method at 3, 7, 28 and 65 days. The results of this study indicate that the partial replacement of ordinary PC with MP affects the physical and mechanical properties of air-cured blended cement paste. Finally, detailed microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy was performed to confirm the obtained macroscopic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acement 3acompression strength 3amechanical properties 3amethanol 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporosity 3aquarries 3arelative humidity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awastes 3aAlgeria 0aMarble powder 0aCement paste 0aCleaner production 0aCompressive strength 0aPorosity 0aScanning electron microscopy1 aMellas, Mekki1 aSadowski, Łukasz1 aŻak, Andrzej,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 May 10, v. 183 p.858-868dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.2673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100001800191245005700209506007600266506003100342520110000373592002801473596004501501506003701546650001601583650002101599650001201620650001601632650001101648650001401659650001301673650001001686650001601696653003301712653002001745653001801765653002401783653002401807653002301831700002001854773012701874856008502001852000902086655001202095IND60674955420221207105907.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067495542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2019.1020302chorus7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2019.1020302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Peichen10aImpacts of forest tax under timber price uncertainty  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aWe examine the effect of forest taxes on the optimal harvest decision and the forest land value using an adaptive optimization framework– the stand is harvested when the stumpage price is equal or higher than an age-dependent reservation price. We prove that the site value tax or site productivity tax does not change the optimal reservation prices; the timber value tax reduces the optimal reservation prices; the yield tax increases the optimal reservation prices when the non-timber benefits are increasing with stand age, or when they are independent of the stand age and the regeneration cost is positive; and the unit harvest tax increases the reservation prices when stand age is relatively high and could reduce the reservation price when stand age is low. Numerical results show that the optimal harvest age is only sensitive to the unit and timber value tax. The tax burden is reduced for all types of taxes except the site value tax. Under a taxation budget constraint, recognition of stumpage price uncertainty may change forest owners’ preferences for different types of taxes.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aforest land 3aforest ownership 3aforests 3aland values 3aprices 3astand age 3astumpage 3ataxes 3auncertainty 0aAdaptive management strategy 0aForest taxation 0aHartman model 0aNon-timber benefits 0aOptimal harvest age 0aReservation prices1 aSusaeta, Andres0 tForest policy and economics.g2020 Feb., v. 111 p.102030-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2019.1020303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245014400199300002000343500001900363520183900382592002802221650001302249650001202262650001402274650001502288650001302303650001202316650001402328650002402342650001102366650001202377650001902389650001502408650001902423700002602442700001702468700002502485773017302510856008002683852000902763655001202772IND60720687620221120055312.0201216e20201207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072068762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c052442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5094-622210aOxidative Coupling of Light Alkanes to Liquid Fuels Using Isobutane as an Oxygen Carrier and the Alkane Structure–Reactivity Relationship  ap. 21630-21641.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA process scheme for the liquid-phase oxidative coupling of light alkanes (C₃–C₇) to transportation fuels using isobutane as the oxygen carrier is devised. The process consists of (1) liquid-phase oxidation of isobutane to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), with tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) coproduct; (2) converting TBHP and TBA over an acid catalyst to di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP); (3) using DTBP to generate alkyl radicals from the feed alkane, which are coupled to form heavier alkanes, with TBA as coproduct; and optionally (4) regeneration of isobutane from TBA via dehydration–hydrogenation. Light alkane coupling to heavier alkanes using DTBP, a critical step in this scheme, is experimentally demonstrated. Prototype jet and diesel products derived from n-pentane coupling show excellent low-temperature properties, reasonable cetane numbers, satisfactory oxidation stability, and attractive density, all consistent with the branched products as a result of alkyl radical coupling. The relative reactivity of primary (1°), secondary (2°), and tertiary (3°) C–H bonds in alkanes toward hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) by tert-butoxy radical has been determined: 1° (1) < 2° (9) < 3° (29) at 150 °C. Relative reactivity of a feed can be estimated based on the number and the relative reactivity of each type of C–H bond in the feed alkane or alkane mixtures. The coupling efficiency, defined as the rate ratio of HAA vs β-scission of tert-butoxy radical (kₐ/kb), is found to correlate linearly with the reactivity estimated from the structure of the feed alkane. With this correlation, the coupling efficiency for a given alkane or alkane mixture can be estimated from the structure of the alkane(s), which will provide guidance to optimize the alkane coupling reaction for eventual large-scale applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abutanes 3acatalysts 3acoproducts 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3aoxygen 3apentane 3aprocess design 3aprototypes 3atransportation1 aMitchell, Jonathan E.1 aHo, Suzzy C.1 aWalker, Elizabeth L.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Dec. 07, v. 59, no. 50 p.21630-21641dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c052443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009000163300001400253520108500267592002801352650001001380650001601390650001801406650000901424650001601433650001601449650001401465653001801479653001601497653002101513653003601534653001301570700002301583773009801606856007701704852000901781655001201790IND60519731620221122040111.0160510e20131231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051973162DNAL7 a10.2478/ata-2013-00162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHlaváč, Peter10aEffect of Temperature and Used Ingredients on Rheological Parameters of Pancake Dough  ap. 63-66.  aThis paper presents the selected rheological properties of pancake dough such as dynamic and kinematic viscosity and fluidity. The effect of used ingredients and temperature on rheological properties is investigated. Measurements were performed on three pancake dough samples. In two samples, there was used milk with a different fat content, and in the third sample, all ingredients were in a powder state. A digital rotational viscometer Anton Paar DV-3P was used for measuring the rheological properties. The principle of viscometer measurement is based on the dependence of sample resistance to probe rotation. Results of measurements are shown as graphical dependencies of rheological parameters on temperature. Exponential functions were used to express the dependencies of all rheological parameters on temperature. Dynamic and kinematic viscosity decreased, and fluidity increased with temperature. The highest values of dynamic viscosity were obtained for pancake dough from powder ingredients. A higher fat content of used milk caused higher values of dynamic viscosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adough 3aingredients 3alipid content 3amilk 3atemperature 3aviscometers 3aviscosity 0apancake dough 0atemperature 0aused ingredients 0adynamic and kinematic viscosity 0afluidity1 aBožiková, Monika0 tActa technologica agriculturae.g2013 Dec. 31, v. 16, no. 3 p.63-66dVersitax1335-25557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ata-2013-00163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009500169300001600264520151800280592002801798650000801826650002301834650001501857650002301872650002401895650001701919650002101936653002801957653002401985653002802009653002502037653001502062653002902077700002002106700001502126700001502141700001402156700001102170773009202181856008502273852000902358655001202367IND60606491620221121232058.0180726e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060649162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2016.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Xiaojing10aModulating fluorescence anisotropy of dye-labeled DNA without involving mass amplification  ap. 567-573.  aFluorescence anisotropy, known as a simple, homogeneous and cost-effective analytical technology, is an invaluable technique for studying the micro-environmental changes of the dye associated with the molecular interactions. An in-depth understanding of the variables affecting the fluorescence anisotropy signal can facilitate better experimental designs to effectively improve the analytical performance. This work is a follow-up effort in evaluating the factors that can significantly influence fluorescence anisotropy. We systematically studied fluorescence anisotropy of dsDNA with the changing length based on dye-DNA interactions, with the fluorophores in the end-labeling, the middle-site-labeling, and multiple number of labeling manners. The fluorescence anisotropy value and the base-pair response dynamic range could be expanded by labeling the fluorophores in the middle of dsDNA and increasing the number of labels on dsDNA. The C overhang configuration in the end-labeling manner could enhance the fluorescence anisotropy signal but not expand the base-pair response range. Results from all the labeling fluorophores reinforced the leveling-off effect, i.e., the fluorescence anisotropy signal does not response to the increased length of the DNA duplex when the length is larger than a critical number of base pairs. These findings provide perspectives about choosing appropriate fluorescent dyes and labeling sites for simple and universal fluorescence anisotropy designs in various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical methods 3aanisotropy 3acost effectiveness 3aexperimental design 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 0aFluorescence anisotropy 0aDouble-stranded DNA 0aLeveling-off phenomenon 0aMiddle-site-labeling 0aC overhang 0aMutiple number of labels1 aHuang, Hongduan1 aChen, Yang1 aLi, Chenxi1 aLiu, Feng1 aLi, Na0 tTalanta.g2016 July 01, v. 154 p.567-573dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011100165300001600276520171300292592002802005650001902033650002002052650001302072650001302085650001402098650001102112650001502123650002502138650001402163650002502177650001202202650001902214651001402233651001602247653001902263653001702282653001702299653002002316653001602336653001502352653001402367653001302381653001402394700001502408700001402423700001602437773013102453856008502584852000902669655001202678IND60558932620221119104549.0161120e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055893262DNAL7 a10.1080/00288330.2016.11820342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodoy, DA14aThe spatio-temporal distribution and population structure of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in New Zealand  ap. 549-565.  aDespite being endangered internationally and protected nationally, little consideration has been given to the occurrence of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in New Zealand. New Zealand lies on the southern boundary of the distributional range of green turtles in the southwestern Pacific, with individuals found within these waters historically considered to be occasional visitors or stragglers incidentally carried by ocean currents. However, the present work shows that green turtles are present year round in New Zealand’s northern waters (c. 34°–38° S). A review of sighting, stranding and incidental capture data collected between 1895 and 2013 illustrate New Zealand’s green turtle population comprises post-pelagic immature juveniles to large subadults. The female:male sex ratio of 1.7:1 is similar to those reported from warm temperate foraging grounds in eastern Australia. A subsample of new recruits indicates green turtles recruit to neritic habitats at approximately 40.8 cm curved carapace length. This study suggests that New Zealand’s neritic habitats constitute a transitional developmental ground for post-pelagic immature green turtles. We observed an exponential increase in the number of documented records over time, though whether this is due to increased numbers of turtles or increased reporting rates, or both, is unclear and warrants further investigation. More broadly, this work provides a baseline understanding of the ecology of green turtles at the edge of their range, providing opportunities to investigate regional niche modelling and connectivity of this highly mobile species, while also monitoring broad-scale effects of climate-induced environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelonia mydas 3adata collection 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apopulation structure 3asex ratio 3aspatial distribution 3aturtles 3awater currents 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand 0aChelonia mydas 0adistribution 0agreen turtle 0aneritic habitat 0aNew Zealand 0apopulation 0asex ratio 0asighting 0astranding1 aSmith, ANH1 aLimpus, C1 aStockin, KA0 tNew Zealand journal of marine and freshwater research.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 50, no. 4 p.549-565dTaylor & Francisx1175-88057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2016.11820343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245008600162300001600248520141000264592002801674650001801702650001901720650001201739650001201751650001601763650001701779650003001796650001301826650002101839650002001860650001101880650001501891650001001906650001701916651001101933700002001944700002101964700002101985700001902006700002902025773013102054856007702185852000902262655001202271IND60559198620221121043925.0200415e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055919862DNAL7 a10.1657/AAAR0015-0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolken, Jane M.10aClimate-Growth Relationships Along a Black Spruce Toposequence in Interior Alaska  ap. 637-652.  aDespite its wide geographic distribution and important role in boreal forest fire regimes, little is known about the climate-growth relationships of black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.). We used site- and tree-level analyses to evaluate the radial growth responses to climate of black spruce growing on a north-facing toposequence in interior Alaska for the period A.D. 1949–2010. At the site level, correlations between growth and climate were negative for temperature and positive for precipitation. The signs and strengths of these correlations varied seasonally and over time. These site-level differences probably arise from tree interactions with non-climatic factors that vary with topography and include active layer thickness, soil temperature, solar radiation, microsite, and tree architecture. We infer that black spruce suffers from drought stress during warm, dry summers and that the causes of this moisture stress relate to topography and the seasonality of drought. Tree-level analyses reveal that divergent inter-tree growth responses among individual trees at the same site also occur, with the lower slope positions having the greatest frequency of mixed responses. The overall complexity of black spruce’s climate-growth relationships reflects the plastic growth strategy that enables this species to tolerate harsh, high-latitude conditions across a transcontinental range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3aboreal forests 3aclimate 3adrought 3afire regime 3aforest fires 3ageographical distribution 3alatitude 3asoil temperature 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3atopography 3atrees 3awater stress 3aAlaska1 aMann, Daniel H.1 aGrant, Thomas A.1 aLloyd, Andrea H.1 aRupp, T.

An Internet survey provides insight into western households' perceptions and preferences regarding water use and management, their familiarity with water terminology, and their WTP a fee in support of eight potential water initiatives regarding water acquisition, conservation, and reallocation. Further analysis identifies factors that influence the decision. Just over half of all respondents express a WTP the fee, with an estimated median WTP among survey respondents of $15.65 per summer month. Respondents with higher self‐reported water knowledge are more likely to support the fee. The probability of supporting the fee is also influenced by respondents' demographic characteristics and attitudes toward water scarcity and management. 3aInternet 3aattitudes and opinions 3ahouseholds 3aprobability 3asociodemographic characteristics 3astakeholders 3asummer 3asurveys 3aterminology 3awater allocation 3awillingness to pay1 aPritchett, James1 aGoemans, Christopher0 tCanadian journal of agricultural economics.g2010 Dec., v. 58, no. 4 p.497-514dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl44931x0008-39767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7976.2010.01195.x 7aarticle02624naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245015700163300001800320520122100338650001801559650001201577650001601589650001701605650001701622650001901639650003001658650003701688650001901725650002401744650002101768650001201789650002201801650001301823650002401836650002001860700001901880700001601899700001601915700001501931773017601946856004702122852000902169655001202178IND60579802320221121201620.0170901e20170705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057980232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b013382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xiaotong10aMethylseleninic Acid Prevents Patulin-Induced Hepatotoxicity and Nephrotoxicity via the Inhibition of Oxidative Stress and Inactivation of p53 and MAPKs  ap. 5299-5305.  aPatulin is one of the common food-borne mycotoxins. Previous studies have demonstrated that patulin can cause diverse toxic effects in animals including hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In the present study, we have addressed the protective effect of two forms of selenium compounds methylseleninic acid (MSeA) and sodium selenite on patulin-induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity using both in vitro and in vivo models. Results showed that MSeA at concentrations of 3–5 μM, not sodium selenite at the same concentrations, is capable of protecting against patulin-induced cytotoxicity in the cell culture model. Moreover, the hepatoprotective and nephroprotective effects of MSeA (2 mg/kg body weight, oral administration) on patulin-induced toxicity (10 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection) were also achieved in the animal model. A further mechanistic study revealed that the protective effect of MSeA on patulin-mediated toxicity is attributed to its ability to inhibit patulin-mediated ROS generation and inactivate p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Our findings support a possible usefulness of MSeA as a novel detoxicant to mitigate the toxicities of patulin. 3aanimal models 3aanimals 3abody weight 3acell culture 3acytotoxicity 3ahepatotoxicity 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anephrotoxicity 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3apatulin 3aprotective effect 3aselenium 3asignal transduction 3asodium selenite1 aZhang, Enxiang1 aYin, Shutao1 aFan, Lihong1 aHu, Hongbo0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 July 5, v. 65, no. 26 p.5299-5305dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals DivisionwJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b01338  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001500189245014300204300001600347500002400363520148500387650004201872650002001914650001701934650000901951650002101960650003001981650001202011650002302023650001702046650001202063650007602075650000902151650002902160650004002189650004402229650004902273650003902322650000902361650002402370650003802394650004602432650004602478653002102524700001402545700001302559700001702572700001302589700001402602700001302616773013502629852000902764856007602773930003302849945002502882946001102907655001202918IND4384972520221121201629.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438497252DNAL7 a170834622pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2006.00805.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8401 aNARITA, T.10aNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce hypermotilinemia and disturbance of interdigestive migrating contractions in instrumented dogs  ap. 569-577.  aIncludes references  aNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induce gastric ulcers due to inhibition of prostaglandin production. Prostaglandins have an influence on physiological gastrointestinal motility, but the relationships between NSAID-induced gastric ulcer, gastrointestinal motility and motilin are unknown. Fifteen dogs were allocated randomly to three groups in which either gelatin, meloxicam or indomethacin was administered. Fecal occult blood and gastrointestinal motility were monitored continuously for 6 days. In addition, analyses of the plasma motilin concentration, gastrointestinal endoscopy and gastric emptying, and detection of motilin cells were performed. Gastrointestinal motility was disturbed in the indomethacin group, presenting as disappearance of interdigestive migrating contractions (IMCs) 3 days before gastric ulcers were detected. Delayed gastric emptying and hypermotilinemia were observed significantly more often in the indomethacin group compared with the other groups. Motilin cell-crypt/villi ratio in the indomethacin group significantly decreased in the duodenum and jejunum, compared with the other groups. No significant changes in any tests were observed in the meloxicam group, when compared with the gelatin group. These findings suggest that the disturbance of IMCs caused by hypermotilinemia, with changes in motilin cell distribution, and delayed gastric emptying induced by indomethacin may contribute to the development of gastric ulcers. 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3adrug evaluation 3adog diseases 3adogs 3ain vitro studies 3agastrointestinal motility 3amotilin 3amuscle contraction 3aindomethacin 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aDogs 2aDuodenoscopyxveterinary 2aDuodenumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGastrointestinal Motilityxdrug effects 2aIndomethacinxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aJejunumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMotilinxmetabolism 2aStomach Ulcerxchemically induced 2aThiazinesxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aThiazolesxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 0ahypermotilinemia1 aOKABE, N.1 aHANE, M.1 aYAMAMOTO, Y.1 aTANI, K.1 aNAITO, Y.1 aHARA, S.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2006 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.569-577dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2006.00805.x3electronic resource  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/01/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03063naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001700181245007700198300001600275520121400291650001001505650003501515650001701550650002801567650001001595650001801605650001201623650001301635650003001648650001201678650001701690650001901707650001901726650000901745650001201754650001201766650002201778650001801800650001301818650002801831650003001859650004601889650002701935650002001962650002401982653002802006653002202034653002702056700001402083700001602097700001402113700001502127700001302142773008302155852000902238856008502247930003302332945002502365946001102390655001202401IND4375176920221121105126.0051013e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437517692DNAL7 a161743632pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299050009322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFeligini, M.12aA single nucleotide polymorphism in the sheep kappa-casein coding region  ap. 317-321.  aGenetic polymorphisms in CSN3 gene in Pag (Croatia), Sarda (Italy) and Pramenka (Serbia) sheep breeds were investigated. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was localized by sequence analysis (sequence submitted to GenBank under accession AY237637) relying on an original primer pair. Primers for sequencing (kappa-casF and kappa-casR) were designed on the available CSN3 sequences to amplify the genomic region encoding the major part of the mature protein (exon 4). An SNP was detected at position 237 of the sheep kappa-casein mRNA (reference sequence: GenBank X51822), where a thymine was substituted for a cytosine. The SNP was typed by conventional PCR and SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR. C and T alleles were discriminated using a dedicated set of primers that consisted of one common forward primer (SNP-TC) and two reverse primers (SNP-T and SNP-C), the latter two differing in the 3' end base and in the presence of a 12 bp poly-G tail in SNP-C. The SNP was found in both the heterozygous and the homozygous state in Sarda and Pramenka breeds, and in the heterozygous state only in the Pag breed. The observed allelic frequencies of the SNP were 0.12 in Pag, 0.27 in Sarda and 0.45 in Pramenka. 3asheep 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3akappa-casein 3aSardinian (sheep breed) 3aexons 3amessenger RNA 3athymine 3acytosine 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aalleles 3ahomozygosity 3aheterozygosity 3agene frequency 3aloci 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsxgenetics 2aDNAxanalysis 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSheepxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 0amolecular sequence data 0aPag (sheep breed) 0aPramenka (sheep breed)1 aVlaco, S.1 aCurik, V.C.1 aParma, P.1 aGreppi, G.1 aEnne, G.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 Aug., v. 72, no. 3 p.317-321x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299050009323Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/12/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02946naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245008200167300001600249520184100265650001302106650001902119650002102138650001802159650002102177650001802198650000902216650002002225650000902245650002002254653001502274653001102289700001402300773007602314852000902390856009202399930003302491945001302524946001102537655001202548IND2322387620221121105202.0010803e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232238762DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00536.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandak, B.10aFruit dispersal and seed banks in Atriplex sagittata: the role of heterocarpy  ap. 159-165.  a1. Atriplex sagittata, an arly succesional, annual species of disturbed habitats in Central Europe, produces three types of fruits. We studied the differences in dispersal between the fruit types in order to investigate their ecological roles. 2. The typical positive relationship between dispersal ability and germinability is not found in this species. Type A (ebracteate) fruits produced deeply dormant seeds and had the lowest dispersal potential, but of the two fruits with bracts, type B, with dormant seeds, was better dispersed by both water and wind than type C, which produces non-dormant seeds. 3. Wind, temperature and precipitation have significant effects on fruit release but their effects differ between fruit types. The release of fruit types with bracts was positively correlated with wind whereas all fruit types tended to be negatively correlated with precipitation and temperature range. 4. Type C fruit, which contains non-dormant seed, are absent from the soil in summer and have a Type II transient seed bank. Type A and B fruits, containing dormant seeds, form a persistent seed bank. 5. Heterocarpy, where fruit types show distinct ecological behaviour, enables colonizing species such as A. sagittata to survive both major disturbance (by ensuring that some seeds persist) and unfavourable conditions (by spreading germination over a long period). 6. In A. sagittata, seed dynamics can be explained by the germination behaviour of seeds produced by the three types of fruit. All fruit types mature in autumn, but few of Type A fall from the mother plant until spring, when germination is probably inhibited because of insufficient stratification. Type C fruit, however, show peak dispersal in winter and the majority of these non-dormant seeds are able to germinate as soon as conditions become more suitable. 3aAtriplex 3aseed dispersal 3aplant morphology 3aplant ecology 3aseed germination 3aseed dormancy 3awind 3aair temperature 3arain 3apioneer species 0aseed banks 0afruits1 aPysek, P.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Apr., v. 89, no. 2 p.159-165x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00536.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01619naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245009700152300001800249520038100267650002600648650002200674650002500696650001200721650003600733650004800769650001000817650001100827650003300838650003500871650001300906650001600919651001500935653002400950700001700974700001800991700001501009773009801024852000901122939003301131945000801164946001301172655001201185991614790810742620221121074935.0830307e198206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021282DNAL7 a69792092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, C.R.10aAmebic colitis: Correlation of proctoscopy before treatment and barium enema after treatment  ap. 1089-1093.  aEntamoeba histolytica, humans with amebic colitis successfully treated with metronidazole, pretreatment proctoscopic diagnostic findings correlated with posttreatment assessment of residual pathology as seen on barium enema, pretreatment proctoscopic patterns have definite predictive value and are useful in assessing severity of illness and in patient management: Bangladesh 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3adisease diagnosis 3aprotozoal infections 3acolitis 2aBarium Sulfatexdiagnostic use. 2aDysentery, Amebicxdiagnosisxdrug therapy. 2aEnema 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Mucosaxpathology 2aMetronidazolextherapeutic use 2aNecrosis 2aProctoscopy 3aBangladesh 0aPathology, Protozoa1 aGilman, R.H.1 aRabbani, G.H.1 aKoster, F.0 tAJR American Journal of Roentgenology.g1982 June, v. 138, no. 6 p.1089-1093x0361-803X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830307c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle01133naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245004100151300001600192520015400208650002500362650003900387650001000426650001800436650001100454650004400465650000900509650004500518651001500563700001900578700001500597773009600612852000900708939003300717945000800750946001300758655001200771991614790710742620221121055928.0830307e198210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021202DNAL7 a69819232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, R.K.J.10aPulmonary features of Kaposi sarcoma  ap. 659-660.  ahomosexual man with Kaposi sarcoma including pulmonary metastases, suspected associated Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, brief case review: California 3aPneumocystis carinii 3aacquired immunodeficiency syndrome 2aAdult 2aHomosexuality 2aHumans 2aLung Neoplasmsxradiographyxsecondary. 2aMale 2aSarcoma, Kaposixradiographyxsecondary. 3aCalifornia1 aHuberman, R.P.1 aVanley, G.0 tAJR American Journal of Roentgenology.g1982 Oct., v. 139, no. 4 p.659-660x0361-803X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830307c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle03625naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245013000165300001600295520218600311650001802497650001302515650001502528650001502543650001602558650001602574650002502590650001702615650001102632650001502643650001302658650001702671650002602688650001302714650001702727650001102744650001602755650001602771651002102787653001602808653001802824700001602842700001502858773007602873852000902949856009202958930003303050945001303083946001103096655001203107IND2322389320221121055903.0010803e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232238932DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00540.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeps, J.10aHabitat and successional status of plants in relation to the communities of their leaf-chewing herbivores in Papua New Guinea  ap. 186-199.  a1. The spatial distribution of 30 woody species (15 species each of Euphorbiaceae and Moraceae) and their associated leaf-chewing communities (Orthoptera, Phasmatodea, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) were studied in coastal, riverine and rain forest habitats. A successional series, from abandoned gardens to primary forest, was examined. Host plant records for more than 27000 insects, all verified by feeding experiments, and spatial distribution of almost 9000 plant specimens were evaluated. 2. Phylogenetic (taxonomic) relatedness of host plants explained 56% of the variability in the composition of their herbivore communities, while the ecological (distribution) similarity of plants explained only 4%. 3. The successional optimum of plant species was not an important determinant of the composition of their herbivore communities. 4. Neither plant successional optimum nor plant palatability to a generalist herbivore were correlated with the number of species, abundance or host specificity of its herbivores, nor was there a correlation between a plant's palatability to a generalist herbivore and its successional optimum. 5. Herbivore communities became dominated increasingly by a few abundant species in later stages of succession. 6. On average, Ficus species had lower palatability and supported more species of herbivores than species of Euphorbiaceae. The abundance of herbivores and their dominance index were not significantly different between the two plant families. 7. These results contradict several previous studies of successional trends in temperate regions. Many tropical successions, however, start with pioneer trees, rather than with annual herbs, and may present a permanent and predictable habitat for insects even at the earliest stages, with no advantage for polyphagous species. Numerous pioneer trees in the tropics possess anti-herbivore defences, resulting in their low palatability to generalists, increased host specificity of herbivores, and often idiosyncratic composition of herbivore communities. Even plant traits such as species richness of their herbivores or palatability may have a phylogenetic component which should not be ignored. 3aEuphorbiaceae 3aMoraceae 3aOrthoptera 3aColeoptera 3aLepidoptera 3aPhasmatidae 3aspatial distribution 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3aherbivores 3ahabitats 3arain forests 3aecological succession 3ataxonomy 3apalatability 3acoasts 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3aPapua New Guinea 0acommunities 0ariver valleys1 aNovotny, V.1 aBasset, Y.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Apr., v. 89, no. 2 p.186-199x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00540.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03275naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010100160300001600261520172700277650002102004650002902025650001702054650002502071650001602096650002302112650001302135650001502148650000902163650001902172650001702191650002502208650001502233650001602248650002202264650004802286650001302334650001502347650001402362650001302376700001702389700001702406700002002423700002002443700001902463700001802482773009502500852000902595856008502604930003302689946001102722655001202733IND4418090020221121060026.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441809002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-008-0158-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForni, C. 10aRole of transglutaminase 2 in quercetin-induced differentiation of B16-F10 murine melanoma cells  ap. 731-738.  aFlavonoids belong to the class of plant polyphenolic compounds with over 6,000 individual structures known. These phytochemicals have attracted the interest of the scientists, because they possess a remarkable spectrum of biological activities, such as antiallergic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. In this work, we compared the anticancer potential of two flavonoids, quercetin and pelargonidin, on highly metastatic B16-F10 melanoma murine cells. We have evaluated different parameters related to cell proliferation and differentiation, such as cell number, toxicity, intracellular content of polyamines and transglutaminase (TG, EC 2.3.2.13) activity. The higher inhibition of tumor cell growth, with respect to control, was obtained with quercetin cell treatment, i.e. 32% reduction after 48 h and 39% reduction after 72 h of incubation (P < 0.001). In parallel, quercetin-treated cells showed a similar decrease in polyamine content. TG activity was fourfold increased, with respect to control, after 48 h and twofold increased after 72 h (P < 0.001). Pelargonidin treatment did not show significant antiproliferative effects and any increase in TG activity. Proteomic approach was used to investigate changes in protein expression profiles in tumor cells following quercetin treatment. Changes in expression of 60 proteins were detected, i.e. 8 proteins were down-regulated, 35 up-regulated, 11 “de novo” synthetized proteins and 6 suppressed proteins were present in treated cells. A 80 kDa spot, identified as TG type 2 by Western blot analysis, presented a fourfold increase in intensity, confirming the key role played by TG in the induction of cancer cell differentiation. 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aantioxidants 3acell differentiation 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3amelanoma 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3apelargonidin 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyamines 3apolyphenols 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aquercetin 3atoxicity1 aBraglia, R. 1 aLentini, A. 1 aNuccetelli, M. 1 aProvenzano, B. 1 aTabolacci, C. 1 aBeninati, S. 0 tAmino acids.g2009 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.731-738dVienna : Springer Viennax0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-008-0158-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03855naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010300167300001600270520262300286650001402909650001902923650001302942650002702955650002502982650001203007650002603019650003003045650003003075651001603105653001803121700001703139700001503156700001303171700001503184773007603199852000903275856009203284930003303376945001303409946001103422655001203433IND2322390420221121060005.0010803e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232239042DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00538.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroppe, K.10aEffects of habitat fragmentation on choke disease (Epichloe bromicola) in the grass Bromus erectus  ap. 247-255.  a1. The fungal endophyte Epichloe bromicola causes choke disease on Bromus erectus, thereby suppressing maturation of host inflorescences. We conducted a 3-year field experiment to investigate the effects of small-scale habitat fragmentation on the occurrence of choke disease in three calcareous grasslands in the Swiss Jura Mountains, where, overall, 4.3% of all flowering tillers had diseased inflorescences. 2. The number of diseased B. erectus plants (presumed genets), the number of tillers with diseased inflorescences, and the number of tillers with healthy inflorescences were counted over 3 years, but healthy tillers could not be allocated to particular genets. Each of 12 blocks contained one large (4.5 x 4.5 m), one medium (1.5 x 1.5 m) and two small (0.5 x 0.5 m) fragments and corresponding control plots. The percentage of tillers in the plots that were infected but did not show disease symptoms (asymptomatic plants) was estimated in the final year of the study using a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction. On average 1.7% of all tillers without disease symptoms were infected. 3. There were significantly more diseased plants in fragment than in control plots, particularly in small fragment plots or in the third year of the study, indicating that disease incidence in the host plant increased after fragmentation if assessed at the level of the genet population. This was probably due both to a switch of genets from the asymptomatic to the symptomatic state and to increased horizontal transmission of the disease in fragments. 4. The increase in the number of flowering tillers with diseased inflorescences was out-weighed by that in the number of tillers with healthy inflorescences. Disease incidence was therefore decreased by fragmentation if assessed at the level of the host flowering tiller population. The effect on healthy plants was probably due to beneficial abiotic edge effects following fragmentation. 5. Plot size affected fragmentation response, with the largest increases in small, followed by medium and large fragments. Similarly, the strength of fragmentation responses increased through time over the 3-year study period. 6. Significant site to site and year to year variation in the number of diseased plants and in the number of tillers with diseased inflorescences suggested that separate experiments with replication within site and year would have yielded a series of interesting but individually different results. Only by repeating the experiments at several sites and over several years was it possible to obtain the general results reported in the previous points. 3ainfection 3aBromus erectus 3ahabitats 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aspatial distribution 3atillers 3afield experimentation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3afungal diseases of plants 3aSwitzerland 0afragmentation1 aSteinger, T.1 aSchmid, B.1 aBaur, B.1 aBoller, T.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Apr., v. 89, no. 2 p.247-255x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00538.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01368naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245008900150300001600239520016500255650002500420650001400445650003900459650002000498650001000518650003400528650001800562650001100580650000900591650004300600650003500643650003400678651001800712653002400730700001600754700001700770773009600787852000900883939003300892945000800925946001300933655001200946991614790140742620221121060040.0830307e198203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021152DNAL7 a69780132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodwin, J.D.10aFatal Pneumocystis pneumonia, cryptococcosis, and Kaposi sarcoma in a homosexual man  ap. 580-581.  aPneumocystis carinii, 29-year-old homosexual man, fatal Pneumocystis pneumonia associated with cryptococcosis and Kaposi sarcoma, clinical report: United States 3aPneumocystis carinii 3apneumonia 3aacquired immunodeficiency syndrome 3amixed infection 2aAdult 2aCryptococcosisxcomplications 2aHomosexuality 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPneumonia, Pneumocystisxcomplications 2aSarcoma, Kaposixcomplications 2aSkin Neoplasmsxcomplications 3aUnited States 0aPathology, Protozoa1 aRavin, C.E.1 aRoggli, V.L.0 tAJR American Journal of Roentgenology.g1982 Mar., v. 138, no. 3 p.580-581x0361-803X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830307c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02709naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245011500170300001600285520140600301650001901707650001601726650002201742650002601764650001701790650001901807650001401826650001001840650001001850650001101860650001101871650002201882650001001904650001001914650002101924651001101945651001201956700001601968700002101984773007602005852000902081856009202090930003302182945001302215946001102228655001202239IND2322389820221121060043.0010803e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232238982DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00556.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCowling, S.A.10aPalaeovegetation-model comparisons, climate change and tree succession in Scandinavia over the past 1500 years  ap. 227-236.  a1. We assess the robustness of a 1500-year palaeoclimate data base and forest gap model in simulating northern Scandinavian boreal forest succession since AD 500. We also evaluate trends in species abundance in a nemoral woodland in southern Scandinavia by comparing modelling results to palaeoecological data. 2. Simulated biomass trends for Picea, Pinus and Betula growing at Penningholmen (northern Sweden) are strikingly similar to those observed in the local pollen record, particularly in the replication of the early Little Ice Age (LIA) decline in Betula and the late-LIA dieback of Picea and Pinus. 3. LIA decreases in Betula may therefore be partly due to the effects of climate on its competitive interactions with Pinus, as well as the previously proposed effects of insect herbivory. 4. Simulations of Draved Forest (western Denmark), suggest that Tilia is under-represented in modern-day Scandinavian nemoral woodlands, and consequently that the present dominance of Fagus probably reflects strong human-plant interactions from as early as the beginning of the 17th century. 5. This study highlights the importance, despite general limitations associated with vegetation models, of model-data comparisons for understanding mechanisms and processes underlying past forest succession, and emphasizes the usefulness of forest models for reconstructing climate influences on past vegetation. 3aboreal forests 3apaleobotany 3asimulation models 3aecological succession 3aforest trees 3aclimate change 3awoodlands 3aPinus 3aPicea 3aBetula 3apollen 3aplant competition 3aTilia 3aFagus 3apaleoclimatology 3aSweden 3aDenmark1 aSykes, M.T.1 aBradshaw, R.H.W.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Apr., v. 89, no. 2 p.227-236x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00556.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01141naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245017600139300001600315500001500331520020800346650002800554653002400582653002100606653002400627700001400651700001600665773009500681852000900776939003300785945000800818946001300826655001200839991614789790742620221121055916.0830316e198210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchnitzerling, H.J.12aA comparative study of the reactivity of acetylcholinesterases of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus and cattle erythrocytes with organophosporus and carbamate inhibitors  ap. 216-225.  a2019-12-04  aBoophilus microplus (organophosphorus-susceptible and -resistant), comparative study of reactivity of acetylcholinesterases of ticks and cattle erythrocytes with organophosphorus and carbamate inhibitors 3aRhipicephalus microplus 0aBoophilus microplus 0aResistance, Drug 0aEnzymes, Arthropoda1 aNolan, J.1 aDavey, P.A.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g1982 Oct., v. 18, no. 2 p.216-225x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830316c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02525naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245011600171300001400287500002400301520114900325650002601474650002201500650001401522650001601536650001901552650001701571650003101588650001001619650001101629650001501640650001601655650002001671650002401691650002201715650001401737650001901751650001701770650001601787650001901803650001501822700002401837773012801861852000901989856005701998655001202055IND4456280820221121051040.0110408e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445628082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1992.tb01590.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, H.C.10aOrientation of males of sorghum midge, Contarinia sorghicola to sex pheromones from virgin females in the field  ap. 23-29.  aIncludes references  aThe orientation of males of the sorghum midge, Contarinia sorghicola Coq.

The number of males trapped decreased significantly after 1400 h; male catches continued till sunset. Trap catches followed the same pattern as the number of ovipositing females on sorghum panicles at the half-anthesis stage. Midge activity decreased with an increase in temperature and a decrease in relative humidity. Peak midge density was observed during the second fortnight of October in the rainy season and during February-March in the post-rainy season.

Stable carbon isotopic signatures, used to infer an organism's food source, indicated that methane can play a major role in the nutrition of chironomid larvae. However, the pathway of methane-derived carbon into invertebrate biomass is still not confirmed. It has been proposed that chironomid larvae ingest methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB), but this has not been experimentally demonstrated to date. Using ¹³C-labelled methane we could show for the first time that chironomid larvae assimilate methane-derived carbon through MOB. Chironomid larval biomass was significantly ¹³C-enriched after dwelling for 10 days in lake sediment enriched with labelled methane. Moreover, phospholipid fatty acids diagnostic for MOB were detected in larval tissue and were significantly ¹³C-enriched, which encompasses the ¹³C-uptake predicted for a methane-based nutrition. Additionally, chironomid larvae fed on sediment and water-column derived MOB biomass. 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abiomass 3acarbon 3afatty acids 3afood webs 3afoods 3alakes 3alarvae 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanotrophs 3anutrition 3asediments 2aAnimals 2aBiomass 2aCarbon Isotopesxmetabolism 2aChironomidaexmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFood Chain 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiology 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aLarvaxmetabolism 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aPhospholipidsxmetabolism1 aBodelier, Paul L.E.1 aEller, Gundula0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2007 May, v. 9, no. 5 p.1126-1134dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01235.x 7aarticle01982naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115072001700133100002000150245020800170300001600378520022000394650003500614650003000649650002500679650001200704650004300716650004400759650004000803650003200843650002000875650004500895650002900940650004500969650001001014650003301024650003201057650003801089650003901127650005001166653002101216653002501237700001901262700001901281700001501300773008801315852000901403930003301412945000801445946001101453655001201464991614787790742620221121035447.0830304e198111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830020782DNAL7 a73422232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Because P is a stable element, the total P accumulated in manure may be determined by mass balance. In this study, total body P content of cull sows was chemically determined in order to facilitate more accurate P mass balance calculations for swine breeding herd farms. Fifteen sows were removed from a central Michigan swine breeding herd, following normal farm culling protocol, and slaughtered. Each sow's blood, viscera including digesta and carcass were individually processed and sampled such that each sow's individual components and each sow's total body content for protein, fat, ash, and nine minerals, including P, were analyzed. Average P content of the 15 cull sows was 0.563% P. A P mass balance model for an example 2,400-sow case farm using this value for cull sows, and those reported in the literature for other specific stages of production at the time when animals enter or depart the farm, were used to estimate annual accumulation of P 2 O 5 in manure. The P mass balance model using stage-specific, chemically-determined values, estimated there would be 29,751-kg manure P 2 O 5 accumulated annually by this farm, 9% to 31% greater than other estimates made using currently available methods. A nutrient management plan developed using a mass balance model with stage-specific, chemically-determined total or whole body P requires a larger land base, but that estimation reduces the risks of P accumulating in the soil and future restrictions on the use of that land for manure applications because of high soil P levels. 3aanimal organs 3ablood 3abody composition 3afarms 3aherds 3aland use 3alaws and regulations 3alivestock breeding 3amanure spreading 3aminerals 3amodels 3anutrient management 3aphosphorus 3aprotein content 3arisk 3asoil 3asows 3aMichigan1 aRozeboom, D.W.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2008, v. 24, no. 6 p.767-772x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01824naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097040001800132100001900150245014300169300001400312520092100326650001201247650001401259653004001273700001701313773009501330852000901425856004801434939003301482945000801515946001101523655001201534991614786710742620221121015332.0830304e198203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830020672DNAL7 a10.1017/S0022149X000349452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddiqui, A.A.10aKinetic and electrophoretic studies on acid and alkaline phosphatases of the metacercariae of Clinostomum complanatum (Trematoda: Digenea)  ap. 17-22.  aHomogenates of the metacercariae of Clinostomum complanatum showed two peaks for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate at pH 4·5–5·0 and 11·0; specific activity at pH 5·0 was 0·017 µmol p-nitrophenol/mg protein/min and 0·0049 µmol p-nitrophenol/mg protein/min at pH 11·0 at 37°C.

The inocula - indigenous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were enriched and cultured from the fresh activated sludge to a wastewater treatment plant. The results showed that Sd/SC significantly influenced the sludge bioleaching process. With increase in Sd/SC the sludge bioleaching was enhanced, which was represented by the acceleration of sludge acidification, oxidizing environment formation, and substrate (sulfur) utilization. Higher Sd/SC was more efficient to solubilize the heavy metals and total phosphorus (TP) than lower Sd/SC, while total nitrogen (TN) release was not influenced by Sd/SC. Zinc and copper were efficiently bioleached because of sludge acidification and sludge oxidation, but lead was bioleached with a low efficiency because of the formation of low soluble PbSO₄ precipitates. After bioleaching the biotoxicity of sewage sludge greatly reduced. 3aacidification 3aactivated sludge 3abacteria 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anitrogen content 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3asewage sludge 3asulfur 3awastewater treatment 3azinc 2aArchaeaxmetabolism 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aMetals, Heavyxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aSulfurxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aZhu, Yi1 aZhang, Guangming1 aZou, Sai1 aZeng, Guangming1 aWu, Zhen0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Feb., v. 100, no. 3 p.1394-1398dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.09.006 7aarticle01317naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245005500149300001600204520016100220650002800381650002300409650001100432650001800443650001200461650001300473650001100486650000900497650002500506650008400531650004300615651001100658653001400669700001500683700001900698700001500717773010200732852000900834939003300843945000800876946001100884655001200895991614785950742620221121015245.0830303e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830020602DNAL7 a61783782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRickman, L.14aThe isolation of T. brucei-like organisms from man  ap. 223-224.  aTrypanosoma rhodesiense stock isolated in rat from sleeping sickness patient in Zambia, 3 of 5 associated clones were clearly BIIT-negative (T. brucei-like) 3aTrypanosoma rhodesiense 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aclones 3apathogenicity 2aAnimals 2aEpitopes 2aHumans 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aTrypanosoma brucei bruceiximmunologyxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aTrypanosomiasis, Africanxparasitology 3aZambia 0avariation1 aMwanza, S.1 aKanyangala, S.1 aKolala, F.0 tAnnals of tropical medicine and parasitology.g1982 Apr., v. 76, no. 2 p.223-224x0003-49837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830303c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01344naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245009700150300001600247500001500263520011600278650001300394650002400407650001800431650002400449650001200473650001800485650002100503650001200524650003300536650002800569650000900597650003800606650005200644653001500696700001700711700001900728773010200747852000900849939003300858945000800891946001100899655001200910991614785890742620221121015238.0830303e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830020622DNAL7 a70923742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansueto, S.10aCounterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) and ELISA tests in the diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis  ap. 229-231.  a2019-12-04  acanine leishmaniasis, diagnosis, counterimmunoelectrophoresis and ELISA tests using Leishmania donovani antigen 3aimmunity 3alabeling techniques 3aserodiagnosis 3aLeishmania donovani 3aenzymes 3aleishmaniasis 3aprecipitin tests 2aAnimals 2aCounterimmunoelectrophoresis 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aDogs 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aLeishmaniasis, Visceralxdiagnosisxveterinary. 0aLeishmania1 aMiceli, M.D.1 aQuartararo, P.0 tAnnals of tropical medicine and parasitology.g1982 Apr., v. 76, no. 2 p.229-231x0003-49837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830303c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02504naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002700161245011900188300001600307500002400323520122200347650001401569650001201583650001201595650001501607650001801622650001101640650001101651650002301662650001101685650003301696650001301729650002501742650004101767650002801808700002201836700002801858773010501886852000901991856008202000655001202082IND4416756520221121015248.0090220s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441675652DNAL7 a191733242pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2008005342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Patricia Kaori10aStatistical mixture design investigation of fractionated and total extracts from Erythrina speciosa Andrews leaves  ap. 644-652.  aIncludes references  aThe simplex centroid mixture design for the ethanol, dichloromethane, hexane and acetone solvents has been applied to the extraction of crude mass and the fiber, organic, neutral and basic fractions as well as the fractionation residues of Erythrina speciosa Andrews leaves. Binary and ternary synergic solvent interactions are seen to provide dominant contributions to the extraction of both crude mass and all the fractions. Quadratic and special cubic mixture models precisely predict the extracted quantities of each fraction and the residue as a function of the proportions of the four solvents. Different solvent mixtures are found to be the most efficient extractors for the different fractions: binary dichloromethane-hexane mixtures for the fiber fraction, ternary ethanol-dichloromethane-acetone mixtures for the neutral fraction, binary ethanol-dichloromethane mixtures for the organic fraction, crude extract and residue values and ternary ethanol-dichloromethane-hexane mixtures for the basic fraction. Principal component analysis shows that the ethanol-dichloromethane mixtures are important for extracting large quantities of the basic and organic fractions as well as of the residue and crude masses. 3aErythrina 3aacetone 3aethanol 3aextractors 3afractionation 3ahexane 3aleaves 3amethylene chloride 3amodels 3aprincipal component analysis 3asolvents 2aErythrinaxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry1 aBruns, Roy Edward1 aScarminio, Ieda Spacino0 tJournal of separation science.g2009 Feb., v. 32, no. 4 p.644-652dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2008005343Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01702naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245007200149300001400221500001500235520017000250650001800420650002400438650002400462650002300486650002500509650001900534650002200553650002400575650001200599650002700611650003200638650005400670650002900724650003100753651001300784653003300797653002500830653003300855653003000888653004000918653001300958653003200971700001401003700001401017773008001031852000901111939003301120945000801153946001101161655001201172991614785620742620221120231633.0830304e198203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830020762DNAL7 a70691852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYen, P.K.F.10aIdentification of some common infective filarial larvae in Malaysia  ap. 69-80.  a2019-12-04  aWuchereria, Brugia, Breinlia, Dirofilaria, Setaria, description of differential characters of infective larvae from Aedes togoi (exper.), key to their identification 3aBrugia malayi 3aDirofilaria immitis 3anematode infections 3aDirofilaria repens 3aWuchereria bancrofti 3aBrugia pahangi 3adisease diagnosis 2aAedesxparasitology 2aAnimals 2aBrugiaxclassification 2aDirofilariaxclassification 2aFilarioideaxanatomy & histologyxclassification. 2aSetariasisxparasitology 2aWuchereriaxclassification 0aMalaysia 0aBreinlia booliati (Nematoda) 0aMorphology, Nematoda 0aBreinlia sergenti (Nematoda) 0aBrugia tupaiae (Nematoda) 0aDirofilaria magnilarvata (Nematoda) 0aNematoda 0aSetaria javensis (Nematoda)1 aZaman, V.1 aMak, J.W.0 tJournal of helminthology.g1982 Mar., v. 56, no. 1 p.69-80x0022-149X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830304c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03783naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245011500187300001600302520178100318650002002099650001302119650001202132650001502144650001502159650000902174650001402183650001002197650001702207650001502224650001702239650001202256650001802268650002802286650001302314650001502327650001202342650001202354650001302366650002102379650000902400650001202409650001702421650001302438650002602451650003602477650003302513650002402546650002302570653001202593653003002605653002202635653002102657700001902678700001602697700001502713700002102728700001802749700001502767773014602782852000902928856009202937930003303029946001103062655001203073IND4425785920221120231737.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442578592DNAL7 a191786092pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2008.00842.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarm, A.10aNo easy solution for the fractionation of faecal nitrogen in captive wild herbivores: results of a pilot study  ap. 596-605.  aFaecal nitrogen (FN) concentration is used as a marker for habitat quality and digestive efficiency in free-ranging herbivores. In herbivores, FN can be separated into undigested plant N (analysed as the N concentration of the neutral detergent residue) and metabolic faecal N (MFN). It has been suggested that by differential analysis of the faecal fibre-bound N, the MFN fraction can be further split into a bacterial N and an endogenous N fraction [Hesta et al., Br. J. Nutr. 90 (2003) 1007]. We applied these methods to 96 faecal samples of 48 mammalian herbivore species from zoos. Species were grouped into coprophageous and non-coprophageous hindgut fermenters and ruminating and non-ruminating foregut fermenters. Diet was not controlled. The FN decreased with body mass, possibly reflecting higher proportions of concentrates in diets of smaller animals. The proportion of MFN increased with FN, indicating that higher quality food might enhance the gastrointestinal bacterial flora. The only outlier to this pattern was the lesser panda (Ailurus fulgens), confirming the low relevance of fermentative digestion in this herbivorous 'carnivore'. No relevant differences between the four digestion types were noted. The proportion of endogenous faecal N (32-80% of FN) was always higher than that of bacterial faecal N (7-30%), which contradicts basal understanding of herbivore digestive physiology. Thus, the method of Hesta et al. (2003) does not appear applicable to herbivores. While the results do not exclude the possibility that detailed differences might occur between digestion types, they indicate a high degree of similarity between herbivores that rely on bacterial fermentation, regardless of their digestion type, with respect to metabolic faecal losses. 3aAilurus fulgens 3abacteria 3abromine 3acarnivores 3adetergents 3adiet 3adigestion 3afeces 3afermentation 3afermenters 3afood quality 3aforegut 3afractionation 3agastrointestinal system 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3ahindgut 3amammals 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3azoos 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Zoo 2aBacteria 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aFecesxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aMammalsxphysiology 2aNitrogenxanalysis 0aprotein 0ametabolic faecal nitrogen 0aendogenous losses 0ametabolic losses1 aSchweigert, M.1 aOrtmann, S.1 aHummel, J.1 aJanssens, G.P.J.1 aStreich, W.J.1 aClauss, M.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2009 Oct., v. 93, no. 5 p.596-605dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2008.00842.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03556naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001100197245010400208300001600312500002400328500001500352520167600367650002502043650001802068650001702086650002702103650001602130650001802146650001402164650002402178650001302202650002602215650001902241650002502260650002202285650001002307650003802317650003502355650002102390650001402411650002202425650001002447650002302457650002502480650006502505653002202570653001702592700001602609700002402625700001702649773008702666852000902753856007502762930003302837945002502870946001102895655001202906IND4384900420221120222350.0061102e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438490042DNAL7 a166003162pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF300 0aF4001 aLi, Y.10aOil content of Arabidopsis seeds: The influence of seed anatomy, light and plant-to-plant variation  ap. 904-915.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aArabidopsis thaliana is frequently used as a model for the study of oilseed biology and metabolism. However, the very small seeds of Arabidopsis can complicate analysis of their oil content and influence the application of results to larger-seeded plants. Here, we describe how seed anatomy, light, and plant-to-plant variation influence the content and measurement of oil in Arabidopsis seeds. The anatomy of Arabidopsis and Brassica napus seeds were compared and the distribution of mass, oil and the fatty acid composition of different seed parts were determined. In Brassica, 90% of the seed oil resides in the cotyledons that contribute 74% of seed mass. By contrast, the values for Arabidopsis are 60% and 45%, respectively, with a higher fraction of the oil deposited in the radicle, hypocotyl, endosperm and seed coat. Growth of Arabidopsis plants with 600 micromole m-2 s-1 light resulted in a two-fold higher seed yield, a 40% increase in mass per seed and a 60% increase in oil per seed compared to growth at 100 micromole m-2 s-1. Factors that influence the analysis of oil content were evaluated. Intact-seed transmethylation followed by gas chromatography (GC) analysis provided reproducible analysis of Arabidopsis seed oil. However, plant-to-plant variation in oil content is large and we analyzed how this influences the ability to detect statistically valid changes in oil between different genotypes. These observations establish a reference data set on the fatty acid composition and distribution of mass and oil between tissues of Arabidopsis seeds that should help to predict the applicability of results obtained with Arabidopsis to other oilseeds. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3alipid content 3aplant growth 3afatty acid composition 3amethylation 3aplant anatomy 3aseed oils 3atissue distribution 3aoilseeds 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aBrassica napus 3aphenotypic variation 3aseed productivity 3alight 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBrassicaxchemistryxgenetics. 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aCell Size 2aGenetic Variation 2aLight 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPlant Oilsxanalysis 2aSeedsxanatomy & histologyxchemistryxgrowth & development. 0alipid composition 0aBrassicaceae1 aBeisson, F.1 aPollard, M.q(Mary)1 aOhlrogge, J.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 May, v. 67, no. 9 p.904-915dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.02.0153electronic resource  a20061114b20061202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/11/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02422naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245010300178300001600281500002400297520122100321650003701542650001501579650001201594650000901606650001701615650002701632650000901659650001301668650001301681650002301694650001501717650002101732650001601753650001301769650002101782650001801803773012701821852000901948856005501957655001202012IND4391572920221120222500.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439157292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2007.00133.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGÖNCÜOĞLU, MUAMMER10aEffect of heating at different temperatures to extend the shelf life of vacuum-packed white cheese  ap. 356-366.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effects of heating applications on the shelf life of vacuum-packed white cheese. Shelf life was evaluated for chemical, microbiological and organoleptic properties during the ripening period of 90 days. For this purpose, pickled white cheeses made with commercial starter cultures (Chr. Hansen R707 Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. lactis subsp. cremoris) were put in polyamide bags for vacuum packaging. During the ripening period, a water bath was used for heating applications at 65, 70 and 72C for 15, 10 and 5 min, respectively. In the ripening period, there were no changes in the values of dry matter in the control group. Dry matter values in control cheese were 40.02-42.09% (average value: 40.87%). Total acidity, protein (%), soluble nitrogen, ripening index (RI), tyrosine content and volatile fatty acid values all showed significant increases between the first and 90th days of the ripening period. However, in the heated cheese groups, dry matter showed no changes, but compared with the control group cheese total acidity, protein (%), soluble nitrogen, RI, tyrosine content and volatile fatty acid values increased but not as much as the control group. 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aacid value 3aacidity 3abags 3acheesemaking 3afatty acid composition 3aheat 3anitrogen 3aproteins 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3astarter cultures 3atemperature 3atyrosine 3avacuum packaging 3awhite cheeses0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2007 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.356-366dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2007.00133.x 7aarticle03010naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012000169300001600289500002400305520172600329650001802055650002702073650001302100650001102113650000902124650001302133650001902146650002202165650001202187650001902199650002202218650001402240650001402254650002402268650001202292650002302304651001202327700001702339773011902356852000902475856009202484655001202576IND4459677620221120222400.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445967762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01267.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaaf, Tobias10aTraits of winner and loser species indicate drivers of herb layer changes over two decades in forests of NW Germany  ap. 516-527.  aIncludes references  aQuestions: What are the most likely environmental drivers for compositional herb layer changes as indicated by trait differences between winner and loser species? Location: Weser-Elbe region (NW Germany). Methods: We resurveyed the herb layer communities of ancient forest patches on base-rich sites of 175 semi-permanent plots. Species traits were tested for their ability to discriminate between winner and loser species using logistic regression analyses and deviance partitioning. Results: Of 115 species tested, 31 were identified as winner species and 30 as loser species. Winner species had higher seed longevity, flowered later in the season and more often had an oceanic distribution compared to loser species. Loser species tended to have a higher specific leaf area, were more susceptible to deer browsing and had a performance optimum at higher soil pH compared to winner species. The loser species also represented several ancient forest and threatened species. Deviance partitioning indicated that local drivers (i.e. disturbance due to forest management) were primarily responsible for the species shifts, while regional drivers (i.e. browsing pressure and acidification from atmospheric deposition) and global drivers (i.e. climate warming) had moderate effects. There was no evidence that canopy closure, drainage or eutrophication contributed to herb layer changes. Conclusions: The relative importance of the different drivers as indicated by the winner and loser species differs from that found in previous long-term studies. Relating species traits to species performance is a valuable tool that provides insight into the environmental drivers that are most likely responsible for herb layer changes. 3aacidification 3aatmospheric deposition 3abrowsing 3acanopy 3adeer 3adrainage 3aeutrophication 3aforest management 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3aground vegetation 3aleaf area 3alongevity 3aregression analysis 3asoil pH 3athreatened species 3aGermany1 aWulf, Monika0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2011 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.516-527dOpulus PresswJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01267.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02181naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245007400213300001400287520106400301653002401365653001901389653001301408653003701421653000801458700002601466700001701492700002901509700002601538773011701564852000901681856008501690930003301775946001101808655001201819IND4436794820221120223159.0100507e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443679482DNAL7 a10.1007/s12104-010-9209-x2doi7 aPMC33661172pmcid7 a201080662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondapalli, Kalyan C. 10aNMR assignments of a stable processing intermediate of human frataxin  ap. 61-64.  aFrataxin, a nuclear encoded protein targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, has recently been implicated as an iron chaperone that delivers Fe(II) to the iron-sulfur assembly enzyme ISU. During transport across the mitochondrial membrane, the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence of frataxin is cleaved in a two-step process to produce the “mature” protein found within the matrix; however, N-terminally extended forms of the protein have also been observed in vivo as a result of processing deficiencies. Structural characterization studies of the mature human frataxin ortholog suggest the protein's N-terminus is predominately unfolded, in contrast to what has been observed for the yeast ortholog. Here we report the NMR assignments of a stable intermediate in the processing of human frataxin. These studies were completed to provide structural insight into editing events that lead to mature protein formation. This report also provides structural details of frataxin editing anomalies produced in vivo during altered protein processing events. 0aFriedreich's ataxia 0aIron chaperone 0aFrataxin 0aIron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis 0aISU1 aBencze, Krisztina Z. 1 aDizin, Eric 1 aCowan, J.

A 2-year field study examined the demographic consequences of association with shrubs in an herbaceous perennial, Cryptantha flava. Physiological data were collected to evaluate whether shrub effects were mediated primarily through water, nutrient or light availability. 2. Microclimatic conditions under the north side of shrubs differed from open microhabitats, primarily in light availability. Due to little photosynthetic acclimation to light, daily photosynthesis for plants under shrubs was reduced proportionally to the light regime. 3. Shading did not reduce stomatal conductance proportionally to photosynthesis, which led to decreased water use efficiency for plants under shrubs. Few difference were found in leaf water potential between microhabitats, indicating that little competition for water was occurring. 4. There was little evidence for shrub-induced nutrient island effects. Soil nitrogen, phosphorus and organic content did not differ between open and shrub microhabitats. Leaf nitrogen content also differed little between plants in the two microhabitats. 5. Growth and flowering responses of individuals under shrubs were reduced relative to those in the open, even for plants located on the south side of shrubs. 6. Over this 2-year period of average to above-average rainfall, association of C. flava with shrubs was dominated by competition for light, rather than for water or nutrients. Future investigations will address whether this asymmetric competitive interaction changes during years with below-average rainfall to a facilitative interaction, or one of increased competition for water. 3astomatal conductance 3aperennials 3ashrubs 3anutrient availability 3amicroclimate 3aMagnoliopsida 3awater use efficiency 3adeserts 3aacclimation 3afield experimentation 3ashade 3aplant competition 3ademography 3aphotosynthesis 3aenvironmental exposure 3alight 3aUtah 0aperformance 0aplant-water relations 0awater availability 0aorientation1 aWait, D.A.1 aCasper, B.B.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Aug., v. 89, no. 4 p.670-680x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00574.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02939naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001800163245012400181300001600305500001500321520082500336650002801161650002701189650003701216650001601253650001701269650003501286650002101321650002301342650001001365650002301375650001201398650002101410650002001431650001001451650003101461650001201492650001801504650002301522650004901545650002301594650002101617650003801638650001601676650001901692650003701711650002801748650004601776650004601822650002701868650002401895650003801919653002801957653002501985700001402010700001802024700001602042700002002058773007302078852000902151930003302160945002502193946001102218655001202229IND4375568720221120223102.0051027e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437556872DNAL7 a161679852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This sequence information was used to identify six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CYP2E1 gene and its promoter. In addition, a microsatellite marker tightly linked to the CYP2E1 gene was subcloned from the BAC. One of these markers was used to map the CYP2E1 gene distal of SWC27 on SSC14, well outside reported quantitative trait loci on SSC14 for skatole, indole and taste test measures of boar taint. However, in a population of commercial pigs scored for backfat skatole levels, there was evidence of association between a SNP in the CYP2E1 promoter and skatole deposition, although there was no significant association between this SNP and skatole levels in the experimental cross. 3aquantitative trait loci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aoff flavors 3afood animals 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3acytochrome P-450 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3alinkage (genetics) 3askatole 3apromoter regions 3agenetic markers 3aswine 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterialxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP2E1xgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aGene Frequency 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSkatolexmetabolism 2aSus scrofaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aDoran, E.1 aMcGivan, J.D.1 aHaley, C.S.1 aArchibald, A.L.0 tAnimal genetics.g2005 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.417-422x0268-91467nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03031naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245010600169300001600275500001500291520167000306650001501976650000901991650001402000650003002014650001602044650002802060650001702088650001502105650001302120650001402133650001902147651002002166653001702186653003302203653001402236653001702250653001602267700001702283700001502300773007602315852000902391856009202400930003302492945001302525946001102538655001202549IND2325281720221120211149.0020208e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232528172DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00598.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThrall, P.H.10aShort-term epidemic dynamics in the Cakile maritima-Alternaria brassicicola host-pathogen association  ap. 723-735.  a2019-12-04  a1. Studies combining within- and among-population processes are crucial for understanding ecological and co-evolutionary dynamics in host-pathogen interactions. We report on work over an 18-month period involving multiple beach populations of the plant Cakile maritima and its fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola along the southeast coast of Australia. 2. Results from permanent transects replicated on several beaches show that disease incidence and prevalence vary significantly with plant age, class and distance from the sea, as well as time during the season. Plant density is also positively related to disease levels. 3. Results from three subregions indicate that disease persistence depends on survival of infected plants behind the foredunes of protected beaches. Population extinction was more likely on beaches with greater wind exposure and sea access, with the latter also related to colonization consistent with the dispersal of Cakile seeds via ocean currents. 4. Although disease dynamics during the epidemic were similar across subregions, the severity of the epidemic varied significantly among these areas, suggesting that largescale environmental factors may influence the timing and development of the epidemic. 5. Estimates of synchrony in disease dynamics indicated that populations within a subregion were significantly correlated with respect to epidemic development. There was, however, no evidence for spatial synchrony in disease dynamics based on among-population covariances in disease prevalence and interbeach distances. Populations within a subregion were thus often at quite different phases of the epidemic at any given time. 3aestimation 3awind 3aevolution 3afungal diseases of plants 3ahost plants 3aAlternaria brassicicola 3aBrassicaceae 3apopulation 3ahabitats 3amortality 3aseed dispersal 3aNew South Wales 0acolonization 0aplant diseases and disorders 0aoutbreaks 0ainteractions 0apersistence1 aBurdon, J.J.1 aBock, C.H.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Oct., v. 89, no. 5 p.723-735x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00598.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02486naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245008900163300001600252500001500268520112300283650001201406650000901418650002101427650001901448650003701467650001701504650001001521650001201531650001201543650002201555650002301577650003201600650001601632650003301648650001301681650003601694653001701730653002801747653001301775653002501788700001601813773007301829852000901902930003301911945002501944946001101969655001201980IND4375569020221120201542.0051027e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437556902DNAL7 a161679882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We report here the development and application of a SBT method for alleles of the chicken BF2 locus (the more polymorphic of the two MHC class I loci in chickens). Exon 2 of the BF2 gene was selectively amplified from genomic DNA using a BF2 locus-specific PCR primer. Exon 2 sequences were sufficient to identify the 21 distinct BF2 alleles described in standard B haplotypes of Leghorns and in commercial broiler-breeder lines. Sixty-six samples from MHC typed, pedigreed chickens were tested, including 50 different heterozygous combinations. BF2 sequences from all B homozygotes were successfully amplified, and all combinations of BF2 alleles in heterozygotes were co-amplified equally. The two different BF2 alleles in heterozygotes could be identified unambiguously by distinct sequence motif patterns. In tests of samples of unknown B genotype in commercial broiler-breeder flocks, we identified expected BF2 alleles as well as an allele not previously encountered in one of the lines. 3aalleles 3aloci 3abroiler breeders 3aheterozygosity 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3ahomozygosity 3aexons 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxmethods 2aChickensxgenetics 2aDNA Fingerprintingxmethods 2aDNA Primers 2aGenes, MHC Class Ixgenetics 2aGenotype 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxmethods 0afood animals 0amolecular sequence data 0agenotype 0anucleotide sequences1 aEwald, S.J.0 tAnimal genetics.g2005 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.432-434x0268-91467nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02791naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002100193245007800214300001800292520127100310650001701581650001701598650001201615650002601627650003801653650003401691650001101725650002301736650004001759650002201799650006101821653001101882653000801893653000801901653000801909653001401917653001301931653000901944653001101953653000801964653001101972653000901983700001701992773010702009852000902116856009202125930003302217946001102250655001202261IND4425799520221120192323.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579952DNAL7 a195668952pmid7 aPMC27468612pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.00951.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAslan, Joseph E.10aDeath by Committee: Organellar Trafficking and Communication in Apoptosis  ap. 1390-1404.  aApoptosis proceeds through a set of evolutionarily conserved processes that co-ordinate the elimination of damaged or unneeded cells. This program of cell death is carried out by organelle-directed regulators, including the Bcl-2 proteins, and ultimately executed by proteases of the caspase family. Although the biochemical mechanisms of apoptosis are increasingly understood, the underlying cell biology orchestrating programmed cell death remains enigmatic. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of Bcl-2 protein regulation and caspase activation while examining cell biological mechanisms and consequences of apoptotic induction. Organellar contributions to apoptotic induction include death receptor endocytosis, mitochondrial and lysosomal permeabilization, endoplasmic reticulum calcium release and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. These early apoptotic events are accompanied by stabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton and translocation of organelles to the microtubule organizing center. Together, these phenomena establish a model of apoptotic induction whereby a cytoskeletal-dependent coalescence and 'scrambling' of organelles in the paranuclear region co-ordinates apoptotic communication, caspase activation and cell death. 3acytochrome c 3amitochondria 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxphysiology 2aCaspasesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Physiological Phenomena. 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aOrganellesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aProtein Transport 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2xmetabolismxphysiology. 0a14-3-3 0aBad 0aBax 0aBid 0acathepsin 0aceramide 0aDrp1 0adynein 0aGD3 0aPACS-2 0aSUMO1 aThomas, Gary0 tTraffic.g2009 Oct., v. 10, no. 10 p.1390-1404dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1398-92197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.00951.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03424naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001200171245017600183300001800359520157300377650002701950650001901977650001201996650001002008650002002018650002802038650003002066650001202096650004802108650002902156650004002185650002502225650002002250650003002270650002702300650003202327650002702359650004802386650004402434650002302478650001702501653001802518700001402536700001702550700001502567700001202582773013102594852000902725856009202734930003302826946001102859655001202870IND4425797620221120192350.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579762DNAL7 a194864042pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04304.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, K.10aIdentification of vhhP2, a novel genetic marker of Vibrio harveyi, and its application in the quick detection of V. harveyi from animal specimens and environmental samples  ap. 1251-1257.  aTo investigate the species-specific prevalence of vhhP2 among Vibrio harveyi isolates and the applicability of vhhP2 in the specific detection of V. harveyi from crude samples of animal and environmental origins. A gene (vhhP2) encoding an outer membrane protein of unknown function was identified from a pathogenic V. harveyi isolate. vhhP2 is present in 24 V. harveyi strains isolated from different geographical locations but is absent in 24 strains representing 17 different non-V. harveyi species, including V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus. A simple polymerase chain reaction method for the identification of V. harveyi was developed based on the conserved sequence of vhhP2. This method was demonstrated to be applicable to the quick detection of V. harveyi from crude animal specimens and environmental samples. The specificity of this method was tested by applying it to the examination of two strains of V. campbellii, which is most closely related to V. harveyi. One of the V. campbellii strains was falsely identified as V. harveyi. vhhP2 is ubiquitously present in the V. harveyi species and is absent in most of the non-V. harveyi species; this feature enables vhhP2 to serve as a genetic marker for the rapid identification of V. harveyi. However, this method can not distinguish some V. campbellii strains from V. harveyi. the significance of our study is the identification of a novel gene of V. harveyi and the development of a simple method for the relatively accurate detection of V. harveyi from animal specimens and environmental samples. 3aGeographical Locations 3aVibrio harveyi 3aanimals 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aouter membrane proteins 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFish Diseasesxdiagnosisxgenetics. 2aFishesxmicrobiology 2aGenetic Markers 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aVibrioxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aVibrio Infectionsxdiagnosisxgenetics. 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Supply 0aPCR detection1 aHu, Y.-H.1 aZhang, X.-H.1 aBai, F.-F.1 aSun, L.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 107, no. 4 p.1251-1257dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04304.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01412naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003300110245008700143300001600230500002400246520037700270650003000647650001600677650001300693650001000706650001800716650001400734650001500748650001500763650001200778651001100790700003300801700002900834700003300863773007200896852000900968856007300977655001201050IND4459706120221120165159.0110708s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445970612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeustroev, Mikhail Petrovich10aBroad spectrum probiotic (Sakhabactisubtil) recovered from Yakutia permafrost soil  ap. 222-224.  aIncludes references  aProbiotic “Sakhabactisubtil” has been developed, it has unique biological properties: frank antagonistic effect against pathogen and opportunistic microorganisms (bacteria, fungi and viruses), interferon-evoke activity, immune system enhancing effect, producing a range of ferments, beneficial microflora formation's stimulation, resistance to a number of antibiotics. 3aanti-infective properties 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3afungi 3aimmune system 3apathogens 3apermafrost 3aprobiotics 3aviruses 3aRussia1 aTarabukina, Nadejda Petrovna1 aFedorova, Marfa Pavlovna1 aParnikova, Svetlana Ivanovna0 tVeterinary world.g2011 May, v. 4, no. 5 p.222-224x0972-89887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.veterinaryworld.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03194naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001700198245008500215300001600300520153200316650001201848650001301860650002801873650002801901650002901929650002001958650002301978650001002001650001302011650001202024650002102036650002002057650001102077650001702088650001202105650002502117650001102142650002202153650003002175650002302205650001402228650001002242650001002252651001002262653001802272700001602290700001402306700001502320773008202335852000902417856008502426930003302511945002502544946001102569655001202580IND4371146720221120165132.0050609e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437114672DNAL7 a159096822pmid7 a10.1017/S002202990400069X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Three cheese batches were prepared using a commercial starter, one from raw milk, another from pasteurized milk, and a third from pasteurized milk with an added culture of wild Lactobacillus. paracasei+Lb. plantarum. Analysis of the volatile compounds was carried out by the purge and trap method and gas chromatography with a mass spectrometer and disclosed a total of 86 compounds belonging to the chemical families hydrocarbons, fatty acids, esters, ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols. After ageing for 120 and 240 days, the cheese samples underwent sensory analysis by a panel of expert assessors. The attributes evaluated were characteristic odour and odour intensity and characteristic aroma and aroma intensity. Pasteurization of the milk had an effect on the formation of certain volatile compounds, adversely affecting the characteristic flavour of the cheese. Use of the adjunct culture in addition to the commercial starter improved the flavour of the cheese made from the pasteurized milk, which earned sensory scores similar to those awarded to the cheese made from the raw milk. Use of adjunct cultures consisting of indigenous FHL strains could help to conserve the traditional characteristics of Roncal cheese made from pasteurized milk, although some technical adjustments to the Regulations would be needed. 3acheeses 3aewe milk 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3amultiple strain starters 3acheese starters 3avolatile compounds 3aodors 3araw milk 3astrains 3apasteurized milk 3acheese ripening 3aflavor 3afood quality 2aAnimals 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aFood Microbiology 2aLactobacillusxphysiology 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aOdorants. 2aSheep 2aTaste 3aSpain 0aRoncal cheese1 aArizcun, C.1 aTorre, P.1 aIzco, J.M.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 May, v. 72, no. 2 p.168-178x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002202990400069X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/03/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02227naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008400124300001600208520136000224650001001584650001201594650001801606650002001624650001101644650001601655650001001671653002101681653001301702700001701715773008901732852000901821930003301830945001301863946001301876655001201889IND2199059620221120155336.0990602e199812  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219905962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyce, J.12aA practical application of HACCP in a refrigerated food manufacturing operation  ap. 185-196.  aHACCP was used in a research study to produce a refrigerated food product at a food manufacturing plant in Central Texas. Coleslaw was selected for analysis due to production volume and instability of the product during shelf-life. Critical control points (ccps) were identified in the manufacturing areas of processing, production and distribution and documentation instruments were designed to monitor the (ccps) in each of these areas. Three formulations of the product were tested: one as control, and one a variation of the control formula with a pre-treatment of the cabbage. The third formula contained a different stabilizing system. All products were manufactured utilizing the proposed HACCP system for this operation. The results of the study indicated that a HACCP system could be implemented into an existing food manufacturing operation successfully. The data collected from the HACCP documentation instruments for time and temperature for the three major refrigerated product holding areas were analyzed statistically The analysis of the data indicated that changes were needed for these areas to be in compliance with this HACCP program. This study supports current literature on research from regulatory agencies and academic studies which suggests that the food industry use HACCP as a control to ensure a safe food supply for consumers. 3afoods 3acabbage 3arefrigeration 3afood processing 3amodels 3atemperature 3aHACCP 0aquality controls 0acoleslaw1 aShanklin, C.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1998 Dec., v. 10, no. 3 p.185-196x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle04387naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001500181245007600196300001600272500001500288520199000303650002602293650003202319650000902351650002302360650002102383650002102404650002902425650001402454650001802468650001802486650002502504650003202529650002002561650001902581650002102600650002002621650003202641650001402673650001702687650001802704650002202722650002002744650002402764650001202788650001102800650002302811650002602834650001102860650004302871650004202914650005302956650006003009650005403069650001703123650001403140653001703154653001403171653002803185653001503213700001703228700001803245700001703263700001503280700001303295700001603308773008203324852000903406856008503415930003303500945002503533946001103558655001203569IND4371147320221120155116.0050609e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437114732DNAL7 a159096842pmid7 a10.1017/S002202990500083X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYounis, A.10aStaphylococcus aureus leucocidin, a virulence factor in bovine mastitis  ap. 188-194.  a2019-12-04  aThe involvement of Staphylococcus aureus exosecretions in bovine udder infection (Younis et al. 2003) suggests that four different monomer protein bands appearing between 36 and 31 kDa, are associated with the severity of the cow's infection response. Three out of these four bands have been identified by means of protein sequencing. Band B, with a MW of 35 kDa was identified as Panton-Valentaine leucocidin LukF'-PV chain- Staph. aureus; band C, with a MW of 32 kDa was identified as leucocidin chain LukM precursor- Staph. aureus; and band D was found to be similar, but not identical, to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase-C-X. Bands B and C were purified by gel filtration using FPLC. The ability of these proteins to induce udder inflammation in vivo, and proliferation response in vitro and cytokine secretion were tested for both the crude exosecretions and purified bands. Three cows were inoculated intracisternally, with three quarters receiving either 0.007-0.008 mg (as total proteins) of Staph. aureus FR2449/1 bacterial exosecretion, pooled fraction 39-41 (bands B and C), or culture broth medium. The fourth quarter was left free as a control. Quarters that received fraction 39-41 of Staph. aureus FR2449/1, exhibited induced inflammation, which was indicated by increased somatic cell count and enhanced NAGase activity that was significantly higher than that of the original Staph. aureus FR2449/1 bacterial exosecretion. Proliferation tests of bovine blood lymphocytes in vitro showed that the pooled fraction 39-41 stimulated bovine proliferation of mononuclear cells much more than the original Staph. aureus FR2449/1 bacterial exosecretion. Secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 was in accordance with the contents of LukF'-PV and LukM precursor in the exosecretions. The results suggest that LukM/LukF' induce inflammation into the udder by a mechanism similar to that of LPS or by a unique mechanism(s) which requires further investigation. 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3acows 3asomatic cell count 3abacterial toxins 3adisease severity 3alymphocyte proliferation 3avirulence 3ainterleukin-8 3ainterleukin-1 3aamino acid sequences 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aimmune response 3audder quarters 3ain vitro studies 3aenzyme activity 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3amonocytes 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3achemical analysis 3abovine mastitis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Proliferation 2aCytokinesxphysiology 2aFemale 2aLeukocidinsxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxdrug effects 2aMastitis, Bovinexmicrobiologyxphysiopathology. 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcus aureusxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 2aVirulence 0apurification 0acytokines 0amolecular sequence data 0aleucocidin1 aKrifucks, O.1 aFleminger, G.1 aHeller, E.D.1 aGollop, N.1 aSaran-a.1 aLeitner, G.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 May, v. 72, no. 2 p.188-194x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002202990500083X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/03/03  aNon-US 7aarticle04172naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245014800187300001600335520174000351650002802091650001602119650002102135650002302156650003602179650002502215650001802240650002302258650001402281650002002295650003102315650001002346650002802356650001102384650002102395650001402416650001302430650002802443650000902471650002202480650002402502650005102526650004302577650003802620650001802658650002102676650002602697650002802723650004202751650005202793650006802845650004002913650002302953650002802976653002703004653001003031653002103041700001903062700001503081700001203096700003103108700001903139773012303158852000903281856009203290930003303382946001103415655001203426IND4425804520221120144623.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442580452DNAL7 a197548362pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-7652.2009.00442.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yayun10aEctopic expression of MgSM1, a Cerato-platanin family protein from Magnaporthe grisea, confers broad-spectrum disease resistance in Arabidopsis  ap. 763-777.  aProteins belonging to the newly identified Cerato-platanin (CP) family have been shown to have elicitor activity in inducing disease resistance responses in various plants. In this study, we characterized a gene, MgSM1, from Magnaporthe grisea, encoding a putative small protein belonging to the CP family. MgSM1 was constitutively expressed not only in different fungal growth stages but also during its infection process in rice plants. Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of MgSM1 in Arabidopsis resulted in hypersensitive response in the infiltrated local leaves and enhanced disease resistance against Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 in upper leaves of plants, accompanyed by up-regulated expression of defense genes (PR-1, PR-5 and PDF1.2). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing MgSM1 under control of a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible promoter were generated. Expression of MgSM1 in transgenic plants was induced by exogenous application of DEX. MgSM1-expressing plants showed normal growth with application of <10 μ m DEX. After DEX induction, the MgSM1-expressing plants showed enhanced disease resistance against B. cinerea, Alternaria brassicicola and Psto DC3000 as well as up-regulated expression of some of defense genes. Moreover, accumulation of reactive oxygen species was observed in MgSM1-expressing plants. These results collectively suggest that ectopic expression of MgSM1 in transgenic plants confers broad-spectrum resistance against different types of pathogens. Our study also provides a novel strategy to generate environment-friendly crops with enhanced broad-spectrum resistance through ectopic expression of microbe-derived disease resistance-inducing proteins. 3aAlternaria brassicicola 3aArabidopsis 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3adevelopmental stages 3adexamethasone 3adisease resistance 3aelicitors 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 3amicrobial growth 3apathogens 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3arice 3atransgenic plants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Fungal 2aImmunity, Innate 2aMagnaporthexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aCerato-platanin family 0aMgSM1 0adefense response1 aZhang, Huijuan1 aLi, Guojun1 aLi, Wei1 aChiang, Judy Shaw-Er Wang.1 aSong, Fengming0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2009 Oct., v. 7, no. 8 p.763-777dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-76447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2009.00442.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02165naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100002300181245008600204300001600290520069900306650002301005650002701028650001901055650002201074650001901096650001601115650000901131650001801140650002201158650001201180650001401192650001201206650003101218650002001249650001301269650003301282650000901315650002401324650002301348700001301371700001701384773008301401852000901484856008501493930003301578945002501611946001101636655001201647IND4375067720221120135415.0051007e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437506772DNAL7 a161743582pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299050007252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Inactivation kinetics revealed an order of reaction above 1 and could be determined by a non-1st-order regression model. Phage inactivation was influenced by the medium (milk and Ca-M17-broth). Within the investigated temperature range, milk had a protective effect on phage P008. This was reflected in the rate constant and in the activation energy. Thermal phage inactivation studies reported in literature were re-analysed using non-1st-order regression. The obtained kinetic parameters showed that phage P008 belongs to the most heat resistant lactococcal phages investigated so far. 3aLactococcus lactis 3acultured milk starters 3abacteriophages 3aheat inactivation 3aheat tolerance 3atemperature 3amilk 3aculture media 3aactivation energy 3astrains 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aBacteriophagesxphysiology 2aHot Temperature 2aKinetics 2aLactococcus lactisxvirology 2aMilk 2aRegression Analysis 2aVirus Inactivation1 aNeve, H.1 aHinrichs, J.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 Aug., v. 72, no. 3 p.281-286x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299050007253Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/12/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03166naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001800163245009700181300001600278520150600294650001101800650001401811650003201825650002601857650001301883650001901896650002201915650002901937650002201966650002501988650001202013650001802025650002102043650001602064650003302080650002602113650002702139650002502166650002002191650002802211650004502239650001402284650002702298650002402325653002802349700001802377700001602395700001402411773007302425852000902498930003302507945002502540946001102565655001202576IND4375568020221120135303.0051027e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437556802DNAL7 a161679782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNishibori, M.10aMolecular evidence for hybridization of species in the genus Gallus except for Gallus varius  ap. 367-375.  aA phylogenetic tree for fowl including chicken in the genus Gallus and based on mitochondrial D-loop analysis further supports the hypothesis developed from morphology and progeny production that red junglefowl (RJF) is the direct ancestor of the chicken. The phylogenetic positions of the chicken and the other fowl species in the genus Gallus are of great importance when considering maintenance and improvement of chicken breeds through introgression of genetic variation from wild-type genomes. However, because the phylogenetic analysis based on the DNA sequences is not sufficient to conclude the phylogenetic positions of the fowls in the genus, in the present study, we have determined sequences of whole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and two segments of the nuclear genome (intron 9 of ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and four chicken repeat 1 elements) for the species in the genus Gallus. The phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA sequences revealed that two grey junglefowls (GyJF) were clustered in a clade with RJFs and chicken, and that one GyJF was located in a remote position close to Ceylon junglefowl (CJF). The analyses based on the nuclear sequences revealed that alleles of GyJFs were alternatively clustered with those of CJF and with those of RJFs and chicken. Alternative clustering of RJF and chicken alleles were also observed. These findings taken together strongly indicate that inter-species hybridizations have occurred between GyJF and RJF/chicken and between GyJF and CJF. 3aGallus 3aphylogeny 3ainterspecific hybridization 3amolecular systematics 3achickens 3awild relatives 3amitochondrial DNA 3aanimal genetic resources 3agenetic variation 3anucleotide sequences 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aGalliformesxgenetics 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aLikelihood Functions 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrnithine Carbamoyltransferasexgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 0amolecular sequence data1 aShimogiri, T.1 aHayashi, T.1 aYasue, H.0 tAnimal genetics.g2005 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.367-375x0268-91467nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03603naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245010800185300001800293520145900311650003101770650002601801650002201827650002601849650001601875650001101891650003701902650002601939650001001965650002301975650001601998650003702014650002002051650001202071650004002083650003302123650002402156650002802180650003702208650002802245650002902273650003902302650002202341650002602363650003702389650003202426650004402458650007002502653003702572653000902609653003902618700001402657700001802671773013102689852000902820856009202829930003302921946001102954655001202965IND4425798920221120135344.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579892DNAL7 a194863842pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04322.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.10aDiversity of staphylococcal cassette chromosome in coagulase-negative staphylococci from animal sources  ap. 1375-1383.  aTo type the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) from animal sources. A total of 92 CoNS isolates recovered from farm animals was analysed. The top three staphylococcal species were Staphylococcus lentus (34), S. sciuri (31), and S. xylosus (13). The presence of the cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) genes ccrA1, ccrB1, ccrA2, ccrB2, ccrA3, ccrB3 and ccrC, the mec regulatory genes mecI and mecR1, and Tn554 was used to differentiate the SCC. A total of 60 of the 92 isolates were methicillin resistant. Among the 60 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. isolates, SCCmec (mecA-carrying SCC) types I, III, IV and V were identified in 24 isolates based on the combinations of the ccr genes and the mec regulatory genes, with type III being predominant. The single S. epidermidis carried SCCmec type IV. SCC type III was also identified in two of 32 methicillin-susceptible isolates. Identical SCCmec types were present in different species of CoNS. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) generated 64 patterns out of 81 PFGE typeable isolates. Indistinguishable clones were detected in animals from different farms. Heterogeneous SCC existed in CoNS of diverse genetic background. Both clonal transmission of methicillin-resistant CoNS and horizontal transfer of SCCmec occurred in the animal production environment. This study adds to our knowledge of SCCmec type and the diversity of SCC in CoNS. 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aStaphylococcus lentus 3aanimal production 3aantibiotic resistance 3achromosomes 3aclones 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3afarmed animal species 3afarms 3agenetic background 3amethicillin 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aregulator genes 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBirdsxmicrobiology 2aCefoxitinxpharmacology 2aChromosomes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aCoagulasexbiosynthesis 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aGenetic Variation 2aMammalsxmicrobiology 2aMethicillin Resistancexgenetics 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aStaphylococcusxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 0acoagulase-negative staphylococci 0amecA 0astaphylococcal cassette chromosome1 aAgidi, S.1 aLeJeune, J.T.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 107, no. 4 p.1375-1383dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04322.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02472naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245009900176300001600275500001500291520122400306650001201530650001701542650002201559650002301581650002001604650002101624650001701645650001801662650001701680650002001697650001001717653001301727653002901740700001401769700001401783700001201797700001601809700001401825773007301839852000901912930003301921945002501954946001101979655001201990IND4375568120221120135411.0051027e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437556812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMikawa, S.10aAnalysis of recessive lethality on swine chromosome 6 in a Gottingen miniature resource family  ap. 376-380.  a2019-12-05  aPreviously, we reported recessive gene(s) that terminate fetal development on swine chromosome (SSC) 6 between SW855 and SW122. The affected alleles originated from a Gottingen miniature pig used for construction of a Gottingen miniature pig x Meishan resource population. However, it is not known when the gene(s) are activated during fetal development, which is one of the important factors in selecting candidate genes responsible for fetal death. In the present study, a second swine population consisting of 159 progeny was produced by mating pigs carrying the deleterious allele(s). This population allowed us to narrow the genetic region harbouring the affected gene(s) and to demonstrate that the region was confined between RYR1 and SW782 (5.7 cM on the National Institute of Animal Industry (NIAI) map and 100 cR on the INRA/University of Minnesota porcine radiation hybrid panel map). In order to determine when the affected gene(s) are activated and in turn terminate fetal development, embryos produced in the second population were collected at several development stages and genotyped for markers in the region. Genes in the homozygous state affected embryo development between 9 and 11 days post-coitus. 3aalleles 3afood animals 3afetal development 3achromosome mapping 3arecessive genes 3aminiature breeds 3ahomozygosity 3aembryogenesis 3alethal genes 3agenetic markers 3aswine 0agenotype 0aradiation hybrid mapping1 aKishi, H.1 aOgawa, H.1 aIga, K.1 aUenishi, H.1 aYasue, H.0 tAnimal genetics.g2005 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.376-380x0268-91467nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01922naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012800127300001400255520087200269650001601141650003401157650001501191650002001206650002601226650002701252653002101279653001301300653004601313700001501359700001601374700001501390773008701405852000901492930003301501945001301534946001301547655001201560IND2164007720221120131000.0980912e199712  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216400772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostello, C.10aEvaluating the effectiveness of two instructional techniques for teaching food safety principles to quick service employees  ap. 41-50.  aThe purpose was to compare the typical lecture method of teaching food safety principles to a computer-assisted interactive method.

Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has become one of the most important agents of vegetation change in densely populated regions. It may also contribute to forest expansion into grasslands at the northern edge of the North American Great Plains. 2. We measured N deposition and available soil N with ion-exchange resin over 2 years in six national parks in areas varying in population density and industrialization. N deposition was significantly higher in four parks in densely populated regions than in two remote parks. 3. Available soil N increased significantly with N deposition across all parks. 4. We measured N mass and 15N abundance (delta15N) in vegetation and soil in two parks: Elk Island, receiving 22 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), and Jasper, receiving 8 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Differences between parks in tissue N concentrations were small, but forest expansion over five decades resulted in the mass of N in vegetation increasing by 74% in Elk Island but by only 26% in Jasper. delta15N in forest vegetation was significantly lower in Elk Island than in Jasper, suggesting that anthropogenic sources contribute significantly to the high rates of N entering that ecosystem. 5. We determined the rate of forest expansion within parks using six decades of aerial photographs. Parks in aspen parkland and boreal forest showed a strong positive relationship between forest expansion and N deposition. The relationships found between N deposition, available soil N and forest expansion suggest that even comparatively low rates of N deposition may accelerate the expansion of forest into temperate grasslands. 3anitrogen content 3aboreal forests 3aplant communities 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aecological succession 3aaerial photography 3asoil fertility 3apopulation density 3aindustrialization 3aair pollution 3agrasslands 3aAlberta 3aManitoba 3aNorthwest Territories 3aSaskatchewan 0adeposition 0aplants 0avegetation1 aWilson, S.D.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Oct., v. 89, no. 5 p.807-817x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00600.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03770naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245010100171300001600272500001500288520251100303650001102814650002802825650002602853650001502879650002202894650002602916650002302942650001502965651001702980653002402997653001803021653001703039653001203056700001703068700001703085773007603102852000903178856009203187930003303279945001303312946001103325655001203336IND2325284620221120085829.0020208e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232528462DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00605.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, T.G.10aInfluence of precipitation and species composition on phytomass of a semi-arid African grassland  ap. 850-860.  a2019-12-04  a1. The influence of botanical composition on annual phytomass production of a semiarid grassland in response to precipitation was tested with a 19-year experiment. Three compositional states reflecting good, medium and poor rangeland condition, whose basal cover increased from poor through to good, were created in 1978. 2. Multiple regression models were developed for assessing whether phytomass was influenced by precipitation, composition, phytomass of the previous year, basal cover, abundance of individual species, or diversity. Composition and precipitation accounted for 66% of the variation in phytomass, but a separate model of basal cover by precipitation was equally successful. The linear effect of rainfall on phytomass was enhanced as composition improved from poor (0.076 g m(-2) mm(-1)) through medium (0.197 g m(-2) mm(-1)) to good (0.277 g m(-2) mm(-1)). Phytomass increased for low precipitation if it had been high the preceding year. Phytomass was more variable over time with deteriorating condition. 3. Species' complementarity ensured greater and more stable production. Setaria sphacelata, Eragrostis chloromelas and Digitaria eriantha increased phytomass on the good or medium condition grasslands during drier years, whereas Themeda triandra had this effect during wetter years. 4. Precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) was influenced mostly by composition and a linear and quadratic effect of precipitation (63% of variance). Optimum PUE of 0.308, 0.203 and 0.096 g m(-2) mm(-1) for the good, medium and poor condition grasslands, respectively, occurred at intermediate amounts (+/-680 mm) of precipitation. PUE was increased if phytomass had been high the previous year. 5. Species' complementarity of PUE in response to precipitation was evident for all compositional states. Ten, mostly uncommon, species and their interaction with precipitation explained an extra 21-42% of the variance. Stability of production was related to PUE for medium and poor condition grassland. Uncommon species therefore ensured growth efficiency and stabilized production as condition deteriorated. 6. Diversity had no influence on phytomass or PUE except for a small to moderate effect, respectively, for the medium condition grassland. 7. Vegetation structure, through limiting runoff and promoting infiltration, is an important control on the amount and efficiency of plant production under variable precipitation, whilst composition further influences the amount and stability of production. 3arunoff 3ainterspecific variation 3along term experiments 3arangelands 3aplant communities 3abotanical composition 3abiomass production 3agrasslands 3aSouth Africa 0aspecies differences 0aprecipitation 0ainfiltration 0abiomass1 aHaines, L.M.1 aSnyman, H.A.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Oct., v. 89, no. 5 p.850-860x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00605.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01159naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013400128300001600262520030500278650001700583650001900600650002400619653001300643700001600656700001800672700001600690773008300706852000900789930003300798945001300831946001300844655001200857IND2037578620221120075915.0940228s1993    ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203757862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmanza, B.A.10aEffect of reprocessed material on selected physical characteristics of corrugated shipping cartons used in foodservice operations  ap. 177-183.  aThe purpose of this study was to compare selected physical strength characteristics of high performance corrugated board containing 50% reprocessed material, to the high performance board containing 30% reprocessed material.

At that time, the management goal for this “Farm 40” was to produce high-quality poles and logs on a 60-year rotation. The goal was to be accomplished entirely through management of the existing natural forest, with little to no capital investment other than the cost for prescribed burning, marking trees for cut, and limited control of cull hardwoods. Management of the forest has continued making the Farm 40 an excellent demonstration of small-scale longleaf pine management. Frequent harvests and small capital outlay continues to make this type of management strategy especially appealing to today's landowners with limited resources. 3aPinus palustris 3aUSDA Forest Service 3acapital 3aconiferous forests 3aeconomic investment 3afarms 3aforest management 3ahardwood 3alandowners 3aprescribed burning 3atrees 3aAlabama1 aKush, John S.1 aBoyer, William D.0 tSouthern journal of applied forestry.g2011 Feb., v. 35, no. 1 p.50-53dSociety of American Forestersx0148-44197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245011400165300001600279520088600295650002301181650001601204650001501220650002601235650000901261650001401270650001801284650001101302650001401313650001501327651001001342653002301352653001401375653002301389700001501412700002501427773012901452852000901581856009201590930003301682946001101715655001201726IND4425792720221120055250.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00676.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLARA, G.10aTrophometric index: a predictor for fish density, biomass and production in Mediterranean reservoirs in Spain  ap. 341-351.  aA trophometric index (TMI) is proposed to estimate fish density, biomass and production in Mediterranean reservoirs. It consists of simple and integrated environmental variables such as the form index (IF = S/V ), the volume percentage of water with sufficient oxygen to sustain fish life, conductivity, chlorophyll a concentration and perimeter, the synergic effect of which explains the fish structure and accounts for the functioning of the ecosystems. This index was tested in eight reservoirs in the Guadalquivir River basin, showing a good fit with a potential model for fish density and a linear model for fish biomass and production (P < 0.01; r² > 0.8). The TMI is a valuable tool for evaluating fishery production in Mediterranean reservoirs and allows these to be classified by type for better management and evaluation in the framework of the European Water Directive. 3abiomass production 3achlorophyll 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3afisheries 3alinear models 3aoxygen 3asynergism 3awatersheds 3aSpain 0afishery evaluation 0areservoir 0atrophometric index1 aENCINA, L.1 aRODRÍGUEZ -RUIZ, A.0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2009 Oct., v. 16, no. 5 p.341-351dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0969-997X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00676.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03016naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245013000172300001600302500002400318500002400342520184300366650000802209650002202217650001302239650002702252650001302279650004702292650001602339650001602355650001302371700001802384700001802402700001802420773011002438852000902548856008502557655001202642IND4459695420221120055205.0110708s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445969542DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-011-9187-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorji, Ahmad Mousapour10aEfficiency of Arbitrarily Amplified Dominant Markers (SCOT, ISSR and RAPD) for Diagnostic Fingerprinting in Tetraploid Potato  ap. 226-237.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aThree molecular markering techniques: start codon targeted (SCOT), inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were compared for fingerprinting of 24 varieties and a segregating population of tetraploid potato. The number of scoreable and polymorphic bands produced using the SCOT, ISSR and RAPD primers for varieties was more than that of genotypes. SCOTs markers were more informative, followed by ISSRs marker, than other markers for the assessment of varieties based on polymorphism information content (PIC). There were no significant differences among these markers in terms of the evaluation of genotypes. All marker techniques individually illustrated that Diversity Index and Marker Index for varieties were higher than that of genotypes, and SCOT had superiority to other markers. The resolving power (Rp) of the SCOT, ISSR and RAPD techniques was 71.25, 46.62 and 30.63 for varieties and 21.38, 18.83 and 18.87 for genotypes, respectively. Standard Jaccard’s similarity coefficient of each marker technique revealed that similarity among varieties was less than that of the genotypes. Overall the Shannon index showed that relative genetic diversity of the varieties was high when SCOT markers were used but it was fairly similar when ISSR and RAPD markers were applied. The results of Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) revealed that variation within groups of varieties of a country was significantly higher than among groups. These results suggest that efficiency of SCOT, ISSR and RAPD markers was relatively the same in fingerprinting of genotypes but SCOT analysis is more effective in fingerprinting of potato varieties. Overall, our results indicate that SCOT, ISSR and RAPD fingerprinting could be used to detect polymorphism for genotypes and for varieties of potato. 3aDNA 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apotatoes 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3astart codon 3atetraploidy 3avariance1 aPoczai, Peter1 aPolgar, Zsolt1 aTaller, Janos0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2011 June, v. 88, no. 3 p.226-237dThe Associationx1099-209X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-011-9187-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02006naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245002800163300001600191500002400207520110700231650001701338650001101355650001301366650001501379650001701394650001201411650001701423700002101440700002001461773010501481852000901586856008501595655001201680IND4459694620221120055209.0110708s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445969462DNAL7 a10.1007/s12229-010-9062-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZotz, Gerhard10aHeteroblasty—A Review  ap. 109-151.  aIncludes references  aVirtually all plants show a certain degree of variation among individual metamers during ontogeny. In some cases, however, there are abrupt and substantial changes in form and function (e.g. in leaf form, leaf size, phyllotaxy, internode length, anthocyanin pigmentation, rooting ability, or wood structure). These plants were called “heteroblastic” by Karl Goebel more than a century ago, but the functional significance of this type of ontogenetic change, the evolutionary trajectories in different plant groups, even their frequency in the plant kingdom are still unresolved issues. We argue that slow progress is partly due to an on-going terminological confusion and the lack of distinction between other developmental processes such as ontogenetic drift. This review develops a conceptual framework for future scientific work, proposes a quantitative index of heteroblasty, and discusses the evidence for developmental regulation, functional significance, and evolutionary implications of heteroblasty to provide a stimulating basis for further research with this fascinating group of plants. 3aanthocyanins 3aleaves 3aontogeny 3aphyllotaxy 3apigmentation 3arooting 3awood anatomy1 aWilhelm, Kerstin1 aBecker, Annette0 tbotanical review.g2011 June, v. 77, no. 2 p.109-151dH.A.

The purposes of this study were to determine the relationship between frequency of performance appraisal and employees' absenteeism and turnover rate and to investigate the managers' attitudes toward appraisals. Respondents were from Missouri schools, long-term care (LTC) facilities and hospitals (n = 214; 231 and 107, respectively). Absenteeism was lower in facilities where performance appraisals were conducted at least once a year, schools and LTC than in hospitals where appraisals were conducted less frequently (p < .05). However, no significant difference in turnover rate was noted among facilities regardless of the frequency of the evaluations. Most respondents had a mildly positive attitude toward performance appraisals (4.74 on a 7 point scale), agreed that appraisals were useful (6.19) and that employees performed better after an evaluation (5.04). Overall, respondents' attitude scores were significantly higher if evaluations were performed to determine wages, and to anlayze strengths and weaknesses of employees, rather than if they were required by administration. These data confirm the usefulness of performance appraisals in lowering absenteeism of foodservice employees. 3afood service 3aperformance appraisals 0alabor turnover 0awork norms1 aHoldt, C.S.1 aZahler, L.P.1 aGates, G.E.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1994 May, v. 7, no. 4 p.243-254x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle03349naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245013800173300001600311500001500327520174200342650002002084650001102104650001302115650001402128650002602142650001302168650002402181650002602205650002102231650002602252650001402278650001402292650001402306650001902320650002102339650001202360651001602372653002402388653001502412653002502427653002702452653002202479653002602501700001702527700001702544773007602561852000902637856009202646930003302738945001302771946001102784655001202795IND2325284920221120055147.0020208e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232528492DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00604.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellingham, P.J.10aDifferential facilitation by a nitrogen-fixing shrub during primary succession influences relative performance of canopy tree species  ap. 861-875.  a2019-12-04  a1. The facilitative and inhibitory effects of a nitrogen-fixing shrub, Carmichaelia odorata, during primary succession were studied using both field measurements in a New Zealand temperate montane valley, and manipulative glasshouse experiments on seedlings of the three dominant tree species, Griselinia littoralis, Metrosideros umbellata and Weinmannia racemosa. 2. During a stand development chronosequence of < 100 years in which Carmichaelia colonized, dominated and senesced, there was significant development of soil organic horizons and a large build-up of soil nitrogen, especially in the organic horizon. Soil organic matter and nitrogen levels across the sequence were strongly correlated with the main DCA axis of vascular plant species composition, along which there was change in dominance from herbaceous to woody species. Vegetation increased in height and light levels declined with stand development. 3. Similar responses to shade that mimicked that in mature Carmichaelia stands suggested that inhibitory effects were likely to be uniform across the three tree species. 4. Nitrogen, either added via Carmichaelia litter or in solution, enhanced shoot biomass and foliar nitrogen concentrations of all three tree species. Growth in soils of increasing development increased foliar nitrogen concentrations for Griselinia and Weinmannia, but not Metrosideros. 5. Overall, Metrosideros was the least responsive to potential facilitative effects of Carmichaelia, and Griselinia exhibited the highest degree of plasticity of response. Future forest composition and spatial patterning of species in mixed stands here, as elsewhere, is likely to result from differential facilitative responses during early primary succession. 3achronosequences 3ashrubs 3anitrogen 3aseedlings 3agreenhouse production 3aFabaceae 3asoil organic matter 3aecological succession 3aorganic horizons 3abotanical composition 3aleaf area 3ahighlands 3amountains 3asoil fertility 3aroot shoot ratio 3aforests 3aNew Zealand 0aweinmannia racemosa 0asenescence 0acarmichaelia odorata 0ametrosideros umbellata 0astand development 0agriselinia littoralis1 aWalker, L.R.1 aWardle, D.A.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Oct., v. 89, no. 5 p.861-875x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00604.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02007naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245007500168300001600243520065900259650001500918650002000933650002900953651001100982653002700993653001901020653003001039700001601069700001901085700001901104700004201123700002301165700002001188700002201208700003301230700001901263700002301282773012301305852000901428856009201437930003301529946001101562655001201573IND4431160520221120040219.0100111e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443116052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0366.2009.00257.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, Terry.10aHousehold Production and Capitalist Development in Contemporary Russia  ap. 130-142.  aThis essay reviews four recent books based on research on the development of capitalism and the position of household-based farming in post-Soviet Russia. Each of the books represents a different set of conceptual assumptions and is based on different methods of enquiry. It is argued that a problematic feature of much of the literature on this topic is that it begins from the assumption that successful capitalist development in Russian agriculture should be based on the development of small-scale family farming. This tends to obscure the variety of forms of production that have emerged so far and the range of different relationships between them. 3acapitalism 3afarming systems 3aresearch and development 3aRussia 0acapitalist agriculture 0afamily farming 0apost-communist transition1 aLerman, Zvi1 aCsáki, Csaba.1 aFeder, Gershon1 aIoffe, G.

The monitoring of coastal waters for the presence of these microalgae is essential to identify correlations between cell abundances and environmental factors that regulate bloom dynamics. In the attempt to improve the monitoring sensitivity and the rapidity at which a large number of field samples can be processed, several molecular methods for the detection of genetically distinct HAB species have been developed during the last years. In particular, real-time PCR has been shown to be a powerful method for quantitative detection of HAB species in environmental samples. When a plasmid is used as a standard, the knowledge of the amount of target gene per cell is essential for the determination of the cell number in the field sample. In this study, we analyzed the rRNA gene content variability in several Alexandrium catenella and Alexandrium taylori strains isolated from the Mediterranean Sea using a real-time PCR-based approach. The rRNA gene content was also analyzed in different growth phases, from early exponential to stationary conditions. The results showed a general variability in the rRNA gene content depending on the strain and, for the species A. taylori, in relation also to the growth phase. These results should be taken into account for the application of the real-time quantitative PCR-based techniques for monitoring purposes in coastal seawaters. 3aAlexandrium catenella 3aalgal blooms 3acoastal water 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3amicroalgae 3amonitoring 3aplasmids 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3atoxicity 3aMediterranean Sea 0aHAB 0areal-time quantitative PCR 0aribosomal genes1 aBertozzini, Elena 1 aPenna, Antonella 1 aPerini, Federico 1 aGarcés, Esther.1 aMagnani, Mauro 0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2010 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.1-9dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-009-9411-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01480naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245004300149300001600192520029000208650002400498650002600522650003900548650001500587650001700602650001200619650002400631650002500655650002500680650001600705650003800721650005900759650002800818653002600846653002700872700001500899773008100914852000900995939003301004945000801037946001301045655001201058991614763020742620221120024448.0830308e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830022772DNAL7 a70774542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBueding, E.10aMetabolic requirements of schistosomes  ap. 208-212.  aSchistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, carbohydrate utilization, lactic acid production, and ATP levels under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with and without stress of increased metabolic requirements, results indicate that these parasites do not derive metabolic energy from respiration 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aSchistosoma japonicum 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAnimals 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlycogenxmetabolism 2aLactatesxmetabolism 2aLactic Acid 2aSchistosoma japonicumxmetabolism 2aSchistosoma mansonixgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSerotoninxpharmacology 0aMetabolism, Trematoda 0aRespiration, Trematoda1 aFisher, J.0 tJournal of parasitology.g1982 Apr., v. 68, no. 2 p.208-212x0022-33957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830308c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02955naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165072001700182100001600199245014900215300001800364520153800382650002201920650001201942650002301954650002501977650002202002650002402024650002602048650001002074650002502084650002902109650003302138650002502171653002802196700002002224773009702244852000902341856008802350930003302438945002502471946001302496655001202509IND4365042820221117163126.0041018e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436504282DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.10.11622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFischer, U.10aOverexpression of NtERTF5, a new member of the tobacco ethylene response transcription factor family enhances resistance to tobacco mosaic virus  ap. 1162-1171.  aA new member of the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) AP2/ERF (ethylene response factor) transcription factor family, designated NtERF5, has been isolated by yeast one-hybrid screening. In vitro, recombinant NtERF5 protein weakly binds GCC box cis-elements, which mediate pathogen-regulated transcription of several PR (pathogenesis related) genes. NtERF5 transcription is transiently activated by wounding, by infection with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, as well as by inoculation with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). In contrast, NtERF5 transcription is not enhanced after application of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, or ethylene. Constitutive overexpression of NtERF5 (ERF5-Oex) under control of the 35S promoter results in no visible alterations in plant growth or enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas infection. Furthermore, no constitutive expression of PR genes has been observed. In contrast, ERF5-Oex plants show enhanced resistance to TMV with reference to reduced size of local hypersensitive-response lesions and impaired systemic spread of the virus. Since, in TMV-infected ERF5-Oex plants, the viral RNA accumulates only up to 10 to 30% of the wild-type level, we suggest that NtERF5-regulated gene expression is controlling resistance to viral propagation. Previous research has demonstrated that overexpression of ERF genes enhances resistance to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Here, we provide further evidence that resistance to viral infection can be engineered by overexpression of ERF transcription factors. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atobacco 3adisease resistance 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3atransgenic plants 3agene overexpression 3atranscription factors 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3abacterial diseases of plants 3aPseudomonas syringae 0amolecular sequence data1 aDroge-Laser, W.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2004 Oct., v. 17, no. 10 p.1162-1171x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.10.11623Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle02161naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010200126300001600228500002400244520142400268650001801692650001801710650001101728650001501739650001001754700001901764773010301783852000901886655001201895IND4459448820221123041403.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445944882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Junfeng10aModeling and Prediction of Tree Height-Diameter Relationships Using Spatial Autoregressive Models  ap. 252-264.  aIncludes references  aThree spatial autoregressive models were applied to model the tree height-diameter relationship, including spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM), and spatial Durbin model (SDM), with ordinary least squares (OLS) as a benchmark. Five spatial weight matrices were used to evaluate the impacts of different weighting schemes on model fitting. It was evident that different schemes of spatial weight matrix strongly affected the model fitting and parameter estimation in these spatial autoregressive models. We found that the variogram or geostatistical weight matrix was superior to other spatial weight matrices such as contiguity, inverse distances, and local Gi* statistics. Further, the spatial autoregressive models were used to predict tree heights at unsampled locations. The results showed that the three spatial autoregressive models overperformed the OLS model not only in model fitting and reducing spatial dependence, but also in model predictions. In general, SDM and SEM performed significantly better than SLM, whereas SDM was slightly better than SEM in each aspect of model fitting and prediction. However, if the complexity of the model structure is a concern, SEM with a geostatistical weight matrix is a reasonable choice over SDM because SEM offers the model coefficient estimates close to those of the OLS model, which makes the interpretation and understanding of the model much easier. 3ageostatistics 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aprediction 3atrees1 aZhang, Lianjun0 tForest science.g2011 June, v. 57, no. 3 p.252-264dSociety of American Forestersx0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010200172300001600274520133500290650002001625650001001645650002001655650001901675650002201694650002201716650001801738650001401756650002101770651001301791653002401804653002301828653001701851653001501868773007601883852000901959856009201968930003302060945001302093946001102106655001202117IND2331038120221123041341.0030226e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233103812DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00662.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajaniemi, T.K.10aWhy does fertilization reduce plant species diversity? Testing three competition-based hypothesis  ap. 316-324.  a1. Plant species diversity drops when fertilizer is added or productivity increases. To explain this, the total competition hypothesis predicts that competition above ground and below ground both become more important, leading to more competitive exclusion, whereas the light competition hypothesis predicts that a shift from below-ground to above-ground competition has a similar effect. The density hypothesis predicts that more above-ground competition leads to mortality of small individuals of all species, and thus a random loss of species from plots. 2. Fertilizer was added to old field plots to manipulate both below-ground and above-ground resources, while shadecloth was used to manipulate above-ground resources alone in tests of these hypotheses. 3. Fertilizer decreased both ramet density and species diversity, and the effect remained significant when density was added as a covariate. Density effects explained only a small part of the drop in diversity with fertilizer. 4. Shadecloth and fertilizer reduced light by the same amount, but only fertilizer reduced diversity. Light alone did not control diversity, as the light competition hypothesis would have predicted, but the combination of above-ground and below-ground competition caused competitive exclusion, consistent with the total competition hypothesis. 3aNPK fertilizers 3ashade 3alight intensity 3asoil fertility 3aspecies diversity 3aplant competition 3aplant density 3amortality 3aapplication rate 3aMichigan 0acompetitive ability 0awater availability 0abroadcasting 0aold fields0 tJournal of ecology.g2002 Apr., v. 90, no. 2 p.316-324x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00662.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02946naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245014600168300001600314520183000330650001602160650000902176650001302185650001402198650001302212700003002225700002302255700002102278700002102299700002202320773011602342852000902458856008302467939003302550946001302583655001202596IND4478802220221123041339.0140325e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447880222DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.244.2.1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrpich, Cassandra Y.10aSecond intention healing after wide local excision of soft tissue sarcomas in the distal aspects of the limbs in dogs: 31 cases (2005–2012)  ap. 187-194.  aObjective-To determine outcomes for dogs with soft tissue sarcomas in the distal aspects of the limbs that underwent second intention healing after wide excision (2-cm lateral surgical margins and a margin 1 fascial plane deep) of the tumors. Design-Retrospective case series. Animals-31 dogs with soft tissue sarcomas in the distal aspects of the limbs that underwent second intention healing following wide local excision of their tumors. Procedures-Tumors were excised with 2-cm lateral margins and a margin 1 fascial plane deep to tumors. Wounds healed by means of second intention. Time to healing, complications during healing, and information regarding tumor recurrence were recorded. Results-All tumors were excised with histologically tumor-free margins. Twenty-nine (93.5%) wounds healed completely by second intention (median time, 53 days). Two (6.5%) dogs required free skin graft procedures to facilitate healing. Complications during open wound management developed for 7 (22.6%) dogs. Long-term complications were detected for 8 (25.8%) dogs, including intermittent epidermal disruption (5/31 [16.1%]) and wound contracture (3/31 [9.7%]). All complications were managed conservatively. Local tumor recurrence was detected for 1 (3.2%) dog. Median follow-up time was 980 days (range, 380 to 2,356 days). No patients died because of tumor-related causes. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results of this study indicated second intention healing of large wounds in the distal aspects of the limbs was complete and typically without complications for dogs that underwent wide excision of soft tissue sarcomas. Wide local excision of soft tissue sarcomas in the distal aspects of the limbs with 2-cm lateral margins and margins 1 fascial plane deep to the tumors provided excellent long-term local tumor control. 3acontracture 3adogs 3aexcision 3aneoplasms 3apatients1 aSantamaria, Alessandra C.1 aSimocock, James O.1 aWong, Hoong Kien1 aNimmo, Judith S.1 aKuntz, Charles A.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 244, no. 2 p.187-194x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.244.2.1873Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140325  aOther US 7aarticle03403naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245014600170300001600316520224200332650001302574650001102587650001402598650002202612650001402634650002402648650001902672650001402691651001102705653001602716653000902732653001102741700001902752773007602771852000902847856009202856930003302948945001302981946001102994655001203005IND2331037820221123041400.0030226e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233103782DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00660.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorvitz, C.C.10aEffects of plant size, leaf herbivory, local competition andfruit production on survival, growth and futre reproduction of a neotropical herb  ap. 279-290.  a1. The effects of natural variation in herbivory, local competition, plant size, and fruit production on next year's growth, survival and inflorescence production of individuals in natural populations of Calathea ovandensis were estimated during 5 years. 2. For each year, we estimated path coefficients (by standardized multiple regression analysis) for the direct effects of predictor variables on demographic rates. Separate analyses were performed for each life-history stage: seedlings, juveniles, pre-reproductives and reproductives, for a total of 55 analyses. Emergent patterns for stages were evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining years. To determine significance of effects in single years, we calculated table-wide probabilities for each stage across multiple years (Bonferroni sequential test). Emergent patterns for years were also evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining stages. 3. Survival of seedlings was positively affected by plant size and negatively affected by local competition. Survival of juveniles was positively affected by plant size, but not by other factors. Survival of large stages was not generally affected by any of the factors. 4. Relative growth rates of all stages were negatively affected by plant size; larger plants grew more slowly than smaller plants. Additionally, growth rate of juveniles was negatively affected by local competition, whereas growth rate of reproductives was positively affected by reproduction. 5. Next year's inflorescence production was positively affected by plant size for both pre-reproductive and reproductive stages. For reproductives, it was additionally positively affected by current fruit production. 6. Analysis of differences among years showed that herbivory negatively affected both survival and growth in 1985, but not in other years, whereas local competition negatively affected survival in 1983 and growth in 1984. 7. Effects of biotic interactions varied among stages and through time. The large effects of competition on seedlings and juveniles was as expected, but the small effect of herbivory on small plants was surprising as was the striking temporal variation in its effect and its impact on large plants. 3aCalathea 3aleaves 3apredation 3aplant competition 3amortality 3asexual reproduction 3ainflorescences 3aseedlings 3aMexico 0agrowth rate 0asize 0agrowth1 aSchemske, D.W.0 tJournal of ecology.g2002 Apr., v. 90, no. 2 p.279-290x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00660.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03577naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001600198245008500214300001400299500001500313520146200328650001801790650001501808650001801823650002201841650001401863650002001877650001701897650002101914650001201935650002001947650002501967650001501992650001902007650003802026650006702064650002802131650001402159650004102173650004202214650006302256650003302319650004202352650004902394650002402443650002502467653001602492653002002508653001602528653002702544700002002571700002002591700001702611773011002628852000902738856008502747930003302832945002502865946001302890655001202903IND4365046720221123041405.0041018e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436504672DNAL7 a147148642pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.1.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To test this hypothesis, the symbiotic responses of transgenic alfalfa plants that express a portion of the putative alfalfa lectin gene MsLEC1 or MsLEC2 in either the antisense or sense orientation were analyzed following inoculation with wild-type Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021. MsLEC1-antisense (LEC1AS) plants were stunted, exhibited hypernodulation, and developed not only abnormally large nodules but also numerous small nodules, both of which senesced prematurely. MsLEC2-antisense plants were intermediate in growth and nodule number compared with LEC1AS and vector control plants. The symbiotic abnormalities of MsLEC1-sense transgene plants were similar to but milder than the responses shown by the LEC1AS plants, whereas MsLEC2-sense transgene plants exhibited symbiotic responses that were identical to those of vector and nontransgenic control plants. MsLEC1 mRNA accumulation was not detected in nodule RNA by Northern blot analysis but was localized to alfalfa nodule meristems and the adjacent cells of the invasion zone by in situ hybridization; transcripts were also detected in root meristems. A similar spatial pattern of MsLEC2 expression was found by using a whole-mount in situ hybridization procedure. Moreover, mRNAs for an orthologous lectin gene (MaLEC) were detected in white sweetclover (Melilotus alba) nodules and root tips. 3amessenger RNA 3atransgenes 3aantisense DNA 3atransgenic plants 3ameristems 3aMedicago sativa 3aroot nodules 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aalfalfa 3agene expression 3aabnormal development 3anodulation 3aplant proteins 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMedicago sativaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Lectinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSinorhizobium melilotixgrowth & development 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 2aTransgenesxgenetics 0aMsLEC1 gene 0ahypernodulation 0aMsLEC2 gene 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aFujishige, N.A.1 aHackworth, C.A.1 aHirsch, A.M.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2004 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.16-26wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.1.163Available from publisher's Web site  a20050804b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/06  aOther US 7aarticle03005naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245006700169300001600236520170700252650001301959650001301972650001101985650001501996650001802011650002602029650001502055650001002070650002102080650002102101650002602122650001602148650002202164650001702186650001502203650001402218651001102232653001502243653001702258700001402275773007602289852000902365856009202374930003302466945001302499946001102512655001202523IND2331037720221123031106.0030226e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233103772DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00653.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundberg, S.10aHabitat requirements for establishment of Sphagnum from spores  ap. 268-278.  a1. The ecological significance of the spore in perennial bryophytes has been questioned. In Sphagnum, protonemata have rarely been observed in the field and P-concentrations in natural waters are insufficient for spore establishment. 2. We determined requirements for establishment of Sphagnum spores in growth chamber experiments. Up to 17 species were tested on peat with various natural substrates added and with different mire waters. In a field experiment, the effect of cover of nutrient depleted Eriophorum-litter was also tested. 3. There were large differences between substrates, and establishment appeared to be limited by the amount of phosphate released. Added moose dung or litter of Betula pubescens promoted establishment well above the low level seen on peat alone, or with added litter from Pinus sylyestris. 4. Species differed slightly in response to different mire waters and to added substrates, but these differences could not be attributed to the natural habitat of the species or their breeding system. There was a weak negative relationship between spore size and establishment success. 5. In the field experiment, about 1% of the sown, viable spores established in the presence of moose dung or Betula litter. With moose dung there was an indication that protonemata and plants of other bryophytes had a negative effect on the establishment of Sphagnum. 6. Nutrient release from litter and cover provided by vascular plants are needed to generate safe sites for the establishment of Sphagnum from spores, especially on wet, acidic and relatively nutrient-poor soils and peat. Recruitment from spores may therefore be important in Sphagnum, particularly following disturbance. 3aSphagnum 3ahabitats 3aspores 3aphosphorus 3awater quality 3afield experimentation 3aEriophorum 3afeces 3aBetula pubescens 3aPinus sylvestris 3anutrient availability 3aAlces alces 3aplant propagation 3aplant litter 3aphosphates 3aBryopsida 3aSweden 0asubstrates 0arequirements1 aRydin, H.0 tJournal of ecology.g2002 Apr., v. 90, no. 2 p.268-278x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00653.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01216naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245009300148300001600241520014800257650002500405650001500430650001200445650001800457650003400475650001300509650001800522650003100540650001800571650002800589650004400617650001600661700001500677773007700692852000900769939003300778945000800811946001100819655001200830991614759010742620221123030932.0830309e198209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830022652DNAL7 a67553632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamp, C.J.10aChemokinetic factors obtained from the larval stage of the cestode, Taenia taeniaeformis  ap. 373-381.  aTaenia taeniaeformis, saline extracts of metacestodes have chemokinetic as well as chemotactic activity for equine polymorphonuclear leucocytes 3aTaenia taeniaeformis 3aleukocytes 2aAnimals 2aCell Movement 2aChemotactic Factorsxanalysis 2aFreezing 2aHorsesxblood 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInterleukin-8 2aNeutrophilsxphysiology 2aTaeniaxanalysisxgrowth & development. 2aTemperature1 aLeid, R.W.0 tParasite immunology.g1982 Sept., v. 4, no. 5 p.373-381x0141-98387nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830309c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01622naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008200124300001600206520080500222650002401027650002001051650002101071650001901092651001101111653002001122700002301142773008701165852000901252930003301261945001301294946001301307655001201320IND2048217920221123015713.0951012e199505  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204821792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalay, E.14aThe nutritional value of nursery school meals served in Campinas City, Brazil  ap. 175-186.  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the nutritive value of food served in the nursery schools of Campinas City, Brazil.

In this study, we used linear prediction theory combined with linearized (with respect to random effects) nonlinear mixed models to investigate the improvement in model prediction achieved with autocorrelation. In this setting, predictions rely on estimates of common parameters obtained from a set of previous growth series and prior observations of new growth series, allowing the response variable for the new series to be projected either backward or forward in time. The prediction gains associated with using autocorrelation were evaluated using stem analysis data sets for black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) and red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.). The evaluations involved splitting the data and comparing models with one or more random parameters, with and without use of autocorrelation. Autocorrelation improved the projection of dominant height (site index) over short ranges (10-20 years), but the gain was trivial for the long range (>20 years). Consequently, in cases of dominant height projection based on one single observation, for practical purposes, autocorrelation can be ignored in both model-fitting and prediction stages. Cross-comparison between models with different random effects indicated that simple models with one random effect had the best predictive performance. Rather than excluding such models solely on the basis of certain fit statistics, it is recommended that the predictive abilities of models with a single random effect be evaluated, with and without correlated errors, relative to their counterparts with more random effects. 3aAlnus rubra 3aPicea mariana 3aautocorrelation 3adata analysis 3adata collection 3aforest growth 3amodels 3aprediction 3asite index1 aBhatti, Jagtar1 aWang, Yonghe1 aVarem-Sanders, Thierry0 tForest science.g2011 June, v. 57, no. 3 p.241-251dSociety of American Forestersx0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01088naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245007400140300001800214500001500232520017900247650001400426653001700440653003100457653004800488653002100536653001800557653001600575700001600591773009400607852000900701939003300710945000800743946001100751655001200762991614757960742620221123015630.0830713e198211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830063052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuralidharam, S.R.G.10aNote on age resistance to Oesophagostomum quadrispinulatum in piglets  ap. 1144-1145.  a2019-12-05  aOesophagostomum quadrispinulatum, piglets (exper.), no evidence of innate age resistance as measured by worm burden, nodule formation in alimentary canal, or host growth rate 3ahelminths 0aGrowth, Host 0aanimal parasites and pests 0aOesophagostomum quadrispinulatum (Nematoda) 0aResistance, Host 0aanimal health 0aAge of host1 aSingh, K.S.0 tIndian journal of animal sciences.g1982 Nov., v. 52, no. 11 p.1144-1145x0367-83187nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830713c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03483naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167072001700184100001600201245011700217300001800334500001500352520152900367650002701896650001101923650002501934650002001959650001001979650002501989650001902014650001402033650002402047650006702071650001802138650002002156650002602176650003002202650001802232650002202250650002202272650002802294650002302322650003402345650002402379653001302403653002802416653001802444653002402462653001402486700001602500700001502516700001802531700001902549773009702568852000902665856008802674930003302762945002502795946001302820655001202833IND4365042320221123015729.0041018e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436504232DNAL7 a154974042pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.10.11142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSchurch, S.10aMolecular population genetic analysis differentiates two virulence mechanisms of the fungal avirulence gene NIP1  ap. 1114-1125.  a2019-12-04  aDeletion or alteration of an avirulence gene are two mechanisms that allow pathogens to escape recognition mediated by the corresponding resistance gene in the host. We studied these two mechanisms for the NIP1 avirulence gene in field populations of the fungal barley pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis. The product of the avirulence gene, NIP1, causes leaf necrosis and elicits a defense response on plants with the Rrs1 resistance gene. A high NIP1 deletion frequency (45%) was found among 614 isolates from different geographic populations on four continents. NIP1 was also sequenced for 196 isolates, to identify DNA polymorphisms and corresponding NIP1 types. Positive diversifying selection was found to act on NIP1. A total of 14 NIP1 types were found, 11 of which had not been described previously. The virulence of the NIP1 types was tested on Rrs1 and rrs1 barley lines. Isolates carrying three of these types were virulent on the Rrs1 cultivar. One type each was found in California, Western Europe, and Jordan. Additionally, a field experiment with one pair of near-isogenic lines was conducted to study the selection pressure imposed by Rrs1 on field populations of R. secalis. Deletion of NIP1 was the only mechanism used to infect the Rrs1 cultivar in the field experiment. In this first comprehensive study on the population genetics of a fungal avirulence gene, virulence to Rrs1 in R. secalis was commonly achieved through deletion of the NIP1 avirulence gene but rarely also through point mutations in NIP1. 3aRhynchosporium secalis 3abarley 3agenetic polymorphism 3aHordeum vulgare 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3ascald diseases 3avirulence 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscomycotaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aBase Sequence 2aCodonxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Variation 2aHordeumxvirology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aVirulencexgenetics 0amutation 0amolecular sequence data 0apathogenicity 0apopulation genetics 0aNIP1 gene1 aLinde, C.C.1 aKnogge, W.1 aJackson, L.F.1 aMcDonald, B.A.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2004 Oct., v. 17, no. 10 p.1114-1125x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.10.11143Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle03468naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167072001700184100001400201245015800215300001800373520156300391650004301954650001301997650001202010650002202022650003702044650002002081650001802101650001002119650002302129650001602152650001002168650002702178650001802205650003202223650002002255650001702275650005002292650001302342650004902355650001402404650003002418650004202448650003802490700001502528700001302543700001602556700002902572773009702601852000902698856008802707930003302795945002502828946001302853655001202866IND4365042220221123015740.0041018e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436504222DNAL7 a154974032pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.10.11032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGao, L.L.10aExpression patterns of defense-related genes in different types of arbuscular mycorrhizal development in wild-type and mycorrhiza-defective mutant tomato  ap. 1103-1113.  aThe expression of defense-related genes was analyzed in the interactions of six arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi with the roots of wild-type tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) cv. 76R and of the near-isogenic mycorrhiza-defective mutant rmc. Depending on the fungal species, wild-type tomato forms both major morphological AM types, Arum and Paris. The mutant rmc blocks the penetration of the root surface or invasion of the root cortex by most species of AM fungi, but one fungus has been shown to develop normal mycorrhizas. In the wild-type tomato, accumulation of mRNA representing a number of defense-related genes was low in Arum-type interactions, consistent with findings for this AM morphotype in other plant species. In contrast, Paris-type colonization, particularly by members of the family Gigasporaceae, was accompanied by a substantial transient increase in expression of some defense-related genes. However, the extent of root colonization did not differ significantly in the two wild-type AM morphotypes, suggesting that accumulation of defense gene products per se does not limit mycorrhiza development. In the mutant, interactions in which the fungus failed to penetrate the root lacked significant accumulation of defense gene mRNAs. However, phenotypes in which the fungus penetrated epidermal or hypodermal cells were associated with an enhanced and more prolonged gene expression. These results are discussed in relation to the mechanisms that may underlie the specificity of the interactions between AM fungi and the rmc mutant. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atomatoes 3amutants 3amycorrhizal fungi 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3agenes 3adefense mechanisms 3aEndogonales 3aroots 3amicrobial colonization 3aGigasporaceae 2aFungixgrowth & development 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aMutation 2aMycorrhizaexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aKnogge, W.1 aDelp, G.1 aSmith, F.A.1 aSmith, S.

Kp342 relieved nitrogen (N) deficiency symptoms and increased total N and N concentration in the plant. Nitrogen fixation was confirmed by 15N isotope dilution in the plant tissue and in a plant product, chlorophyll. All of these observations were in contrast to uninoculated plants, plants inoculated with a nitrogen-fixing mutant of Kp342, and plants inoculated with dead Kp342 cells. Nitrogenase reductase was produced by Kp342 in the intercellular space of the root cortex. Wild-type Kp342 and the nifH mutant colonized the interior of wheat roots in equal numbers on a fresh weight basis. The nitrogen fixation phenotype described here was specific to cv. Trenton. Inoculation of cvs. Russ or Stoa with Kp342 resulted in no relief of nitrogen deficiency symptoms. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3anitrogen fixation 3aroots 3asymbiosis 3aendophytes 3anitrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3anitrogen content 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aKlebsiella pneumoniaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aOxidoreductasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aSymbiosis 2aTriticumxmetabolismxmicrobiology.1 aDong, Y.1 aTriplett, E.W.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2004 Oct., v. 17, no. 10 p.1078-1085x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.10.10783Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle01722naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245009800122300001600220500001500236520077900251650002201030650001701052650002301069650000801092650001001100650001801110650001301128651001501141653001301156653002001169700001501189773008801204852000901292930003301301945001301334946001301347655001201360IND2049905320221122184707.0960216e199512  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204990532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, A.10aInfluence of microwave heating and steaming on sensory and moisture content of Moo-Shu shells  ap. 243-247.  a2019-12-05  aMoo-Shu shells (oriental-style flour tortilla) prepared by 2 cooking methods (steaming and microwave heating) were served to 42 taste panelists for sensory evaluation.

The moisture contents determined by an oven drying method were 34% and 36% for steamed and microwaved samples, respectively. Two samples were showing equally satisfying sensory characteristics; while preparation time for microwave heating was much less than that for steaming.

The negative effects of pollutants on the environment and on human health are diverse and depend on the nature of the pollution. The search for alternative methods for excavation and incineration to clean polluted sites resulted in the application of bioremediation techniques. In this review, we describe some generally accepted bioremediation tools and subsequently focus on the combination of two approaches, phytoremediation and bioaugmentation, resulting in rhizoremediation. During rhizoremediation, exudates derived from the plant can help to stimulate the survival and action of bacteria, which subsequently results in a more efficient degradation of pollutants. The root system of plants can help to spread bacteria through soil and help to penetrate otherwise impermeable soil layers. The inoculation of pollutant-degrading bacteria on plant seed can be an important additive to improve the efficiency of phytoremediation or bioaugmentation. 3arhizosphere 3asoil pollution 3aroot exudates 3apollutants 3asoil microorganisms 3aphytoremediation 3abiodegradation 3apolluted soils 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 0aliterature reviews 0arhizoremediation 0aplants1 aLagendijk, E.L.1 aBloemberg, G.V.1 aLugtenberg, B.J.J.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2004 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.6-15x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.1.63Available from publisher's Web site  a20050804b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/06  aOther US 7aarticle02442naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002000138245010600158300001400264500002400278500002300302520128000325650001801605650001901623650001601642650001801658650001701676650001301693650001501706650001801721650002301739650002001762650001501782650001101797651001101808700002201819700001901841773008501860852000901945856007801954655001202032IND4459446820190506000000.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445944682DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc87086-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBescond, Hervé10aPartial harvests in the boreal forest: response of the understory vegetation five years after harvest  ap. 86-98.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aIn the eastern boreal forest of Canada long fire cycles allow for a significant portion of stands to become old growth. These old-growth boreal forest stands are subjected to secondary disturbances that create uneven structure, which supports a variety of types of organisms. In order to maintain the proportion of stands with uneven structure on the landscape, partial cuts have been suggested as a management technique that could create or maintain these uneven structures. This study compares the effects of partial and low-retention harvests and UN-harvested control on understory plants in four sites five years after harvest. The relative abundance of species was examined by a habitat group. While richness did not vary among treatments, increasing severity of harvest favored pioneer species that prefer disturbed mineral soil and high light levels. Sites with thicker organic layers that were harvested in the winter were significantly less impacted by both partial and low retention harvest. Canopy opening alone had little impact in the three most northern sites. As old-growth black spruce forests are open by nature, this suggests that soil perturbation is a bigger driver of community change after harvest than proportion of canopy removed for this forest type. 3aPicea mariana 3aboreal forests 3acanopy gaps 3aforest stands 3aforest types 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amineral soils 3aold-growth forests 3apioneer species 3aunderstory 3awinter 3aCanada1 aFenton, Nicole J.1 aBergeron, Yves0 tForestry chronicle.g2011 , v. 87, no. 1 p.86-98wJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc87086-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02889naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245016200169300001600331500001500347520146200362650001101824650001701835650001201852650001401864650000901878650002501887650001001912650001401922650002601936650001101962650002501973650001301998650002202011650002202033650001302055650001202068650001102080651001102091653001702102653001602119653001402135773007602149852000902225856009202234930003302326945001302359946001102372655001202383IND2331902720221122144000.0030410e200212  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233190272DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00723.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCronberg, N.10aColonization dynamics of the clonal moss Hylocomium splendens on islands in a Baltic land uplift area: reproduction, genet distribution and genetic variation  ap. 925-935.  a2019-12-04  a1. Islands representing four stage classes, dated by their height above sea level, in a Baltic land uplift area were used to study genet level dynamics during colonization of the clonal moss Hylocomium splendens. Allozyme electrophoresis involving 10 polymorphic loci enabled accurate identification of 103 haplotypes from a sample of 694 shoots collected along transects across 10 islands. 2. The populations consisted initially of scattered colonies with single clones. The number of clones, and the tendency of colonies to be multiclonal, increased significantly with increasing age of islands, whilst their mean size decreased significantly. In the Skeppsvik Archipelago, H. splendens thus shows repeated recruitment. 3. The percentage male or female fertile shoots relative to sterile shoots was positively correlated with age of the islands. The sex ratios were skewed during early colonization. 4. Spore capsules were found only in the oldest succession stage-classes. This can be explained by a greater chance for fertile males and females to grow within the fertilization range, which is limited to a few centimetres. 5. Genetic variation was accumulating with increasing population age. Correlations were stronger for mean number of alleles per locus (A) than for gene diversity (H(s)). 6. No isolation by distance was detected among populations, indicating efficient and essentially random gene flow, probably occurring via wind-dispersed spores. 3aspores 3areproduction 3aislands 3aallozymes 3aloci 3aspatial distribution 3amales 3asex ratio 3aecological succession 3aclones 3aHylocomium splendens 3agenotype 3apopulation growth 3agenetic variation 3aaltitude 3afemales 3ashoots 3aSweden 0acolonization 0arecruitment 0afertility0 tJournal of ecology.g2002 Dec., v. 90, no. 6 p.925-935x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00723.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03159naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006500129300001800194500016300212500002400375520205600399650001502455650001002470650001602480650001302496650001602509650002002525650001702545650001602562700001702578773014202595852000902737856008702746655001202833IND4459448020221122144015.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445944802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlsson, M.G.10aHigh tunnel covering materials for northern field production  ap. 1333-1339.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on High Technology for Greenhouse Systems - GreenSys2009, Volume 2, held June 14-19, 2009, Quebec City, Canada.  aIncludes references  aHigh tunnels offer opportunities to increase yield, improve quality and extend the field season for specialty crops. Under northern conditions with naturally extreme day lengths and short seasons, high tunnels covered with non-traditional plastic materials may more effectively support crop productivity. Four commercially available greenhouse films were tested using 7.3 m (length) by 3.7 m (width) high tunnel structures. The evaluated materials were K50 Clear, K50 IR/AC, KoolLite380 (Klerks Plastic Product Manufacturing, Inc., Richburg, South Carolina) and Solatrol (Visqueen GCF 925C9, British Polythene Industries PLC, Greenock, UK). The temperature and light profiles were recorded for the plastics and compared to adjacent field conditions. K50 Clear and K50 IR/AC blocked radiation below 360 nm, Solatrol below 390 nm and KoolLite380 as expected, below 380 nm. In addition, KoolLite380 modified the spectrum with reduced radiation from 400 to 600 nm compared to other plastics. The temperature pattern in the K50 Clear and K50 IR/AC covered tunnels were similar although slightly higher during cold nights for the K50 IR/AC. During warm days, the KoolLite380 material maintained a cooler environment compared to K50 Clear. Raspberries and strawberries were grown to assess crop response. Container grown long cane ‘Tulameen’ produced more than 100 high quality marketable raspberries from each single cane plant. The highest yield was recorded under K50 IR/AC and the least number of raspberries were harvested on plants in the open field. A protected environment also resulted in higher strawberry yield. During three weeks prior to the end of season frost, the day neutral ‘Tristar’ produced significantly more under K50 IR/AC and K50 Clear at 125 g of berries/plant. The harvest was reduced to 80 g under Solatrol and KoolLite380 while the yield in the field averaged 50 g.

We characterize seed dispersal for 13 taxa from seed rain data collected over 13 years in 200 mesh traps, and for an additional species from germination from soil samples collected in one year. We describe seedling distribution patterns from a complete census of all seedlings of these 14 taxa present in 36 treefall gaps. 2. A maximum likelihood model, incorporating both distance to adult trees and tree size, fitted observed seed rain to traps quite well for all taxa. 3. The ability to predict seedling recruit number per gap varied greatly among taxa. For 8 of 14 taxa, regression models incorporating predicted seed rain were significantly better predictors of seedling recruitment than models in which recruitment probability was assumed constant in all sites. 4. To see if variation in local dispersal patterns determined the community composition of gaps, we examined the relative abundances of these 14 pioneer taxa in the 36 gaps. We found that taxon abundances were significantly positively correlated with abundances predicted from seed dispersal models and seed-seedling regressions for 27 out of 36 gaps. 5. Overall, we find evidence that limited seed dispersal is an important factor contributing, together with factors affecting post-dispersal recruitment success, to seedling distribution patterns in gaps. 3apioneer species 3acanopy 3aforest trees 3aforests 3aspecies diversity 3aseed productivity 3aseed dispersal 3aprediction 3aPanama 0acolonization 0asize 0arecruitment1 aMuller-Landau, H.C.1 aWright, SJ.1 aHubbell, S.P.0 tJournal of ecology.g2002 Aug., v. 90, no. 4 p.714-727x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00706.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03608naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245010100133300001600234520262700250650001602877650001602893650001802909650001302927650001402940650002502954650002702979651001503006653002703021700001303048700001803061700001603079773008303095852000903178930003303187945001303220946001303233655001203246IND2061574020221122115843.0980129s1996    ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206157402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCochran-Yantis, D.10aAttitudes and knowledge of food safety among Santa Clara County, California restaurant operators  ap. 117-128.  aThe idea for a food safety study within the restaurant population was brought to light by Joan Giampaoli, MS., R.D. The study's query began with the intent to bridge the gap between those restaurant operators who know about food safety yet do not practice it and those who not only know food safety principles, but actually put them to use. It was brought to our attention that eliciting truthful responses to actual restaurant practices would be extremely difficult. Consequently, the query became "what differences occur between restaurants with excellent environmental health code records and those having difficulty with food safety." Due to good timing and luck, the Department of Environmental Health, Consumer Protection Division of Santa Clara County, California, was in the process of examining their own inspection procedures and welcomed us as partners. The data collected from the study was useful to them in assessing the effectiveness of their current foodservice education program, identifying additional educational methods for restaurant operators, and in revising their inspection process. A follow-up study is planned after implementing these changes. Food safety and foodborne illness prevention are both a high priority with the Department of Environmental Health, Consumer Protection Division (DEH, CPD) in Santa Clara County, California. With the rising incidence of foodborne illness outbreaks across the United States it is imperative that restaurant foodservice operators become not only concerned with the dangers of foodborne illness, but also knowledgeable about how to prevent outbreaks. To measure attitude and knowledge regarding food safety, three hundred surveys were mailed to two separate restaurant operator populations in Santa Clara County, California. The two populations were separated by distinguishing favorable and unfavorable health code violation records dating between January 1994 and January 1995. Those restaurants with favorable health code records were hypothesized to be highly concerned and knowledgeable regarding food safety in comparison to restaurants with unfavorable health code records. Total response rate for the survey was 20.6%. Results of the survey indicated that restaurants with favorable health code records reflected a significantly higher level of concern and knowledge regarding food safety with a p < 0.05. It was concluded that restaurant operators possessing the necessary knowledge and an appropriate attitude and concern towards food safety are practicing these principles on a more frequent basis as evidenced by favorable health code records. 3afood safety 3arestaurants 3afood handling 3amanagers 3aknowledge 3alaws and regulations 3aattitudes and opinions 3aCalifornia 0ahealth care violations1 aBelo, P.1 aGiampaoli, J.1 aMcProud, L.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1996, v. 9, no. 2 p.117-128x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03438naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245009800189300001600287520145000303650002101753650001401774650000901788650002501797650001201822650003101834650003501865650001401900650002001914650002601934650003201960650003201992650003402024650005502058650001102113650002102124650006302145650000902208650002402217650003802241650003702279653000702316653002402323653002102347653000802368653002702376653002302403700002002426700001702446700002402463700001502487700002002502700001602522773011702538852000902655856009202664930003302756946001102789655001202800IND4425778520221122092041.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442577852DNAL7 a197514762pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3024.2009.01136.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLANGELAAR, M.10aSuppression of dendritic cell maturation by Trichinella spiralis excretory/secretory products  ap. 641-645.  aEvidence from experimental studies indicates that during chronic infections with certain helminth species a regulatory network is induced that can down-modulate not only parasite-induced inflammation but also reduce other immunopathologies such as allergies and autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms however, and the molecules involved in this immunomodulation are unknown. Here, we focus on the effect of Trichinella spiralis excretory/secretory antigens (TspES) on the innate immune response by studying the effect of TspES on DC maturation in vitro. Bone marrow-derived DC from BALB/c mice were incubated with TspES either alone or in combination with LPS derived from two different bacteria. As indicators of DC maturation, the cytokine production (IL-1α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-α) and the expression of various surface molecules (MHC-II, CD40, CD80 and CD86) were measured. Results indicate that while TspES alone did not change the expression of the different surface molecules or the cytokine production, it completely inhibited DC maturation induced by Escherichia coli LPS (E. coli LPS). In contrast, DC maturation induced by LPS from another bacterium, Neisseria meningitidis, was not affected by TspES. These results were confirmed using TLR4/MD2/CD14 transfected HEK 293 cells. In conclusion, T. spiralis ES antigens lead to suppression of DC maturation but this effect depends on the type of LPS used to activate these cells. 3aEscherichia coli 3ahelminths 3amice 3aTrichinella spiralis 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, CDxbiosynthesis 2aAntigens, Helminthximmunology 2aCell Line 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytokinesxsecretion. 2aDendritic Cellsximmunology 2aEscherichia colixchemistry 2aHelminth Proteinsximmunology 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class IIxbiosynthesis 2aHumans 2aImmune Tolerance 2aLipopolysaccharidesximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aNeisseria meningitidisxchemistry 2aTrichinella spiralisximmunology 0aDC 0aexcretory/secretory 0aimmunomodulation 0aLPS 0aNeisseria meningitides 0atoll-like receptor1 aARANZAMENDI, C.1 aFRANSSEN, F.1 aVAN DER GIESSEN, J.1 aRUTTEN, V.1 aVAN DER LEY, P.1 aPINELLI, E.0 tParasite immunology.g2009 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.641-645dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-98387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3024.2009.01136.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03615naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245014200187300001600329520168500345650002602030650002102056650001702077650000902094650001002103650002802113650002102141650001902162650001002181650001702191650001202208650005902220650003902279650003502318650002102353650002202374650002802396650001102424650003602435650001102471650002302482650003802505650001002543653003602553653002502589653001602614653002502630700002002655700002002675700001702695700001602712773012802728852000902856856009202865930003302957946001102990655001203001IND4425779420221122092034.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442577942DNAL7 a196742942pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02685.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavison, Z.10aControl of microbial contamination of Franz diffusion cell receptor phase in the development of transcutaneous breast cancer therapeutics  ap. 456-460.  aTo determine the micro-organism contamination of excised porcine (pig) ear, and evaluate the use of Cyclopore track-etched membranes (CTEM) for preventing ingress into Franz-type diffusion cells. Swabs were taken from four locations and used to inoculate Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) plates. Diffusion cells were assembled to include porcine skin with and without CTEM, and the receptor phase sampled periodically and spread onto plates. Five distinct colony types were isolated after incubation of all swabs on TSA plates at 37°C; on SDA plates, one fungal colony was found at 30°C and one at 37°C. The SDA agar plate incubated at 30°C resulted in the growth of a large diffused white fungal colony. No regional differences were observed. Without the CTEM, the receptor phase became contaminated within 6 h. With the CTEM present, microbial ingress was substantially retarded with visible presumptive fungal growth occurring at 24 h and detectable contamination on both microbiological media at 48 h. As expected, the native porcine ears were considerably contaminated. The ingress of contamination into the diffusion cell receptor phases can be largely, but not entirely, eliminated using CTEM. The addition of antimicrobial agents was necessary to eliminate micro-organisms that were observed at later time points. This article, while highlighting the presence of a high number of micro-organisms on native porcine skin, presents a practical means to reduce the risk of microbial contamination in transdermal/transcutaneous permeation studies, particularly in the study of cell cultures grown within Franz diffusion cell receptor compartments. 3aanti-infective agents 3abreast neoplasms 3acell culture 3aears 3afungi 3amicrobial contamination 3amicrobial growth 3arisk reduction 3aswine 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aBacteriaxisolation & purification 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapy 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aEarxmicrobiology 2aEquipment Contamination 2aFemale 2aFungixisolation & purification 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aSkinxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aSwine 0aCyclopore track-etched membrane 0aFranz diffusion cell 0aporcine ear 0atransdermal delivery1 aNicholson, R.I.1 aMaillard, J.-Y.1 aDenyer, S.P.1 aHeard, C.M.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 49, no. 4 p.456-460dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02685.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02298naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007200127300001200199520148500211650002601696650001401722650002201736650001201758650002401770651001001794653001001804700001701814773008501831852000901916930003301925945001301958946001301971655001201984IND2164007420221122070205.0980912e199712  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216400742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBednar, C.M.10aComputer use in foodservice departments of small hospitals in Texas  ap. 1-7.  aAlthough computer use by hospital foodservice directors appears to be increasing, small hospitals may have different needs and resources than large facilities. Foodservice directors at 42 small (60 to 200 bed) Texas hospitals participated in a mail survey aimed at identifying current computer software use and future needs. Thirty-four respondents used computer software for foodservice management and/or clinical nutrition purposes while eight did not. The most frequently used software applications were ordering food/supplies at 21 hospitals and patient status/diet orders and nutrient analysis at 20 facilities each. When directors rated the importance of software applications according to a 5-point scale from 1 (not useful at all) to 5 (very important), the highest mean ratings were: nutrient analysis (3.90); patient status/diet orders (3.81); inventory management (3.60); menu and recipe costing (3.56); ordering food/supplies (3.53); nutritional assessment (3.53). Thirteen directors were making free use of computer software supplied by a food distributor while 12 had purchased a complete software package related to foodservice management and/or clinical nutrition. Eighteen respondents were willing to pay a maximum of $1,000 or less for computer software, while 17 were willing to pay higher amounts. Vendors marketing computer software to foodservice directors at small hospitals may wish to focus on those applications rated highest in importance in this study. 3ahospital food service 3ahospitals 3acomputer software 3asurveys 3acomputer techniques 3aTexas 0ausage1 aPangan, T.A.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1997 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.1-7x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02061naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010800129300001600237520132300253651001801576700001801594700001501612700001701627773008301644852000901727930003301736945001301769946001301782655001201795IND2151410320221122070141.0980813s1997    ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND215141032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, S.E.10aFoodservice industry market profile study: palatability characteristics of U.S. foodservice beef steaks  ap. 193-210.  aPortion-controlled beef steaks for foodservice use were selected based on USDA Quality Grades from 50 purveyors in 12 cities across the United States to measure palatability traits. Steaks studied included the ribeye, T-bone, strip loin, centercut top sirloin, tenderloin, and cubed steak. Steaks were cooked on a foodservice-style clamshell griddle to a medium degree of doneness (70C) and served to a trained sensory panel. Additionally, Warner-Bratzler shear tests were performed on 1.27 cm cores of the cooked steaks. Overall, sensory scores for all steaks tested were > 5 on an 8-point descriptive scale. Tenderloin steaks were rated the most tender (6.4 on an 8-point scale) and strip loin steaks were rated the juiciest (5.93 on an 8-point scale). Generally, steaks collected from the Southwest and Mountain/Desert regions were tougher and drier (P < .05) than those from the Southeast region. Means for Warner-Bratzler shear values for all steaks were less than 1.7 kg, with tenderloin steaks being the easiest to shear (.93 kg). When differences between quality grade were found, Prime steaks usually scored higher (P < .05) for sensory attributes than Select and no-roll steaks. Results from this study indicate steaks purchased from the foodservice sector are tender; however, geographical variation exists. 3aUnited States1 aJohnson, L.P.1 aNeel, S.W.1 aReagan, J.O.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1997, v. 9, no. 3 p.193-210x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02398naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001800168245012300186300001600309500002400325520104700349650004801396650001001444650002001454650001801474650001201492650001601504650001201520650001001532650002301542650002801565653003001593653002601623700002001649700002101669773009401690852000901784856009001793930003301883945002501916946001101941655001201952IND4437330820221122052616.0100522e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443733082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aChoy, Ai-Ling14aThe effects of microbial transglutaminase, sodium stearoyl lactylate and water on the quality of instant fried noodles  ap. 957-964.  aIncludes references  aInstant fried noodles are typically made from flour of medium protein content. In order to examine the potential application of microbial transglutaminase (MTGase), a low-protein soft wheat flour (Australian Soft) has been used. Trials were carried out to evaluate the effects of varying proportions of three ingredients (MTGase, sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) and water) on product texture and colour of instant noodles. The variables were studied using a central composite design. Textural characteristics were assessed using the TA-TX2, colour by the Minolta Chroma meter and the results analysed by response surface methodology. MTGase and SSL enhanced the textural properties of noodles prepared with the low-protein flour and electron microscopy confirmed the enhanced development of structure within the noodles. No significant observable difference was found in noodle colour between the various treatment combinations. MTGase and water had an impact on fat uptake with an inverse relationship between water incorporation and uptake. 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3awater 3aenzyme activity 3ainstant foods 3anoodles 3afried foods 3atexture 3acolor 3amodel food systems 3afood processing quality 0asodium stearoyl lactylate 0ainstant fried noodles1 aHughes, Jeff G.1 aSmall, Darryl M.0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 122, no. 4 p.957-964dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.10.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02340naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002100168245013300189300001700322500002400339520103300363650001701396650001101413650001901424650001501443650001901458650002001477650001301497650002201510650000901532650002001541650002301561650001101584650001601595700002001611773009501631852000901726856009001735930003301825945002501858946001101883655001201894IND4437331320221122052535.0100522e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443733132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ106 0aQ5061 aKuwahara, Koichi10aSuppression of thermal denaturation of myosin and salt-induced denaturation of actin by sodium citrate in carp (Cyprinus carpio)  ap. 997-1002.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of sodium citrate (Na-citrate) on myosin and actin denaturation in myofibrils was investigated. Na-citrate significantly suppressed the thermal inactivation of Ca²⁺-ATPase of carp myosin in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect was greater than that of sorbitol. A similar effect was observed with myofibrils in which myosin is stabilized by F-actin binding. Na-citrate dissolved myofibrils at lower concentration than NaCl. Nevertheless, Na-citrate at 1M failed to denature F-actin in myofibrils, while 1M NaCl denatured F-actin almost completely. Na-citrate suppressed the NaCl-induced F-actin denaturation. Sorbitol did not show such protective effect on F-actin denaturation. Moreover, Na-citrate suppressed the freeze denaturation of myofibrils at lower concentration than sorbitol. Thus, Na-citrate was proved to be superior to sorbitol. It was suggested that Na-citrate alone could substitute sorbitol as cryoprotectant in surimi and NaCl as dissolving reagent of myofibril in thermal gel production. 3adenaturation 3amyosin 3asodium citrate 3amyofibrils 3aheat treatment 3asodium chloride 3asorbitol 3aprotective effect 3agels 3aCyprinus carpio 3amodel food systems 3asurimi 3anovel foods1 aKonno, Kunihiko0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 122, no. 4 p.997-1002dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0563Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03054naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100001900228245011400247300001800361500001500379520091500394650002301309650002101332650001301353650001201366650001901378650002501397650001801422650002501440650001701465650001401482650002201496650002001518650002001538650003701558650004201595650001201637650002201649650001301671650002801684650002501712650003201737650001101769650005201780650001201832653002301844653002501867700001801892700001401910700002001924700001601944700001501960700001801975700001401993700001702007700001302024773012202037852000902159856008102168930003302249945002502282946001302307655001202320IND4397176820221122052716.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439717682DNAL7 a179112292pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2007-04672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRandolph, T.F.10aInvited Review: Role of livestock in human nutrition and health for poverty reduction in developing countries  ap. 2788-2800.  a2019-12-04  aLivestock keeping is critical for many of the poor in the developing world, often contributing to multiple livelihood objectives and offering pathways out of poverty. Livestock keeping also affects an indispensable asset of the poor, their human capital, through its impact on their own nutrition and health. This paper outlines the linkages between livestock keeping and the physical well-being of the poor, and examines a number of commonly held beliefs that misrepresent livestock development issues related to these linkages. These beliefs limit the scope of intervention programs to promote livestock and limit their potential contribution to poverty reduction. Recognition of the complexity of the role livestock play in household decision-making and of the opportunities foregone due to these misconceptions can enhance the ability of livestock to contribute to human well-being in the developing world. 3adisease reservoirs 3ahousehold income 3azoonoses 3apoverty 3asocial welfare 3alivestock production 3apublic health 3adeveloping countries 3ahuman health 3alivestock 3afoodborne illness 3ahuman nutrition 3adecision making 2aAgriculturexeconomicsxmethods. 2aAnimal Husbandryxeconomicsxmethods. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aCommerce 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDeveloping Countries 2aDietxeconomicsxstandards. 2aHumans 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aPoverty 0aliterature reviews 0aeconomic development1 aSchelling, E.1 aGrace, D.1 aNicholson, C.F.1 aLeroy, J.L.1 aCole, D.C.1 aDemment, M.W.1 aOmore, A.1 aZinsstag, J.1 aRuel, M.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.2788-2800dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2007-04673Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/15  aOther US 7aarticle04155naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100002000194245016700214300001800381520190400399650000902303650001402312650002102326650001102347650002002358650002302378650001102401650002002412650002602432650002302458650001502481650003502496650001502531650002002546650001602566650002102582650002502603650002502628650002002653650001202673650003402685650002202719650001102741650004902752650003702801650005002838650005002888650001102938650003902949650002102988650004103009650002203050700001403072700001603086700001703102700001403119700001703133773012203150852000903272856008103281930003303362945002503395946001303420655001203433IND4397180420221122032125.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439718042DNAL7 a176447862pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2007-02152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Cellular prion proteins (PrPc) bind Cu, which appears to be required to maintain functional characteristics of the protein. The replacement of Cu on PrPc with Mn has resulted in loss of function and increased protease resistance. Twelve mature cows were used to determine the effects of Cu deficiency, alone and coupled with high dietary Mn, on brain Cu and Mn concentrations and on PrPc functional characteristics. Copper-adequate cows were randomly assigned to treatments: 1) control (adequate in Cu and Mn), 2) Cu-deficient (-Cu), and 3) Cu-deficient plus high dietary Mn (-Cu+Mn). Cows assigned to treatments -Cu and -Cu+Mn received no supplemental Cu and were supplemented with Mo to further induce Cu deficiency. After 360 d, Cu-deficient cows (-Cu and -Cu+Mn) tended to have lesser concentrations of Cu (P = 0.09) in the obex region of the brain stem. Brain Mn tended (P = 0.09) to be greater in -Cu+Mn cattle compared with -Cu cattle. Western blots revealed that PrPc relative optical densities, proteinase K degradability, elution profiles, molecular weights, and glycoform distributions were not different among treatments. The concentration of PrPc, as determined by ELISA, was similar across treatment groups. Brain tissue (obex) Mn superoxide dismutase activity was greatest (P = 0.04) in cattle receiving -Cu+Mn, whereas immunopurified PrPc had similar superoxide dismutase-like activities among treatments. Immunopurified PrPc had similar Cu concentrations across treatments, whereas Mn was undetectable. We concluded that Cu deficiency, coupled with excessive Mn intake, in the bovine may decrease brain Cu and increase brain Mn. Copper deficiency, alone or coupled with high dietary Mn, did not cause detectable alterations in PrPc functional characteristics. 3acows 3amanganese 3adietary minerals 3acopper 3anutrient intake 3anutritional status 3aprions 3aprotein binding 3anutrient deficiencies 3atemporal variation 3amolybdenum 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3abrain stem 3aprotein content 3aproteinases 3amolecular weight 3aprotein conformation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aenzyme activity 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Westernxveterinary 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCopperxadministration & dosagexdeficiency. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEncephalopathy, Bovine Spongiformxmetabolism 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aManganesexadministration & dosage 2aMolecular Weight 2aPrionsxdrug effectsxpathogenicity. 2aRandom Allocation1 aLiu, H.C.1 aLloyd, K.E.1 aHansen, S.L.1 aFry, R.S.1 aSpears, J.W.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.2895-2903dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2007-02153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/15  aOther US 7aarticle04619naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001500194245013900209300001800348500001500366520244400381650002302825650002202848650001002870650001602880650001802896650001202914650001702926650001602943650001302959650000902972650001102981650001002992650001503002650002503017650001703042650001203059650005103071650002103122650002803143650002403171650001303195650002003208650005303228650000903281650003003290650000903320650002203329650002203351650003503373650001203408653002003420653003503440700001603475700001403491700001503505700001803520700001203538700001403550700001403564773012203578852000903700856008103709930003303790945002503823946001303848655001203861IND4397181020221122012224.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439718102DNAL7 a176868902pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2007-01002doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aShingu, H.10aCharacteristics of developmental changes in the kinetics of glucose and urea in Japanese Black calves: Comparison with Holstein calves  ap. 2910-2915.  a2019-12-04  aThe current study was conducted to clarify the characteristics of glucose and urea kinetics in male Japanese Black calves, using a glucose and urea dilution method with stable isotopes, at preweaning (3 wk of age) and postweaning (13 and 26 wk of age) stages, in comparison with the kinetics of glucose and urea in male Holstein calves. Six Japanese Black and 6 Holstein calves were arranged in a 2 (breed) x 3 (stage) factorial block design. These 12 suckling calves were fed only whole milk, offered concentrate and or-chardgrass hay after 3 wk of age, and weaned at 6 wk of age. Under steady-state conditions, glucose challenges (1.0 mg/kg of BW; [U-¹³C]D-glucose) and urea challenges (both 2.2 mg/kg of BW; [¹³C]urea and [¹⁵N₂]urea) were performed at the 3 stages examined. There were no significant differences in plasma glucose concentrations between Japanese Black and Holstein calves at any stage, but the glucose concentrations at 3 wk of age were greater (P <0.05) than those at 13 wk of age in both breeds. The glucose pool size in Japanese Black calves was smaller (P <0.05) than that in Holstein calves at all stages. Within each breed, there were no significant differences between the glucose pool sizes at 3 and 13 wk of age, but the glucose pool size was larger (P <0.05) at 26 wk of age. Moreover, Japanese Black calves had greater glucose irreversible loss rates (P <0.01) than Holstein calves at 3 wk of age, and the glucose irreversible loss rates were less (P <0.05) on and after 13 wk of age in both breeds. Japanese Black calves had greater plasma urea N concentrations (P <0.05) than Holstein calves at all stages, and in both breeds, the urea N concentrations increased (P <0.05) with age. The urea pool size was smaller (P <0.01) in Japanese Black calves than in Holstein calves at all stages, and in both breeds, the urea pool size increased (P <0.05) with age. In comparison with Holstein calves, Japanese Black calves had greater urea irreversible loss rates (P <0.05) on and after 13 wk of age and greater urea recycling rates (P <0.05) at 26 wk of age. In addition, in both breeds, urea irreversible loss rates and urea recycling rates increased (P <0.05) with age. We conclude that Japanese Black calves have partially different glucose and urea kinetics from Holstein calves and that the kinetics of these metabolites in both Japanese Black and Holstein calves are strongly influenced by weaning. 3atemporal variation 3abreed differences 3amales 3abeef cattle 3ablood glucose 3aweaning 3adairy cattle 3ametabolites 3aHolstein 3aurea 3acalves 3aWagyu 3aanimal age 3anutrition physiology 2aAgingxblood 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxbloodxgrowth & development. 2aArea Under Curve 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aBreeding 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aCattlexbloodxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDiet 2aGlucosexpharmacokinetics 2aMale 2aNitrogen Isotopes 2aRandom Allocation 2aUreaxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aWeaning 0ablood chemistry 0aglucose irreversible loss rate1 aHayashi, H.1 aTouno, E.1 aOshibe, A.1 aKushibiki, S.1 aOda, S.1 aKatoh, K.1 aObara, Y.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.2910-2915dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2007-01003Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/15  aOther US 7aarticle05065naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001800193245017100211300001800382500001500400520247800415650001902893650001602912650001802928650001202946650003002958650000902988650002002997650001103017650001803028650002103046650001403067650001603081650002003097650001303117650001403130650002303144650002203167650002303189650002003212650002503232650002803257650001603285650004703301650001203348650003703360650001303397650004603410650001003456650002103466650005903487650001403546650005103560650001103611650001803622650003603640650001703676650001503693650000903708650000903717650002203726650004803748650001603796653001403812653001703826700001603843700002303859700001603882700001903898773012203917852000904039856008004048930003304128945002504161946001304186655001204199IND4397185220221121225626.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439718522DNAL7 a175917152pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2006-6512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGilbery, T.C.10aEffect of field peas, chickpeas, and lentils on rumen fermentation, digestion, microbial protein synthesis, and feedlot performance in receiving diets for beef cattle  ap. 3045-3053.  a2019-12-04  aTwo experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of pulse grains in receiving diets for cattle. In Exp. 1, 8 Holstein (615 ± 97 kg of initial BW) and 8 Angus-crossbred steers (403 ± 73 kg of initial BW) fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulas were blocked by breed and used in a randomized complete block design to assess the effects of pulse grain inclusion in receiving diets on intake, ruminal fermentation, and site of digestion. Experiment 2 was a 39-d feedlot receiving trial in which 176 mixed-breed steers (254 ± 19 kg of initial BW) were used in a randomized complete block design to determine the effects of pulse grains on DMI, ADG, and G:F in newly received feedlot cattle. In both studies, pulse grains (field peas, lentils, or chickpea) replaced corn and canola meal as the grain component in diets fed as a total mixed ration. Treatments included 1) corn and canola meal (control); 2) field pea; 3) lentil; and 4) chickpea. Preplanned orthogonal contrasts were conducted between control vs. chickpea, control vs. field pea, and control vs. lentil. In Exp. 1, there were no differences among treatments for DMI (11.63 kg/d, 2.32% of BW daily, P = 0.63) or OM intake (P = 0.63). No treatment effects for apparent ruminal (P = 0.10) and total tract OM digestibilities (P = 0.40) were detected when pulse grains replaced corn and canola meal. Crude protein intake (P = 0.78), microbial CP flow (P = 0.46), total tract CP digestibility (P = 0.45), and microbial efficiency (P = 0.18) were also not influenced by treatment. Total-tract ADF (P = 0.004) and NDF (P = 0.04) digestibilities were greater with field pea vs. control. Total VFA concentrations were lower for field pea (P = 0.009) and lentil (P < 0.001) compared with control. Chickpea, field pea, and lentil had lower (P <= 0.03) acetate molar proportion than control. Ruminal pH (P = 0.18) and NH₃ (P = 0.14) were not different among treatments. In Exp. 2, calves fed chickpea, field pea, and lentil had greater overall DMI (7.59 vs. 6.98 kg/d; P <= 0.07) and final BW (332 vs. 323 kg; P <= 0.04), whereas chickpea and lentil had greater ADG (1.90 vs. 1.71 kg/d; P <= 0.04) than control. Gain efficiency (P = 0.18) did not differ among treatments. Steers fed pulse grains had similar CP and OM digestibilities compared with a combination of corn and canola meal in receiving diets. Pulse grains are a viable alternative for replacement of protein supplements in receiving diets for beef cattle. 3acattle feeding 3abeef cattle 3adigestibility 3alentils 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apeas 3aliveweight gain 3asteers 3acrude protein 3afeed supplements 3acorn meal 3acanola meal 3afeed conversion 3afeedlots 3achickpeas 3arumen fermentation 3adry matter intake 3amicrobial activity 3adietary protein 3aacid detergent fiber 3aneutral detergent fiber 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCicer 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aDuodenumxchemistryxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysis 2aFermentation 2aLens Plant 2aMale 2aPeas 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxchemistryxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aWeight Gain 0adigestion 0afood animals1 aLardy, G.P.1 aSoto-Navarro, S.A.1 aBauer, M.L.1 aAnderson, V.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.3045-3053dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2006-6513Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/15  aOther US 7aarticle02723naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001100144245009200155300002000247520165600267650001301923650001301936650001301949650001601962650001801978650002301996650002402019650001702043650002702060650002902087651001002116700001502126773011602141852000902257930003302266945002502299946001302324655001202337IND4377290620221121225727.0060118e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437729062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLi, H.10aOne-dimensional airflow in unsaturated zone induced by periodic water table fluctuation  ap. W04007 (10p.  aThis paper investigates the vertical airflow driven by fluctuating water table within the lower layer of a coastal two-layered system. The upper layer is unsaturated and semipermeable, while the lower is permeable. An analytical solution of the subsurface air pressure fluctuation is derived on the basis of model simplification assumptions, the reasonability of which was examined by numerical solutions of the original nonlinear model. The airflow in the upper layer is controlled from the top by the constant atmospheric pressure and from the bottom by a temporally fluctuating air pressure P0(t), which is spatially constant in the unsaturated zone of the lower layer. For a sinusoidal head the amplitude of P0(t) increases with the frequency of the head fluctuation, the upper layer's thickness, and the unconfined aquifer's air-filled porosity and decreases with the upper layer's permeability. The phase shift of P0(t) ranges from 0 to pi/2, indicating a "time advance." Particularly, P0(t) is approximately proportional to the temporal derivative of the head for sufficiently thin or permeable upper layer and to the head itself for sufficiently thick or less permeable one. The fluctuation amplitude of the water table is always less than that of the head and can be only one tenth of the latter if the upper layer is sufficiently thick or less permeable, which may slow significantly the landward attenuation speed of the tide-induced head fluctuation in a coastal "air-confined" aquifer. The analytical solution was used to estimate the value range of the air permeability of the marine sand fill at a coastal reclamation area of Hong Kong. 3aair flow 3asoil air 3apressure 3awater table 3acoastal water 3aanalytical methods 3amathematical models 3acase studies 3aunsaturated conditions 3asoil transport processes 3aChina1 aJiao, J.J.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Apr., v. 41, no. 4 p.W04007 (10p-W04007 (10pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/08/21  aOther US 7aarticle02095naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245011100161300002100272500001500293520096800308650002301276650002701299650001501326650001101341650001001352650001201362650001901374650001201393650001801405651001201423653001801435700001501453700002001468773011701488852000901605930003301614945002501647946001301672655001201685IND4376894720221121225609.0051227e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437689472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W05021 (10 p.  a2019-12-05  aIn 1923, a U.S. Geological Survey expedition surveyed the water surface profile of the Colorado River through Grand Canyon with theodolite and stadia rod. In 2000, lidar overflights collected topographic data centered on the river corridor, allowing construction of a new water surface profile and detection of change in the profile since 1923. By registering the surveys with respect to each other on the basis of 11 locations that were independently determined to have been unchanged between 1923 and 2000, 80 rapids were directly compared for change between 1923 and 2000. The average change for all measured rapids was +0.26 m, indicating net aggradation of the coarse-grained alluvium forming the rapids throughout Grand Canyon. In addition, comparison of the two water surface profiles showed enhanced pool-and-rapid morphology. While 50% of the total drop of the river occurred in just 9% of the river distance in 1923, that value increased to 66% by 2000. 3atemporal variation 3ascientific expeditions 3atopography 3arivers 3alidar 3asurveys 3aremote sensing 3acanyons 3asurface water 3aArizona 0ageomorphology1 aWebb, R.H.1 aGriffiths, P.G.0 tWater resources research.g2005 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.W05021 (10 p-W05021 (10 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20070918b20071002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle02707naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001100161245005700172300002100229500001500250520159600265650002201861650002201883650001301905650001401918650001501932650001701947650001701964650001301981650001001994653002402004653002902028700001102057700001902068773011802087852000902205930003302214945002502247946001302272655001202285IND4376910120221121204104.0051228e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437691012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLi, H.10aAeration for plant root respiration in a tidal marsh  ap. W06023 (11 p.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper investigates the tidal effects on aeration conditions for plant root respiration in a tidal marsh. We extend the work of Ursino et al. (2004) by using a two-phase model for air and water flows in the marsh. Simulations have been conducted to examine directly the link between the airflow dynamics and the aeration condition in the marsh soil. The results show that the effects of entrapped air on water movement in the vadose zone are significant in certain circumstances. Single-phase models based on Richards' equation, which neglect such effects, may not be adequate for quantifying the aeration condition in tidal marsh. The optimal aeration condition, represented by the maximum of the integral magnitude of tidally advected air mass (TAAM) flux, is found to occur near the tidal creek for the four soil textures simulated. This may explain the observation that some salt marsh plant species grow better near tidal creeks than in the inner marsh areas. Our analyses, based on the two-phase model and predicted TAAM flux magnitude, provide further insight into the "positive feedback" mechanism proposed by Ursino et al. (2004). That is, pioneer plants may grow successfully near the creek where the root aeration condition is optimal. The roots of the pioneer plants can soften and loosen the rhizosphere soil, which increases the evapotranspiration rate, the soil porosity, and absolute permeability and weakens the capillary effects. These, in turn, improve further the root aeration conditions and may lead to colonization by plants less resistant to anaerobic conditions. 3asalt marsh plants 3asimulation models 3aaeration 3aequations 3awater flow 3asoil texture 3asalt marshes 3aair flow 3aroots 0amathematical models 0asoil physical properties1 aLi, L.1 aLockington, D.0 tWater resources research.g2005 June, v. 41, no. 6 p.W06023 (11 p-W06023 (11 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20070912b20071002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle04224naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160100001800177245017100195300001800366520187000384650001002254650002202264650001602286650002302302650001402325650003002339650001302369650002002382650002202402650001002424650002702434650002802461650002102489650001402510650002002524650002002544650001502564650001402579650002002593650001202613650001402625650003602639650001802675650002902693650004302722650004602765650002402811650001902835650005902854650005702913650005202970650002203022650002403044650001003068650004703078650005503125653001803180700002103198773012203219852000903341856008103350930003303431945002503464946001303489655001203502IND4397989820221121204046.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439798982DNAL7 a177855952pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2007-03202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWilling, B.P.10aEnterocyte proliferation and apoptosis in the caudal small intestine is influenced by the composition of colonizing commensal bacteria in the neonatal gnotobiotic pig  ap. 3256-3266.  aWe previously reported marked differences in small intestinal morphology, including changes in crypt depth and villous height, after inoculation of germ-free pigs with different bacterial species. In an attempt to identify the mechanisms governing changes in villous morphology associated with bacterial colonization, 2 gnotobiotic experiments were performed. In each experiment, 16 piglets were allocated to 4 treatment groups including germ-free (GF), monoassociation with Lactobacillus fermentum (LF) or Escherichia coli (EC), or conventionalized with sow feces (SF). Piglets were reared under gnotobiotic conditions until 14 d of age, at which time whole intestinal tissue and enterocytes were collected for histological, gene expression, and protein analysis. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), Fas ligand (FasL), CD3ε, caspase 3 (casp3), and toll-like receptors (TLR)2, 4, and 9 expression were measured by quantitative PCR. Activated casp3 was measured by Western blot. Increased abundance of activated casp3 and transcripts encoding proliferating cell nuclear antigen, TNFα, CD3ε, and FasL was observed in SF and EC treatment groups compared with GF and LF. Expression of TLR2 was increased (P < 0.05) in the SF treatment and tended to be greater (P < 0.08) in EC relative to LF and GF. Results indicate that conventional bacteria and E. coli but not L. fermentum increase overall cell turnover by stimulating increased apoptosis through the expression of FasL and TNFα and by increasing cell proliferation. The differential regulation of TLR expression indicates that microbially induced changes may be mediated in part by these receptors. Induction of inflammatory responses and activation of apoptosis through death receptors appears to play a significant role in enterocyte turnover mediated by commensal bacteria. 3aswine 3agerm-free animals 3aenterocytes 3acell proliferation 3aapoptosis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aneonates 3asmall intestine 3aintestinal crypts 3avilli 3abacterial colonization 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aEscherichia coli 3ahistology 3agene expression 3aprotein content 3abiomarkers 3areceptors 3aanimal proteins 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aCaspasesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCell Division 2aErythrocytesxphysiology 2aEscherichia colixgrowth & development 2aFas Ligand Proteinxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGerm-Free Life 2aIntestine, Smallximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aLimosilactobacillus fermentumxgrowth & development. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSignal Transduction 2aSwine 2aToll-Like Receptorsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxanalysisxmetabolism. 0acell turnover1 aVan Kessel, A.G.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Dec., v. 85, no. 12 p.3256-3266dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2007-03203Available from publisher's Web site  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/12  aOther US 7aarticle02637naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245011600175300002000291500001500311520152400326650002201850650001601872650001501888650001101903650002401914650002201938651001201960653002401972653001601996653001602012700001502028773011602043852000902159930003302168945002502201946001302226655001202239IND4377296520221121204028.0060119e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437729652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W03004 (14p.  a2019-12-05  aAutomatic calibration routines for hydrologic models with multiple objective capabilities are becoming increasingly popular due to advances in computational power, population-based optimization techniques, and the recognition that a single performance measure such as the root-mean-square error is no longer sufficient to characterize the complex behavior of the catchment. However, as more objective functions are included in the calibration, the number of Pareto-optimal solutions as well as the number of "near" Pareto-optimal parameter sets increases. The calibration problem quickly becomes a decision-making problem. In the practical sense, users of automatic calibration routines have to face the task of selecting a set of suitable model parameters from the numerous Pareto-optimal sets. A new method of automatic calibration is proposed, which combines an effective optimization routine, based on multiobjective genetic algorithms, and Pareto preference ordering. In this case, Pareto-optimal points that are also Pareto-optimal in different subspace combinations of the objective functions space are preferred. The proposed method is used to calibrate the MIKE11/NAM rainfall-runoff model for a Danish catchment. The results indicated that the method is able to sieve through the numerous Pareto-optimal solutions and select a small number of preferred solutions. This is extremely useful to modelers who typically are required to provide the best estimated parameter sets with good overall model performance. 3asimulation models 3acalibration 3aalgorithms 3arunoff 3arainfall simulation 3ahydrologic models 3aDenmark 0amathematical models 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aMadsen, H.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.W03004 (14p-W03004 (14pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle04484naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176072001700193072001700210100001800227245021500245300001800460500001500478520199900493650001602492650001502508650001402523650001702537650002002554650003502574650002402609650002002633650002702653650001602680650002102696650002202717650002002739650001702759650001402776650001702790650002502807650001302832650004102845650003802886650007002924650001202994650003103006650002203037650001103059650001603070650001103086650001803097650001303115650000903128650004303137650001403180650004803194650002303242650001303265650002603278653002403304653002103328700001403349700001703363700001603380773012203396852000903518856008003527930003303607945002503640946001303665655001203678IND4397988720221121204049.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439798872DNAL7 a177097872pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2006-7922doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aQuinton, C.D.10aGenetic relationships of body composition and feed utilization traits in European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) and implications for selective breeding in fishmeal- and soybean meal-based diet environments  ap. 3198-3208.  a2019-12-04  aBody composition traits have potential use in fish breeding programs as indicator traits for selective improvement of feed efficiency. Moreover, feed companies are increasingly replacing traditional fish meal (FM) based ingredients in feeds for carnivorous farmed fish with plant protein ingredients. Therefore, genetic relationships of composition and feed utilization traits need to be quantified for both current FM-based and future plant-based aquaculture feeds. Individual whole-body lipid% and protein%, daily gain (DG), ADFI, and G:F (daily gain/daily feed intake) were measured on 1,505 European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) from 70 half/full-sib families reared in a split-family design with either a typical FM or a novel soybean meal (SBM) based diet. Diet-specific genetic parameters were estimated with multiple-trait animal models. Lipid% was significantly greater in the FM diet group than in the SBM group, even independent of final BW or total feed intake. In both diets, lipid% showed moderate heritability (0.12 to 0.22) and had positive phenotypic and genetic correlations with DG (0.37 to 0.82) and ADFI (0.36 to 0.88). Therefore, selection against lipid% can be used to indirectly select for lower feed intake. Protein% showed low heritability (0.05 to 0.07), and generally very weak or zero correlations with DG and ADFI. In contrast to many previous studies on terrestrial livestock, lipid% showed zero or very weak phenotypic and genetic correlations with G:F. However, selection index calculations demonstrated that simultaneous selection for high DG and reduced lipid% could be used to indirectly increase G:F; this strategy increased absolute genetic response in G:F by a factor of 1.5 to 1.6 compared with selection on DG alone. Lipid% and protein% were not greatly affected by genotype-diet environment interactions, and therefore, selection strategies for improving body composition within current FM diets should also improve populations for future SBM diets. 3amarine fish 3afish farms 3aCoregonus 3asoybean meal 3afeed conversion 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3agenetic correlation 3aliveweight gain 3aphenotypic correlation 3afeed intake 3afeed composition 3agenetic variation 3aanimal breeding 3aheritability 3afish meal 3afish feeding 3aartificial selection 3abody fat 2aAdipose Tissuexgrowth & development 2aAnimal Feedxanalysisxstandards. 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxgenetics 2aBreedingxmethods 2aEating 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aFish Products 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxgrowth & development 2aPhenotype 2aSalmonidaexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSoybeans 2aWeight Gainxgenetics 0aCoregonus lavaretus 0abody composition1 aKause, A.1 aRuohonen, K.1 aKoskela, J.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Dec., v. 85, no. 12 p.3198-3208dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2006-7923Available from publisher's Web site  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/12  aOther US 7aarticle04556naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001600211245017700227300001800404520250600422650001002928650001802938650001202956650001402968650001402982650002402996650002603020650001703046650001903063650002003082650002603102650002003128650002603148650001703174650001603191650001603207650001003223650001203233650002703245650002603272650001303298650001103311650003003322650001603352650002603368650002403394650002303418650004303441650001203484650001603496700001603512700001403528700001503542700001803557773012203575852000903697856008103706930003303787945002503820946001303845655001203858IND4397988920141224000000.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439798892DNAL7 a176094632pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2007-01062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRosendo, A.10aCorrelated responses of pre- and postweaning growth and backfat thickness to six generations of selection for ovulation rate or prenatal survival in French Large White pigs  ap. 3209-3217.  aCorrelated effects of selection for components of litter size on growth and backfat thickness were estimated using data from 3 pig lines derived from the same base population of Large White. Two lines were selected for 6 generations on either high ovulation rate at puberty (OR) or high prenatal survival corrected for ovulation rate in the first 2 parities (PS). The third line was an unselected control (C). Genetic parameters for individual piglet BW at birth (IWB); at 3 wk of age (IW3W); and at weaning (IWW); ADG from birth to weaning (ADGBW), from weaning to 10 wk of age (ADGPW), and from 25 to 90 kg of BW (ADGT); and age (AGET) and average backfat thickness (ABT) at 90 kg of BW were estimated using REML methodology applied to a multivariate animal model. In addition to fixed effects, the model included the common environment of birth litter, as well as direct and maternal additive genetic effects as random effects. Genetic trends were estimated by computing differences between OR or PS and C lines at each generation using both least squares (LS) and mixed model (MM) methodology. Average genetic trends for direct and maternal effects were computed by regressing line differences on generation number. Estimates of direct and maternal heritabilities were, respectively, 0.10, 0.12, 0.20, 0.24, and 0.41, and 0.17, 0.33, 0.32, 0.41, and 0.21 (SE = 0.03 to 0.04) for IWB, IW3W, IWW, ADGBW, and ADGPW. Genetic correlations between direct and maternal effects were moderately negative for IWB (-0.21 ± 0.18), but larger for the 4 other traits (-0.59 to -0.74). Maternal effects were nonsignificant and were removed from the final analyses of ADGT, AGET, and ABT. Direct heritability estimates were 0.34, 0.46, and 0.21 (SE = 0.03 to 0.05) for ADGT, AGET, and ABT, respectively. Direct and maternal genetic correlations of OR with performance traits were nonsignificant, with the exception of maternal correlations with IWB (-0.28 ± 0.13) and ADGPW (0.23 ± 0.11) and direct correlation with AGET (-0.23 ± 0.09). Prenatal survival also had low direct but moderate to strong maternal genetic correlations (-0.34 to -0.65) with performance traits. The only significant genetic trends were a negative maternal trend for IBW in the OR line and favorable direct trends for postweaning growth (ADGT and AGET) in both lines. Selection for components of litter size has limited effects on growth and backfat thickness, although it slightly reduces birth weight and improves postweaning growth. 3aswine 3aanimal growth 3abackfat 3athickness 3aovulation 3aembryonic mortality 3aparity (reproduction) 3abirth weight 3aweaning weight 3aliveweight gain 3aenvironmental factors 3amaternal effect 3aadditive gene effects 3aheritability 3alitter size 3aLarge White 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBirth Weightxgenetics 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aFemale 2aFetal Viabilityxgenetics 2aLitter Size 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aOvulationxgenetics 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSwinexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aWeaning 2aWeight Gain1 aCanario, L.1 aDruet, T.1 aGogué, J.1 aBidanel, J.P.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Dec., v. 85, no. 12 p.3209-3217dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2007-01063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/12  aOther US 7aarticle04573naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001400211245013300225300001800358500001500376520240100391650001702792650002302809650001702832650001802849650001402867650002002881650002402901650002402925650002402949650002002973650001902993650001103012650001703023650001703040650002503057650001803082650001003100650002303110650002503133650003103158650001203189650003103201650002603232650002203258650001103280650004403291650000903335650005703344650001503401650003403416650002303450653001603473653001803489700001703507700001503524700001703539773012203556852000903678856008103687930003303768945002503801946001303826655001203839IND4397989120221121172327.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439798912DNAL7 a177097802pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2007-03322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKause, A.10aDirect and indirect selection of visceral lipid weight, fillet weight, and fillet percentage in a rainbow trout breeding program  ap. 3218-3227.  a2019-12-04  aWe assessed whether visceral lipid weight, fillet weight, and percentage fillet from BW, 3 traits laborious to record, could be genetically improved by indirect selection on more easily measured traits in farmed rainbow trout. Visceral lipid is discarded as waste during slaughter, influencing production efficiency and production costs. Fillet weight and fillet percentage directly influence economic returns in trout production. The study comprised 3 steps. First, we assessed the degree to which selection on percentage of visceral weight from BW indirectly changes visceral lipid weight and the size of intestines and internal organs. The phenotypic analysis of weights of viscera, intestines, visceral lipid, liver, and gonads measured from 40 fish revealed that phenotypic selection against visceral weight was most strongly directed to visceral lipid, and to a lesser degree to intestines and gonads. Because genetic relationships among these traits were not established, it is not known whether indirect selection leads to genetic responses. Second, we examined whether direct selection for the fillet traits could be replaced by indirect selection on BW, eviscerated BW, visceral weight, visceral percentage, head volume, and relative head volume (head volume relative to BW). The selection index calculations based on the quantitative genetic parameters obtained from multigenerational pedigree data showed that genetic improvement of fillet percentage through direct selection (selection accuracy, rTI = 0.54) was equally efficient compared with indirect selection on visceral percentage (rTI = 0.54). Genetic improvement of fillet weight through direct selection (rTI = 0.56) was always more efficient than indirect selection, yet indirect selection for eviscerated BW (rTI = 0.50) was almost as efficient as direct selection. Third, the expected genetic responses to alternative selection indices showed that improved fillet percentage was mainly a result of a moderate decrease in visceral weight rather than of a major increase in absolute fillet weight. Moreover, fillet percentage is challenging to improve, even if it exhibits moderate heritability (h² = 0.29). This is because fillet percentage displays low phenotypic variation. In conclusion, fillet weight and fillet percentage can be increased by indirect selection against visceral percentage and for high eviscerated BW. 3afish culture 3aselection response 3avisceral fat 3aprofitability 3aphenotype 3aanimal breeding 3adressing percentage 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3agenetic improvement 3aselection index 3acarcass weight 3agonads 3afish fillets 3aheritability 3aphenotypic variation 3atissue weight 3atrout 3aselection criteria 3aartificial selection 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxgenetics 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aBreedingxmethods 2aFemale 2aLipid Metabolismxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aOncorhynchus mykissxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aOrgan Size 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSelection, Genetic 0ahead volume 0aanimal organs1 aPaananen, T.1 aRitola, O.1 aKoskinen, H.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Dec., v. 85, no. 12 p.3218-3227dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2007-03323Available from publisher's Web site  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/12  aOther US 7aarticle02254naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001600178245012800194300001900322500001500341520103900356650001501395650002401410650003001434650002401464650002101488650001901509650002301528650001601551650002201567653001701589653001601606700001601622773011401638852000901752930003301761945002501794946001301819655001201832IND4377291320221121172338.0060118e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437729132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The inverse solver for parameter estimation of the soil hydraulic parameters is then applied to multirotation transient flow experiments in a centrifuge. Using time-variable water contents measured at a sequence of several rotation speeds, soil hydraulic properties were successfully estimated by numerical inversion of transient experiments. The inverse method was then evaluated by comparing estimated soil hydraulic properties with those determined independently using an equilibrium analysis. The optimized soil hydraulic properties compared well with those determined using equilibrium analysis and steady state experiment. Multirotation experiments in a centrifuge not only offer significant time savings by accelerating time but also provide significantly more information for the parameter estimation procedure compared to multistep outflow experiments in a gravitational field. 3aestimation 3amathematical models 3asoil hydraulic properties 3aexperimental design 3agroundwater flow 3atransient flow 3aRichards' equation 3acentrifuges 3acomputer software 0aoptimization 0amethodology1 aNimmo, J.R.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Apr., v. 41, no. 4 p.W04015 (9p-W04015 (9pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/08/21  aOther US 7aarticle02973naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008200130300001600212500002400228520197900252650001402231650001202245650001502257650001902272650001602291650001102307650002202318650001202340650001802352650002602370650001602396651001802412700002202430700002002452700001702472773010102489852000902590655001202599IND4459451220221121172355.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445945122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKandel, William10aMoving Up in Rural America: Economic Attainment of Nonmetro Latino Immigrants  ap. 101-128.  aIncludes references  aRapid Hispanic population growth represents a pronounced demographic transformation in many nonmetropolitan counties, particularly since 1990. Its considerable public policy implications stem largely from high proportions of new foreign-born residents. Despite the pressing need for information on new immigrants in nonmetro counties and a bourgeoning scholarship on new rural destinations, few quantitative analyses have measured systematically the social and economic well-being of Latino immigrants. This study analyzes the importance of place for economic well-being, an important public policy issue related to rural Hispanic population growth. We consider four measures of economic mobility: full-time, year-round employment; home ownership; poverty status; and income exceeding the median national income. We conduct this analysis for 2000 and 2006-2007 to capture two salient periods of nonmetro Hispanic population growth, using a typology that distinguishes among nonmetropolitan areas by the categories of "traditional" immigrant destinations concentrated in the Southwest and Northwest, "new" immigrant destinations to capture recent and rapid Hispanic population growth in the Midwest and Southeast, and "all other" rural destinations as a reference category representing more typical nonmetro population trends. We also compare our results to those for metropolitan destinations. We find that place type matters little for stable employment but more so for wealth accumulation and income security and mobility. Compared with urban Latino immigrants, rural Latino immigrants exhibit higher rates of homeownership as well as greater likelihoods of falling into poverty and lower likelihoods of earning a measure of U.S. median income. From 2000 to 2006-2007, rural-urban differences deteriorated slightly in favor of urban areas. We conclude by discussing implications of these findings and those of addressing rural immigrant economic well-being more generally. 3aHispanics 3aLatinos 3aemployment 3ahome ownership 3aimmigration 3aincome 3apopulation growth 3apoverty 3apublic policy 3aquantitative analysis 3aurban areas 3aUnited States1 aHenderson, Jamila1 aKoball, Heather1 aCapps, Randy0 tRural sociology.g2011 Mar., v. 76, no. 1 p.101-128dRural Sociological Societyx0036-01127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01404naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099072001700117100001800134245009000152300001400242520056900256650001500825650002600840651001400866653001400880653002500894710007400919773007100993852000901064930003301073945000801106655001201114991614744340742620221121133434.0780701e197501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7899134982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effect of this cinnamon oil film for shelf-life extension and storage stabilities of wax apples (Syzygium samarangense L.) was evaluated over 12-day storage at refrigerated temperature (5 °C). Emulsion of cinnamon oil and surfactant at different ratios of 70:30 (ME1), 60:40 (ME2) and 50:50 (ME3) was incorporated into the films and the interactions between the emulsion and polymeric structure in films were analysed through physical, morphological and functional properties. The cinnamon oil emulsion-based gelatin films with a ratio of 70:30 exhibited significant increase in mechanical, water barrier, antioxidant activity and thermal stability. The increase in antioxidant activity of cinnamon oil films revealed that encapsulation of cinnamon oil in gelatin matrix better retains the bioactive compounds for food packaging applications. Cinnamon oil emulsion-based films significantly lowered the weight loss of wax apples (12.43%) compared to the control (unwrapped) wax apples (26.40%). Interestingly, this research indicates that encapsulation of bioactive compounds is governed by the ratio of oil to surfactant mixture in emulsion. It was proved that the film microemulsion with the 70:30 ratio of oil to surfactant (FME 70) have better overall performances as compared to the control (gelatin films) due to hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with protein network of gelatin. In conclusion, cinnamon oil emulsion-based films could enhance and modify the functionality of protein-based films creating a biodegradable, sustainable and cost-effective food packaging materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSyzygium samarangense 3aantioxidant activity 3aapples 3abiodegradability 3acinnamon oil 3acost effectiveness 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3agelatin 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3apolymers 3arefrigeration 3ashelf life 3asurfactants 3athermal stability 3aweight loss 0aEssential oil 0aEmulsion 0aBioactive compounds 0aActive films 0aPackaging material1 aRazifah, M.R.1 aMubarak, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1381-35321 aKam, Amin1 aVigneswari, Sevakumaran1 aRamakrishna, Seeram0 tFood bioscience.g2022 June, v. 47 p.101638-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1016383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245010500201300001800306500002000324520141800344592002801762596004001790596002701830650002601857650002601883650003201909650001301941650002101954650001201975650002301987650000902010650001802019650001602037650001702053650002002070650001402090650001702104700001802121700002002139773012702159856007302286852000902359655001202368IND60714393020221121064505.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071439302DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.132322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesbois, Andrew P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6052-876110aAntibiotics modulate biofilm formation in fish pathogenic isolates of atypical Aeromonas salmonicida  ap. 1373-1379.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAtypical Aeromonas salmonicida causes furunculosis infections of non‐salmonid fish, which requires antibiotic therapy. However, antibiotics may induce biofilm in some bacteria, which protects them against hostile conditions while allowing them to persist on surfaces, thus forming a reservoir for infection. The aim of this study was to determine whether atypical isolates of A. salmonicida increased biofilm in the presence of two antibiotics, florfenicol and oxytetracycline. A microtitre plate assay was used to quantify biofilm in the presence and absence of each antibiotic. Fifteen of 28 isolates formed biofilms under control conditions, while 23 of 28 isolates increased biofilm formation in the presence of at least one concentration of at least one antibiotic. For oxytetracycline, the most effective concentration causing biofilm to increase was one‐quarter of that preventing visible bacterial growth, whereas for florfenicol it was one‐half of this value. This is the first study to demonstrate that a bacterial pathogen of fish increases biofilm in response to antibiotics. Biofilm formation may increase the risk of re‐infection in culture systems and this lifestyle favours the transmission of genetic material, which has implications for the dissemination of antibiotic‐resistance genes and demonstrates the need for enhanced disease prevention measures against atypical A. salmonicida.  aPublisher supplied data  cCommonwealth Scholarship Commission  cUniversity of Stirling 3aAeromonas salmonicida 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacteria 3abacterial growth 3abiofilm 3adisease prevention 3afish 3afish diseases 3aflorfenicol 3afurunculosis 3aoxytetracycline 3apathogens 3atherapeutics1 aCook, Kira J.1 aBuba, Elizabeth0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2020 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.1373-1379dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.132323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011300165300001600278520127300294592002801567650001201595650002501607650002301632650002601655650001301681650000901694650001701703650001701720650000901737650001501746650001401761650001501775650001301790650002001803653001201823653002401835653001801859653002001877653002301897700002001920700001301940700001601953700005201969700001502021773012502036856008302161852000902244655001202253IND60597101020221122223159.0191231e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059710102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaochen10aSupramolecular proteinaceous biofilms as trapping sponges for biologic water treatment and durable catalysis  ap. 117-123.  aInspired by the bacterial biofilms and chorions of living organisms which are made by proteinaceous assemblies and functional for multi-applications, various artificial protein fibrils-based nanoporous films are developed, and show their potential applications in multiple fields. Here, a simple and environmental friendly method was identified to produce bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanofibrils based biofilms, through a combination of protein fibrillation and reverse dialysis. BSA nanofibrils formed biofilms through intermolecular interactions, the resultant biofilms showed tunable thickness by altering the initial protein amount, good stability in organic and salty solvents, transparency and fluorescence properties, hold high capacity of trapping different substances (e.g. nanomaterials, organic dyes, heavy-metal ions and enzymes), and further enabled applications in biologic water treatment and enzyme stabilization. Taken o-phenylenediamine as substrate, the trapped horseradish peroxidase showed a catalytic activity 9–38 folds higher than free ones in organic phase, together with enhanced stability.

However, the regulation of HSYA on different types of skeletal myofibers is largely unknown. Here, in vitro experiments found that the water extract of safflower could significantly increase MyHC I, MB and Tnni1 mRNA expression while downregulating MyHC IIb mRNA expression. Furthermore, HSYA triggered fast-to-slow fiber-type switching and increased gene expression related to mitochondrial biosynthesis both in vitro and in vivo. Autodock analyses proved that FoxO1 is a potential target of HSYA, and qRT-PCR and western blotting further showed that HSYA significantly promoted the activation of the FoxO1 signaling pathway. Additionally, the levels of PGC1α, downstream of FoxO1, also significantly increased after HSYA treatment. Together, our findings suggested that HSYA triggered a fast-to-slow myofiber-type shift through the FoxO1 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3abioactive compounds 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3ahealth promotion 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3amyocytes1 aWang, Zhijun1 aNie, Chenzhipeng1 aXue, Lamei1 aWang, Yu1 aLiu, Jinxin1 aFan, Mingcong1 aZhang, Duo1 aHe, Ruikun1 aZhang, Xuguang1 aQian, Haifeng1 aChow, Billy K.

New classes of antimicrobial compounds are urgently needed as the frequency of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microbes continues to rise. Recent metagenomic data have demonstrated that there is still biosynthetic potential encoded in but transcriptionally silent in cultivatable bacterial genomes. However, the culture conditions required to identify and express silent biosynthetic gene clusters that yield natural products with antimicrobial activity are largely unknown. Here, we describe a new antibiotic discovery scheme, dubbed the modified crowded plate technique (mCPT), that utilizes complex microbial interactions to elicit antimicrobial production from otherwise silent biosynthetic gene clusters. Using the mCPT as part of the antibiotic crowdsourcing educational program Tiny Earthᵀᴹ, we isolated over 1400 antibiotic-producing microbes, including 62 showing activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens. The natural product extracts generated from six microbial isolates showed potent activity against vancomycin-intermediate resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We utilized a targeted approach that coupled mass spectrometry data with bioactivity, yielding a new macrolactone class of metabolite, desertomycin H. In this study, we successfully demonstrate a concept that significantly increased our ability to quickly and efficiently identify microbes capable of the silent antibiotic production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiosynthesis 3aeducation programs 3ahealth services 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametagenomics 3amultiple drug resistance 3atranscription (genetics)1 aDorandish, Sadaf 1 aLindow, Rebecca 1 aSteltz, Megan 1 aShoukat, Ifrah 1 aShoukat, Maira 1 aChehade, Hussein 1 aBaghdadi, Sara 1 aMcAlister-Raeburn, Madelaine 1 aKamal, Asad 1 aDawit Abebe,1 aAli, Khaled 1 aIvy, Chelsey 1 aAntonova, Maria 1 aSchultz, Pamela 1 aAngell, Michael 1 aClemans, Daniel 1 aFriebe, Timothy 1 aSherman, David 1 aCasper, Anne M.1 aPrice, Paul A.1 aTripathi, Ashootosh 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 July 27, v. 19, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190804243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245017700166500001900343520112200362592002801484650001001512650001101522650001101533650001701544650002201561650001501583650001201598650001301610650001401623650001901637651001701656651001801673651001101691651002001702651001101722653001701733653002201750653002201772653002601794653001701820653001401837700001901851700001701870773011301887856007702000852000902077655001202086IND60728567520221122025943.0210308e20170113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072856752DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.5.e108242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWonglersak, Rungtip10aSalix transect of Europe: structured genetic variation and isolation-by-distance in the nettle psyllid, Trioza urticae (Psylloidea, Hemiptera), from Greece to Arctic Norway  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe common nettle (Urticadioica L.) is co-associated with willows (Salix spp.) in riparian habitats across Europe. We sampled the widespread nettle psyllid, Triozaurticae (Linné, 1758), from Urtica in willow habitats on a megatransect of Europe from the Aegean to the Arctic Ocean. The aim of this study was to use an unusually widespread insect to assess the influence of geographic distances and natural geographic barriers on patterns of genetic variation and haplotype distribution. Phylogeographic analysis using DNA sequences of two mtDNA regions, COI and cytB, shows that T.urticae specimens are organized into four regional groups (southern, central, northern and arctic). These groups are supported by both phylogenetic analysis (four geographically-based clades) and network analysis (four major haplotype groups). The boundary between southern and central groups corresponds to the Carpathian Mountains and the boundary between the central and northern groups corresponds to the Gulf of Finland. Overall these groups form a latitudinal cline in genetic diversity, which decreases with increasing latitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix 3aTrioza 3aUrtica 3abiodiversity 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainsects 3alatitude 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aArctic Ocean 3aArctic region 3aGreece 3aGulf of Finland 3aNorway 0abiogeography 0ahaplotype network 0alatitudinal cline 0aisolation by distance 0amegatransect 0aTriozidae1 aCronk, Quentin1 aPercy, Diana0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2017 Jan. 13, v. 5 p.e10824-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.5.e108243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015000165300001400315520119800329592002801527650001901555650001901574650002901593650002601622650001801648650001901666650001601685650001901701650001901720650001901739650001901758650002401777650001401801653001001815653002901825653002301854653001901877653001901896700001701915700001501932773012301947856008302070852000902153655001202162IND60597101220221122233432.0191231e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059710122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Songying10aGraphene oxide and carbon nanodots co-modified BiOBr nanocomposites with enhanced photocatalytic 4-chlorophenol degradation and mechanism insight  ap. 78-86.  aNon-metallic graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanodots (CDots) co-doped BiOBr ternary system (GO/CDots/BiOBr) were successfully synthesized via a simple one-step solvothermal process. The compositional characterization, optical and electrical properties of photocatalysts were investigated in detail. The prepared ternary photocatalysts possessed the excellent visible-light driven photocatalytic 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) degradation. Additionally, the 4-CP removal efficiencies decreased in the order of GO/CDots/BiOBr (88.9%) > CDots/BiOBr (62.9%) > GO/BiOBr (60.5%) > pristine BiOBr (46.9%) in 6 h under visible light irradiation. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal and the dechlorination efficiency by the GO/CDots/BiOBr were 58.4% and 78.2%, respectively, much higher than pristine BiOBr. The co-existence of GO and CDots on the BiOBr greatly promoted visible light harvesting and utilizing ability and inhibited the recombination of photogenerated electron/hole pairs. The synergistic effect between GO, CDots and BiOBr was expounded, and the photocatalytic reaction mechanism was proposed in detail via the band structure analysis and free radical trapping experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-chlorophenol 3adechlorination 3adissolved organic carbon 3aelectrical properties 3afree radicals 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3ananocomposites 3ananotechnology 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3areaction mechanisms 3asynergism 0aBiOBr 0aNon-metallic co-catalyst 0aSynergistic effect 0a4-Chlorophenol 0aPhotocatalysis1 aXiong, Yuhan1 aZhang, Jun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 527 p.78-86dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245017500161300001800336520158100354592002801935650001801963650002101981650002002002650001602022650000902038650002102047650002002068650001902088650001402107650001202121650001102133650003102144650000902175650001702184650001102201650002402212700001702236700002302253700001902276700001602295700002102311700001802332700001502350700001902365700001902384700002802403700001902431773012502450856007502575852000902650655001202659IND60779439420221121093855.0220608e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943942DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo03664e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuklaew, Phim on10aImprovement in the metabolic markers of prediabetic subjects due to the partial substitution of Taiken9 rice by RD43 rice in their daily diet: a randomized clinical trial  ap. 5987-5995.  aAlthough RD43 rice is characterized by high amounts of undigestible starch, its potential health benefits for prediabetic individuals remain unknown. Thus, the effect of regular consumption of RD43 rice on the glycemic response, body composition, and metabolic markers was investigated in a sample of 34 participants with prediabetes (aged from 32 to 68 years) who were randomly allocated to either the treatment or the control group. The first were required to consume RD43 rice (Glycemic Index [GI] = 78) containing 14.1 g of undigestible starch daily as a substitute for two meals per day while the second were given the Taiken9 rice (GI = 98) for 12 continuous weeks. The evaluations were performed at baseline, at the end of week 6 and 12, and at follow-up conducted two weeks after the intervention had ended. The results obtained at the week 12 assessment clearly showed a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR in the group that consumed RD43 rice. In addition, daily ingestion of RD43 rice markedly reduced body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), total fat mass, and waist circumference at both week 6 and 12 compared with the baseline. When compared with the controls, the treatment group also exhibited a significant decrease in fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR at week 12. However, no significant inter- or intra-group differences in lipid profiles were detected. These findings suggest that RD43 rice could be a potential staple food with the capacity to improve glycemic control and body composition in prediabetic individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3abody weight 3adiet 3aglycemic control 3aglycemic effect 3aglycemic index 3aingestion 3ainsulin 3alipids 3arandomized clinical trials 3arice 3astaple foods 3astarch 3awaist circumference1 aHan, Yi-Chun1 aChusak, Charoonsri1 aLin, Wen-Chien1 aWu, Yi-Hsiu1 aWang, Jyun-Syong1 aChang, Ya Chu1 aLin, Yuru,1 aZhuang, Shu-Ru1 aChuang, Hui-Ju1 aAdisakwattana, Sirichai1 aWang, Chin-Kun0 tFood & function.g2022 June 6, v. 13, no. 11 p.5987-5995dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo03664e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013000166300001600296500001500312520110100327592002801428650002601456650001101482650001101493650002901504650002201533650002101555650001601576650002501592650001201617650001401629653001601643653001001659653000801669653000901677653002701686653000801713653001101721653001601732653000801748653000801756653000701764653001301771653001001784653001001794653002001804653000901824653001501833653001401848653002001862653001001882653001801892700001701910700001201927700001201939700001601951773012101967856008202088852000902170655001202179IND60089692320221120044713.0160728e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008969232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Zhao-Wen10aChloroquine enhances cobalt chloride-induced leukemic cell differentiation via the suppression of autophagy at the late phase  ap. 926-932.  a2019-12-06  aWe previously reported that moderate hypoxia and hypoxia-mimetic agents including cobalt chloride (CoCl2) induce differentiation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1 α), which interacts with and enhances transcriptional activity of CCAAT-enhancer binding factor alpha and Runx1/AML1, two important transcriptional factors for hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here, we show that autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) increases HIF-1 α accumulation, thus potentiating CoCl2-induced growth arrest and differentiation of leukemic cells. Furthermore, the increased effect of CQ on differentiation induction is dependent of the inhibition of autophagosome maturation and degradation, since this sensitization could be mimicked by the suppression of expression of both lysosome-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LAMP1 and LAMP2). These findings not only provide the evidence that CQ is a sensitizer for CoCl2-induced differentiation of leukemic cells but also possibly propose the new therapeutic strategy for differentiation induction of AML.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3acobalt 3ahumans 3atranscription (genetics) 3amembrane proteins 3amyeloid leukemia 3achloroquine 3acell differentiation 3ahypoxia 3aautophagy 0aChloroquine 0aNCF-1 0aDFO 0aEBSS 0aAcute myeloid leukemia 0aATO 0ahVps34 0aLAMP1 and 2 0aAML 0aAPL 0aCQ 0aHIF-1 α 0ashRNA 0aSpp-1 0aCobalt chloride 0aATRA 0aPML-RAR α 0aAutophagy 0aDifferentiation 0aCoCl2 0agrowth arrest1 aHou, Jia-Kai1 aHe, Wei1 aFan, Li1 aHuang, Ying0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 430 p.926-932dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011200166500002200278520142000300592002801720650001101748650001701759650002001776650002001796650002301816650001401839650001801853650001601871650001801887650001201905650001301917650002201930650002401952650001601976653002201992653001202014653001502026653001602041653000802057653000902065653000802074653000702082653000902089653000802098653000902106653000702115653000702122653000802129700002102137700006002158773006302218856008202281852000902363655001202372IND60570982920221119034316.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057098292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2017.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamazi, Nazli10aAlpha-lipoic acid supplement in obesity treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials  aPre-press version  aPrevious studies have supported positive roles of antioxidant supplements on weight-loss. One antioxidant supplement is Alpha- lipoic acid. However, recommending ALA as an anti-obesity supplement remains controversial. Accordingly, the purpose of the present study was to perform a meta-analysis on the effects of ALA supplement on anthropometric indices among adult subjects.We searched five electronic databases till Sep 2016. Placebo-controlled clinical trials were included. Weighted Mean Differences (WMD) was pooled using a random-effects model.Findings of 12 included trials indicated that ALA supplement reduced body weight (WMD: -0.69 kg; 95% CI: -1.27, -0.10, I2=0%) and BMI (WMD: -0.38 kg/m2, 95% CI: -0.53, -0.24, I2= 0%) significantly compared to the placebo group. However, its effects on Waist Circumference (WC) was not significant (WMD: -0.30 cm, 95% CI: -1.18, 0.58, I2=17.8%). Stratification by health status indicated that ALA decreased WC in unhealthy subjects (WMD: -2.00 cm, 95% CI: -4.19, 0.19, I2=1.3%) more than healthy individuals (0.03 cm, 95% CI:-0.69, 0.75 I2=0%).The present study revealed that supplementation with ALA slightly but significantly decreased body weight and BMI. Safe dosage for ALA is up to 1200 mg/day. However, it seems that ALA cannot be cost-effective. Further studies are needed to clarify the effects of ALA on metabolic parameter in unhealthy obese individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantioxidants 3abody mass index 3aclinical trials 3acost effectiveness 3adatabases 3ahealth status 3alipoic acid 3ameta-analysis 3aobesity 3aplacebos 3asystematic review 3awaist circumference 3aweight loss 0aAlpha-lipoic acid 0aObesity 0aOverweight 0aWeight-loss 0aALA 0aAMPK 0aBMI 0aCI 0aPPAR 0aRCT 0aNCDs 0aSD 0aWC 0aWMD1 aLarijani, Bagher1 aAzadbakht, Leila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7169-69600 tClinical nutrition.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2017.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01792naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003200152245011200184300001600296520082500312592002801137650002001165650001201185650002301197650000901220651001401229700001801243700001701261700001801278773011801296856005501414852000901469655001201478IND4479625220221119074726.0120907e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447962522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1477-9552.2012.00343.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGedara, Kularatne Mohottala10aFactors Affecting Technical Efficiency of Rice Farmers in Village Reservoir Irrigation Systems of Sri Lanka  ap. 627-638.  aGiven the importance of water for rice production, this study examines the factors affecting the technical efficiency (TE) of irrigated rice farmers in village irrigation systems (VIS) in Sri Lanka. Primary data were collected from 460 rice farmers in the Kurunagala District, Sri Lanka, to estimate a stochastic translog production frontier for rice production. The mean TE of rice farming in village irrigation was found to be 0.72, although 63% of rice farmers exceeded this average. The most influential factors of TE are membership of Farmer Organisations (FOs) and the participatory rate in collective actions organised by FOs. The results suggest that enhancement of coâoperative arrangements of farmers by strengthening the membership of FOs is considered important for increasing TE in rice farming in VIS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3afarmers 3airrigation systems 3arice 3aSri Lanka1 aWilson, Clevo1 aPascoe, Sean1 aRobinson, Tim0 tJournal of agricultural economics.g2012 Sept., v. 63, no. 3 p.627-638dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-857X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-9552.2012.00343.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010400159300001400263520164400277592002801921653001301949653001301962653002701975653002302002653001002025700002402035700002002059700001302079773015202092856007502244852000902319655001202328IND60129000120221119193124.0151124e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012900012DNAL7 a10.2987/08-5807.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadanandane, C.10aEfficacy of Two Formulations of the Bioinsecticide Spinosad Against Culex quinquefasciatus in India  ap. 66-73.  aSpinosad 12%% suspension concentrate (SC) and 0.5%% granular (G) formulations were tested against Culex quinquefasciatus immatures at 3 dosages——50, 100, and 150 mg active ingredient (AI)/m²——in cesspits, street drains, and disused wells in comparison with temephos 1%% G at 1 part per million. The 2 formulations reduced the density of pupae of Cx. quinquefasciatus by 80––100%% for 7––14 days in cesspits, 7––18 days in drains, and 33––69 days in disused wells at the 3 dosages tested. The 12%% SC and 0.5%% G formulations were equally effective in suppressing the larval and pupal populations of Cx. quinquefasciatus in all the habitats treated. At 100 mg AI/m² in drains and cesspits, the efficacy of spinosad 0.5%% G was greater than that of temephos (1%% G) and that of spinosad 12%% SC was comparable to that of temephos (1%% G) applied to the 2 habitats. In disused wells, both the formulations lasted longer than temephos. Based on the small-scale trial, the rate of 150 mg AI/m² of spinosad was selected for field application to cesspits and drains and 50 mg AI/m² for application to disused wells. The efficacy observed in medium-scale trials was in agreement with that of small-scale trials. The trial showed that the 2 formulations of spinosad can be used for larval control of Cx. quinquefasciatus, at 50 mg AI/m², applied at weekly intervals to cesspits and street drains and at monthly intervals to disused wells. At the higher dose of 150 mg AI/m², the 2 formulations were effective in suppressing the pupal population for 2 wk in cesspits and street drains and for 2 months in disused wells.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSpinosad 0atemephos 0aCulex quinquefasciatus 0abiological control 0aIndia1 aBoopathi Doss, P.S.1 aJambulingam, P.1 aZaim, M.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2009 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.66-73dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F08-5807.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03776naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245008200177300001600259520222900275592002802504650001902532650001202551650001702563650001702580650001102597650001802608650000902626650001502635650001102650650001002661650001102671650001302682650001002695650001202705650002202717650001502739650002202754650001002776650001302786650001802799650001202817650001002829650001102839650001402850650002402864650001002888650000902898651001302907700002602920700002602946700002402972773010002996856008103096852000903177655001203186IND60486048420221122234356.0160218e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-015-9888-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca, Ana Margarida P.10aEmergy analysis of a silvo-pastoral system, a case study in southern Portugal  ap. 137-157.  aThe Mediterranean silvo-pastoral system known as Montado, in Portugal, is a complex land use system composed of an open tree stratum in various densities and an herbaceous layer, used for livestock grazing. Livestock also profit from the acorns, and the grazing contributes to avoid shrub encroachment. In the last 20 years, subsidies from the European Union have greatly promoted cattle rearing in this system and the introduction of heavy breeds, at the expense of sheep, goats or the native cattle breeds. The balance of the traditional system is thus threatened, and a precise assessment of the balance between the different components of the system, therefore is highly needed. The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of a Montado farm system with cattle rearing as the major economic activity by applying the emergy evaluation method to calculate indices of yield, investment, environmental loading and sustainability. By integrating different ecosystem components, the emergy evaluation method allows a comprehensive evaluation of this complex and multifunctional system at the scale of an individual farm. This method provides a set of indices that can help us understand the system and design management strategies that maximize emergy flow in the farm. In this paper, we apply the emergy evaluation method to a Montado farm with cattle rearing, as a way to gain a better understanding of this system at the farm scale. The value for the transformity of veal (2.66E+06 sej J⁻¹) is slightly higher, when compared to other systems producing protein. That means that the investment of nature and man in this product was higher and it requires a premium price on the market. The renewability for Holm Oaks Farm (49 %), lower than for other similar systems, supports the assumption that this is a farm in which, comparing with others, the number of purchased inputs in relation to renewable inputs provided by nature, is higher. The Emergy Investment Ratio is 0.91 for cattle rearing compared to a value of 0.49 for cork and 0.43 for firewood harvesting, making it clear that cattle rearing is a more labor demanding activity comparing with extractive activities as cork and firewood harvesting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aQuercus 3aagroforestry 3acase studies 3acattle 3acattle breeds 3acork 3aecosystems 3aemergy 3afarms 3afruits 3afuelwood 3agoats 3agrazing 3aground vegetation 3aharvesting 3aherbaceous plants 3alabor 3aland use 3amarket prices 3arearing 3asheep 3ashrubs 3asubsidies 3asystems engineering 3atrees 3aveal 3aPortugal1 aMarques, Carlos A.

These lines were developed to introduce genetic diversity into the narrow base of sugarbeet. The original populations were produced by crossing male-sterile plants of a cultivated line with wild relatives of sugarbeet. The pollinators for F1017, F1018, F1019, and F1020 were B. v. subsp. maritima accessions originally collected in Denmark, Belgium, Ireland, and the Middle East, respectively. The pollinators for F1021, F1022, and F1023 were based on species (F1021, B. atriplicifolia Rouy; F1022, B. macrocarpa Guss.; F1023, B. patula Aiton). Six-year mean root yield of the germplasm lines was 32.63 Mg ha⁻¹ or 63% of the yield of an adapted hybrid. Average sucrose concentrations of the lines ranged from 114 to 122 g kg⁻¹, compared with 136 g kg⁻¹ for a commercial hybrid. These lines will contribute to the broadening of the genetic diversity of the crop, and the infusion of genes from these and other exotic sources may result in unique gene combinations that expand the limits of improvement through selection and enhance combining ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm releases 3asugar beet 3aBeta macrocarpa 3awide hybridization 3asucrose 3agenetic variation 3aplant fertility 3acrop yield 3aplant genetic resources 3asugar crops 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. maritima 3awild relatives 3apollen 3aroots 3aNorth Dakota 0agermplasm 0aandroecium 0aBeta vulgaris 0aBeta0 tJournal of plant registrations.g2010 May, v. 4, no. 2 p.149-154dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:6195x1940-34967nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/432973Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3198/jpr2009.11.0673crg3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04038naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017600168500002200344520201000366592002802376650001102404650001702415650001602432650001402448650001602462650002302478650002002501650001002521650001202531650001102543650001202554650001802566650002102584650001702605650002202622650000802644650002602652650001302678650001902691650001602710650001002726653001602736653001702752653002102769653002302790653001502813653001102828653001202839653001102851653000802862653001102870653001102881653000902892653000802901653000802909653000802917653000902925653001002934653001002944653000902954653000802963653001002971653000802981653000802989700002302997700002503020700002703045700001803072773006303090856008203153852000903235655001203244IND60570983120221119034553.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057098312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2017.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmolders, Lotte10aTheobromine does not affect postprandial lipid metabolism and duodenal gene expression, but has unfavorable effects on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in humans  aPre-press version  aChocolate consumption is associated with a decreased risk for CVD. Theobromine, a compound in cocoa, may explain these effects as it favorably affected fasting serum lipids. However, long-term effects of theobromine on postprandial metabolism as well as underlying mechanisms have never been studied. The objective was to evaluate the effects of 4-week theobromine consumption (500 mg/day) on fasting and postprandial lipid, lipoprotein and glucose metabolism, and duodenal gene expression.In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, 44 healthy men and women, with low baseline HDL-C concentrations consumed 500 mg theobromine or placebo daily. After 4-weeks, fasting blood was sampled and subjects participated in a 4-hour postprandial test. Blood was sampled frequently for analysis of lipid and glucose metabolism. In a subgroup of 10 men, 5 hours after meal consumption duodenal biopsies were taken for microarray analysis.4-weeks theobromine consumption lowered fasting LDL-C (-0.21 mmol/L; P = 0.006), and apoB100 (-0.04 g/L; P = 0.022), tended to increase HDL-C (0.03 mmol/L; P = 0.088) and increased hsCRP (1.2 mg/L; P = 0.017) concentrations. Fasting apoA-I, TAG, FFA, glucose and insulin concentrations were unchanged. In the postprandial phase, theobromine consumption increased glucose (P = 0.026), insulin (P = 0.011) and FFA (P = 0.003) concentrations, while lipids and (apo)lipoproteins were unchanged. In duodenal biopsies, microarray analysis showed no consistent changes in expression of genes, pathways or gene sets related to lipid, cholesterol or glucose metabolism.It is not likely that the potential beneficial effects of cocoa on CVD can be ascribed to theobromine.

In this study, fucoidan (LJNF3), purified from S. japonica, was found to be a novel sulfated galactofucan, with the monosaccharide of only fucose and galactose in a ratio of 79.22:20.78, and with an 11.36% content of sulfate groups. NMR spectroscopy showed that LJNF3 consists of (1→3)-α-l-fucopyranosyl-4-SO₃ residues and (1→6)-β-d-galactopyranose units. The molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect in RAW264.7 demonstrated that LJNF3 reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), and down-regulated the expression of MAPK (including p38, ENK and JNK) and NF-κB (including p65 and IKKα/IKKβ) signaling pathways. In a zebrafish experiment assay, LJNF3 showed a significantly protective effect, by reducing the cell death rate, inhibiting NO to 59.43%, and decreasing about 40% of reactive oxygen species. This study indicated that LJNF3, which only consisted of fucose and galactose, had the potential to be developed in the biomedical, food and cosmetic industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aSaccharina japonica 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acell death 3afood industry 3afucoidan 3afucose 3agalactose 3amacroalgae 3amortality 3anitric oxide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrition 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3asulfates1 aNi, Liying 1 aFu, Xiaoting 1 aWang, Lei 1 aDuan, Delin 1 aHuang, Luqiang 1 aXu, Jiachao 1 aGao, Xin 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 July 29, v. 19, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190804303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008400165300001300249520151400262592002801776650001701804650002401821650003501845650001501880650001301895650001301908650001801921651001001939700001901949700002001968773009701988856008102085852000902166655001202175IND60486048720221123010735.0160218e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-014-9756-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcebes, Pablo10aTowards the identification and assessment of HNV Dehesas: a meso-scale approach  ap. 7-22.  aIberian dehesa and montado are paradigmatic high nature value (HNV) agroforestry systems in Europe. Nevertheless their conservation status is uncertain as a consequence of their typological variety, different intensity of management practices on the ground, and other ongoing processes challenging their long-term sustainability. The existing broad gradients of dehesa and montado types impose difficulties in estimating not only their distribution and extent, but also their condition, since probably not all these agroforestry systems should readily be considered as HNV. Tackling with these difficulties, we explore a methodology based on GIS-analyses of land cover cartographies to estimate the extent and condition of dehesa farmland in an area covering ten municipalities in northern Andalusia region (Spain) based on: (1) integration of available thematic maps to obtain an improved land-use cartography; (2) application of GIS map generalization techniques to delimit potential HNV farmland types; (3) definition and calculation of several indices of ‘structural diversity’ and ‘impact’ within patches of dehesa farmland; (4) automatized weighted integration of indices to obtain a cartography assessing dehesa’s HNV in an ordinal scale from very low to very high. Estimated natural value was significantly worse for cultivated dehesas, with dehesas of pastures showing higher structural diversity and lower impact indices. Weaknesses and strengths of the proposed methodology are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3aconservation status 3ageographic information systems 3aland cover 3aland use 3apastures 3athematic maps 3aSpain1 aPereira, David1 aOñate, Juan J.0 tAgroforestry systems.g2016 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.7-22dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-014-9756-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014700158300001600305520103500321592002801356653002401384653003901408653002201447653002001469653001801489773015401507856007501661852000901736655001201745IND60129000520221119193126.0151124e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012900052DNAL7 a10.2987/08-5836.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldemir, Adnan10aInitial and Residual Activity of VectoBac®® 12 AS, VectoBac®® WDG, and VectoLex®® WDG for Control of Mosquitoes in Ararat Valley, Turkey  ap. 113-116.  aTwo formulations, VectoBac®® 12 AS and VectoBac®® WDG, of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) and one formulation, VectoLex®® WDG, of Bacillus sphaericus were tested against Anopheles maculipennis, Culex pipiens, Culex theileri, Aedes caspius, and Aedes dorsalis larvae in drainage canals, a flooded plain, and a drainage well in the Igdir Plain of Arafat Valley, Turkey.

Three commercially available swabs were compared aiming their application for timelier AGD diagnosis (Calgiswab® (calcium alginate fibre‐tipped), Isohelix® DNA buccal and cotton wool‐tipped). Calcium alginate is soluble in most sodium salts, which potentially allows the total recovery of biological material, hence a better extraction of target organisms’ DNA. Thus, this study consisted of (a) an in vitro assessment involving spiking of the swabs with known amounts of amoebae and additional assessment of retrieval efficiency of amoebae from agar plates; (b) in vivo testing by swabbing of gill arches (second, third and fourth) of AGD‐infected fish. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments identified an enhanced amoeba retrieval with Calgiswab® and Isohelix® swabs in comparison with cotton swabs. Additionally, the third and fourth gill arches presented significantly higher amoebic loads compared to the second gill arch. Results suggest that limiting routine gill swabbing to one or two arches, instead of all, could likely lead to reduced stress‐related effects incurred by handling and sampling and a timelier diagnosis of AGD.  aPublisher supplied data  a634429 (ParaFishControl)cEuropean Union’s Horizon 2020 research 3aDNA 3aParamoeba perurans 3aSalmo salar 3aamoebic gill disease 3acalcium alginate 3acotton 3afish 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalts 3asampling 3asodium1 aFridman, Sophie1 aSokołowska, Jadwiga,1 aMonaghan, Sean J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7692-77561 aGarzon, Teresa1 aBetancor, Monica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1626-74581 aPaladini, Giuseppe1 aAdams, Sandraq(Alexandra),1 aBron, James E.0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2020 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.1463-1472dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.132433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013100169300001600300520177400316592002802090650001902118650001702137650002202154650001002176650002602186650001702212650001202229650001202241650001502253650002002268650001402288650001102302650001302313650001802326650001302344650001402357651001302371700001802384700001702402700001802419700002102437700002102458700001602479700002602495773010002521856008102621852000902702655001202711IND60486048820221123010827.0160218e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-014-9757-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodinho, Sérgio,10aAssessment of environment, land management, and spatial variables on recent changes in montado land cover in southern Portugal  ap. 177-192.  aMontado decline has been reported since the end of the nineteenth century in southern Portugal and increased markedly during the 1980s. Consensual reports in the literature suggest that this decline is due to a number of factors, such as environmental constraints, forest diseases, inappropriate management, and socioeconomic issues. An assessment on the pattern of montado distribution was conducted to reveal how the extent of land management, environmental variables, and spatial factors contributed to montado area loss in southern Portugal from 1990 to 2006. A total of 14 independent variables, presumably related to montado loss, were grouped into three sets: environmental variables, land management variables, and spatial variables. From 1990 to 2006, approximately 90,054 ha disappeared in the montado area, with an estimated annual regression rate of 0.14 % year⁻¹. Variation partitioning showed that the land management model accounted for the highest percentage of explained variance (51.8 %), followed by spatial factors (44.6 %) and environmental factors (35.5 %). These results indicate that most variance in the large-scale distribution of recent montado loss is due to land management, either alone or in combination with environmental and spatial factors. The full GAM model showed that different livestock grazing is one of the most important variables affecting montado loss. This suggests that optimum carrying capacity should decrease to 0.18–0.60 LU ha⁻¹ for livestock grazing in montado under current ecological conditions in southern Portugal. This study also showed that land abandonment, wildfire, and agricultural practices (to promote pastures, crops or fallow lands) were three significant variables influencing montado loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabandoned land 3aagroforestry 3acarrying capacity 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest trees 3aforests 3agrazing 3aland cover 3aland management 3alivestock 3amodels 3apastures 3atree diseases 3avariance 3awildfires 3aPortugal1 aGuiomar, Nuno1 aMachado, Rui1 aSantos, Pedro1 aSá-Sousa, Paulo1 aFernandes, J.

These barriers restrict the upstream migration of adults and downstream larval dispersal. A one‐dimensional (1D) modelling framework is currently in use to evaluate reservoir operation alternatives and to simulate drift of dispersing free embryos for different flow regimes and reservoir stages. This paper presents the results of a large‐scale tracer experiment conducted in 2016 and associated modelling performed to evaluate flow management scenarios that might aid species recovery. Breakthrough curves from the tracer experiment were used to infer the 1D longitudinal dispersion coefficient from a parameter optimization procedure. Simulations generated using the calibrated 1D advection–dispersion model were compared with field observations of the passive tracer and with larval fish collected during a previous experiment in 2007. When used with the appropriate range of dispersion coefficients, the 1D modelling framework agrees well with the available direct measurements of larval drift distances. Although we cannot unequivocally state whether insufficient length of free‐flowing river alone is causing recruitment failure, given the current thermal regime and our understanding of pallid sturgeon development, the time required for pallid sturgeon to transition to the benthos and initiate feeding might exceed the duration of drift available given constraints of reservoir operations.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Geological Survey: Ecosystems Mission Area  cU.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Missouri River Integrated Science Program 3aScaphirhynchus albus 3aadults 3abenthic organisms 3adispersibility 3afish larvae 3amodels 3arivers 3asturgeon 3aMissouri River 3aUnited States1 aBulliner, Edward A.1 aFischenich, J.

Accurate detection and root-cause analysis of oscillations is of great interest for the economic viability of the process operation. Standard oscillation detection and root cause analysis methods require a large enough number of data samples. Unrelated transient changes superimposed on the oscillation pattern reduce the number of useful data samples. The present paper proposes simple heuristic methods to effectively detect and remove two types of transient changes from oscillatory signals, namely step changes and spikes. The proposed methods are used to preprocess oscillatory time series. The accuracy gained when using autocorrelation function method for oscillation detection (Thornhill, N. F.; Huang, B.; Zhang, H. J. Process Control 2003, 13, 91–100) and transfer entropy method for oscillation propagation (Bauer, M.; Cox, J. W.; Caveness, M. H.; Downs, J. J.; Thornhill, N. F. IEEE Trans. Control Syst. Technol. 2007, 15, 12–21) is experimentally evaluated. The methods are carried out on a 1,3-butadiene production process where several measurements showed an established oscillation occurring after a production level change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3achemistry 3aeconomic sustainability 3aentropy 3aprocess control 3aprocess design 3atime series analysis1 aChioua, Moncef1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6968-41001 aBauer, Margret1 aSchlake, Jan Christoph1 aThornhill, Nina F.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 May 03, v. 58, no. 26 p.11234-11250dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b061383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005600092040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100002200202245016700224300001800391500002400409520155500433650001901988650001302007650002302020650001302043650002302056650001302079650001602092650001402108650001602122650002202138650002702160650002302187651001202210700001702222773011902239852000902358856011002367856007702477930003302554945002502587946001302612655001202625IND4384531520221117234421.0061019e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438453152DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X(2006)35[1222:TARHEO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL001 0aL3001 aPerez-Mendoza, J.10aTemperature and Relative Humidity Effects on Postdiapause Larval Development and Adult Emergence in Three Populations of Wheat Stem Sawfly (Hymenoptera: Cephidae)  ap. 1222-1231.  aIncludes references  aPostdiapause larval development and adult emergence of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), were studied in three field populations collected at Amsterdam, Conrad, and Opheim, MT, at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C and at 43, 54-62, and 75-76% RH under laboratory conditions. No development beyond the larval stage occurred at either 10 or 35°C at any relative humidity. At 10°C, >75% of the larvae remained alive, but quiescent, whereas at 35°C, approximately = to 50% of the larvae probably re-entered diapause. Temperature and population were the main factors affecting development time and adult emergence. The shortest development times occurred at temperatures of 20°C and higher, but development time increased sharply at 15°C. Adult emergence was highest at 20 and 25°C for the two populations collected at Amsterdam and Conrad (western Montana) and was highest at 15 and 20°C for the population collected at Opheim (eastern Montana). Emerged females were twice as heavy as males. Temperature and relative humidity did not affect weight, but emerged adults from the populations collected at Amsterdam and Conrad were heavier than adults emerged from the population collected at Opheim. Sex ratio of emerging adults was female biased and was strongly affected by population. The optimal conditions for larval-adult development of C. cinctus lie between 20 and 25°C and 60-75% RH. This data will be used to predict adult emergence and forecast the onset of the adult flight period in Montana wheat fields. 3aCephus cinctus 3asawflies 3ainsect development 3adiapause 3alarval development 3aeclosion 3abody weight 3asex ratio 3atemperature 3arelative humidity 3ageographical variation 3apopulation ecology 3aMontana1 aWeaver, D.K.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2006 Oct., v. 35, no. 5 p.1222-1231dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2006)35%5B1222:TARHEO%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3electronic resource  a20061026b20061102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/26  aOther US 7aarticle03348naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245012800169300001600297520200400313592002802317650002602345650002502371650002302396650001502419650002502434650001802459650001502477650001802492650001302510650001202523650001502535650001502550650001402565650001702579653002002596653001102616653001202627653003002639700002002669773012202689856008202811852000902893655001202902IND60130022320221120095202.0151126e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013002232DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-11-00155.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBedunah, Donald J.10aRangeland Degradation, Poverty, and Conflict: How Can Rangeland Scientists Contribute to Effective Responses and Solutions?  ap. 606-612.  aIn many developing countries where rangelands are a dominant land type and critically important in livelihoods of a significant portion of the population, severe rangeland degradation and/or conflicts over rangeland use can create significant social, economic, and environmental problems. In this paper, we review rangeland degradation in the developing world, its impacts and causes, discuss problems in applying rangeland science to improve rangeland conditions, discuss the role of rangeland scientists, and discuss our approach for enhancing rangeland science in international development. We suggest range scientists can provide valuable input and direction on issues of rangeland degradation (including state changes and impacts on ecosystem goods and services), provide guidance in methods and realistic opportunities for rangeland improvement to local users, government, and development organizations, and work to provide pastoralists with adaptive management in variable ecosystems. Conflict and poverty can create situations where a long-term goal of sustainable rangeland use is overwhelmed by short-term needs of safety and food security; however, providing science and training on sustainable management can make a difference where conflicts are not too severe and can help promote societal stability. Negative perceptions about aid are widespread, but the needs for improved conditions associated with multiple values of rangelands, and the needs of people utilizing these areas, are great. Conducting planning and projects with transparency and accountability will help promote more inclusive participation and successful projects. To be effective, a project needs to consider the needs of the people utilizing the project area but also provide to these communities information on values of the rangelands to other stakeholders (ecosystem services). Sustainable projects will require accountability and enhance self-reliance to allow community empowerment and adaptability to changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity development 3adeveloping countries 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afood security 3alivelihood 3aorganizations 3aplanning 3apoverty 3arangelands 3ascientists 3asolutions 3astakeholders 0aapplied science 0acauses 0aimpacts 0ainternational development1 aAngerer, Jay P.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2012 Nov., v. 65, no. 6 p.606-612dthe Society for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2FREM-D-11-00155.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03824naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011600165300001600281520190300297592002802200650002102228650001702249650001402266650001502280650001702295650001602312650002702328650002402355650001402379650002302393650002102416650001602437650002602453650001502479650001802494650001302512650004302525653000802568653000802576653001402584653000802598653000802606653000802614653001002622653000802632653003202640653002102672653001902693653001602712653002102728653001602749700001602765700001902781700001402800700001502814700001702829700001502846700002002861700001702881700001602898773012102914856008203035852000903117655001203126IND60089692820221120073528.0160728e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008969282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulliero, A.10aInhibition of the de-myelinating properties of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome lymphocytes by cathepsin D silencing  ap. 957-962.  aMolecular mechanisms relating interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) to brain damage have recently been identified in a microarray analysis of cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytes from patients with Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS). These findings demonstrate that the inhibition of angiogenesis and the activation of neurotoxic lymphocytes are the major pathogenic mechanisms involved in the brain damage consequent to elevated interferon-alpha levels. Our previous study demonstrated that cathepsin D, a lysosomal aspartyl endopeptidase, is the primary mediator of the neurotoxicity exerted by AGS lymphocytes. Cathepsin D is a potent pro-apoptotic, neurotoxic, and demyelinating protease if it is not properly inhibited by the activities of leukocystatins. In central nervous system white matter, demyelination results from cathepsin over-expression when not balanced by the expression of its inhibitors. In the present study, we used RNA interference to inhibit cathepsin D expression in AGS lymphocytes with the aim of decreasing the neurotoxicity of these cells. Peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from an AGS patient were immortalized and co-cultured with astrocytes in the presence of interferon alpha with or without cathepsin D RNA interference probes. Cathepsin D expression was measured by qPCR, and neurotoxicity was evaluated by microscopy. RNA interference inhibited cathepsin D over-production by 2.6-fold (P<0.01) in AGS lymphocytes cultured in the presence of interferon alpha. AGS lymphocytes treated using RNA interference exhibited a decreased ability to induce neurotoxicity in astrocytes. Such neurotoxicity results in the inhibition of astrocyte growth and the inhibition of the ability of astrocytes to construct web-like aggregates.These results suggest a new strategy for repairing AGS lymphocytes in vitro by inhibiting their ability to induce astrocyte damage and leukodystrophy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3aastrocytes 3abrain damage 3acathepsin D 3acentral nervous system 3acerebrospinal fluid 3acoculture 3agrowth retardation 3ainterferon-alpha 3alymphocytes 3amicroarray technology 3amicroscopy 3aneurotoxicity 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aAGS 0aCSF 0aIFN-alpha 0aSLE 0aCNS 0aEBV 0aECACC 0aGFP 0aAicardi-Goutières Syndrome 0aInterferon-alpha 0aDe-myelination 0aCathepsin D 0aRNA interference 0aLymphocytes1 aMarengo, B.1 aLongobardi, M.1 aFazzi, E.1 aOrcesi, S.1 aOlivieri, I.1 aCereda, C.1 aDomenicotti, C.1 aBalottin, U.1 aIzzotti, A.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 430 p.957-962dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013500164300001600299520081700315592002801132650001201160650002301172650001901195650002701214650001101241650001701252651001001269651001701279700001501296700001701311700001901328700001901347700001901366773010501385856004801490852000901538655001201547IND50059575920221120034437.0121102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005957592DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-012-9654-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhi-Zhi10aIsolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite markers for the endangered roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus)  ap. 837-840.  aThe roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus) is an endangered species.

Addition of lipid and tea leaf antioxidant extract in starch/glycerol coating solution improved the surface integrity of films but decreased the solubility and stability of the films and coating solutions. Starch retrogradation was reduced and amylose-lipid complexation occurred on addition of coconut oil as suggested by Differential Scanning Calorimetry. After 20 days of storage, weight loss was 1.78% less for starch/glycerol/lipid (S/G/L) coated and 3.53% less for starch/glycerol/lipid/antioxidant (S/G/L/A) coated tomatoes as compared to control. Titratable acidity was 0.262±0.007% and 0.337±0.003% and pH was 4.62±0.013 and 4.27±0.015 for control and S/G/L/A coated tomatoes, respectively. TSS (°Brix) increased with storage in all samples but S/G/L/A coated tomatoes exhibited 0.5 °Brix less TSS than the control. Reducing sugars and ascorbic acid increased with storage initially and thereafter decreased later on with control showing maximum fall and S/G/L/A and S/G/L recording lowest fall, in that order. Coconut oil and tea leaf extract in the edible coating clearly delayed ripening effects on tomatoes. The coconut oil and tea extract also exhibited microbe-barrier property.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acoatings 3acoconut oil 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aedible films 3aglycerol 3aleaf extracts 3aleaf oils 3alipids 3areducing sugars 3arice 3astarch 3asugar acids 3atea 3atemperature 3atitratable acidity 3atomatoes 3aweight loss 0aEdible film 0aCoating 0aAntioxidant 0aAntimicrobial 0aAmylose–lipid complex1 aDutta, Himjyoti1 aMahanta, Charu Lata0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.272-278dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012700163300001200290500002000302520145700322592002801779650001801807650001401825650001701839650002001856650001401876650001401890650001601904651001601920700002201936700003201958700003701990700002102027700002102048700001502069773012502084856007402209852000902283655001202292IND60787637220221117233900.0220809e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078763722DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.1042532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Bolhuis, Hester10aPrevalence of dental disorders in degus and evaluation of diagnostic methods to determine dental disease and its prognosis  ap. 627.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDegus (Octodon degus) are prone to develop dental disease with deleterious health effects. The two studies reported here aimed to determine the prevalence of dental disorders in degus and to identify and evaluate diagnostic tools for determination of prognosis of these disorders. In study A, health data from 225 degus at AAP, Rescue Center for Exotic Animals in the Netherlands, were collated and the prevalence of dental disorders and differences in sex and age at clinical onset of symptoms associated with dental disorders were described. The prevalence was 34.7 per cent and higher (P<0.01) in males than in females. The occurrence of cheek teeth malocclusion was highly positively (P<0.0001) correlated to mortality. In study B, 36 skulls were examined by macroscopic evaluation, radiography and histology. Additionally, the calcium:phosphorus (Ca:P) of mandibular bone in degus with and without dental disorders were determined. There was no significant (P=0.10) difference in Ca:P between the two groups. Quantifying mandibular apical cheek teeth elongation via macroscopic evaluation was highly correlated (P<0.01) to the results obtained via radiography. Examination for apical elongation by palpation and diagnostic imaging should be included in routine health monitoring of degus. Apical elongation appeared to develop before coronal elongation and when cheek teeth malocclusion occurred, prognosis for recovery of dental disease was poor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOctodon degus 3ahistology 3amalocclusion 3amandible (bone) 3amortality 3aprognosis 3aradiography 3aNetherlands1 avan Hoffen, Lotte1 avan Zijll Langhout, Martine1 avan Engeldorp Gastelaars, Heleen1 aHendriks, Wouter1 aLamberts, Marnix1 aKik, Marja0 tVeterinary record.g2017 Dec., v. 181, no. 23 p.627-627dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.1042533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245013900169520141300308592002801721650001601749650002401765650001801789650001801807650001601825650002101841700002901862700002901891700003001920700003201950700002101982700002502003773012602028856007402154852000902228655001202237IND60748600920221119131100.0210827e20210729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074860092DNAL7 a10.3390/md190804322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales-Amador, Adrián 10aIsolation and Structural Elucidation of New Amphidinol Analogues from Amphidinium carterae Cultivated in a Pilot-Scale Photobioreactor  aThe demand for valuable products from dinoflagellate biotechnology has increased remarkably in recent years due to their many prospective applications. However, there remain many challenges that need to be addressed in order to make dinoflagellate bioactives a commercial reality. In this article, we describe the technical feasibility of producing and recovering amphidinol analogues (AMs) excreted into a culture broth of Amphidinium carterae ACRN03, successfully cultured in an LED-illuminated pilot-scale (80 L) bubble column photobioreactor operated in fed-batch mode with a pulse feeding strategy. We report on the isolation of new structurally related AMs, amphidinol 24 (1, AM24), amphidinol 25 (2, AM25) and amphidinol 26 (3, AM26), from a singular fraction resulting from the downstream processing. Their planar structures were elucidated by extensive NMR and HRMS analysis, whereas the relative configuration of the C-32→C-47 bis-tetrahydropyran core was confirmed to be antipodal in accord with the recently revised configuration of AM3. The hemolytic activities of the new metabolites and other related derivatives were evaluated, and structure–activity conclusions were established. Their isolation was based on a straightforward and high-performance bioprocess that could be suitable for the commercial development of AMs or other high-value compounds from shear sensitive dinoflagellates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphidinium 3abioactive compounds 3abioprocessing 3aculture media 3ametabolites 3aphotobioreactors1 aMolina-Miras, Alejandro 1 aLópez-Rosales, Lorenzo 1 aSánchez-Mirón, Asterio 1 aGarcía-Camacho, Francisco 1 aSouto, María L.1 aFernández, José J.0 tMarine drugs.g2021 July 29, v. 19, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190804323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012700165300001600292520142200308592002801730650002001758650002201778650001301800650001801813650002201831650001601853650003101869650001701900650000901917650001801926650001301944650001301957650001701970650000701987650001501994650001602009650003702025650001902062653002002081653001602101653002202117653000902139700001802148700001402166700001602180700001502196773011402211856008502325852000902410655001202419IND60607586120221116143047.0180731e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060758612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhi10aBiomineralization of Pb(II) into Pb-hydroxyapatite induced by Bacillus cereus 12-2 isolated from Lead–Zinc mine tailings  ap. 531-537.  aThe remediation of Pb(II) through biomineralization is rergarded as a promising technique as well as an interesting phenomenon for transforming heavy metals from mobile species into very stable minerals in the environment. Studies are well needed for in-depth understanding the mechanism of Pb(II) immobilized by bacteria. In the present study, we investigated the uptake and biomineralization of Pb(II) using Bacillus cereus 12-2 isolated from lead–zinc mine tailings. The maximum Pb(II) uptake capacity of B. cereus 12-2 was 340mg/g at pH 3.0. Zeta potential analyses and selective passivation experiments demonstrated that electrostatic attraction was the main force driving the uptake of Pb(II), while the carboxyl, amide and phosphate functional groups of the bacteria provided the binding sites for immobilizing Pb(II). XRD and TEM investigation revealed that the Pb(II) loaded on bacteria could be stepwise transformed into rod-shaped Ca2.5Pb7.5(OH)2(PO4)6 nanocrystal. Combined with protein denaturalization experiments, we proposed that the biomineralization of Pb(II) possibly consisted of two steps: (1) Rapid biosorption of Pb(II) on B. cereus 12-2 through the synergy of electrostatic attraction, ionic exchange and chelating activity of functional groups; (2) enzyme-mediated mineral transformation from amorphous precipitate to rod-shaped crystalline minerals happening gradually inside the bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aX-ray diffraction 3abacteria 3abinding sites 3abiomineralization 3abiosorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amine tailings 3aminerals 3amoieties 3ananocrystals 3apH 3aphosphates 3aremediation 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aBacillus cereus 0aBiosorption 0aBiomineralization 0aLead1 aPan, Xiaohong1 aChen, Hui1 aGuan, Xiong1 aLin, Zhang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 301 p.531-537dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012400162300001600286520096200302592002801264650002201292650001101314650001801325650001401343650001301357650002001370650002101390650001501411650002201426650001501448650001701463650002401480653000901504653001101513653001301524653001101537653003001548700001501578700001301593700001301606700001801619700001401637773012501651856008301776852000901859655001201868IND60597101920221123022350.0191231e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059710192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanan10aHybrid shells of MnO2 nanosheets encapsulated by N-doped carbon towards nonprecious oxygen reduction reaction catalysts  ap. 241-250.  aDeveloping nonprecious electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have aroused increasing interest recently. Herein, α-MnO2 nanosheet-based hollow spheres encapsulated by N-doped carbon (denoted as N-Carbon/MnO2/N-Carbon) as efficient ORR electrocatalysts were reported. As started from redox reactive polystyrene/polyaniline (PS/PANI) core/shell templates, MnO2 and PANI layers were sequentially in situ loaded, leading to the formation of MnO2 nanosheet-based hollow spheres encapsulated by PANI (denoted as PANI/MnO2/PANI) after PS removal process. Finally, the calcination process ensured the crystallization of MnO2 and carbonization of PANI, resulting in the formation of N-Carbon/MnO2/N-Carbon hybrid shells. The N-Carbon/MnO2/N-Carbon hybrid shells showed excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution, making the hybrids promising cathode catalysts for alkaline fuel cell applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acrystallization 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3amanganese dioxide 3ananosheets 3apolystyrenes 3apotassium hydroxide 0aMnO2 0aCarbon 0aCatalyst 0aHybrid 0aOxygen reduction reaction1 aCao, Shiyi1 aFan, Lei1 aHan, Jie1 aWang, Minggui1 aGuo, Rong0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 527 p.241-250dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245008800165300001600253520202900269592002802298650001602326650001202342650002002354650002302374650001802397650001002415650002402425650001502449650002202464650002002486650002202506650002302528650001102551650001502562650001202577650001502589653001602604653001402620653001802634653001502652653000902667653003202676700001702708700002302725700001902748700001402767700001502781700001602796700001902812700001602831700001802847700002102865700001902886700001602905700001802921700001802939700001602957773012202973856008203095961002203177852000903199655001203208IND60130022620221120095021.0151126e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013002262DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-11-00186.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrick, J. E.10aRevolutionary Land Use Change in the 21st Century: Is (Rangeland) Science Relevant?  ap. 590-598.  aRapidly increasing demand for food, fiber, and fuel together with new technologies and the mobility of global capital are driving revolutionary changes in land use throughout the world. Efforts to increase land productivity include conversion of millions of hectares of rangelands to crop production, including many marginal lands with low resistance and resilience to degradation. Sustaining the productivity of these lands requires careful land use planning and innovative management systems. Historically, this responsibility has been left to agronomists and others with expertise in crop production. In this article, we argue that the revolutionary land use changes necessary to support national and global food security potentially make rangeland science more relevant now than ever. Maintaining and increasing relevance will require a revolutionary change in range science from a discipline that focuses on a particular land use or land cover to one that addresses the challenge of managing all lands that, at one time, were considered to be marginal for crop production. We propose four strategies to increase the relevance of rangeland science to global land management: 1) expand our awareness and understanding of local to global economic, social, and technological trends in order to anticipate and identify drivers and patterns of conversion; 2) emphasize empirical studies and modeling that anticipate the biophysical (ecosystem services) and societal consequences of large-scale changes in land cover and use; 3) significantly increase communication and collaboration with the disciplines and sectors of society currently responsible for managing the new land uses; and 4) develop and adopt a dynamic and flexible resilience-based land classification system and data-supported conceptual models (e.g., state-and-transition models) that represent all lands, regardless of use and the consequences of land conversion to various uses instead of changes in state or condition that are focused on a single land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomists 3acapital 3acrop production 3aecosystem services 3afood security 3afuels 3aland classification 3aland cover 3aland productivity 3aland use change 3aland use planning 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3arangelands 3asociety 3atechnology 0adegradation 0aeconomics 0afood security 0aresilience 0asoil 0asustainable land management1 aBrown, J.

For cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived products, the former microorganism was found to ferment compounds with low molecular weights such as monosaccharides, decomposed products, and organic acids to acetic acid, while the latter was found to ferment compounds with high molecular weights such as polysaccharides and oligosaccharides to acetic acid. Lignin-derived products were, on the other hand, fermented by both microorganisms to acetic acid. Based on these lines of evidence, co-culture with C. thermoaceticum and C. thermocellum was evaluated and proven to increase acetic acid fermentability. Consequently, almost all compounds produced from beech wood in hot-compressed water were found to be converted to acetic acid when using these microorganisms in combination. Thus, hot-compressed water treatment coupled with acetic acid fermentation would likely be a powerful method to produce acetic acid from lignocellulosics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aFagus 3aMoorella thermoacetica 3aacetic acid 3acellulosic materials 3acoculture 3afermentation 3amicroorganisms 3amolecular weight 3amonosaccharides 3aoligosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3awater treatment 3awood1 aMiyafuji, Hisashi1 aKawamoto, Haruo1 aSaka, Shiro0 tJournal of wood science.g2011 Aug., v. 57, no. 4 p.331-337dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-010-1169-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009000174300001400264520103600278592002801314650001701342650001701359650003001376650002001406650001001426650002301436650001901459650001401478650001301492650001501505650002501520650001601545650001301561650001501574650000901589650001801598700003001616700003701646773009801683856008101781852000901862655001201871IND60486049120221120124945.0160218e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-014-9785-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSales-Baptista, Elvira10aOvergrazing in the Montado? The need for monitoring grazing pressure at paddock scale  ap. 57-68.  aMontados are presently facing the threat of either abandonment or intensification, and livestock overgrazing has been suspected of contributing to reduced natural regeneration and biodiversity. However, reliable data are to our knowledge, lacking. To avoid potential risks of overgrazing, an adaptive and efficient management is essential. In the present paper we review the main sources of complexity for grazing management linked with interactions among pasture, livestock and human decisions. We describe the overgrazing risk in montados and favour grazing pressure over stocking rate, as a key indicator for monitoring changes and support management decisions. We suggest the use of presently available imaging and communication technologies for assessing pasture dynamics and livestock spatial location. This simple and effective tools used for monitoring the grazing pressure, could provide an efficient day-to-day aid for farm managers’ operational use and also for rangeland research through data collection and analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3abiodiversity 3acommunications technology 3adata collection 3afarms 3agrazing management 3aimage analysis 3alivestock 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3anatural regeneration 3aovergrazing 3apastures 3arangelands 3arisk 3astocking rate1 ad’Abreu, Manuel Cancela1 aFerraz-de-Oliveira, Maria Isabel0 tAgroforestry systems.g2016 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.57-68dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-014-9785-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013000163520125500293592002801548650001701576650001901593650001901612650001901631650001901650650001801669650003901687650002101726650002001747650002101767653002701788653003301815653002001848653002701868653002001895700001801915700001801933700001401951773009401965856008502059852000902144655001202153IND60769555420221119105546.0220517e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076955542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foostr.2022.1002652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Lan10aImpact of high-pressure homogenization on physico-chemical, structural, and rheological properties of quinoa protein isolates  aThe impact of high pressure homogenisation (HPH) on physico-chemical, microstructural, and rheological properties of quinoa protein isolate (QPI) suspensions were studied. Individual protein bands kept unchanged with HPH treatment up to 50 MPa, as revealed by SDS-PAGE. After HPH treatment at 50 MPa, large protein aggregates were disrupted, and particle size was substantially reduced from ~8.2–0.5 µm. Concurrently, water solubility, emulsifying, and foaming capability were significantly enhanced. QPI molecules after HPH treatment became more flexible with increased surface hydrophobicity and absorbed at the air-water and oil-water interfaces faster, resulting in a more rapid decrease of surface tension and interfacial tension. The secondary structure of QPI proteins was not significantly altered after HPH treatment as probed by FTIR. All QPI suspensions formed weak gels after thermal treatment (85 °C, 30 min), and HPH treated QPI suspensions resulted in a stronger gel strength with a more compact and homogeneous protein network microstructure. These results show that HPH treatment could be an excellent processing technique to modify the physico-chemical, techno-functional, and microstructural properties of QPI suspensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3agel strength 3aheat treatment 3ahomogenization 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein isolates 3asurface tension 3awater solubility 0aQuinoa protein isolate 0aHigh pressure homogenisation 0aViscoelasticity 0aInterfacial properties 0aMicrostructures1 aCheng, Lirong1 aZhang, Ruijia1 aYang, Zhi0 tFood structure.g2022 Apr., v. 32 p.100265-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23298x2213-32917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foostr.2022.1002653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245014300155500001900298520059400317536023400911592002801145650001601173650001701189650001001206650001001216650001601226651001201242651001001254653002601264653001701290653001801307653001401325700001701339773011301356856007701469852000901546655001201555IND60728568520221122042509.0210308e20170320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072856852DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.5.e123872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ye12aA new species, first report of a male and new distributional records for three species of Pteroptrix (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) from China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Chinese fauna of Pteroptrix currently includes 26 species, of wihich 19 species were described originally as new from China: 2 by Howard (1907), 2 by Compere (1953), 1 by Flanders (1966), 1 by Viggiani and Ren (1986), 4 by Huang (1991), 4 by Huang et al.

Herein, high-surface area mesoporous Pt/TiO2 hollow chains were synthesized in high yield by using a simple microwave–hydrothermal route, followed by a combined NaOH-assisted NaBH4-reduction deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the as-obtained TiO2 surface. The catalytic activity for HCHO decomposition was evaluated at room temperature. The prepared Pt/TiO2 hollow chains with an optimal Pt loading of 0.5wt.% exhibited high catalytic activity and recyclability. The apparent reaction rate constant of HCHO oxidation over this catalyst was approximately 1.42×10⁻³ppm⁻¹min⁻¹, exceeding that of the commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 with equal Pt content (k=5.36×10⁻⁴ppm⁻¹min⁻¹) by a factor of approximately 2.65. The high catalytic activity of the Pt/TiO2 hollow chains could be mainly attributed to the hollow chain-like structure, high specific surface area, numerous mesopores, and high pore volume of TiO2 support. Consequently, the catalysts exhibited high adsorption capacity for HCHO, fast diffusion and transport of gas molecules, and good contact between gases and active sites. These characteristics enhanced the catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aformaldehyde 3agases 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide 0aCatalytic oxidation 0aHCHO removal 0aMesoporous TiO2 0aHollow spheres 0aIndoor air quality1 aChenghua,1 aYu, Jiaguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0612-86331 aHo, Wingkei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 301 p.522-530dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011500157300001600272520158900288592002801877653001601905653002201921653002001943653002901963653001601992653002602008653001702034700002002051773015402071856007502225852000902300655001202309IND60129001420221119193217.0151124e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012900142DNAL7 a10.2987/08-5821.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhalala, Hina14aThe Zumba™™ Mosquito Trap and Bg-Sentinel™™ Trap: Novel Surveillance Tools for Host-Seeking Mosquitoes  ap. 134-139.  aIn a periurban habitat located in Northern Virginia, this study used 13 replicates of a 4 ×× 4 Latin square to evaluate the efficacy of 2 novel mosquito traps, the Zumba™™ mosquito trap and the BG-Sentinel™™ trap, against 2 existing host-seeking mosquito traps [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) miniature light and CDC Fay-Prince]]. All traps were baited with the BG-Lure®® and CO₂. The Zumba trap, baited with the BG-Lure and CO₂ (Zumba trap combination) was the most productive and diverse trap, averaging 35.51 mosquitoes and 4.16 species per trapping period. It collected 19 times as many Culex pipiens/restuans, which will be referred to as Cx. pip/res, as the other traps and was the only trap to collect West Nile virus (WNV)-infected host-seeking Cx. pip/res in the study area. The BG-Sentinel trap, baited with the BG-Lure and CO₂ (BG-Sentinel trap combination) collected 7 times as many female Aedes albopictus as the CDC miniature light or Fay-Prince traps. The Zumba trap combination collected 4 times as many female Ae. albopictus as the CDC miniature light or Fay-Prince traps. The WNV infection rate of Cx. pip/res and Ae. albopictus collected by the Zumba trap combination was consistently greater than the infection rates for these species collected in the Fairfax County program's routine CDC miniature light traps and comparable to the infection rate found in the Cx. pip/res collected in the program's routine gravid traps. Both the Zumba and BG-Sentinel trap combinations collected WNV-infected Ae. albopictus in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 0aZumba™™ 0aBG-Sentinel™™ 0aWest Nile virus 0aCDC miniature light trap 0agravid trap 0amosquito surveillance 0ahost-seeking1 aArias, Jorge R.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2009 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.134-139dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F08-5821.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015700173300001600330520162000346592002801966650001201994650001202006650001702018650001202035650001702047650000902064650001502073650001502088650001102103650001302114650001902127650001202146650001602158650001102174650000902185650001202194650001502206651001302221700002002234773010002254856008102354852000902435655001202444IND60486049320221120124957.0160218e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-015-9800-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos-Silva, Celeste10aAssessment of the diversity of epigeous Basidiomycota under different soil-management systems in a montado ecosystem: a case study conducted in Alentejo  ap. 117-126.  aSeveral management practices that are employed in Montados are known to affect the establishment and maintenance of Basidiomycota communities immediately after disturbances have occurred, contributing to their development or, conversely, decreasing their diversity. In this study we aim to evaluate the effects of the most common understory and soil-management practices on the diversity of the epigeous Basidiomycota a long time after disturbances have taken place. The study was conducted in a Montado (cork and holm-oak ecosystem) area in Southern Portugal (Alentejo). In 1998, four experimental treatments—control (C), mulching (Mu), mowing (Mo) and ploughing (P)—with three replicates each were carried out: C—untreated/untouched; Mu—cutting of shrubs followed by deposition of plant residues on soil surfaces; Mo—cutting of shrubs followed by biomass removal and soil tilling; P—cutting of shrubs followed by the incorporation of plant biomass into the soil through tillage. Macrofungal surveys were conducted fortnightly in the experimental plots between Autumn 2007 and Spring 2012. Significant differences in total and mycorrhizal richness were found between plots, with higher values being found for non-tilled plots and lower values for tilled plots. No significant differences were found in saprotrophic richness between treatments. Regarding the composition of taxa, Boletus and Russula were the main taxonomic groups affected by experimental treatments. Our results showed that soil tillage can result in a decrease in mycorrhizal taxa even a long time after disturbances have taken place.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoletus 3aRussula 3aagroforestry 3abiomass 3acase studies 3acork 3aecosystems 3amolybdenum 3amowing 3amulching 3aplant residues 3aplowing 3asaprotrophs 3ashrubs 3asoil 3asurveys 3aunderstory 3aPortugal1 aLouro, Rogério0 tAgroforestry systems.g2016 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.117-126dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-015-9800-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245014600210300001600356506007600372520122100448592002801669506003701697650003101734650001701765650002301782650002001805650002901825650002801854650001101882650001401893653001101907653000801918653001001926653000901936653000801945653000801953653000901961653001001970653002901980653001202009653002202021653002302043653001002066653001802076700003102094700002402125700003602149773012102185856008202306852000902388655001202397IND60089693120221207095416.0160728e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008969312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.1282doi7 aPMC35556932pmcid7 a232614662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Vinod K.10aLipid complex of apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide 4F is a novel platform for paraoxonase-1 binding and enhancing its activity and stability  ap. 975-980.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigh density lipoprotein (HDL) associated paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is crucial for the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherogenic properties of HDL. Discoidal apolipoprotein (apo)A-I:1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) complex has been shown to be the most effective in binding PON1, stabilizing it, and enhancing its lactonase and inhibitory activity of low density lipoprotein oxidation. Based on our earlier study demonstrating that apoA-I mimetic peptide 4F forms discoidal complex with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, we hypothesized that lipid complexes of 4F would be able to bind PON1 and enhance its activity and stability. To test our hypothesis, we have expressed and purified a recombinant PON1 (rPON1) and studied its interaction with 4F:POPC complex. Our studies show significant increase, compared to the control, in the paraoxonase activity and stability of rPON1 in the presence of 4F:POPC complex. We propose that 4F:POPC complex is a novel platform for PON1 binding, increasing its stability, and enhancing its enzyme activity. We propose a structural model for the 4F:POPC:PON1 ternary complex that is consistent with our results and published observations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3aenzyme activity 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alow density lipoprotein 3amodels 3aoxidation 0aapoA-I 0aCVD 0aELISA 0aFPLC 0aHDL 0aLDL 0aPON1 0arPON1 0aHigh density lipoprotein 0aPeptide 0aAmphipathic helix 0aApolipoprotein A-I 0aLipid 0aParaoxonase-11 aPalgunachari, Mayakonda N.1 aMcPherson, David T.1 aAnantharamaiah, Gattadahalli M.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 430 p.975-980dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245004900211300001600260506007600276520057400352592002800926506003700954650002000991650001601011650001101027650003101038650004301069650001201112650002401124700003301148773008101181856008201262852000901344655001201353IND60092626220221207142306.0141103e20120413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009262622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.0172doi7 aPMC33316792pmcid7 a225007972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaplante, Mathieu10amTOR Signaling in Growth Control and Disease  ap. 274-293.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway senses and integrates a variety of environmental cues to regulate organismal growth and homeostasis.

Osbek] subjected to cold quarantine, subsequent simulated transport and shelf-life. Commercially mature fruit were submerged in water at 20°C (control fruit) or TBZ at 1000mg/L and 20°C for 60s, or in hot water without or with TBZ at 300mg/L and 53, 56, or 59°C for 60, 30, and 15s respectively. Following treatments, fruit were stored for 3 weeks at 1°C (simulated quarantine conditions for fruit disinfestations against Mediterranean fruit fly, Medfly), followed by 4 days at 3°C (simulated long distance transport), and finally kept at 20°C for 3 days (shelf-life, SL). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of ‘Tarocco’ orange surface showed that the typical wax platelets, lifting around edges of wax plates and areas free of epicuticular wax (ECW), that disappeared after hot water dips at 53–59°C for 60–15s, become visible again after storage for 21 days at 1°C (quarantine conditions), and changes involving the appearance of rough ultrastructure, presence large curled plates, fissured wax crusts, and areas with ECW deficiencies, became much more pronounced after shelf-life. These occurrences were related to the transient effect of hot water treatment in decay control. Conversely, treatments with 300mg/L TBZ 53°C for 60s or 56°C for 30s effectively reduced decay after quarantine. These treatments were as effective as standard treatment with 1000mg/L TBZ at 20°C and produced similar TBZ residue levels in fruit, without impairing fruit quality traits such as visual appearance, weight loss, compression test, sensory attributes, juice color parameters (a*, b*, h, L*, and Chroma), and juice chemical characteristics (soluble solids content, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, glucose, sucrose, citric acid, total phenols, total anthocyanins, and total antioxidant activity).  aPublisher supplied data 3ashelf life 3atotal soluble solids 3aphenols 3ascanning electron microscopy 3adisinfestation 3aCeratitis capitata 3aepicuticular wax 3ajuices 3aglucose 3afruit quality 3atitratable acidity 3acitric acid 3ahot water treatment 3aanthocyanins 3apostharvest treatment 3asucrose 3aquarantine 3aantioxidant activity 3aweight loss 3acold 3aascorbic acid 3afruits 3asensory properties 3aoranges 3aCitrus sinensis 3athiabendazole 0aThiabendazole residues 0aCitrus 0aHeat treatment 0aDecay 0aStorage 0aEpicuticular wax morphology 0asoluble solids1 aD’Aquino, S.1 aVanadia, S.1 aAngioni, A.1 aSchirra, M.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2013 Apr., v. 78 p.24-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2012.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245010900175520084800284592002801132650002301160650001801183650001701201650001001218650001301228650001301241650001601254650001701270650001101287650001101298650001901309650001701328650002201345650001501367653001401382653002101396653002201417653001401439653001201453700004901465700005601514700002501570773010901595856008301704852000901787655001201796IND60769555720221119105459.0220517e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076955572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNimitkeatkai, Hataitip10aCommercial active packaging maintaining physicochemical qualities of carambola fruit during cold storage  aPhysicochemical quality of carambolas kept in active packaging during storage at 10 °C for 35 d were investigated. The carambola was individually packaged in a low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag with and without a sachet of commercial oxygen and ethylene absorbers. Fruit weight, color, ascorbic acid, firmness and the activities of polygalacturonase (PG) and pectin methylesterase (PME) were monitored. Storage in the active packaging reduced the losses of fruit weight and ascorbic acid content as well as maintained fruit color over the storage. The fruits packed in the active packaging had higher firmness compared to control. Negative relationships between softening and both of the PG (R² = 0.6803) and PME (R² = 0.8179) activities were found.

In contrast, the multifunctional cytokine TGF-β1 has been reported to be augmented in obesity of rodents and humans, but inhibits adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Here we demonstrate that TGF-β1 induces expression of the Angptl2 gene through a Smad3-dependent pathway in RAW264.7 macrophage cells, primary peritoneal macrophages, and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Transcriptional induction of the Angptl2 gene by TGF-β1 was dependent on the Smad3 protein which binds to the Smad Binding Element (SBE) region located on the Angptl2 promoter. Macrophages with Smad3 knocked down by small interfering RNA showed reduction of TGF-β1-induced Angptl2 expression. These findings may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of the increased expression of Angptl2 and TGF-β1 in obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3acytokines 3agenes 3ahumans 3amacrophages 3aobesity 3arodents 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aAngptl2 0aTGF-β1 0aSmad3 0aObesity1 aKim, Jun Hwan1 aKim, Joon-Hyung1 aMartinus, Ryan Dennis1 aPark, Seok Hee0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 430 p.981-986dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012100167300002000288520174000308592002802048650001302076650001402089650001702103650002202120650001202142650001902154650002002173650001802193650002502211700006502236700005902301773017202360856008002532852000902612655001202621IND60649254220221119154705.0190703e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064925422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b064912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, P. Swapna10aRobust Trajectory Tracking in a Reactive Batch Distillation Process using Multirate Nonlinear Internal Model Control  ap. 11364-11381.  aOperating a reactive batch distillation (RBD) process in an optimal manner is of paramount importance for improving product quality and profitability in the face of changing market conditions. However, implementation of an open loop optimal control policy may lead to significant reduction in yield and amount of desired product produced when unmeasured disturbances occur during operation. In this work, an observer error feedback-based multirate nonlinear internal model control (NIMC) scheme is developed for optimal trajectory tracking in the face of unmeasured disturbances. In particular, mismatch in the initial conditions and process parameter variations that can occur during RBD operation are considered. To reduce the time required for online computations, a recently proposed reduced order RBD model [Reddy et al. Compt. Chem. Eng., 2017, 106, 40−56] is used for the controller synthesis. Because the thermodynamic model associated with the RBD process has discontinuities, a multirate version of unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has been developed on the basis of the reduced order model for solving the state estimation problem associated with the proposed NIMC formulation. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by simulating an optimal trajectory tracking problem in the RBD process involving production of butyl acetate. The proposed multirate NIMC formulation is found to be computationally efficient and work reasonably well when tested on the RBD process for solving the set point tracking problem in the presence of unmeasured disturbances. In particular, it is advantageous to operate the RBD process using the proposed UKF-NIMC scheme when the system is subjected to unmeasured disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3achemistry 3adistillation 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aprocess design 3aproduct quality 3aprofitability 3athermodynamic models1 aPatwardhan, Sachin C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4726-79601 aRani, K.

The prepared PA-Fe₃O₄@YPO₄ could be rapidly harvested in the presence of an applied magnetic field and easily re-dispersed in solutions after removing the external magnet. The ultrathin YPO₄ shell on super-hydrophilic PA-Fe₃O₄ has the advantages of fast adsorption/desorption dynamics and low non-specific adsorption, thus trapping of phosphopeptides from the tryptic digests mixture of β-casein/BSA with molar ratio of 1/300 is achieved in 20s adsorption/desorption time.

These alkaloids first became known in the 1950's due to their teratogenic properties, which resulted in newborn and fetal lambs developing cyclopia as a result of pregnant ewes consuming Veratrum californicum. It was discovered that the alkaloids in V. californicum were concentrated in the root and rhizome of the plant with much lower amounts of the most active alkaloid, cyclopamine, present in the aerial plant, especially in the late growth season. Inspired by the limitations in analytical instrumentation and methods available to researchers at the time of the original investigation, we have used state-of-the-art instrumentation and modern analytical methods to quantitate four steroidal alkaloids based on study parameters including plant part, harvest location, and growth stage. The results of the current inquiry detail differences in alkaloid composition based on the study parameters, provide a detailed assessment for alkaloids that have been characterized previously (cyclopamine, veratramine, muldamine and isorubijervine), and identify at least six alkaloids that have not been previously characterized. This study provides insight into optimal harvest time, plant growth stage, harvest location, and plant part required to isolate, yet to be characterized, alkaloids of interest for exploration as Hh pathway antagonists with desirable medicinal properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyclopia 3aVeratrum californicum 3aanalytical methods 3aantagonists 3acyclopamine 3aewes 3aharvest date 3ainstrumentation 3alambs 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3aneonates 3aneoplasms 3aplant growth 3arhizomes 3asignal transduction 3ateratogenicity 0aSteroidal alkaloid 0aVeratrum 0aHedgehog pathway1 aRossi, Meagan1 aCampfield, Vannessa1 aFrench, John1 aHunt, Ellie1 aWade, Emily1 aMcDougal, Owen M.0 tFitoterapia.g2019 July 27, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34526x0367-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2019.1042813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006500145245014300210300001600353500002000369520211200389592002802501596004102529596002702570650001702597650001102614650001202625650002202637650001402659650001302673650002002686650001102706650001302717650002302730651001402753700006202767773011802829856008002947852000903027655001203036IND60769157120221122050208.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076915712DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.139782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichards, Jeannine H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1736-212610aLeaf economics in a three‐dimensional environment: Testing leaf trait responses in vascular epiphytes to land use, climate and tree zone  ap. 727-738.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study of functional traits offers predictive power for community ecology. Particularly in cases where individual species are difficult to study, known properties of trait spectra, such as the leaf economics spectrum (LES), and trait–environment relationships can provide crucial generalizable information that can contribute to forecasts of distributional shifts in response to the abiotic effects of climate and land use changes. Vascular epiphytes have been proposed as indicators of environmental change, but we know little about the ecology of most species. Key functional trait assumptions are based on terrestrial plants; testing these in epiphytes verifies their universality and will inform applying functional traits in predicting epiphyte responses to climate and land use change. In this study, we use functional traits from 37 vascular epiphyte species from forests and shade coffee farms at two sites in northern Nicaragua. We compare correlations among traits and intraspecific trait variances with those of terrestrial plants and among epiphyte taxonomic groups. We also test trait responses to environmental differences between sites and land use types, and within zones of the tree. We find that epiphyte leaf traits fall towards the slower end of the LES, but with about one‐third lower leaf nitrogen per change in specific leaf area (SLA) relative to terrestrial herbaceous plants. Bromeliads show less relationship between these traits than other epiphyte groups and also deviate in other trait interrelationships, suggesting unique leaf construction. Trait–environment relationships varied most strongly along vertical gradients within trees, but some traits, including SLA and carbon isotope ratio, also responded to land use and site differences. We present evidence that trait relationships established for terrestrial plants appear to translate to epiphytes, but identify some possible caveats. Strong trait response to vertical gradients within trees suggests that within‐canopy shifts could provide resilience to climate and land use changes for some epiphyte species.  aPublisher supplied data  cWisconsin Alumni Research Foundation  cGarden Club of America 3aBromeliaceae 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acommunity ecology 3aepiphytes 3aisotopes 3aland use change 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aspecific leaf area 3aNicaragua1 aDamschen, Ellen I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7435-06690 tFunctional ecology.g2022 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.727-738dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44821x0269-84637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.139783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245015200211300001200363520168700375592002802062650002402090650002202114650001702136650001302153650001802166650001602184650001102200650002202211650001302233650001202246650001502258650001102273650002802284650002502312650002002337700002502357700001802382700001702400700002502417700001702442700002702459773012002486856008302606852000902689655001202698IND60736236120221119130943.0220521e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073623612DNAL7 a10.1186/s13068-021-01962-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamineni, Annapurna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0346-746110aIncreasing lipid yield in Yarrowia lipolytica through phosphoketolase and phosphotransacetylase expression in a phosphofructokinase deletion strain  ap. 113.  aBACKGROUND: Lipids are important precursors in the biofuel and oleochemical industries. Yarrowia lipolytica is among the most extensively studied oleaginous microorganisms and has been a focus of metabolic engineering to improve lipid production. Yield improvement, through rewiring of the central carbon metabolism of Y. lipolytica from glucose to the lipid precursor acetyl-CoA, is a key strategy for achieving commercial success in this organism. RESULTS: Building on YB-392, a Y. lipolytica isolate known for stable non-hyphal growth and low citrate production with demonstrated potential for high lipid accumulation, we assembled a heterologous pathway that redirects carbon flux from glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to acetyl-CoA. We used phosphofructokinase (Pfk) deletion to block glycolysis and expressed two non-native enzymes, phosphoketolase (Xpk) and phosphotransacetylase (Pta), to convert PPP-produced xylulose-5-P to acetyl-CoA. Introduction of the pathway in a pfk deletion strain that is unable to grow and accumulate lipid from glucose in defined media ensured maximal redirection of carbon flux through Xpk/Pta. Expression of Xpk and Pta restored growth and lipid production from glucose. In 1-L bioreactors, the engineered strains recorded improved lipid yield and cell-specific productivity by up to 19 and 78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Yields and cell-specific productivities are important bioprocess parameters for large-scale lipid fermentations. Improving these parameters by engineering the Xpk/Pta pathway is an important step towards developing Y. lipolytica as an industrially preferred microbial biocatalyst for lipid production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3abiocatalysts 3abiofuels 3abioprocessing 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3acarbon metabolism 3acitrates 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3alipids 3apentose phosphate cycle 3aphosphofructokinases 3aphosphoketolase1 aConsiglio, Andrew L.1 aMacEwen, Kyle1 aChen, Shuyan1 aChifamba, Gamuchirai1 aShaw, A.

Chemesthetic perception is studied to understand its effect on food-related behavior and health. Thus, the objective of this research was to study individual differences in chemesthetic perception. Our study involved sensory tests of three chemesthetic modalities (astringency, pungency, and cooling). Participants (N = 196) evaluated the intensity of samples in different concentrations using a line scale under sensory laboratory conditions. Aluminum ammonium sulfate, capsaicin, and menthol were used as the prototypic chemesthetic compounds. The participants were divided into sensitivity groups in different chemesthetic modalities by hierarchical clustering based on their intensity ratings. In addition, an oral chemesthesis sensitivity score was determined to represent the generalized chemesthesis sensitivity. The results showed that people can perceive chemesthesis on different intensity levels. There were significantly positive correlations between (1) sensitivity scores for oral chemesthesis and taste as well as (2) each chemesthesis and taste modalities. Moreover, based on the multinomial logistic regression model, significant interactions between oral chemesthesis and taste sensitivity were discovered. Our findings showed that people can be classified into different oral chemesthesis sensitivity groups. The methods and results of this study can be utilized to investigate associations with food-related behavior and health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aammonium sulfate 3aastringency 3acapsaicin 3amenthol 3apeople 3aregression analysis 3ataste sensitivity1 aPuputti, Sari 1 aAisala, Heikki 1 aHoppu, Ulla 1 aSeppä, Laila 1 aSandell, Mari A.0 tFoods.g2021 Nov. 08, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101127303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011900173300001800292520120300310592002801513650001601541650001001557650000901567700002001576773011201596852000901708856008101717930003301798946001101831655001201842IND60438789620221118044053.0151023e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-008-0373-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdds-Walton, Peggy L.10aDirectional and frequency response characteristics in the descending octaval nucleus of the toadfish (Opsanus tau)  ap. 1013-1029.  aThis study is a continuation of a long-term investigation of the auditory circuit in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau. Input from the auditory periphery projects to the ipsilateral descending octaval nucleus (DON). Ipsilateral and contralateral DONs project to the auditory midbrain, where a previous study indicated that both frequency tuning and directional sharpening are present. To better understand the transformation of auditory information along the auditory pathway, we have examined over 400 units in the DON to characterize frequency and directional information encoded in the dorsolateral division of the nucleus. Background activity was primarily low (<10 spikes/s) or absent. The maximum coefficient of synchronization was equivalent to the periphery (R = 0.9) and substantially better than in the midbrain. The majority of DON units (79%) responded best to stimulus frequencies of 84–141 Hz and were broadly tuned. DON cells retain or enhance the directional character of their peripheral input (s); however, characteristic axes were distributed in all quadrants around the fish, providing further evidence that binaural computations may first occur in the DON of this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpsanus tau 3abrain 3afish1 aFay, Richard R.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2008 Dec., v. 194, no. 12 p.1013-1029dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-008-0373-83Available from publisher's site  a20081128b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02629naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245017100161520133200332592002801664650001601692650002101708650001501729650001101744650002601755650001501781650001401796650001301810650002901823650001601852700001701868700001401885700001401899700001801913700001401931700001901945700001801964700001801982773012002000856007802120852000902198655001202207IND60757693620221123040948.0211125e20211108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075769362DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101127312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shaowen 10aUtilizing a Rapid Multi-Plug Filtration Cleanup Method for 72 Pesticide Residues in Grape Wines Followed by Detection with Gas Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry  aA convenient and fast multi-residue method for the efficient identification and quantification of 72 pesticides belonging to different chemical classes in red and white grape wines has been developed. The analysis was based on gas chromatography tandem quadrupole mass spectrometric determination (GC–MS/MS). The optimization strategy involved the selection of the amount of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and the number of cleanup procedure cycles for multi-plug filtration cleanup (m-PFC) to achieve ideal recoveries and reduce the sample matrix compounds in the final extracts. The optimized procedure obtained consistent recoveries between 70.2 and 108.8% (70.2 and 108.8% for white wine, and 72.3 and 108.4% for red wine), with relative standard deviations (RSDs) that were generally lower than 9.2% at the three spiking levels of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg. The linearity was studied in the range between 0.002 and 0.1 mg/kg using pesticide standards prepared both in pure solvent and in the presence of the matrix, showing coefficients of determination (R²) higher than 0.9495 for all the pesticides. To improve accuracy, matrix-matched calibration curves were used for calculating the quantification results. Finally, the method was used successfully for detecting pesticide residues in commercial grape wines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3acarbon nanotubes 3afiltration 3agrapes 3amultiresidue analysis 3apesticides 3ared wines 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awhite wines1 aBai, Aijuan 1 aSong Lê,1 aZou, Nan 1 aHan, Yongtao 1 aZhou, Li 1 aYu, Chuanshan 1 aLi, Changjun 1 aPan, Canping 0 tFoods.g2021 Nov. 08, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101127313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012300168300001600291520136400307592002801671650002501699650001301724650001001737650001201747650001201759650001501771650001201786700002201798700002101820773010901841852000901950856008101959930003302040946001102073655001202084IND60438789820221118044208.0151023e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-007-0310-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRitzmann, Roy E.10aMulti-unit recording of antennal mechano-sensitive units in the central complex of the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis  ap. 341-360.  aThe central complex (CC) is a group of midline neuropils in the protocerebrum of all insects (Williams, J Zool, 176:67–86, 1975; Strausfeld, Prog Brain Res, 123:273–284, 1999). Its columnar organization coupled with the anatomical tracts to and from this region suggests that the CC may supervise various forms of locomotion. In cockroach, lesions of the CC affect turning and controlled climbing over blocks (Ridgel et al., J Comp Physiol A, 193:385–402, 2007). Since these behaviors are largely directed by tactile cues detected by antennae, we predicted that some neurons in the CC respond to mechanical antennal stimulation. We used 16-channel probes to record from broad regions within the CC, while mechanically stimulating one or the other antenna. Using cluster cutting procedures, we examined 277 units in 31 preparations. Many of these units responded to mechanical stimulation of the antennae, and of these, most responded equally well to medial or lateral stimulation of either antenna. However, several units either responded to only one antenna or responded significantly more strongly to one of them. Most of the units responding to antennal stimulation were sensitive to changes in the velocity as well as changes in light. Our data reveal a large population of mult-sensory neurons in the CC that could contribute to locomotion control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlaberus discoidalis 3aantennae 3abrain 3acutting 3ainsects 3alocomotion 3aneurons1 aRidgel, Angela L.1 aPollack, Alan J.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2008 Apr., v. 194, no. 4 p.341-360dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-007-0310-23Available from publisher's site  a20080412b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02811naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011200165500002200277520146000299592002801759650001201787650001701799650002501816650001201841650001301853650001301866650002301879650001901902650001701921650001301938650001701951650001201968650001301980653004001993653002202033653003502055653001502090653001402105653002502119700001902144773009602163856008502259852000902344655001202353IND60656139020221119071830.0190809e20190806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065613902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2019.1173572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qisong10aEffects of functionalization on the nanofiltration performance of PIM-1: Molecular simulation investigation  aPre-press version  aAs a unique class of microporous polymers, polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) have attracted considerable interest for organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN). Here, we report a molecular simulation study to investigate OSN through six PIMs (pristine PIM-1 and five functional PIMs). The permeabilities of four organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and acetone) through PIM-1 are found to correlate well with a combination of membrane and solvent properties. In the presence of a solute (mometasone furoate), the predicted solvent permeabilities through PIM-1 agree well with available experimental data. The solute is 100% rejected in all the solvents; however, it has different effects on solvent permeation. For protic solvents (methanol and ethanol), the permeabilities are marginally reduced by the solute; this is attributed to the favourable interaction between the solute and protic solvent, thus the solute is less accumulated at the membrane interface. Upon substituting the cyano groups in PIM-1 by various functional groups (hydroxyl, amine, amidoxime, tetrazole and carboxyl), the functional PIMs generally exhibit larger swelling degrees in methanol and higher methanol permeability, surpassing many existing OSN membranes. This simulation study provides microscopic insights into the effects of functionalization on OSN and reveals the complex interplay of solute-solvent-membrane interactions in governing OSN performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aacetonitrile 3aartificial membranes 3aethanol 3amethanol 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3ananofiltration 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aporous media 3asolutes 3asolvents 0aPolymers of intrinsic microporosity 0aFunctionalization 0aOrganic solvent nanofiltration 0aPermeation 0aRejection 0aMolecular simulation1 aJiang, Jianwen0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Aug. 06, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.1173573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04081naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245015000203300001600353500002000369520247600389592002802865596005202893596005702945596005703002596005703059650001603116650001603132650002303148650001103171650001503182650001603197650001103213650002603224650002303250700005803273700006403331700005703395773011803452856008003570852000903650655001203659IND60769157720221122050201.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076915772DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.139882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhsaki, Haruna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1219-298910aIntraspecific interaction of host plants leads to concentrated distribution of a specialist herbivore through metabolic alterations in the leaves  ap. 779-793.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent studies suggest that changes in leaf traits due to interactions between plants affect resource utilisation by herbivores, as well as herbivore distribution. However, this has not yet been confirmed experimentally. Here, we investigated the effects of phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits of Rumex obtusifolius (host plant) in response to intraspecific and interspecific interactions on the distribution of two leaf beetles, Gastrophysa atrocyanea (specialist herbivore) and Galerucella grisescens (generalist herbivore). We investigated the local population density of R. obtusifolius plants and the presence of leaf beetles on the plants at five study sites. Leaf chemicals (condensed tannins and total phenolics) were compared between aggregated and solitary R. obtusifolius plants. To clarify the effects of the interaction environment of R. obtusifolius plants on their leaf traits and on resource utilisation by the leaf beetles, we compared leaf chemicals and preferences of adult leaf beetles among treatments where R. obtusifolius experienced intraspecific interaction, interspecific interaction or no interaction in cultivation experiments. Finally, we evaluated the independent and combined effects of patch size and intraspecific interaction on leaf beetle distribution in mesocosm experiments. In the field, the presence of the specialist leaf beetle G. atrocyanea was positively correlated with the local population density (rosette overlap ratio) of R. obtusifolius plants; however, there was no correlation in the case of the generalist leaf beetle G. grisescens. In the cultivation experiments, plants in the intraspecific interaction treatment increased their leaf concentrations of condensed tannins and total phenolics, and G. atrocyanea consumed more of these leaves than leaves in other treatments. Similar results were observed in the field. In the mesocosm experiments, larger numbers of G. atrocyanea were distributed on R. obtusifolius plants exposed to below‐ground intraspecific interaction than on plants not exposed to intraspecific interaction. Our results provide experimental evidence that leaf‐trait changes in response to intraspecific interaction between host plants influence specialist herbivore distribution. This highlights the need to integrate plant–plant interactions into our understanding of plant–animal interactions.

Here, a novel membrane with ion-recognizable copolymers in graphene-based nanochannels is developed for facilitated transport of potassium ions. The poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-benzo-15-crown-5-acrylamide) (PNB) copolymers are fixed in the lamellate spacings between the partially reduced graphene oxide (prGO) nanosheets. The K+ permeability of the fabricated prGO-PNB membrane remarkably increases at around the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the PNB copolymer, because of the dynamic complexation between B15C5 units and K+ ions at around the LCST. The selectivity of K+/Na+ increases with increasing the content of PNB copolymers in the membrane. The proposed membrane shows good stability in water and K+ separation performance. Due to the uniform channels and facilitated transport mechanism of the prGO-PNB membrane, the comprehensive performance of selectivity and permeability of the K+ ions is better than that of previously reported polymer-based nanofiltration membranes, polymer-based facilitated transport membranes and graphene-based membranes. The proposed strategy of this prGO-PNB membrane that combining graphene-based sheets as “skeleton” and substance-recognizable copolymers as “facilitators” is also applicable to fabricate membranes for facilitated transport of other ions or molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acations 3acomposite polymers 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananofiltration 3ananosheets 3apermeability 3apotassium 3asodium 3atemperature 0aFacilitated transport membranes 0aGraphene-based oxide nanosheets 0aCrown ethers 0aPotassium ions 0aIon-recognizable copolymers1 aLiu, Zhuang1 aDeng, Ke1 aChen, Zhi-Hao1 aCai, Quan-Wei1 aFaraj, Yousef1 aXie, Rui1 aJu, Xiao-Jie1 aWang, Wei1 aChu, Liang-Yin0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Aug. 02, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.1173453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005400168300001300222520148900235592002801724650001901752650001401771650001101785650001301796650001501809650001501824650002901839653003001868653002501898653001901923653002001942653001901962700001301981773009401994856008502088852000902173655001202182IND60591725820221121063603.0190318e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059172582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulver, Aaron10aOptimizing the spatial location of medical drones  ap. 9-16.  aUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are increasingly proposed for medical uses due to their potential to transport medical supplies quickly and efficiently. A prototype medical drone that is equipped with an on-board automated external defibrillator (AED) was announced recently to significantly reduce the time it takes for an AED to arrive to a patient's side. As drones are battery-operated and have limited service range, a network of medical drones is required to adequately provide service to a large area. This paper developed a new spatial optimization model, the backup coverage location problem with complementary coverage (BCLP-CC), to aid in the deployment of a network of AED enabled medical drones. By explicitly integrating backup coverage and continuously distributed demand, the BCLP-CC can optimally place drones and the corresponding launch sites while significantly improving backup coverage with minimal loss of primary coverage. Our results show that 90.4% of historical out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Salt Lake County can be responded to within 1 min by using 71 drones and 68 launch sites. In addition, 58.9% of incidents can be served by two or more drones, a significant improvement over existing models. This study shows that drones could significantly reduce life-saving equipment travel times for victims of cardiac arrest by appropriately siting them, which will motivate further research in using UAVs or drones for emergency medical purpose.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiac arrest 3ageography 3amodels 3apatients 3aprototypes 3asalt lakes 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0aEmergency medical service 0aSpatial optimization 0aMedical drones 0aBackup coverage 0aCardiac arrest1 aWei, Ran0 tApplied geography.g2018 Jan., v. 90 p.9-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04224naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005500111024002000166040001800186072000900204072000900213100001700222245016700239300001600406500002400422500001500446520206800461650002002529650002802549650002502577650001102602650002502613650002602638650002002664650002802684650002402712650002402736650001202760650001402772650004702786650001202833650001102845650003002856650004102886650001402927650003202941653002402973653002402997653002403021653001803045700001503063700001403078700001803092700001703110773012203127852000903249856010903258856011103367930003303478945002503511946001303536961001303549655001203562IND4394713020221119022836.0070906e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439471302DNAL7 a175472352pmid7 a10.1603/0022-2585(2007)44[484:COTPOA]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/80822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8211 aScoles, G.A.10aConservation of transmission phenotype of Anaplasma marginale (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) strains among Dermacentor and Rhipicephalus ticks (Acari: Ixodidae)  ap. 484-491.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBefore the eradication of Boophilus ticks from the United States, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini) and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus (Say) were important biological vectors of the cattle pathogen Anaplasma marginale Theiler. In the absence of Boophilus ticks, A. marginale continues to be transmitted by Dermacentor ticks. However, a few U.S. strains are not transmissible by Dermacentor andersoni Stiles, Dermacentor variabilis (Say), or both, raising the question of how these strains evolved and how they are maintained. We hypothesize that the U.S. non-Dermacentor-transmissible strains of A. marginale were formerly Boophilus-transmitted strains that have been maintained by a combination of persistent infection and mechanical transmission since the eradication of their biological vector from the United States. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to transmit a well-documented non-Dermacentor-transmissible A. marginale strain (Florida), by using D. andersoni and the two Boophilus species that formerly occurred in the United States. For comparison, we examined tick-borne transmission of a strain of A. marginale (Puerto Rico), which has previously been shown to be transmissible by both D. andersoni and B. microplus. All three species of tick transmitted the Puerto Rico strain, and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis confirmed the presence of A. marginale colonies in their salivary glands. All three tick species failed to transmit the Florida strain. Although both D. andersoni and B. microplus acquired transient midgut and salivary gland infections after acquisition feeding, we were unable to detect colonies of the Florida strain in the salivary glands with IHC. This demonstrates that the transmission phenotype of A. marginale strains is conserved among tick species, and it suggests that the failure of the Florida strain to be transmitted by ticks is related to a general inability to efficiently invade or replicate in tick cells, rather than to a failure to invade or replicate in cells of a specific tick species. 3adisease vectors 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amidgut 3adisease transmission 3aDermacentor andersoni 3asalivary glands 3aRhipicephalus annulatus 3abovine anaplasmosis 3aAnaplasma marginale 3astrains 3ainfection 2aAnaplasma marginalexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDermacentorxmicrobiology 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmicrobiology 2aPhenotype 2aRhipicephalusxmicrobiology 0aBoophilus annulatus 0atick-borne diseases 0aBoophilus microplus 0aRhipicephalus1 aUeti, M.W.1 aNoh, S.M.1 aKnowles, D.P.1 aPalmer, G.H.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2007 May, v.  44, no.  3 p.484-491dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585(2007)44%5B484:COTPOA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/80823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071128b20071210c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/11/26  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02834naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012200163300001600285520144200301592002801743650001701771650001401788650001701802650002001819650001001839650001501849650001601864650001101880650001901891650001901910653002201929653002601951653002301977653002102000653003602021700001602057700001702073700001902090700001602109700001202125700001302137773012202150856008302272852000902355655001202364IND60750151420221119044100.0220314e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075015142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Cheng10aFlowerlike BiOCl nanospheres fabricated by an in situ self-assembly strategy for efficiently enhancing photocatalysis  ap. 423-430.  aFor semiconductor-based photocatalytic reactions, defect engineering has been proven as an efficient approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance. In this work, a synergistically PVP/EG-assisted in situ self-assembly strategy has been successfully developed for preparing flowerlike BiOCl nanospheres (NSP) assembled by ultrathin nanosheets (thickness of 3.8 nm) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs). During the hydrothermal process, PVP plays a template role in controlling the orientation of the crystallite growth, leading to the forming of nanosheets. Meanwhlie, ethylene glycol would induce the self-assembly of nanosheets into a loose hierarchical architecture duo to its stereo-hindrance effect. NSP achieves a twice higher photocatalytic conversion of benzylamine than BiOCl nanosheets (NST) under visible light. XPS, ESR, NH₃-TPD results manifest that NSP possesses more active sites including OVs and unsaturated Bi atoms than NST, because of avoiding the accumulation of ultrathin nanosheets. In situ FTIR reveals that benzylamine molecules can be chemisorbed and activated on BiOCl interfaces via forming -N…Bi- species. The OVs can facilitate the forming of superoxide radicals (•O₂⁻), achieving the selective photooxidation. Finally, a possible synergetic mechanism based on the interaction of reactants and catalyst interfaces was proposed to illustrate the photocatalytic process at the molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzylamines 3acatalysts 3acrystallites 3aethylene glycol 3alight 3ananosheets 3ananospheres 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotooxidation 0aBiOCl nanospheres 0aIn situ self-assembly 0aDefect engineering 0aOxygen vacancies 0aSurface coordination activation1 aRen, Yahang1 aWang, Zhiwen1 aShi, Yingzhang1 aGuo, Binbin1 aYu, Yan1 aWu, Ling0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.423-430dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245019800175500001900373520150500392592002801897650001201925650001501937650002301952650002301975650001501998650001902013650001102032650002602043650000902069650001102078650001302089651001402102653002102116653001902137653002302156653002402179700002202203700002502225700002802250773011602278856008402394852000902478655001202487IND60734062620221122062852.0210708e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073406262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1069012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonasterio, Romina P.10aEffects of pre-harvest deficit irrigation during the oil accumulation period on fruit characteristics, oil yield extraction, and oil quality in olive cv.

Two regulated deficit irrigation treatments (RDI) were evaluated over two seasons in a cv. Genovesa olive orchard. This study included a Control treatment, irrigated at 100% crop evapotranspiration over the season, and two RDI treatments, irrigated at 50% (RDI1) and 30% (RDI2) of Control. These treatments were applied from the end of pit hardening (mid-January) until harvest (early- April), when oil is accumulated in fruits. Fruit moisture decreased as the deficit irrigation period advanced, being significantly lower in RDI2 and RDI1 than in the Control treatment. Fruits harvested from the RDI2 treatment had lower moisture, dry mass and oil deposition, and higher maturation and pulp flavonoid compounds concentration than in RDI1 and Control. Pooled data across seasons showed that a 1% reduction in fruit moisture produced an increase of 0.16% in oil yield extraction. Phenolic compounds increased consistently with fruit moisture decreasing from 60% to 50%. However, when fruit moisture was as low as 35%, phenolic compounds were the lowest. Additional fruit samples from RDI2 were processed with water addition after malaxation. Water addition led to a general pattern of increases in oil yield extraction, reduction of phenolic compounds, and no influence on acidity, UV indexes, or fatty acids profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aarid zones 3adeficit irrigation 3aevapotranspiration 3aflavonoids 3afruit moisture 3afruits 3airrigation scheduling 3aoils 3aolives 3aorchards 3aArgentina 0aOlea europaea L. 0aMaturity index 0aPhenolic compounds 0aFatty acids profile1 aBanco, Adriana P.1 aCaderón, Facundo J.1 aTrentacoste, Eduardo R.0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 June 30, v. 252 p.106901-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1069013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04165naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100003000187245007200217300001200289506007600301520215400377592002802531506003702559650003402596650002102630650002102651650001902672650002502691650002502716650002802741650001702769650001402786650000902800650001302809650001302822650001902835650002002854650001702874650001802891650001002909650001102919650001102930650001302941650002002954650002502974650001302999650001303012650003703025650001303062651001303075700003503088700001903123700003003142700003103172700005003203700002903253773013103282856008103413852000903494655001203503IND60574972320221207115335.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057497232DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-1752doi7 aPMC40472592pmcid7 a248861392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Dulcelena Ferreira10aCytotoxic effects of Euterpe oleracea Mart. in malignant cell lines  ap. 175.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Euterpe oleracea Mart., a plant from the Amazon region, is commonly known as açaí or juçara; it has high nutritional value and elevated levels of lipids, proteins, and minerals. Açaí is an abundant and much consumed fruit by the Amazon local population, and studies have demonstrated that it is rich in phytochemicals with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test this plant for anticancer activity in different human malignant cell lines. METHODS: Cell lines derived from breast and colorectal adenocarcinomas were treated with 10, 20, and 40 μg/mL of bark, seed, and total açaí fruit hydroalcoholic extracts for 24 and 48 h. After treatment, cell viability was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, and cell morphological features were observed by light and transmission electron microscopy. The type of cell death was also evaluated. The data were analyzed statistically by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s post hoc tests, as appropriate. RESULTS: We observed that of all the cell lines tested, MCF-7 was the only line that responded to açaí treatment. The extracts caused significant reduction (p < 0.01) in cell viability and altered cell morphological features by inducing the appearance of autophagic vacuoles, as observed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, increased expression of LC3BII, a protein marker of autophagosome formation, was observed by western blotting. Caspase Glo™ assays and morphologic observations by DAPI nuclear staining and transmission electron microscopy did not indicate any apoptotic events. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that açaí possesses antitumorigenic potential in the MCF-7 cell line. Further studies are needed to identify the compound (s) responsible for this cytotoxic activity and the molecular target in the cell. This discovery of the anticancer potential of açaí may help in the development of chemopreventive drugs and may have therapeutic effects in the treatment of breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aEuterpe oleracea 3aWestern blotting 3aadenocarcinoma 3aalternative medicine 3aanalysis of variance 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abark 3abromides 3acaspases 3acell viability 3achemoprevention 3acytotoxicity 3adata analysis 3adrugs 3ahumans 3alipids 3aminerals 3anutritive value 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aproteins 3astaining 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avacuoles 3aAmazonia1 aVidal, Flávia Castello Branco1 aSantos, Debora1 aCosta, Maria Célia Pires1 aMorgado-Diaz, Jose Andres,1 ado Desterro Soares Brandão Nascimento, Maria1 ade Moura, Roberto Soares0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.175-175dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-1753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011100170300001600281520140900297592002801706650001301734650002201747650001001769650001401779700002001793700002101813773010901834852000901943856008101952930003302033946001102066655001202077IND60438790020221120093007.0151023e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043879002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-007-0311-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbosa, Alexandra10aChangeable cuttlefish camouflage is influenced by horizontal and vertical aspects of the visual background  ap. 405-413.  aCuttlefish change their appearance rapidly for camouflage on different backgrounds. Effective camouflage for a benthic organism such as cuttlefish must deceive predators viewing from above as well as from the side, thus the choice of camouflage skin pattern is expected to account for horizontal and vertical background information. Previous experiments dealt only with the former, and here we explore some influences of background patterns oriented vertically in the visual background. Two experiments were conducted: (1) to determine whether cuttlefish cue visually on vertical background information; and (2) if a visual cue presented singly (either horizontally or vertically) is less, equally or more influential than a visual cue presented both horizontally and vertically. Combinations of uniform and checkerboard backgrounds (either on the bottom or wall) evoked disruptive coloration in all cases, implying that high-contrast, non-uniform backgrounds are responded to with priority over uniform backgrounds. However, there were differences in the expression of disruptive components if the checkerboard was presented simultaneously on the bottom and wall, or solely on the wall or the bottom. These results demonstrate that cuttlefish respond to visual background stimuli both in the horizontal and vertical plane, a finding that supports field observations of cuttlefish and octopus camouflage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSepiidae 3abenthic organisms 3acolor 3apredators1 aLitman, Leonild1 aHanlon, Roger T.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2008 Apr., v. 194, no. 4 p.405-413dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-007-0311-13Available from publisher's site  a20080412b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle05094naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012000165300001400285520327900299592002803578650000903606650002203615650002103637650001603658650001003674650002003684650001803704650002303722650001203745650001603757650001603773650001503789650002203804650001703826650001103843650001903854650002403873650001503897650002303912650002003935650001603955650002503971650002203996650001704018651001004035653002304045653001604068653001604084653001904100653001504119653003204134653001604166700001704182700001704199700001704216700001804233773010104251856008304352852000904435655001204444IND60584181020221121042411.0201125e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058418102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2017.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jianmei10aEvaluating water conservation effects due to cropping system optimization on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei plain, China  ap. 32-41.  aIrrigation of the conventional double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize has caused serious problems regarding water resources and the environment on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei plain (HP), China. Reducing or replacing high water consumption crops (such as winter wheat) is the most impactful way to effectively save water in the HP region. In this study, crop coefficient and vegetation remote sensing data were used to estimate evapotranspiration (ETₐ) for winter wheat and summer maize on the HP from 2009 to 2013. For early maize, ETₐ and yield were based on the results from the APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) crop model, which had been calibrated and validated using field experimental data. The effects on groundwater conservation and grain yield were estimated at the regional scale for the conventional winter wheat (WW) and summer maize (SM) double cropping system (Y₁M₂) and three alternative cropping systems: three harvests in two years system (Y₂M₃, 1st year: WW-SM; 2nd year: early maize), four harvests in three years system (Y₃M₄, 1st year: WW-SM; the next two years: early maize), as well as a continuous early maize monoculture system (Y₁M₁). The results showed that: (1) Relative to Y₁M₂, the water savings in each alternative cropping system exceeded 50% of the groundwater overdraft on the HP. The evapotranspirations of Y₂M₃, Y₃M₄ and Y₁M₁ decreased by 14%, 19% and 29% over that of Y₁M₂ (740mm), respectively. The economic water use efficiencies (WUEₑ) of the alternative cropping systems were 7% –16% greater than that of Y₁M₂. The groundwater drop by Y₁M₂ (0.59myear⁻¹) was higher than that by Y₂M₃ (0.20myear⁻¹) and Y₃M₄ (0.07myear⁻¹), and the drop by Y₁M₁ was negative, indicating a groundwater rise of 0.20m. The groundwater overdraft in Y₁M₂ was 160mm (3.83billionm³), and the alternative cropping systems were more sustainable, with groundwater overdrafts that were less than the recharge value of 128mm on the HP. (2) In comparison with Y₁M₂, the total yield was reduced by 2.28, 3.04 and 4.56billionkga⁻¹ (or 7.7%, 10.2% and 15.3%) for Y₂M₃, Y₃M₄ and Y₁M₁, respectively, which accounted for <15% of the regional total or <1% of the national total. It is important to note that the yield loss of the alternative cropping systems was below the net grain export amount in Hebei province, so the grain supply and demand could be roughly balanced. (3) In summary, Y₂M₃ is a preferred alternative cropping system over Y₁M₂ in the near future because of the advantages of high WUEₑ, economic return, mitigated groundwater level decline and balance between wheat supply and demand on the HP. Y₁M₁, which had the least water use and highest WUEₑ and economic return, is an option for the most serious groundwater overdraft area despite a contradiction between the traditional dietary habit and complete abandonment of wheat. Y₃M₄ is recommended as the transitional cropping system between Y₂M₃ and Y₁M₁. The method in this study is applicable to relevant regional research, and the results can be of use to the government when formulating policies on cropping systems and groundwater management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acosts and returns 3acrop coefficient 3acrop models 3acrops 3adouble cropping 3aeating habits 3aevapotranspiration 3aexports 3agrain yield 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3aspatial data 3asummer 3asupply balance 3asystem optimization 3avegetation 3awater conservation 3awater resources 3awater table 3awater use efficiency 3awater utilization 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aEvapotranspiration 0aGroundwater 0aGrain yield 0aRemote sensing 0aCrop model 0aAlternative cropping system 0aHebei plain1 aShen, Yanjun1 aQi, Yongqing1 aZhang, Yucui1 aXiao, Dengpan0 tAgricultural systems.g2018 Jan., v. 159 p.32-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2017.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012800157300001800285520065000303592002800953650001600981650002300997650001701020650001101037650001601048700001601064700001801080700001901098700002101117700002201138700001601160700001601176700002301192773013401215856007401349852000901423655001201432IND60660907320221116152320.0190827e20150331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066090732DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc01085c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZorlu, Yunus10a1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-Alkylsulfanyl phthalocyanines: effect of macrocycle distortion on spectroscopic and packing properties  ap. 6580-6583.  aThe effect of phthalocyanine macrocycle distortion on its spectroscopic and packing properties is studied, by comparing two phthalocyanines octa-non-peripherally substituted by alkanethiols of different bulkiness (n-hexyl and tert-butyl).

Comparison of frontier orbital energies revealed that this distortion decreases the conjugation potency of the benzo rings to the central pyrrolic rings.

In these countries, targeted pollution mitigation requires an understanding of where, how and when contaminants enter water bodies. Here we report on contamination of the Ciliwung River, a dynamic, tropical system flowing through the Jakarta metropolitan area (Indonesia). We measured a set of isotopic, chemical and microbial tracers in representative water and contamination sources, as well as longitudinally within the river, to assess the spatial and temporal variations in contaminant levels in and pathways to the river. In the dry season, we observed a tight coupling between locally recharged groundwater sources and the river, whereas in the wet season, one single water source originating from the fractured headwaters predominantly contributed to river flow. Yet, the flushing of upstream waters in the wet season did not always lead to the dilution of contaminants downstream. We delineated several contamination hotspots along the river, particularly active during the wet season due to higher hydrological connectivity between sources and the river. These hotspots may originate from septic tank leakage, as supported by metal ratios and dominant microbial communities, although we could not rule out other potential sources such as urban runoff or sediment resuspension. Bayesian source tracking on the whole microbial community proved useful in outlining processes that conventional tracers did not capture, such as the occurrence of a localised domestic contamination in the upper catchment, and the inflow of agricultural runoff all along the river profile during the wet season. Our study emphasises the role of rivers as biogeochemical reactors that constantly process and transform contaminants and microbial communities. We also demonstrate the value of using isotopic, chemical and microbial tools together to trace the movement of water and contaminants through urban rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA 3adeveloping countries 3adry season 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3ainfrastructure 3aisotopes 3ametropolitan areas 3amicrobial communities 3apollution control 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asediments 3aseptic systems 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3atracer techniques 3aurban runoff 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aIndonesia 0a16S rRNA 0aBacterial community 0aHeavy metals 0aWeathering 0aSediment 0aRiverine processes1 aPriadi, Cindy R.1 aRose, Alea M.1 aAbdillah, Ayik1 aMarthanty, Dwinanti R.1 aGibb, Karen S.1 aKaestli, Mirjam0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Sept. 10, v. 682 p.382-393dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011900176520135100295592002801646653002701674653001001701653003101711653001201742653002501754700001401779700001901793700002101812700001701833773010201850856008501952852000902037655001202046IND60656139520221119071905.0190809e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065613952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2019.1173482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThankamony, Roshni L.10aPorous covalent triazine piperazine polymer (CTPP)/PEBAX mixed matrix membranes for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separations  aMixed Matrix Membranes (MMMs) made from a porous covalent triazine piperazine polymer (CTPP) as filler embedded in poly ether-block-amide (PEBAX® 1657) were studied for the separation of CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 gas systems. At a loading rate of 0.025 wt%, significant improvement was achieved for both CO2 permeability (from 53 to 73 barrer) and selectivity (from 51 to 79 for CO2/N2 and from 17 to 25 for CO2/CH4) that were measured at 293 K and 3 bars. Results of FTIR, DSC, WAXS, and SEM revealed a strong interaction between CTPP and PEBAX due to the high density of hydrogen bonding in CTPP, which led to chain rigidification of PEBAX at very low loading rate compared to other literature reported systems. On the other hand, CTPP contains rich nitrogen in the framework, which favourites the adsorption of CO2 more than N2 and CH4. Hence, although the chain rigidification decreased the CO2 adsorption sites in PEBAX matrix, the intrinsic porosity and high surface area of CTPP compensated the diffusivity and solubility which in turn improved the overall permeability and selectivity at a very low loading rate. CTPP is highly stable in acid, base, and high temperature up to 400 °C. Hence, this novel type material is a very promising filler for preparation of mixed matrix membranes for the separation of CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 systems.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMixed matrix membranes 0aPEBAX 0aCovalent organic framework 0aTrazine 0aChain rigidification1 aLi, Xiang1 aDas, Swapan K.1 aOstwal, Mayur M.1 aLai, Zhiping0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 591dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.1173483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01441naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009200157300001800249520036900267592002800636650001900664650002000683650001200703650001300715650001700728650001900745650001400764650002100778700001500799700001500814700001900829700001400848773013400862856007400996852000901070655001201079IND60660907420221116152421.0190827e20150423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066090742DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc01087j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Quanlong10aCubic anatase TiO₂ nanocrystals with enhanced photocatalytic CO₂ reduction activity  ap. 7950-7953.  aSingle-crystalline anatase TiO₂ nanocubes with exposed {100} and {001} facets, prepared by hydrothermal and calcination methods, display especially high photocatalytic activity toward CO₂ reduction to methane and methanol, due to the synergistic effects of better crystallization, a more negative conduction band position and co-exposed {100} and {001} facets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acrystallization 3amethane 3amethanol 3ananocrystals 3aphotocatalysis 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide1 aYu, Jiaguo1 aZhang, Jun1 aZhang, Jinfeng1 aLiu, Gang0 tChemical communications.g2015 Apr. 23, v. 51, no. 37 p.7950-7953dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc01087j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001500186245008800201300002000289506007600309520112100385592002801506506003701534650002201571650001301593650001301606650002301619650002201642650001301664650001801677650001201695650002501707650001201732650001001744650001801754650000901772650001701781650001901798653003101817653002101848653002001869700002201889700001801911700001701929700001501946700002401961700002201985700002002007773017702027856007902204852000902283655001202292IND60172270220221207050519.0150602e20120911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017227022DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12059831092doi7 aPMC34431672pmcid7 a228913362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Young10aMetabolic manifestations of insulin deficiency do not occur without glucagon action  ap. 14972-14976.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo determine unambiguously if suppression of glucagon action will eliminate manifestations of diabetes, we expressed glucagon receptors in livers of glucagon receptor-null (GcgR ⁻/⁻) mice before and after β-cell destruction by high-dose streptozotocin. Wild type (WT) mice developed fatal diabetic ketoacidosis after streptozotocin, whereas GcgR ⁻/⁻ mice with similar β-cell destruction remained clinically normal without hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or hepatic glycogen depletion. Restoration of receptor expression using adenovirus containing the GcgR cDNA restored hepatic GcgR, phospho-cAMP response element binding protein (P-CREB), and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, markers of glucagon action, rose dramatically and severe hyperglycemia appeared. When GcgR mRNA spontaneously disappeared 7 d later, P-CREB declined and hyperglycemia disappeared. In conclusion, the metabolic manifestations of diabetes cannot occur without glucagon action and, once present, disappear promptly when glucagon action is abolished. Glucagon suppression should be a major therapeutic goal in diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomplementary DNA 3adiabetes 3aglucagon 3aglucagon receptors 3aglucose tolerance 3aglycogen 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3aislets of Langerhans 3aketosis 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3apyruvic acid 3astreptozotocin 0aglucagon receptor knockout 0aglucose turnover 0atype 1 diabetes1 aBerglund, Eric D.1 aWang, May-yun1 aFu, Xiaorong1 aYu, Xinxin1 aCharron, Maureen J.1 aBurgess, Shawn C.1 aUnger, Roger H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Sept. 11, v. 109, no. 37 p.14972-14976dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12059831093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245010600179300001600285520170400301592002802005650001602033650001102049650001402060650002302074650001302097650001802110650000902128650001402137650001702151650002402168650001702192650002202209650002002231700002602251700002202277700002402299700001802323700002702341700002202368700001902390773009902409856008502508852000902593655001202602IND60080830320221118135151.0140812e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008083032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2011.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrisawangwong, Tuanchai10aConcomitant and protective immunity in mice exposed to repeated infections with Echinostoma malayanum  ap. 740-744.  aConcomitant immunity and its consequence against infection play roles in regulating worm burdens in helminthiasis. Under natural conditions, this immunity is generated by exposure to repeated low dose or trickle infection. In this study, concomitant immunity was induced in mice exposed repeatedly to infection with Echinostoma malayanum and its protective effect on a challenge infection evaluated. A profile of worm burden from exposure to 10 metacercariae/mouse/week rose rapidly during the first 2weeks reaching a plateau from week 3 to 8 post infection. Based on a cumulative dose of infection, worm recoveries were around 75% in the first 2weeks, dropped to 50% at week 3 and 19% at week 8. After week 2, adult worm burden was constant and no juvenile worms were found after week 3 of the experiment. To examine the effect of resistance against reinfection, mice in the experimental group were primarily infected with 10 metacercariae/week for 5weeks, treated with praziquantel and were challenged with 75 metacercariae/animal. The number of worms recovered from the experimental groups was significantly lower than that from naïve control groups beginning from 24h to 28days post challenge. The worms in the experimental group showed growth retardation and the proportion of adult worms was lower than that in the control animals especially during the first 3weeks of the experiment. Parasite fecundity was also suppressed compared with that in the control group. The selective effects of protective immunity on establishment, growth, and fecundity of challenged worms affected the population dynamics of E. malayanum which is a similar phenomenon to concomitant immunity in schistosomiasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinostoma 3aadults 3afecundity 3agrowth retardation 3aimmunity 3ametacercariae 3amice 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apopulation dynamics 3apraziquantel 3aprotective effect 3aschistosomiasis1 aSithithaworn, Paiboon1 aSukkasaem, Pasana1 aJintakanon, Darunee1 aTesana, Smarn1 aSithithaworn, Jiraporn1 aAndrews, Ross H.,1 aFried, Bernard0 tExperimental parasitology.g2011 Apr., v. 127, no. 4 p.740-744dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2011.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006500145245011000210300001600320500002000336520162300356592002801979596002702007596004702034596004702081650001402128650001602142650001402158650002702172650001502199650002402214650001702238700001702255773011802272856008002390852000902470655001202479IND60769158220221122042012.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076915822DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.139732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesserman, Arianne F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9839-586114aThe contributions of individual traits to survival among terrestrial juvenile pond‐breeding salamanders  ap. 516-525.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIndividual survival is influenced by interactions between local environmental conditions and an organism's morphological, behavioural and physiological traits. Studies examining the effects of individual phenotypes on survival under variable conditions are relatively rare among early transitional life stages, although the vital rates of these life stages can importantly influence population dynamics. We experimentally examined the effects of initial body mass, movement, standard metabolic rate (SMR) and respiratory surface area water loss (RSAWL) on survival in the transitional juvenile life stage of two biphasic amphibian species (Ambystoma maculatum and A. opacum) in a 7‐month mark–recapture study under semi‐natural conditions. Juveniles with a larger initial body mass, lower initial SMR and/or a lower tendency to change locations had a higher likelihood of known survival. In contrast, we found no significant effect of RSAWL on juvenile survival. The relationships between individual phenotypes and survival did not differ between species, but equivalent species‐specific survival rates may have been attributed to larger initial body sizes in A. maculatum and lower SMR in A. opacum. Our results illuminate the complex ways in which individual traits influence survival during the early transitional life stage of two ambystomatid species under varying abiotic conditions. More generally, our findings illustrate potential advantages of simultaneously examining multiple traits to evaluate survival.

Cu-limitation increased rates of cell surface reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) in E. huxleyi but not in T. pseudonana. Furthermore, Cu-limited E. huxleyi cells took up more Cu when cysteine was present compared to when no ligand was added, although a dependence on cysteine concentration was not observed. In contrast, Cu uptake by replete cells was dependent upon the relative abundance of inorganic species [Cu(I)′]. We also show that cysteine can increase the bioavailability of Cu to Cu-limited cells, of both species, through the reductive release of Cu(I) from fairly strong Cu(II) ligands such as EDTA. Finally, support for a mechanism involving uptake of a Cys–Cu complex in E. huxleyi is drawn from the observation that Cu-limitation significantly enhances cysteine uptake by transporters that exhibit Michaelis–Menten kinetics. These Cu uptake strategies help explain the presence and distribution of dissolved thiols in surface seawater and have implications for the biogeochemical cycling of Cu in low Cu environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aEmiliania huxleyi 3aThalassiosira 3aalgae 3abioavailability 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acopper 3acysteine 3aenzyme kinetics 3aligands 3amodels 3aphytoplankton 3aredox reactions 3aseawater 3athiols 3atransporters1 aGoodnow, Sarah D.1 aVezeau, Grace E.1 aRichter, Lubna

Characterizing and delineating areas of sediment contamination and toxicity are important goals of coastal resource management in terms of ecological and economical perspectives. Core and surficial sediment samples were collected from an industrialized urban watershed at the East Coast of the United Stated and analyzed to evaluate the PCB contamination profile and toxicity resulting from dioxin-like PCBs as well as reductive dechlorination potential of indigenous PCB halorespiring bacteria through dechlorination activity assays. To support the experimental results an anaerobic dechlorination model was applied to identify microbial dechlorination pathways. The total PCB concentration in core samples ranged from 3.9 to 225.6 ng/g·dry weight (dw) decreasing with depth compared to 353.2 to 1213.7 ng/g·dw in surficial samples. The results of this study indicated an increase in PCB contamination over the last century as the industrial activity intensified. The toxicity resulting from dioxin-like PCBs was reduced up to 94% in core samples via 21 pathways resulting from the dechlorination model. Dechlorination rates in surficial sediment were between 1.8 and 13.2 · 10−3 mol% PCB116/day, while lower rates occurred in the core sediment samples. Dechlorination was achieved mainly through meta followed by para dechlorination. However, the rarer ortho dechlorination was also observed. Detection of indigenous PCB dechlorinating bacteria in the sediments and reduction of toxicity indicated potential for natural attenuation when point and nonpoint source PCBs in the urban watershed are controlled and PCB loading reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3acoasts 3adechlorination 3ahuman health 3aindustrialization 3amodels 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aresource management 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atoxicity 3awatersheds 3aUnited States 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 0aToxicity 0aRecontamination 0aReductive PCB dechlorination 0aDechlorination modeling1 aSowers, Kevin R.1 aDemirtepe, Hale1 aStiell, Brian1 aBaker, Joel E.1 aImamoglu, Ipek1 aKjellerup, Birthe V.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 683 p.154-165dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.1933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245013200215300001600347520170900363592002802072650001202100650001302112650002002125650002502145650001402170650001802184650002202202650001302224650001902237650001602256650002202272650001902294650001102313650001902324650001702343651001102360653001702371653001902388653002202407653001502429653002602444653002202470700003102492700002402523773009702547856008502644852000902729655001202738IND60591726320221121121217.0190318e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059172632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGounaridis, Dimitrios1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3145-728410aExploring prospective urban growth trends under different economic outlooks and land-use planning scenarios: The case of Athens  ap. 134-144.  aSimulation modeling along with scenario analysis is a useful tool for urban planning, by providing an appraisement of different alternatives and tradeoffs and thus contributing to improved decision making. The objective of this study is to explore potential future urban dynamics in the Messoghia plain, (peri-urban Athens, Greece) under four scenarios that reflect future growth traits in the area related to different economic performance realities and alternative policies. Messoghia, a predominantly rural area, experienced significant and unregulated urban growth, during the past decades, due to the construction of the international airport in the area, the significant allocation of funds triggered by 2004 Olympics and the absence of planning controls. However, the late economic circumstances significantly affected the growth trends in the area. First, the paper looks at the periodic changes occurred during the past three decades (1980–2015) employing remote sensing techniques and Landsat data. The observed changes are then combined with 20 dynamic, biophysical, socio-economic and legislative factors, to produce transition potential maps using the Random Forests algorithm. Scenarios are projected until 2045 by implementing a spatially explicit Cellular Automata model. Under an economically optimistic scenario which means high or medium development circumstances, and given the absence of an adequate controlling mechanism, the artificial surfaces are expected to nearly double in size, by 2045. In case of a continuation of economic scarcity which can be translated in low or very low development, the artificial surfaces are expected to increase by 9% or 6% respectively, by 2045.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aairports 3adecision making 3aeconomic performance 3ageography 3agrowth traits 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3aremote sensing 3arural areas 3asimulation models 3asocioeconomics 3asports 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3aGreece 0aUrban growth 0aRandom forests 0aCellular automata 0aSimulation 0aDevelopment scenarios 0aLand use planning1 aChōrianopoulos, Giannēs,1 aKoukoulas, Sotirios0 tApplied geography.g2018 Jan., v. 90 p.134-144dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04394naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001500187245016900202300001200371506007600383520211700459592002802576506003702604650003402641650002402675650002502699650002502724650001702749650002102766650001202787650002302799650001502822650001702837650002202854650001802876650001802894650001402912650001902926650001602945650001902961650002502980650001103005650002103016650001703037650001403054650003203068650001003100650001303110650002003123650000903143650002503152650001303177650001803190650001303208650001403221650002603235650001803261650001103279650001203290650002503302651001403327700002603341700002003367700002803387773013103415856008103546852000903627655001203636IND60574972820221207115324.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057497282DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-1522doi7 aPMC40399862pmcid7 a248857092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLay, Ma Ma10aPhytochemical constituents, nutritional values, phenolics, flavonols, flavonoids, antioxidant and cytotoxicity studies on Phaleria macrocarpa (Scheff.) Boerl fruits  ap. 152.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The edible fruits of Phaleria macrocarpa (Scheff.) Boerl are widely used in traditional medicine in Indonesia. It is used to treat a variety of medical conditions such as - cancer, diabetes mellitus, allergies, liver and heart diseases, kidney failure, blood diseases, high blood pressure, stroke, various skin diseases, itching, aches, and flu. Therefore, it is of great interest to determine the biochemical and cytotoxic properties of the fruit extracts. METHODS: The methanol, hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and water extracts of P. macrocarpa fruits were examined for phytochemicals, physicochemicals, flavonols, flavonoids and phenol content. Its nutritional value (A.O.A.C method), antioxidant properties (DPPH assay) and cytotoxicity (MTT cell proliferation assay) were also determined. RESULTS: A preliminary phyotochemical screening of the different crude extracts from the fruits of P. macrocarpa showed the presence secondary metabolites such as of flavonoids, phenols, saponin glycosides and tannins. The ethyl acetate and methanol extracts displayed high antioxidant acitivity (IC₅₀ value of 8.15±0.02 ug/mL) in the DPPH assay comparable to that of the standard gallic acid (IC₅₀ value of 10.8±0.02 ug/mL). Evaluation of cytotoxic activity showed that the crude methanol extract possessed excellent anti-proliferative activity against SKOV-3 (IC₅₀ 7.75±2.56 μg/mL) after 72 hours of treatment whilst the hexane and ethyl acetate extracts displayed good cytotoxic effect against both SKOV-3 and MDA-MB231 cell lines. The chloroform extract however, showed selective inhibitory activity in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 (IC₅₀ 7.80±1.57 μg/mL) after 48 hours of treatment. There was no cytotoxic effect observed in the Ca Ski cell line and the two normal cell lines (MRC-5 and WRL-68). CONCLUSION: The methanol extract and the ethyl acetate fraction of P. macrocarpa fruits exhibited good nutritional values, good antioxidant and cytotoxic activities, and merits further investigation to identify the specific compound(s) responsible for these activities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPhaleria macrocarpa 3aalternative medicine 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abreast neoplasms 3acalcium 3acell proliferation 3achloroform 3acytotoxicity 3adiabetes mellitus 3aedible fruits 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonols 3afruit extracts 3agallic acid 3aheart diseases 3ahematologic diseases 3ahexane 3ahypersensitivity 3ahypertension 3ainfluenza 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aliver 3amethanol 3anutritive value 3apain 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apruritus 3arenal failure 3asaponins 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3askin diseases 3astroke 3atannins 3atraditional medicine 3aIndonesia1 aKarsani, Saiful Anuar1 aMohajer, Sadegh1 aAbd Malek, Sri Nurestri0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.152-152dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-1523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245016300175300001600338520167700354592002802031650001602059650001602075650002002091650001202111650001802123650002602141650001302167650001002180650001602190650001502206650001302221650001202234650001702246650001802263650000802281650002002289650002102309650002102330650001502351650002602366650001402392650001102406653001602417653001702433653001202450700002002462700002002482773008802502856008602590852000902676655001202685IND60089278620221119122348.0160903e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008927862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.07.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, David J.14aThe on-line detection of biological particle emissions from selected agricultural materials using the WIBS-4 (Waveband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor) technique  ap. 415-425.  aAgricultural activities have, for some time, been linked to adverse health effects such as Farmers' lung, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, aspergillosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) This connection is known to be, at least in part, due to the numerous microbiological organisms that live and grow on materials found in occupational settings such as barns, animal shelters, stables and composting sites. Traditional techniques for determining biological release of fungal spores and bacteria require intensive, experienced human resources and considerable time to determine ambient concentrations. However more recently the fluorescence and light scattering signals obtained from primary biological aerosol particles (PBAP) have been utilised for their near real-time counting and characterisation abilities.In the current study, data collected for the bioaerosol types released from hay and silage were counted and identified using a combination of the WIBS-4 bioaerosol sensor approach and impaction/optical microscopy. Particle emissions were characterised according to particle numbers, their size distributions, particle asymmetry values and fluorescence characteristics. The variables obtained were shown to provide potential “fingerprint” signatures for PBAP emissions emanating from two important compost components, namely, silage and hay. Comparisons between the data acquired by the WIBS-4 bioaerosol sensor, optical microscopy findings and also previous literature suggest that the likely identification of Aspergillus/Penicillium type spores and bacterial species released from hay and silage was achieved on a relatively rapid time-scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aPenicillium 3aadverse effects 3aanimals 3aaspergillosis 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abacteria 3abarns 3abioaerosols 3acomposting 3acomposts 3afarmers 3afluorescence 3afungal spores 3ahay 3ahuman resources 3ahypersensitivity 3alight scattering 3amicroscopy 3aparticulate emissions 3apneumonia 3asilage 0aBioaerosols 0aFluorescence 0aCompost1 aHealy, David A.1 aSodeau, John R.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2013 Dec., v. 80 p.415-425dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.07.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016800168520144300336592002801779650002401807650001101831650001201842650001401854650002301868650002101891650002101912650001601933650001201949653002401961653001901985653003002004653001702034653003102051700002302082700002102105700002202126700002002148700001702168700002302185773010802208856008502316852000902401655001202410IND60734063220221121220459.0211003e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073406322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1068372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBetchaku, Mii10aCatalytic performance of hydrotalcite-like-compound-derived Ni-metal alloy catalyst for toluene reforming with gasoline engine exhaust model gas as reforming agent  aReforming of toluene with model exhaust gas was carried out as Reformed EGR of gasoline engine mainly at 773 K with Ni-M/Mg/Al (Ni 12 wt%, M = Fe, Co, Cu) prepared from corresponding hydrotalcite-like compounds. Ni-Fe/Mg/Al (Fe/Ni = 0.1–0.5) showed clearly higher performance than Ni/Mg/Al in terms of activity, coke-deposition resistance and stability. In contrast, Ni-M/Mg/Al (M/Ni = 0.25, M = Co, Cu) showed similar behaviors to Ni/Mg/Al. The optimum Fe/Ni ratio was 0.25 from toluene conversion and the suppression of benzene formation. Ni-Fe/Mg/Al (Fe/Ni = 0.25) showed high coke-deposition resistance at any position of the catalyst bed, indicating that both substrate decomposition and CO disproportionation were suppressed. The coke amount was not increased even at low temperature (773 K) or higher toluene partial pressure (toluene/H₂O/N₂/CO₂ = 0.5–1.2/11.8/71.2/11.8, molar ratio), but the activity gradually decreased under such conditions. The Ni-Fe alloy nanoparticles in the reduced Ni-Fe/Mg/Al were almost unchanged during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst was regenerated successfully by the treatment under N₂ at 873 K, catalytic use at 973 K or re-reduction. These results suggest that the deactivation was caused by carbonaceous species which can be removed easily even by N₂ treatment, rather than by graphite-like coke that is difficult to be eliminated via such simple treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3aalloys 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agasoline engines 3apartial pressure 3atemperature 3atoluene 0aNickel‑iron alloy 0aFuel reforming 0aExhaust gas recirculation 0aRegeneration 0aCoke-deposition resistance1 aNakagawa, Yoshinao1 aTamura, Masazumi1 aYabushita, Mizuho1 aMiura, Yasutomo1 aIida, Shinya1 aTomishige, Keiichi0 tFuel processing technology.g2021 July, v. 218 p.106837-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1068373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010800167300001600275520168000291592002801971650000801999650001602007650001702023650001802040650001602058650001202074650001902086650001902105650001502124650002602139650001402165650001302179650001502192650002602207653001502233653001902248653002102267653002202288653001902310700002202329700002102351700001902372773011802391856008302509852000902592655001202601IND60647131620221117093106.0190712e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064713162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2019.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasotti, Fabio10aAirborne contamination in the food industry: An update on monitoring and disinfection techniques of air  ap. 147-156.  ahygienic and safe production is a high priority in the food industry. During processing, food may be subjected to bio-contamination. Accordingly, preservation of overall quality by keeping a clean environment is a goal to pursue. Among microbial vectors, air is considered a contributing factor to cross-contamination.nowadays, in food plants emphasis is paid to the assessment of air bioload in view of prevention of recontamination. Normally, air entering a processing plant is chilled and filtered to remove undesired microorganisms from outside. Nevertheless, apart from clean-room environments, uncontrolled factors (processes, personnel, structures, etc.) contribute to the release of microorganisms in indoor environments, resulting in generation of bioaerosols highly variable within and among plants, and on a daily basis within the same plant.this review focuses on the relevance of bioaerosol monitoring in the food industry, providing an update of air sampling techniques and methods of analysis in view to strengthen preventive hygienic actions. Disinfection procedures to minimize microbial counts in the air as additional safeguard to the standard chemical sanitation protocols are reviewed. Benefits and limitations of air treatment by chemical fogging, ozonation, uv irradiation or cold plasma are outlined. Air bioload monitoring and the implementation of subsequent air disinfection procedures are a feasible and a routinely exploitable strategy to satisfy hygienic requirements in food plants. Further research is required to face technical challenges and optimize the feasibility of some disinfection technologies for the real-world of food environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abioaerosols 3adisinfection 3afood industry 3afood plants 3ahygiene 3amicrobial load 3amicroorganisms 3amonitoring 3anonthermal processing 3aozonation 3asampling 3asanitation 3aultraviolet radiation 0aBioaerosol 0aAir monitoring 0aChemical fogging 0aGaseous ozonation 0aUV irradiation1 aCattaneo, Stefano1 aStuknytė, Milda1 aDe Noni, Ivano0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2019 Aug., v. 90 p.147-156dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2019.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245009500206300001600301500002000317520179100337592002802128596005102156596003602207650001202243650001802255650001702273650002202290650002502312650002602337650001902363650001502382650001502397650002402412650001102436650001602447700002302463700006902486700006502555700006002620700007102680700006002751773011802811856008002929852000903009655001203018IND60769158420221122042023.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076915842DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.139812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPilecky, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3404-592310aHydrogen isotopes (δ2H) of polyunsaturated fatty acids track bioconversion by zooplankton  ap. 538-549.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOrganisms at the base of aquatic food webs synthesize essential nutrients, such as omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n‐3 PUFA), which are transferred to consumers at higher trophic levels. Many consumers, requiring n‐3 long‐chain (LC) PUFA, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have limited ability to biosynthesize them from the essential dietary precursor α‐linolenic acid (ALA) and thus rely on dietary provision of LC‐PUFA. We investigated LC‐PUFA metabolism in freshwater zooplankton using stable hydrogen isotopes (δ²H) of fatty acids as tracers. We conducted feeding experiments with the freshwater keystone grazer Daphnia to quantify changes in the δ²H value of body FA in response to the FA composition of their food and the δ²H value of the ambient water. The isotopic composition of LC‐PUFA changed in Daphnia, depending on the integration of ²H from ambient water during de novo synthesis or bioconversion from dietary precursors, allowing us to distinguish dietary from bioconverted EPA in body tissue. We tested the applicability of these laboratory findings in a field setting by analysing δ²H values of PUFA in primary producers and consumers in eutrophic ponds to track EPA sources of zooplankton. Multilinear regression models that included conversion of ALA to EPA correlated better with zooplankton δ²HEPA than seston δ²HEPA at low dietary EPA supply. This study provides evidence that zooplankton can compensate for low dietary EPA supply by activating LC‐PUFA biosynthesis and shows that herbivorous zooplankton play a crucial role in upgrading FA for higher trophic levels during low dietary EPA supply.

Acupuncture and herbal medicine has been a recent favorable therapeutic approach. Thus we aimed to review the effects of acupuncture and herbal medicine in the past decade as a preceding research in order to further investigate the most effective Korean Medicine treatment for PMS/PMDD. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using electronic databases on studies published between 2002 and 2012. Our review included randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture and herbal medicine for PMS/PMDD. Interventions include acupuncture or herbal medicine. Clinical information including statistical tests was extracted from the articles and summarized in tabular form or in the text. Study outcomes were presented as the rate of improvement (%) and/or end-of-treatment scores. RESULTS: The search yielded 19 studies. In screening the RCTs, 8 studies in acupuncture and 11 studies in herbal medicine that matched the criteria were identified. Different acupuncture techniques including traditional acupuncture, hand acupuncture and moxibustion, and traditional acupuncture technique with auricular points, have been selected for analysis. In herbal medicine, studies on Vitex Agnus castus, Hypericum perforatum, Xiao yao san, Elsholtzia splendens, Cirsium japonicum, and Gingko biloba L. were identified. Experimental groups with Acupuncture and herbal medicine treatment (all herbal medicine except Cirsium japonicum) had significantly improved results regarding PMS/PMDD. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence supports the efficacy of alternative medicinal interventions such as acupuncture and herbal medicine in controlling premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Acupuncture and herbal medicine treatments for premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder showed a 50% or better reduction of symptoms compared to the initial state. In both acupuncture and herbal medical interventions, there have been no serious adverse events reported, proving the safety of the interventions while most of the interventions provided over 50% relief of symptoms associated with PMS/PMDD. Stricter diagnostic criteria may have excluded many participants from some studies. Also, depending on the severity of symptoms, the rate of improvement in the outcomes of the studies may have greatly differed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCirsium japonicum 3aElsholtzia splendens 3aGinkgo biloba 3aHypericum perforatum 3aVitex 3aacupuncture 3adatabases 3aherbal medicines 3amedical treatment 3amedicine 3amenstruation 3aquality of life 3arandomized clinical trials 3ascreening 3astatistical analysis 3asystematic review 3awomen1 aKim, Dong Il1 aChoi, Min-Sun0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.11-11dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014300169520135600312592002801668650002301696650002301719650001201742650001201754650001101766650002301777650001801800650001801818650001401836650001201850650001601862653001101878653001901889653001801908653002901926653001801955653001801973700003201991700001502023700001702038700001202055700001202067700002002079700001902099700001802118700001402136700001302150700001302163700001502176773010802191856008502299852000902384655001202393IND60734063420221121220623.0211003e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073406342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1068392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuanjing10aTemporal and spatial evolution of biochar chemical structure during biomass pellet pyrolysis from the insights of micro-Raman spectroscopy  aBiomass pellet is a popular fuel, and pyrolytic char can be a promised carbon material, further understanding char structural evolution can promote its utilization. To deeply investigate the evolution of char chemical structure and its heterogeneity during biomass pellet pyrolysis process, a new method was developed to fragment the char in space, and the chemical structures of the fragmented sections were analyzed by a micro-Raman spectroscopy (equipped with a 532 nm laser). The first-order Raman spectra (800–1800 cm⁻¹) of varied positions of sawdust pellet pyrolytic char were curve-fitted with 10 Gaussian bands to reveal the temporal and spatial evolutions. The results indicate that pyrolysis of sawdust pellet can be divided into two stages: i) the decomposition of raw biomass (temperature heterogeneity in pellet remains); ii) the condensation reactions of aromatic ring systems (temperature in pellet becomes uniform). The axial and radial heterogeneity of char chemical structure is mainly caused by heat transfer when the whole pellet temperature is uniform during heating. While mass transfer, in accordance with volatile diffusion, can eliminate the heterogeneity of char chemical structure by volatile-char interaction. The combined effects of heat and mass transfer lead to a heterogeneity in pellet char chemical structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aaromatic compounds 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achemical structure 3aheat transfer 3amass transfer 3apyrolysis 3asawdust 3atemperature 0aPellet 0aChar structure 0aHeterogeneity 0aMicro-Raman spectroscopy 0aHeat transfer 0aMass transfer1 aSyed Shatir A.

Genes encoding ZIPs are present in the genomes of schistosomes. Here, we describe molecular characterisation of six ZIPs (SjZIPA-F) from Schistosoma japonicum. Quantitative PCR analyses of these ZIPs through the lifecycle showed that each is expressed predominantly during the intramammalian stage and are particularly enriched in adult females. Using laser microdissected tissue as template, SjZIPA-D were transcriptionally enriched in female reproductive tissues, SjZIPE was not expressed in specific tissues and SjZIPF was expressed similarly in each tissue. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed that SjZIPA and SjZIPB were localised to the oesophageal gland of adults and the vitellaria. We have shown that multiple ZIPs are expressed by schistosomes during the intramammalian parasitic phases and propose that the encoded products perform diverse cellular functions related to metal transport in different cells of S. japonicum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aadults 3acell membranes 3afemales 3agenes 3ain situ hybridization 3ametal ions 3aparasitology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransporters 3azinc1 aGlanfield, Amber1 aNawaratna, Sujeevi1 aGobert, Geoffrey N.1 aMcManus, Donald P.1 aJones, Malcolm K.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2011 Apr., v. 127, no. 4 p.768-776dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2011.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008600206300001100292520105800303592002801361596004301389650001601432650001101448650001601459650002101475650001201496650002501508651001501533700001901548700002301567700002201590700002301612700001801635700003301653700001801686700002501704700001901729773012701748856008301875852000901958655001201967IND60759499220221121064213.0220120e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075949922DNAL7 a10.1186/s13002-021-00493-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarooq, Harith1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9031-278510aSpecies perceived to be dangerous are more likely to have distinctive local names  ap. 69.  aBACKGROUND: Species with direct uses, such as sources of food, shelter, building material and medicine tend to have more specific local names. But could the same apply for species that people fear? METHODS: To address this question, here we explore the behavior and perception of species diversity and dangerousness through a survey of 1037 households in nine villages in Cabo Delgado, northern Mozambique. We compare people’s knowledge of snakes with that of lizards and amphibians. RESULTS: We find that northern Mozambicans know four to five times more local names for snakes than for lizards and frogs, despite the local species richness of snakes being comparable to the diversity of lizards and frogs. We further find that local knowledge was on par with the academic literature regarding snakebite symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that fear can increase the level of specificity in naming species among indigenous communities, which could lead to biases in the mapping and protection of species that include data from citizen reports.  aPublisher supplied data  a#2017- 03862cSwedish Research Council 3afearfulness 3apeople 3asnake bites 3aspecies richness 3asurveys 3atraditional medicine 3aMozambique1 aBero, Cláudio1 aGuilengue, Yolanda1 aElias, Clementina1 aMassingue, Yasalde1 aMucopote, Ivo1 aNanvonamuquitxo, Cristóvão1 aMarais, Johan1 aAntonelli, Alexandre1 aFaurby, Søren0 tJournal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.69-69dBioMed CentralwJournal:2213x1746-42697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13002-021-00493-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02025naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010000174300001600274500001400290520117300304592002801477650001801505650001001523650001501533773012101548856008101669852000901750655001201759IND60438790820221120093042.0160512e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043879082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-015-1013-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZupanc, Günther K.

Keeton  ap. 957-960.  aEditorial  aThe tremendous increase in the number of authors and institutional affiliations on papers published in the natural sciences over the last few decades is commonly interpreted as an indicator of an increase in the collaborative spirit. However, a closer analysis suggests that this development reflects an increase in cooperation (defined as a strategy to divide labor among participants), rather than a rise in collaboration (defined as a mutual engagement of participants in a coordinated effort to jointly solve a problem). An exception to this development was William T. Keeton (1933–1980), who, as a faculty member at Cornell University, pioneered research into pigeon homing. A direct result of his willingness to openly share ideas and collaborate with other investigators is the article by Hagstrum and Manley (J Comp Physiol A, 2015) in this issue of the Journal of Comparative Physiology A. Their study is based on data from experiments Keeton and his collaborators conducted some 40 years ago. Despite the age of these data, their analysis and the interpretation of the results are likely to stimulate fruitful discussion in the field of avian orientation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColumba livia 3abirds 3aphysiology0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2015 Oct., v. 201, no. 10 p.957-960dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-015-1013-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009700164300001600261520160200277592002801879650002501907650001601932650001601948650001701964650002301981650001802004650001402022650002002036650001602056650001402072650001802086650000902104650001302113650001102126650002402137650001602161650001602177650001302193650002002206650001302226650001602239700001902255700001902274773010402293856008202397852000902479655001202488IND60486046020221120110033.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-015-2127-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min-ho,10aEstrogen-like osteoprotective effects of glycine in in vitro and in vivo models of menopause  ap. 791-800.  aRecently, the placenta mesotherapy has been widely used to treat menopause. Placenta contains amino acids, peptides, minerals, and estrogen. Here, we investigated the estrogen-like osteoprotective effects of glycine (a main ingredient of placenta) in in vitro and in vivo models of menopause. We assessed the effect of glycine on MG-63 osteoblast cell line, MCF-7 estrogen-dependent cell line, and ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Glycine significantly increased the MG-63 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase were increased by glycine in MG-63 cells. Glycine also increased the BrdU-incorporation and Ki-67 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells. Glycine induced the up-regulation of estrogen receptor-β mRNA expression and estrogen-response element-luciferase activity in MG-63 and MCF-7 cells. In OVX mice, glycine was administered orally at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg per day for 8 weeks. Glycine resulted in the greatest decrease in weight gain caused by ovariectomy. Meanwhile, vaginal weight reduced by ovariectomy was increased by glycine. Glycine significantly increased the ALP activity in OVX mice. MicroCT-analysis showed that glycine significantly enhanced bone mineral density, trabecular number, and connectivity density in OVX mice. Moreover, glycine significantly increased the serum 17β-estradiol levels reduced by ovariectomy. Glycine has an estrogen-like osteoprotective effect in menopause models. Therefore, we suggest that glycine may be useful for the treatment of menopause.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aamino acids 3ablood serum 3abone density 3acell proliferation 3adose response 3aestradiol 3agene expression 3aingredients 3amenopause 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aminerals 3amodels 3aoral administration 3aosteoblasts 3aovariectomy 3apeptides 3aphosphorylation 3aplacenta 3aweight gain1 aKim, Hyung-Min1 aJeong, Hyun-Ja0 tAmino acids.g2016 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.791-800dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-015-2127-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009000159300001600249520113800265592002801403653001601431653001701447653001201464653001901476653001901495700001801514700001701532700001401549700001701563700001601580700001401596700001201610700001401622700001401636773015401650856007501804852000901879655001201888IND60128997220221118015806.0151124e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012899722DNAL7 a10.2987/08-5779.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, W.

The objectives of this work were to present not only information on spray-system droplet size generated by different sprayers, but to compare methodologies by which other similar systems can be evaluated and give applicators sprayer-system performance data. Data from 45 replicated spray tests, comprising 11 sprayers and 5 pesticides, showed a wide range in the droplet size spectra produced. The volume median diameter measurements ranged from 2.6 to 75.5 μμm for diesel-diluted sprays and from 27.9 to 59.9 μμm for water-diluted sprays. Similarly, the percent volume <20 μμm ranged between 12.0––100%% and 8.5––30.7%%, for diesel- and water-diluted sprays, respectively. The droplet sizes measured by the swinging slide and laser diffraction methods were not consistent. The information presented aids users in sprayer selection and operation to produce the specific droplet size spectra required for a particular application.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAtomization 0adroplet size 0asprayer 0athermal fogger 0avector control1 aWalker, T.

To cope with this problem, a land suitability assessment has become an essential tool for sustainable land use management. The present research qualitatively evaluated the suitability of land in the Al-Yarmouk Basin (S-Syria) for rainfed winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivation. In this study, a regional spatial approach involving three steps was developed, based on the method proposed by Sys et al. In the first step, a soil survey was carried out and 107 soil profiles were described, sampled and analyzed. In the second step, climatic gridded datasets from 1984–2014 MRm at a high spatial resolution (30 meters) and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were clipped from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and prepared for the study area. In the third step, a land suitability assessment was performed using the geographical information system (GIS) and multi criteria decision support (MCDS). Soil survey outcomes showed that the study area was dominated by five soil orders: Mollisols, Inceptisols, Vertisols, Entisols and Aridisols. Also, results from the Sys model illustrated that more than 23.8% of the study area is highly suitable (S1–0) for wheat production without any limitations, whereas 38.7% and 37.5% are highly suitable (S1–1) and moderately suitable (S2), respectively. Also, the study emphasizes the important role of topographical factors in the study area for wheat cultivation. All in all, this research suggests W-Syria as a potential region for wheat cultivation, instead of the eastern area which is subject to climate change and a shortage of water. Integrating the Sys-approach and the GIS framework offers a good tool for policy-makers to apply in Syria for land suitability assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAridisols 3aEntisols 3aInceptisols 3aMollisols 3aTriticum aestivum 3aVertisols 3aagricultural industry 3abasins 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adigital elevation models 3ageographic information systems 3aland degradation 3aland suitability 3aland use planning 3aradar 3asoil surveys 3asustainable land management 3atopography 3awinter wheat 3aSyria 0aLand evaluation 0aSDGs 0aland suitability 0awheat 0aSyria1 aAlsafadi, Karam1 aʻAlī, Ḥaidar,1 aMousavi, Seyed Mohammad Nasir1 aKiwan, Samer1 aHennawi, Sami1 aHarsanyie, Endre1 aPhạm, Quó̂c Bảo,1 aLinh, Nguyen Thi Thuy1 aAli, Rawshan1 aAnh, Duong Tran1 aThai, Van Nam0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Mar. 19, v. 37, no. 6 p.1645-1663dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2020.17906743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013500162300001800297500001900315520077800334592002801112650001401140650001801154650001201172650001201184650001001196650001901206650002001225653001601245653002501261653003001286653002401316653002101340700001901361700001901380700002001399700002101419700001601440773018601456856007301642852000901715655001201724IND60692360920221119111050.0200502e20071123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069236092DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.705512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYAMAMOTO, Masanobu12aA Novel Lepidopteran Sex Pheromone Produced by Females of a Lithosiinae Species, Lyclene dharma dharma, in the Family of Arctiidae  ap. 2860-2863.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFemale moths of Lyclene dharma dharma (Arctiidae, Lithosiinae) produced three pheromone components (I–III), which strongly stimulated male antennae.

While the stereochemistry of the chiral centers could not be determined because it was difficult to collect a sufficient amount of the natural pheromone, the plain structures of I and II were confirmed by synthesis of the racemic mixtures starting from diols.

This retrospective study included cats diagnosed with HL based on liver cytology or histopathology (years 2004–2015), and aimed to identify clinical and laboratory parameters associated with mortality. The study included 71 cats (47 females and 24 males) and 85 control cats with non‐HL diseases. Most HL cats (90 per cent) were mixed breed, neutered (70; 99 per cent), female (47; 66 per cent), indoor cats (56; 79 per cent), fed dry commercial diets (44 cats; 62 per cent), and with a median age of 7.5 years (range 1.5–16.0). Common primary conditions included gastrointestinal diseases, pancreatitis and cholangiohepatitis (31 cats; 44 per cent) and stressful events (14; 20 per cent). HL was idiopathic in 20 cats (28 per cent). The overall mortality was 38 per cent (27/71 cats). Older age, as well as dullness, weakness, ptyalism, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, increased serum creatine kinase activity, hypocholesterolaemia and hepatic failure at presentation were significantly (P≤0.033) associated with mortality. The primary disease was unassociated with mortality. Worsening hypoalbuminaemia, hyperammonaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, electrolyte disorders, and occurrence of cavitary effusions or hypotension during hospitalisation were significantly (P≤0.045) associated with mortality. A decrease of serum β‐hydroxybutyrate during hospitalisation was significantly (P=0.01) associated with survival, likely reflecting improvement in the catabolic state. The identified risk factors may be therapeutic targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanorexia 3ablood serum 3acatabolism 3acats 3acell biology 3acreatine kinase 3aelectrolytes 3afatty liver 3afemales 3agastrointestinal system 3ahistopathology 3ahypoalbuminemia 3ahypocholesterolemia 3ahypotension 3aliver 3aliver failure 3amortality 3apancreatitis 3aretrospective studies 3atherapeutics1 aSegev, Gilad1 aKedar, Shay1 aYas, Einat1 aAroch, Itamar0 tVeterinary record.g2017 Nov., v. 181, no. 19 p.512-512dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.1042523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010300169300001600272520205000288592002802338653001502366653001302381653002102394653001902415653002302434653001602457700002202473773011702495856008202612852000902694655001202703IND60130019420221120025327.0151126e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013001942DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-11-00025.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuffner, Marvin E.10aEvaluation of Herbicide and Disking to Control Invasive Bluestems in a South Texas Coastal Prairie  ap. 277-285.  aConservation and restoration efforts of native grasslands are being hindered by invasive, exotic plants. Exotic bluestem grasses (Bothriochloa and Dichanthium spp.) have become increasingly invasive throughout the rangelands of the central and southern Great Plains, United States. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of glyphosate, imazapyr, and imazapyr + glyphosate treatments with or without disking to remove exotic bluestems from a south Texas coastal prairie. We evaluated three different control regimens: 1) herbicide treatments only, 2) herbicide treatments followed by two diskings (H + D), and 3) disking followed by herbicide treatments (D + H). Percent exotic bluestem, native grass, and forb cover were visually estimated at 0 (pre-treatment: May 2006), 20, 52, and 104 wk after treatment (WAT). The herbicide-only and H + D regimens were ineffective at controlling exotic bluestems. However, exotic bluestem cover in herbicide-treated plots of the D + H regimen was significantly lower (P ≤ 0.05) compared to control plots and most treatment plots of the herbicide-only and H + D regimens up to 52 WAT. Control regimens did not notably facilitate an increase in native grass cover from pre-treatment levels, but native grass cover remained the highest, and increased the most, in some imazapyr-treated plots of the herbicide-only and D + H regimens, respectively. In the H + D and D + H regimens, disking resulted in a flush of forb cover (up to 50%) at 52 WAT; yet forb cover was ≤ 5% in these plots by 104 WAT. Exotic bluestem cover recovered back to, or was greater than, pre-treatment levels among most treatment plots across all three control regimens at 104 WAT. This study suggests that follow-up control measures are needed to suppress the re-invasion of exotic bluestems after initial control efforts. Additional studies are needed to evaluate other strategies to control exotic bluestems in rangelands of the central and southern United States.  aPublisher supplied data 0aglyphosate 0aimazapyr 0ainvasive grasses 0anative grasses 0aOld World bluestem 0arestoration1 aBarnes, Thomas G.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2012 May, v. 65, no. 3 p.277-285dSociety for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2FREM-D-11-00025.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245015400201300001600355500001900371500002000390520102300410592002801433650001501461650002001476650001301496651001101509700006001520773011801580856007401698852000901772655001201781IND60714391520221118052931.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071439152DNAL7 a10.1111/soru.122912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamonova, Natalia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6618-877X10aPopulism, Neoliberalism and Agrarian Movements in Europe. Understanding Rural Support for Right‐Wing Politics and Looking for Progressive Solutions  ap. 710-731.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRight‐wing populism has gained ground in Europe in recent years, with the greatest support among rural communities. Yet the European countryside remains largely overlooked in debates on the current political crisis and the ways out of it. This article aims to provide keys for understanding the connection between right‐wing populism and the rural world in Europe. Our analysis unfolds around three main ideas. First, we argue that the root cause of the spread of right‐wing populism is the fundamental, multidimensional crisis of globalised neoliberal capitalism, particularly pronounced in Europe’s countryside. Second, we examine what role historical legacies, trajectories of agrarian change, and other national, regional and local specificities play in shaping populist movements in different rural areas in Europe. Finally, we discuss the constraints and possibilities for the emergence of agrarian (populist) movements that may offer progressive alternatives to right‐wing populism in the countryside.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapitalism 3aeconomic policy 3apolitics 3aEurope1 aFranquesa, Jaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8416-27920 tSociologia ruralis.g2020 Oct., v. 60, no. 4 p.710-731dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl20174x0038-01997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soru.122913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003800151245008600189500002200275520154800297592002801845650005001873650005201923650001901975650001801994650002102012650002002033650001102053650001302064650001802077650003002095650002302125650001902148653004002167653001302207653001002220653000902230653000902239653000902248653001502257653001302272773008802285856005202373852000902425655001202434IND60795452720221122144445.0221004s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079545272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2022.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXylogiannopoulos, Konstantinos F.10aMultiple Genome Analytics Framework: The Case of All SARS-CoV-2 Complete Variants  aPre-press version  aPattern detection and string matching are fundamental problems in computer science and the accelerated expansion of bioinformatics and computational biology have made them a core topic for both disciplines. The requirement for computational tools for genomic analyses, such as sequence alignment, is very important, although, in most cases the resources and computational power required are enormous. The presented Multiple Genome Analytics Framework combines data structures and algorithms, specifically built for text mining and (repeated) pattern detection, that can help to efficiently address several computational biology and bioinformatics problems, concurrently, with minimal resources. A single execution of advanced algorithms, with space and time complexity O(nlogn), is enough to acquire knowledge on all repeated patterns that exist in multiple genome sequences and this information can be used as input by meta-algorithms for further meta-analyses. For the proof of concept and technology of the proposed Framework scalability, agility and efficiency, a publicly available dataset of more than 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information has been used for the detection of all repeated patterns. These results have been used by newly introduced algorithms to provide answers to questions such as common patterns among all variants, sequence alignment, palindromes and tandem repeats detection, different organism genome comparisons, polymerase chain reaction primers detection, etc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Center for Biotechnology Information 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3abioinformatics 3abiotechnology 3acomputer science 3adata collection 3agenome 3agenomics 3ameta-analysis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence alignment 3aspace and time 0aMultiple Genome Analytics Framework 0aLERP-RSA 0aARPaD 0aMuGA 0aSPaD 0aMPaD 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aCOVID-190 tJournal of biotechnology.g2022, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2022.09.015  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012800163300001600291520088900307592002801196650002201224650003701246650001401283650001801297650001901315650001801334650001101352650001301363650001601376650003701392653002201429653002501451653002301476653002201499700001901521700001901540700002201559700001701581700005401598773012601652856008301778852000901861655001201870IND60597099720221122060317.0200318e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059709972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSen, Betul10aHighly efficient polymer supported monodisperse ruthenium-nickel nanocomposites for dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine borane  ap. 480-486.  aIn the present study, highly effective and reusable monodisperse ruthenium–nickel (Ru-Ni) nanomaterials supported on poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (Ru-Ni@PVP) were synthesized (3.51 ± 0.38 nm) by a facile sodium-hydroxide-assisted reduction method; Ru and Ni reduction in PVP solution was accomplished. The prepared nanocomposites were characterized by TEM, HRTEM, XRD, and XPS and performed as a catalyst for dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine-borane (DMAB). It was found that Ru-Ni nanomaterials are one of the most active catalysts at low concentrations and temperature for dehydrocoupling of DMAB. This catalyst with its turnover frequency of 458.57 h⁻¹ exhibits one of the best results among all the catalysts prepared in the literature for dehydrocoupling of DMAB. Significantly low Ea value (36.52 ± 3 kJ mol⁻¹) was also found for dehydrocoupling of DMAB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3adimethylamine 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3anickel 3apolymers 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aDehydrogeneration 0aDimethylamine-borane 0aMetal-nanocatalyst 0aPolymer supported1 aKuyuldar, Esra1 aDemirkan, Buse1 aOnal Okyay, Tugba1 aŞavk, Aysun1 aSen, Fatih1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6843-90260 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 526 p.480-486dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04476naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245013000161500001900291520310200310592002803412650002003440650001703460650001503477650001903492650001303511650002003524651001403544651001003558651001103568653001803579653001603597653001803613653001303631653001603644653001603660653001503676653001303691653001603704653002303720653001003743700001903753700002503772773011203797856007603909852000903985655001203994IND60728565620221122052138.0210308e20160708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072856562DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.4.e81502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guanyang12aA taxonomic monograph of the assassin bug genus Zelus Fabricius (Hemiptera: Reduviidae): 71 species based on 10,000 specimens  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe New World assassin bug genus Zelus Fabricius, 1803 (Insecta: Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Reduviidae: Harpactorinae: Harpactorini) is revised based on more than 10,000 specimens. Seventy-one species are recognized and twenty-four described as new: Zelus aithaleos sp. n., Zelus amblycephalus sp. n., Zelus antiguensis sp. n., Zelus auralanus sp. n., Zelus bahiaensis sp. n., Zelus banksi sp. n., Zelus casii sp. n., Zelus championi sp. n., Zelus cordazulus sp. n., Zelus fuliginatus sp. n., Zelus gilboventris sp. n., Zelus gracilipes sp. n., Zelus grandoculus sp. n., Zelus kartaboides sp. n., Zelus lewisi sp. n., Zelus panamensis sp. n., Zelus paracephalus sp. n., Zelus rosulentus sp. n., Zelus russulumus sp. n., Zelus spatulosus sp. n., Zelus truxali sp. n., Zelus umbraculoides sp. n., Zelus umbraculus sp. n., and Zelus xouthos sp. n. Five species, Zelus araneiformis Haviland, 1931, Zelus gradarius Bergroth, 1905, Zelus modestus (Stål, 1862), Zelus subfasciatus Stål, 1860 and Zelus vittaticeps Stål, 1866, are removed from Zelus and placed incertae sedis within Harpactorini. Nine new synonyms are recognized (senior synonym in parentheses): Zelus atripes Champion, 1898 syn. nov. (=Zelus conjungens [Stål, 1860]), Zelus dispar Fabricius, 1803 syn. nov. (=Zelus pedestris Fabricius, 1803), Zelus formosus Haviland, 1931 syn. nov. (=Zelus laticornis Herrich-Schaeffer, 1853), Zelus obscuridorsis (Stål, 1860) syn. nov. (=Zelus pedestris), Zelus pallidinervus Haviland, 1931 syn. nov. (=Zelus kartabensis Haviland, 1931), Zelus personatus Berg, 1879 syn. nov. (=Zelus versicolor Herrich-Schaeffer, 1848), Zelus trimaculatus Champion, 1898 syn. nov. (=Zelus means Fabricius, 1803), Zelus trimaculicollis (Stål, 1855) syn. nov. (=Zelus means), and Zelus tristis Haviland, 1931 syn. nov. (=Zelus laticornis). Zelus conjungens (Stål, 1860) stat. rev. Is resurrected from junior synonymy with zealous armillatus (Lepeletier & Seville, 1825). Zelus ambulans Stål, 1862 stat. rev. and Zelus cognatus (Costa, 1862) stat. rev. are resurrected from synonymy with Zelus exsanguis Stål, 1862. Iquitozelus Bérenger syn. nov. is synonymized with Zelus and its only species transferred to Zelus , hence resulting in a new combination, Zelus couturieri (Bérenger, 2003) comb. nov. Lectotypes, paralectotypes or neotypes are designated for a number of species. Habitus images, illustrations of male genitalia, distribution maps and measurements are provided for nearly all species. The three previously recognized subgenera of Zelus are found to be based upon superficial characters and these divisions do not reflect natural groupings. Using sets of characters, especially those of the male genitalia, eleven species groups are proposed. It is also hypothesized that Zelus is closely related to three other New World genera: Atopozelus Elkins, Ischnoclopius Stål and an undescribed genus "Hartzelus" [manuscript name]. Zelus is endemic to the New World, occurring naturally in the Caribbean and all but one of the continental countries, with introductions to Pacific islands, Europe and Chile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZelus exsanguis 3abiodiversity 3alectotypes 3amale genitalia 3aneotypes 3anew combination 3aCaribbean 3aChile 3aEurope 0aHarpactorinae 0aHeteroptera 0anatural enemy 0aNearctic 0aNeotropical 0anew species 0aReduviidae 0asynonymy 0asystematics 0ataxonomic revision 0aZelus1 aHart, Elwood R1 aWeirauch, Christiane0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2016 July 08, v. 4 p.e8150-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.4.e81503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012400172300001800296520117000314592002801484650006701512650001501579650001201594650001501606650001301621650001301634650001101647650001301658650001301671650001401684650001401698650001901712650001401731650003301745650001101778650001901789650001501808650001401823651000901837653001001846653001601856653004201872653002501914653000901939700001801948700002601966700001901992700003002011700001802041773011802059856008602177852000902263655001202272IND60779437820221122234017.0220614e20220319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943782DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2020.17906762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekandari, Milad10aASTER and WorldView-3 satellite data for mapping lithology and alteration minerals associated with Pb-Zn mineralization  ap. 1782-1812.  aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite remote sensing data were used for mapping lithological units and hydrothermal alteration zones associated with Pb-Zn mineralization in the Kerman–Kashmar Tectonic Zone (KKTZ), Iran. The visible near infrared (VNIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) bands of ASTER were used to map iron oxide/hydroxides, Al-OH minerals, Fe,Mg-OH minerals, quartz and carbonate minerals. The VNIR bands of WV-3 were used to discriminate Fe³⁺ and Fe²⁺ absorption intensities. Selective Principal Component analysis (SPCA), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) and Automatic Lineament Extraction techniques were implemented. Lithological units were discriminated based on Al/Fe-OH, Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ and Mg-Fe-OH/CO3 absorption properties. The spatial distribution of hematite, goethite, jarosite, gypsum, calcite, dolomite, kaolinite and muscovite were comprehensively detected. Some prospective zones were identified in the intersection of N-S, NW-SE and NE-SW trending fault systems, gossan, argillic/phyllic and dolomitic units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aabsorption 3acalcite 3acarbonates 3adolomite 3agoethite 3agypsum 3ahematite 3ajarosite 3akaolinite 3alithology 3amineralization 3amuscovite 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquartz 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atectonics 3aIran 0aASTER 0aWorldView-3 0aKashmar–Kerman Tectonic Zone (KKTZ) 0aPb-Zn mineralization 0aIran1 aMasoumi, Iman1 aPour, Amin Beiranvand1 aMuslim, Aidy M1 aHossain, Mohammad Shawkat1 aMisra, Ankita0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Mar. 19, v. 37, no. 6 p.1782-1812dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2020.17906763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245011800203300001800321500002000339520216800359592002802527596004602555650002702601650002202628650002602650650002002676650001902696650001502715650002102730650001202751650001602763700001702779700002102796700002102817773012002838856007302958852000903031655001203040IND60714391620221118053007.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071439162DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.135902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeidbüchel, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9083-174210aGo with the flow: Fragment retention patterns shape the vegetative dispersal of aquatic plants in lowland streams  ap. 1936-1949.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe dispersal of aquatic plant propagules is highly facilitated in streams due to flow. As many aquatic plants predominantly spread through vegetative propagules, the specific retention and thus drift distance of dispersed plant fragments largely contribute to the rapid spread along the course of a stream. We determined fragment retention for four aquatic plant species (Elodea canadensis, Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Salvinia natans; representing four different common morpho‐structural groups) in sections of small to medium‐sized German streams with different levels of stream sinuosity. The number of fragments showed a logistic decline over drift distance. In two small streams, 90% of drifting fragments were retained at distances (D₉₀) of only 5–9 m and 19–70 m, while higher D₉₀ values of 116–903 m and 153–2,367 m were determined for sections of a medium‐sized stream. The likelihood of retention thereby decreased significantly with increasing stream size and was reduced in straightened stream sections. Differences in retention were more strongly related to fragment buoyancy rather than fragment size and morphology. Increasing buoyancy significantly lowered the likelihood of fragment retention over drift distance by a factor of 3–8, whereas contrasting effects were documented for size and morphology of fragments. The relevance of different obstacles was highly stream section‐specific and depended on obstacle abundance, distribution, and the degree of submergence/emergence. Our findings elucidate the dynamic retention patterns of plant fragments and highlight the strong interplay between extrinsic (stream) and intrinsic (fragment) properties. We conclude that straightened lowland streams of intermediate size promote the rapid dispersal of invasive aquatic plants and are particularly prone to invaders producing large amounts of small and highly buoyant plant fragments. Information on the species‐specific fragment colonisation dynamics in the field is further required to improve our understanding of the vegetative dispersal capacity of invasive aquatic plants in stream ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  a20016/450cDeutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt 3aCeratophyllum demersum 3aElodea canadensis 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3aSalvinia natans 3aaquatic plants 3aecosystems 3ainvasive species 3astreams 3asubmergence1 aSachs, Maria1 aHamzehian, Nadia1 aHussner, Andreas0 tFreshwater biology.g2020 Nov., v. 65, no. 11 p.1936-1949dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.135903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04231naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015100165300001600316520230100332592002802633596004602661596006302707596006302770650001702833650002002850650001602870650002102886650002402907650003502931650001002966650001902976650002502995650001503020650001403035650001503049650002603064650001503090650003303105650000903138650001303147650001503160650001703175650004003192700001303232700001703245700001503262700001403277700001703291700002003308700001903328700001503347700001403362700002103376700001303397773010403410856008203514852000903596655001203605IND60486046420221121093350.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604642DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-015-2129-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Mengting10aPET monitoring angiogenesis of infarcted myocardium after treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells  ap. 811-820.  aAngiogenesis is a key factor for post-ischemic repair of the infarcted myocardium. This study aims to monitor angiogenesis of infarcted myocardium with a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent, ¹⁸F-alfatide II (¹⁸F-AlF-NOTA-E[PEG₄-c(RGDfk)]₂), targeting αᵥβ₃ integrin after treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and/or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats underwent left coronary artery ligation and were randomly divided into four groups: normal saline control, Ad-VEGF, BMSCs, and Ad-VEGF + BMSCs (n = 4/group). The induced myocardial infarction (MI) was confirmed by electrocardiogram (ECG) with ST-segment elevation, and ⁹⁹ᵐTc-MIBI SPECT imaging showing defected myocardial perfusion. Alfatide II PET was performed to monitor angiogenesis at different time points after the therapy. The ratios of Alfatide II tracer uptake in the infarcted myocardium to normal myocardium in all four groups were analyzed. The PET results were validated by ex vivo tissue biodistribution, autoradiography, and immunofluorescence staining. At 1 week after therapy, elevated RGD peptide tracer uptake at the infarcted myocardium was observed in all four groups. The infarct to normal heart ratio of Alfatide II tracer for the three treatment groups was significantly higher than that of the control group (3.94 ± 0.20 for VEGF group, 3.77 ± 0.16 for BMSCs group and 4.86 ± 0.08 for the combination group vs. 3.01 ± 0.03 for the control group, P < 0.005, P < 0.005, P < 0.0001, respectively). The combination treatment group demonstrated higher contrast than the two single treatment groups. Similar results were also observed at 4 weeks after treatment. Autoradiography showed similar trend to that of PET results. Immunohistochemical staining showed expression of VEGF protein and the presence of adenovirus in the myocardium. The patterns of vascular density and integrin αᵥβ₃ expression were measured by CD31 and CD61 immunostaining analysis, and were consistent with the PET results. ¹⁸F-alfatide II PET could reflect angiogenesis of infarcted myocardium after VEGF gene and BMSCs therapy and further provide a non-invasive way of monitoring therapy response of myocardial infarction.  aPublisher supplied data  a[2014] 1685cthe state education ministry  a81101068cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a81471707cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aangiogenesis 3aautoradiography 3abone marrow 3acoronary vessels 3aelectrocardiography 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainfarction 3aintegrins 3amonitoring 3amyocardial infarction 3amyocardium 3apositron-emission tomography 3arats 3astaining 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aRen, Lei1 aYin, Xiaoqin1 aGuo, Zhide1 aLi, Yesen1 aHe, Tingting1 aTang, Yongxiang1 aLong, Tingting1 aLiu, Yutao1 aLiu, Gang1 aZhang, Xianzhong1 aHu, Shuo0 tAmino acids.g2016 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.811-820dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-015-2129-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245014400174300001600318520181500334592002802149650000802177650001702185650001402202650001002216650002202226650001302248650001302261650001302274650002602287650002202313653001602335653001602351653002202367653000802389653001702397700002102414700001702435700006602452773011102518856008802629852000902717655001202726IND60584403320221122055820.0180914e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058440332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.09.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReid, Kate Megan12aA review of the optimisation of the use of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue for molecular analysis in a forensic post-mortem setting  ap. 181-187.  aMolecular analyses in a post-mortem setting are becoming increasingly common, particularly in cases of sudden unexplained death, with the aim of identifying genetic mutations which may be responsible for causing death. In retrospective investigations, the access to suitable autopsy biological samples may be limited, and often formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue is the only sample available. The preservation of tissue in formalin is known to damage DNA through crosslinking activity. This results in the extraction of severely fragmented DNA of variable yields, which subsequently reduces the ability to perform downstream molecular analyses. Numerous studies have investigated possible improvements to various aspects of the DNA extraction and amplification procedures from FFPE tissue and this review aims to collate these optimization steps in a cohesive manner. A systematic review was performed of three major databases, which identified 111 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Five main areas for optimization and improvements were identified in the workflow: (1) tissue type, (2) fixation process, (3) post-fixation, (4) DNA extraction procedure and (5) amplification. It was found that some factors identified, for example tissue type and fixation process, could not be controlled by the researcher when conducting retrospective analyses. For this reason, optimization should be performed in other areas, within the financial means of the laboratories, and in accordance with the purposes of the investigation. Implementation of one or more of the optimization measures described here is anticipated to assist in the extraction of higher quality DNA. Despite the challenges posed by FFPE tissue, it remains a valuable source of DNA in retrospective molecular forensic investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acrosslinking 3adatabases 3adeath 3aforensic sciences 3aformalin 3amutation 3anecropsy 3aretrospective studies 3asystematic review 0aFFPE tissue 0aPost-mortem 0aMolecular autopsy 0aDNA 0aOptimization1 aMaistry, Sairita1 aRamesar, Raj1 aHeathfield, Laura Jane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4860-94190 tForensic science international.g2017 Nov., v. 280 p.181-187dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245016900158520157300327592002801900650000901928650001701937650000901954650001301963650001101976650002101987650001702008650001702025651001002042700001402052700001602066700001802082773011802100856007602218852000902294655001202303IND60748598420221120112721.0210827e20210817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074859842DNAL7 a10.3390/land100808642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xinyue 10aMapping the Challenges to the Sustainable Operation of Suburban Villages in a Metropolis: A Comparative Case Study from the Lens of Three Stakeholder-Led Approaches  aIn the rapid urbanization and land development process, the integration of urban and rural areas has accelerated. Alongside this trend, the sustainable operation of suburban villages in metropolitan areas face many difficulties and challenges, especially in terms of the efficient use of land and the coordination of stakeholders’ interests. However, there remains a lack of systematic case studies in the literature targeted toward suburban villages in metropolises. This study selects three typical suburban villages in the metropolis of Jiangning District, Nanjing (i.e., a metropolis in China) to narrow this research gap. We collected primary data based on field investigations, structural interviews, and professional documents. With three typical villages employed as comparative case studies, we developed a theoretical framework to systematically analyze the operation process and the challenges faced by suburban villages in the metropolis. The results revealed the different application scenarios of three stakeholder-led models, including the state-owned enterprise-led model, the grassroots government-led model, and the private capital-led model, in the sustainable operation of metropolis-based suburban villages. The findings shed new light on selecting an appropriate path to boost the sustainable endogenous development of rural areas. This study extends existing research on the sustainable operation of suburban villages in the metropolis, providing practical guidance on aligning stakeholder-led models to better integrate urban and rural areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLens 3acase studies 3aland 3aland use 3amodels 3apublic ownership 3astakeholders 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aWang, Ge 1 aZhu, Chang 1 aChi, Xinyang 0 tLand.g2021 Aug. 17, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100808643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012100175300001800296520108500314536029801399592002801697650002201725650002001747650001701767650001201784650003301796651001101829653000901840653001501849653001601864653002201880653002201902653001101924700001901935700002301954700001901977773011801996856008602114852000902200655001202209IND60779438020221122234042.0220614e20220319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943802DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2020.17919782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunthali, Maggie G.14aThe impacts of land use and land cover dynamics on natural resources and rural livelihoods in Dedza District, Malawi  ap. 1529-1546.  aThe sustainable management of natural resources requires critical understanding of land use and land cover changes and how these changes impact natural resources and rural livelihoods. This study examined the impacts of LULC changes on natural resources and rural livelihoods of Central Malawi. The study used an integrated approach combining remote sensing, household surveys consisting of structured and semi-structured questionnaires, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Local communities perceived that LULC changes have resulted in the decline of agricultural land (57.3%), crop production (82.8%) and forest cover (87.4%) In response to observed LULC changes, respondents deployed short-term coping strategies such as seeking piecework opportunities and the use of savings and credits. The study has provided evidence that LULC changes have led to significant losses in natural resources, with serious consequences for rural livelihoods in Dedza. The study has contributed to better understanding of the complicated human-environment interaction in Malawi.  aWe would also like to thank the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD), the University of Pretoria, the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa, and the Schlumberger Foundation through its Faculty for the Future Program for financial support to the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acrop production 3afocus groups 3aforests 3aland use and land cover maps 3aMalawi 0aWord 0aLULC cover 0alivelihoods 0alocal perceptions 0acoping strategies 0ashocks1 aDavis, Nerhene1 aAdeola, Abiodun M.1 aBotai, Joel O.0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Mar. 19, v. 37, no. 6 p.1529-1546dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2020.17919783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159100001300168245008700181300001600268500002400284500001500308520180800323650003702131650001902168650001902187650001402206650001002220650001202230650001602242650002002258650001702278650001202295650001502307650002002322650001002342650003302352650001102385650003502396650001102431650002502442650000902467650003702476650001402513651001002527651002502537653003202562653002102594700001202615700001602627700001302643700001302656700001702669700001502686700001602701700001502717700001402732773011502746852000902861856008002870930003302950945002502983946001103008655001203019IND4425493720221120144025.0090904e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442549372DNAL7 a195648802pmid7 a10.1038/ijo.2009.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aWang, Y.10aFetal macrosomia and adolescence obesity: results from a longitudinal cohort study  ap. 923-928.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: To assess the association between fetal macrosomia and adolescent obesity. Design: Longitudinal cohort study of the association between macrosomia and adolescent obesity. Subjects: Between 1 October 2005 and 1 February 2007, a follow-up study of live-born infants born in 1993-1995 in Wuxi, a suburban area of Shanghai, was conducted. Subjects with birth weight > 4000 g were selected as the exposed. For each exposed subject, one subject with a birth weight of 2500-4000 g, matched by year of birth, sex of infant, and type of institute at birth, was chosen as non-exposed. Clinical data were collected by structured interview and physical examination. Obesity was defined as body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m2)) higher than the sex-age-specific criteria by the working group on obesity in China. Distribution of baseline characteristics and adolescent obesity rate between the exposed and non-exposed groups was compared. Results: A total of 1435 pairs of exposed and non-exposed subjects were included in the final analysis. No major difference in baseline characteristics (other than birth weight) was found between the exposed and non-exposed groups. Obesity rate was significantly higher in the exposed group (2.9%) than in the non-exposed group (1.6%). Adolescent obesity rates were 1.4, 1.9, 2.6, and 5.6%, respectively, in study subjects with a birth weight of 2500-3499, 3500-3999, 4000-4499, and 4500 g. The association between birth weight and adolescent obesity remained essentially the same when mother's demographic and anthropometric factors, breast feeding, and adolescent life-style factors were adjusted. Conclusion: Compared with infants of normal birth weight, infants with birth weight >4000 g, especially those >4500 g, are at increased risk of adolescent obesity. 3asociodemographic characteristics 3abreast feeding 3aChinese people 3alifestyle 3afetus 3aobesity 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3abirth weight 3ainfants 2aAdolescent 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology 2aFemale 2aFetal Macrosomiaxepidemiology 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aObesityxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aPregnancy 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology. 0aanthropometric measurements 0afetal macrosomia1 aGao, E.1 aWu-O, Jess.1 aZhou, J.1 aYang, Q.1 aWalker, M.C.1 aMbikay, M.1 aSigal, R.J.1 aNair, R.C.1 aWen, S.W.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2009 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.923-928dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2009.1313Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/10/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02001naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012400161300001600285500002400301520093500325650001101260650001901271650001201290650001201302650002101314650001401335650002701349650002701376700001701403700001701420700001501437700001401452773011601466852000901582856004801591655001201639IND4434334220221120143940.0100319e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443433422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-009-9493-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, J.

Polymorphisms were evaluated in a collection of 26 banana cultivars and 11 related species/subspecies. The mean number of alleles amplified per primer was 4.55 (range, 2-9), with a total of 100 alleles identified. The mean PIC value was 0.48 (range, 0.10-0.74). In addition, 22 markers also showed robust cross-species/genera amplification across 11 related species/subspecies, with the exception of ‘Xiangtuijiao' (Ensete glaucum). Unweighted pair-grouping method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) cluster analysis divided all the banana accessions into three main groups. The results demonstrate the usefulness of microsatellites for identification, similarity studies, and germplasm conservation in banana and related species. 3aEnsete 3aMusa acuminata 3aalleles 3abananas 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3agermplasm conservation 3amicrosatellite repeats1 aZheng, L.

Among these factors, the concentration of copper is crucial due to the essential toxic effect of this metal, which forces the cells to maintain a tight homeostasis. The M. xanthus copper response is more complex than that in other bacteria, which is reflected by the different copper sensitivities of growing and developing cells. In the present study, the participation in copper homeostasis of six heavy metal efflux systems encoded in the M. xanthus genome has been examined. Three of these pumps exhibit the signature sequences in transmembrane domain 4 of the Cus systems (Cus1, Cus2, and Cus3), while the other three exhibit the motifs of the Czc systems (Czc1, Czc2, and Czc3). The Cus2 and Cus3 systems are inducible by copper and monovalent metals, functioning as the main copper efflux pumps, while the Cus1 system is implicated in Zn²⁺ homeostasis. The Czc systems are also differentially regulated either by divalent metals but not by copper (Czc1), by copper and divalent metals (Czc2), or by starvation (Czc3). The differential regulation of these six efflux systems ensures the proper completion of the M. xanthus life cycle in an environment with fluctuating concentrations of copper and other metals.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMyxococcus xanthus 3abacteria 3acopper 3agenome 3agrowth and development 3aheavy metals 3ahomeostasis 3astarvation 3atoxicity 3atransporters1 aPérez, Juana1 aExtremera, Antonio Luis1 aMuñoz-Dorado, José0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Sept. 15, v. 76, no. 18 p.6069-6076dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00753-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02150naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001600159245008200175300001600257500002400273520096400297650001601261650001801277650001801295650001701313650001401330650001001344650001001354650001001364650001101374650002501385650001801410650001201428700001601440773018001456852000901636856008001645856002701725655001201752IND4373506120221120124547.0050823e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437350612DNAL7 a216533822pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.91.2.2622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, C.C.10aElatinaceae are sister to Malpighiaceae; peridiscaceae belong to Saxifragales  ap. 262-273.  aIncludes references  aPhylogenetic data from plastid (ndhF and rbcL) and nuclear (PHYC) genes indicate that, within the order Malpighiales, Elatinaceae are strongly supported as sister to Malpighiaceae. There are several putative morphological synapomorphies for this clade; most notably, they both have a base chromosome number of X = 6 (or some multiple of three or six), opposite or whorled leaves with stipules, unicellular hairs (also uniseriate in some Elatinaceae), multicellular glands on the leaves, and resin (Elatinacae) or latex (Malpighiaceae). Further study is needed to determine if these features are synapomorphic within the order. Malpighiaceae have previously been inferred as sister to Peridiscaceae based on rbcL sequence data, but the rbcL sequence of Whittonia is a chimera of two sequences, neither of which appears to be Whittonia. Our data from plastid (atpB, rbcL) and nuclear (18S rDNA) genes instead place Peridiscaeace as a member of the Saxifragales. 3aElatinaceae 3aMalpighiaceae 3aPeridiscaceae 3aX chromosome 3achimerism 3agenes 3ahairs 3alatex 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal DNA 3asisters1 aChase, M.W.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2004 Feb., v. 91, no. 2 p.262-273dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.91.2.2623Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/ 7aarticle02985naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001900165245008600184300001800270500002400288520131500312650001301627650000901640650001601649650002201665650002701687650002501714650002601739650003001765650002201795650002301817650002601840650002501866650002301891650004301914650003901957650002301996653002702019653002602046653002802072700001802100700001702118773016302135852000902298856007702307930003302384945002502417946001302442655001202455IND4425477420221120113628.0090904e20090826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442547742DNAL7 a196506332pmid7 a10.1021/jf901078d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aLee, Seong-Hun10aSimplex and Duplex Event-Specific Analytical Methods for Functional Biotech Maize  ap. 7178-7185.  aIncludes references  aAnalytical methods are very important in the control of genetically modified organism (GMO) labeling systems or living modified organism (LMO) management for biotech crops. Event-specific primers and probes were developed for qualitative and quantitative analysis for biotech maize event 3272 and LY 038 on the basis of the 3' flanking regions, respectively. The qualitative primers confirmed the specificity by a single PCR product and sensitivity to 0.05% as a limit of detection (LOD). Simplex and duplex quantitative methods were also developed using TaqMan real-time PCR. One synthetic plasmid was constructed from two taxon-specific DNA sequences of maize and two event-specific 3' flanking DNA sequences of event 3272 and LY 038 as reference molecules. In-house validation of the quantitative methods was performed using six levels of mixing samples, from 0.1 to 10.0%. As a result, the biases from the true value and the relative deviations were all within the range of ±30%. Limits of quantitation (LOQs) of the quantitative methods were all 0.1% for simplex real-time PCRs of event 3272 and LY 038 and 0.5% for duplex real-time PCR of LY 038. This study reports that event-specific analytical methods were applicable for qualitative and quantitative analysis for biotech maize event 3272 and LY 038. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agrain crops 3atransgenic plants 3agenetic transformation 3anucleotide sequences 3aquantitative genetics 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aanalytical methods 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aLimit of Detection 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aZea maysxgenetics 0alimits of quantitation 0atransformation events 0amolecular sequence data1 aKim, Su-Jeong1 aYi, Bu-Young0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Aug. 26, v. 57, no. 16 p.7178-7185dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf901078d3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/09  aOther US 7aarticle03078naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100002200164245021800186300001800404500002400422500001500446520118300461650002501644650003101669650001101700650001401711650001601725650001701741650001901758650004301777650000901820650003201829650001801861650001401879650002101893650000901914650001501923653001901938653001401957653001901971653001601990653003902006700002402045700002302069700002202092700001902114700002302133773016302156852000902319856007702328930003302405945002502438946001302463655001202476IND4425479020221120113616.0090904e20090826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442547902DNAL7 a10.1021/jf901244k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aS200 0aT3001 aLupinacci, Elvira10aXanthohumol from Hop (Humulus lupulus L.)

The hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.) has been described to possess both anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic effects. In the present study, the chemical composition of a hop crude extract (HCE) was investigated by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). Next, HCE and various fractions obtained by preparative HPLC were tested for their ability to inhibit production of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which play crucial roles in the complications of obesity. The hop chalcone xanthohumol was found to be the most potent inhibitor of both cytokines in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages and U937 human monocytes. Moreover, other constituents, namely, iso-α-acids, in combination with the β-acid hulupone, showed a moderate but selective inhibitory activity only on MCP-1 release. These findings underscore the potential health effects of hop and support further optimization, selection, and use of this plant. 3achemical composition 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ahumans 3amonocytes 3amacrophages 3ainflammation 3aplant extracts 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amice 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aanimal models 3achalcones 3ain vitro studies 3ahops 3acell lines 0aphytochemicals 0acytokines 0acultured cells 0axanthohumol 0amonocyte chemoattractant protein-11 aMeijerink, Jocelijn1 aVincken, Jean-Paul1 aGabriele, Bartolo1 aGruppen, Harry1 aWitkamp, Renger F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Aug. 26, v. 57, no. 16 p.7274-7281dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf901244k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/09  aOther US 7aarticle04472naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100001300174245010600187300001800293500002400311500001500335520187200350650001602222650002602238650002102264650001002285650001502295650002202310650002002332650003202352650001402384650001102398650002102409650002102430650001002451650001702461650001602478650002502494650002302519650002902542650001702571650004402588650001102632650002802643650003602671650007802707650009002785650002702875650002102902650003702923650006702960650001103027650006203038650003103100650007103131650002103202650006603223653002203289653002503311700002203336700002403358773016303382852000903545856007703554930003303631945002503664946001303689655001203702IND4425479120221120113607.0090904e20090826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442547912DNAL7 a196270892pmid7 a10.1021/jf901716j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aF6001 aLi, Liya10aIdentification and Bioactivities of Resveratrol Oligomers and Flavonoids from Carex folliculata Seeds  ap. 7282-7287.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPlants of the Carex genus (Family: Cyperaceae) have attracted recent attention as potential food additives because they contain high levels of bioactive polyphenols commonly found in plant foods. Seven compounds, which included two resveratrol oligomers and five flavonoids, were isolated from seeds of Carex folliculata L. (northern long sedge), a forage prevalent in the northern United States. The compounds were identified by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry data. The resveratrol oligomers were pallidol (1), a resveratrol dimer reported to be present in levels equivalent to those of resveratrol in red wine, and kobophenol A (2), a resveratrol tetramer with a unique 2,3,4,5-tetraaryltetrahydrofuran skeleton. The flavonoids were isoorientin (3), luteolin (4), quercetin (5), 3-O-methylquercetin (6), and rutin (7). Compounds were evaluated for antioxidant activity in the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay; cytotoxicity activity against human colon (HCT116, HT29) and breast (MCF7, MDA-MB-231) tumor cell lines; and antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The antioxidant activities of the flavonoids (3-7; IC50 values ranging from 50 to 200 μM) were comparable to that of ascorbic acid (IC50 = 60 μM) and superior to those of the resveratrol derivatives (1 and 2; IC50 > 1000 μM) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT; IC50 = 1500 μM), a commercial antioxidant. In the cytotoxicity and antibacterial bioassays, compounds 4 (IC50 for HCT116 = 45 μM) and 6 (IC50 for MRSA = 6.4 μM) were the most active, respectively. Therefore, given the wide availability and underutilization of C. folliculata, this forage may provide a source of bioactive compounds useful for nutraceutical purposes. Also, this is the first reported phytochemical investigation of C. folliculata. 3apolyphenols 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3amedicinal plants 3aCarex 3aflavonoids 3amass spectrometry 3adrug resistance 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aneoplasms 3aforage 3afunctional foods 3ahuman cell lines 3aseeds 3acytotoxicity 3aresveratrol 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical structure 3aantibacterial properties 3aforage crops 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3adosage 3afree radical scavengers 3achemical constituents of plants 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCarex Plantxchemistry 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aMethicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureusxdrug effects 2aNeoplasmsxphysiopathology 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aStilbenesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 0aCarex folliculata 0abioactive properties1 aHenry, Geneive E.1 aSeeram, Navindra P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Aug. 26, v. 57, no. 16 p.7282-7287dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf901716j3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/09  aOther US 7aarticle02169naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001700174245006700191300001600258500002400274500001500298520074600313650002801059650002201087650002401109650002501133650002801158650001401186650004401200650001201244650001601256650004501272650004401317653002301361653001601384653002801400700002001428773008701448852000901535856008601544930003301630945002501663946001101688655001201699IND4425445520221120113730.0090901e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442544552DNAL7 a173832052pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aAldous, E.W.10aNewcastle disease in pheasants (Phasianus colchicus): A review  ap. 181-185.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNewcastle disease (ND) is regarded throughout the world as one of the most important diseases of poultry, not only due to the serious disease and high flock mortality that may result from some ND virus (NDV) infections, but also through the economic impact that may ensue due to trading restrictions and embargoes placed on areas and countries where outbreaks have occurred. All ages of pheasants are purported to be highly susceptible to infection with NDV, but clinical signs and mortality levels in infected birds vary considerably. This article reviews the available literature relating to infections in pheasants, describing the clinical presentation of the disease and the epidemiological role these hosts may have in the spread of ND. 3aepidemiological studies 3aNewcastle disease 3aPhasianus colchicus 3adisease transmission 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3apheasants 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 2aAnimals 2aGalliformes 2aNewcastle Diseasexdiagnosisxmortality. 2aNewcastle disease virusxclassification 0aliterature reviews 0aPhasianidae 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aAlexander, D.J.0 tVeterinary journal.g2008 Feb., v. 175, no. 2 p.181-185dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.12.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/10/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02940naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100002000174245013800194300001600332500002400348520109200372650001101464650001901475650003001494650001201524650001601536650001701552650002301569650001401592650003201606650001701638650001201655650007101667650001101738650005201749650002801801650001101829650004501840650000901885650002601894650005501920653001401975653002201989653001602011653002002027700002302047700002902070773008702099852000902186856008602195930003302281945002502314946001102339655001202350IND4425445720221120104147.0090901e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442544572DNAL7 a174665442pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aGorvy, Dylan A.10aIntra-abdominal adhesions in horses: A retrospective evaluation of repeat laparotomy in 99 horses with acute gastrointestinal disease  ap. 194-201.  aIncludes references  aThe objectives of this study were (1) to determine the prevalence of pathological abdominal adhesion formation following exploratory laparotomy; (2) to establish the site of adhesion formation and its relationship to the initial lesion; (3) to ascertain whether the development of intra-abdominal adhesions decreases long-term survival and (4) to identify risk factors for adhesion formation. Of 1014 horses treated surgically for acute gastrointestinal disease, 113 (10.1%) were subjected to repeat laparotomy, with surgical records available for 99 of these cases. Pathological adhesions were the most common diagnosis at repeat laparotomy (28%), followed by complications associated with the anastomosis (16%). Adhesions were not associated with the site of the primary lesion, resection, or endotoxaemia, consistent with the hypothesis that surgical trauma is the most important stimulus in adhesion formation. Together these findings strongly support the need for pan-abdominal, rather than site-specific adhesion prevention measures in all horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy. 3ahorses 3ahorse diseases 3adigestive system diseases 3aabdomen 3alaparoscopy 3arisk factors 3adisease prevalence 3amortality 3apostoperative complications 3aacute course 2aAnimals 2aDigestive System Surgical Proceduresxadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Diseasesxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aHorse Diseasesxsurgery 2aHorses 2aLaparotomyxadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aRetrospective Studies 2aTissue Adhesionsxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 0aadhesions 0arepeat procedures 0aanastomosis 0asurgical trauma1 aEdwards, G.

A total of 16 horses, aged 8-20 years, with heaves were included in the study. Complete examinations were performed on Day 0 (before treatment), Day 13 (after treatment) and Day 30. Clinical variables, arterial blood gases, mucus scoring and carina evaluation (during endoscopy), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytological analysis were all assessed. The horses were randomly assigned to receive either oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg) or IM dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg). The animals were clinically scored and mucus accumulation evaluated. Results were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA with time (days of treatment) and treatment as the main effects. When combined with environmental control, prednisolone and dexamethasone treatments had similar effects on heaves score, blood gases and endoscopic scores. However, dexamethasone had a more beneficial effect on BAL cytology. 3ahorses 3ahorse diseases 3aimmunologic diseases 3aprednisolone 3aoral administration 3adexamethasone 3aintramuscular injection 3adrug evaluation 3aclinical examination 3ablood gases 3amucus 3aendoscopy 3acell biology 3aanalysis of variance 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aBlood Gas Analysisxveterinary 2aBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluidxcytology 2aDexamethasonexadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aHorses 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aLung Diseases, Obstructivexdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPrednisolonexadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 0aheaves 0aenvironmental control 0acarina evaluation 0abronchoaveolar lavage1 aFortier, Guillaume1 aPronost, Stéphane1 aSiliart, Brigitte1 aBrachet, Guillaume0 tVeterinary journal.g2008 Feb., v. 175, no. 2 p.227-233dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.12.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/10/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02366naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100002000183245008600203300001600289500002400305520054100329650001000870650001900880650001000899650001800909650001100927650002000938650002200958650001200980650001500992650002301007650002101030650001001051650003801061650001201099650003301111650002401144650001801168650003401186650005001220650001701270650002801287650003001315650001701345651001201362651002701374700001501401700001901416700002001435700002201455773008701477852000901564856008601573930003301659945002501692946001101717655001201728IND4425447020221120104154.0090901e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442544702DNAL7 a173795512pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8321 aÇekani, Mirela10aReport of a serological study of Coxiella burnetii in domestic animals in Albania  ap. 276-278.  aIncludes references  aThe prevalence of Coxiella burnetii antibodies in domestic ruminants in Albania has been investigated.

The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was 50 ng/g for muscle and 100 ng/g for liver and kidney. Mean recoveries at all fortification levels ranged from 82.34 to 93.20% with coefficient of variation (CV) below 5.39%. Residue depletion study of GEN in swine was performed after intramuscular injections twice daily at a dose of 4 mg/kg of bw with 12 h intervals for 5 consecutive days. The concentrations of GEN were determined in injection site, muscle, liver, and kidney by the HPLC-FLD method. The highest GEN concentration was measured in kidney, indicating that kidney was the primary target tissue for GEN residue. GEN concentrations in all examined tissues were below the maximum residue limit (MRL) recommended by the European Union (EU) at 50 days post-treatment. 3aswine 3afood animals 3agentamicin 3aantibiotic residues 3aintramuscular injection 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3adetection 3aquantitative analysis 3askeletal muscle 3aliver 3akidneys 3adosage 3amaximum residue limits 3atemporal variation 3aEuropean Union 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aGentamicinsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aInjections, Intramuscular 2aKidneyxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aLiverxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aSwine 0alimit of quantification1 aChen, Yiqiang1 aTang, Shusheng1 aHe, Jiakang1 aShang, Yanhong1 aXiao, Xilong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Aug. 26, v. 57, no. 16 p.7356-7362dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf901143c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/09  aOther US 7aarticle03089naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100003000155245016000185300001800345500002400363520113400387650001301521650001001534650001001544650001701554650002501571650003201596650001801628650002201646650003101668650002001699650001901719650002101738650002501759650002601784650002401810653002801834653003801862653003801900653003501938653002801973700001902001700001902020700002102039700002002060700001802080700001802098700002002116700001902136773016302155852000902318856007702327930003302404945002502437946001302462655001202475IND4425479720221120093938.0090904e20090826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442547972DNAL7 a10.1021/jf900856z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT2001 aNizamutdinova, Irina Tsoy10aAnthocyanins from Black Soybean Seed Coats Preferentially Inhibit TNF-α-Mediated Induction of VCAM-1 over ICAM-1 through the Regulation of GATAs and IRF-1  ap. 7324-7330.  aIncludes references  aAdhesion molecules have a key role in pathological inflammation. Thus, we investigated the effect of anthocyanins on the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) by TNF-α and the possible molecular mechanisms by which anthocyanins differentially regulate ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. Stimulation of cells with TNF-α increased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, and pretreatment with anthocyanins inhibited VCAM-1 expression, but not ICAM-1 expression. We found that IRF-1 and GATAs, especially GATA-4 and -6, were involved in the TNF-α-mediated expression of VCAM-1 but not ICAM-1, and anthocyanins decreased nuclear levels of GATA-4 and GATA-6 as well as IRF-1. Moreover, pretreatment with a Jak/STAT inhibitor decreased TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression and nuclear GATA-4, GATA-6, and IRF-1 levels. Furthermore, anthocyanins efficiently inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT-3. This suggests that anthocyanins differentially regulate TNF-α-mediated expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 through modulation of the GATA and IRF-1 binding activity via Jak/STAT-3 activation. 3asoybeans 3atesta 3acolor 3aanthocyanins 3amedicinal properties 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3acell adhesion 3aprotein synthesis 3agene expression regulation 3agene expression 3acultured cells 3ain vitro studies 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription factors 3aDNA-binding domains 0acell adhesion molecules 0aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 0avascular cell adhesion molecule-1 0ainterferon regulatory factor-1 0amolecular sequence data1 aKim, Young Min1 aChung, Jong Il1 aShin, Sung-chul.1 aJeong, Yong-Kee1 aSeo, Han Geuk1 aLee, Jae Heun1 aChang, Ki Churl1 aKim, Hye-jung.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Aug. 26, v. 57, no. 16 p.7324-7330dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf900856z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/09  aOther US 7aarticle02913naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100002300183245006500206300001600271500002400287500001500311520125200326650002301578650002101601650001201622650001601634650002001650650001301670650001401683650001301697650002001710650001601730650001201746650002901758650001101787650002001798650002401818650000901842650002801851650002901879653002401908653001501932700002201947700002201969700002401991700001802015773012102033852000902154856007702163930003302240945002502273946001302298655001202311IND4425412420221120093821.0090829e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442541242DNAL7 a196811502pmid7 a10.1002/zoo.202362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL210 0aP0501 aSearcy, Richard A.10aCaptive reproduction of the Jamaican iguana (Cyclura collei)  ap. 343-349.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Jamaican iguana (Cyclura collei) was considered to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1990 in the Hellshire Hills region of Jamaica. Between 1994 and 1996, several wild caught juveniles were placed in six North American zoological institutions including the Indianapolis Zoo. The intent was to establish a self-sustaining captive population outside of Jamaica in order to serve as an ancillary population should the wild numbers decline. Several environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, photoperiod and diet were manipulated to encourage reproduction in captivity. In 2006, two clutches of eggs were deposited by two separate females for a total of 35 eggs. Twenty-six eggs were fertile and 22 hatched after a 76-83-day incubation at 30.3-30.8°C (86.5-86.7°F). The average weight of the neonates was 26.4 g and the average total length was 21.7 cm. This successful reproduction of C. collei constitutes the first North American hatching for this species. Environmental parameters, incubation techniques and neonate morphometry can serve as a baseline for further propagation of the species. This represents a positive milestone for the continuing conservation of this critically endangered species.

Putrescine fractions increased with increasing leaf age, although the expression of its biosynthetic enzymes Arg and Orn decarboxylases decreased. Orn transport from young organs dramatically enhanced putrescine biosynthesis in older tissues, via the Orn decarboxylase pathway. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase genes were down-regulated during development in a tissue/organ-specific manner, as were spermidine and spermine levels. In contrast, amine oxidases, peroxidases and phenolics increased from the youngest to the fully developed vascular tissues; they also increased from the peripheral regions of leaves to the petioles. Hydrogen peroxide generated by amine oxidases accumulated for the covalent linkage of proteins via peroxidases during lignification. These results could be valuable for addressing further questions on the role of PAs in plant development. 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3asecondary metabolites 3aadenosylmethionine decarboxylase 3aputrescine 3aarginine decarboxylase 3aperoxidases 3aVitis vinifera 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3agene expression regulation 3aleaf development 3aphenolic compounds 2aAdenosylmethionine Decarboxylase 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aPeroxidasexmetabolism 2aPolyaminesxmetabolism 2aPutrescinexmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aSpermidinexmetabolism 2aSpermidine Synthasexmetabolism 2aSperminexmetabolism 2aVitisxembryologyxmetabolism. 0apolyamines 0aplant development 0aspermidine synthase1 aMoschou, Panagiotis N.1 aToumi, Imene1 aRoubelakis-Angelakis, Kalliopi A.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2009 Sept. 15, v. 166, no. 14 p.1508-1519dUrban & Fischerx0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2009.03.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090903b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/09/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03173naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100002500202245010200227300001800329500002400347520139600371650001701767650001701784650002201801650002201823650003101845650001701876650001601893650002201909650002401931650002101955650003801976650002702014650002902041650003502070650005202105653004202157700002202199700001802221700002202239700002202261700001902283700001802302773011002320852000902430856008702439930003302526945002502559946001102584655001202595IND4425435520221120083101.0090901e20090915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442543552DNAL7 a194647532pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2009.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF300 0aF600 0aK0011 aMaestrini, Pierluigi10aIsolation and expression analysis of low temperature-induced genes in white poplar (Populus alba)  ap. 1544-1556.  aIncludes references  aPoplar is an important crop and a model system to understand molecular processes of growth, development and responses to environmental stimuli in trees. In this study, we analyzed gene expression in white poplar (Populus alba) plants subjected to chilling. Two forward suppression-subtractive-hybridization libraries were constructed from P. alba plants exposed to low non-freezing temperature for 6 or 48 h. Hundred and sixty-two cDNAs, 54 from the 6-h library and 108 from the 48-h library, were obtained. Isolated genes belonged to six categories of genes, specifically those that: (i) encode stress and defense proteins; (ii) are involved in signal transduction; (iii) are related to regulation of gene expression; (iv) encode proteins involved in cell cycle and DNA processing; (v) encode proteins involved in metabolism and energetic processes; and (vi) are involved in protein fate. Different expression patterns at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 h at 4 °C and after a recovery of 24 h at 20 °C were observed for isolated genes, as expected according to the class in which the gene putatively belongs. Forty-four of 162 genes contained DRE/LTRE cis-elements in the 5' proximal promoter of their orthologs in Populus trichocarpa, suggesting that they putatively belong to the CBF regulon. The results contribute new data to the list of possible candidate genes involved in cold response in poplar. 3aPopulus alba 3aforest trees 3amolecular cloning 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression regulation 3aplant stress 3acold stress 3aenergy metabolism 3asignal transduction 2aCold Temperature 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPopulusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 0asuppression subtractive hybridization1 aCavallini, Andrea1 aRizzo, Milena1 aGiordani, Tommaso1 aBernardi, Rodolfo1 aDurante, Mauro1 aNatali, Lucia0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2009 Sept. 15, v. 166, no. 14 p.1544-1556dUrban & Fischerx0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2009.03.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090903b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/09/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02676naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100001800175245007400193300001800267500002400285500001500309520120300324650000901527650002501536650002401561650001701585650002901602650001601631650003501647650002301682650004001705650002101745650005201766650003701818653003101855700002201886700002301908773011001931852000902041856008702050930003302137945002502170946001102195655001202206IND4425435420221120083119.0090901e20090915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442543542DNAL7 a194103352pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2009.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aFujino, Kenji10aTranscriptional activity of rice autonomous transposable element Dart  ap. 1537-1543.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe rice Dart/nDart transposon system belongs to the hAT superfamily of class II transposons. The nonautonomous element nDart is active in intact rice plants. The autonomous element Dart was identified based on sequence similarity to nDart. Because the rice genome sequence of Nipponbare contains at least 51 Dart elements, it is not clear whether Dart elements are expressed or whether they are transposable. This study characterized for the expression of the predicted ORF of Dart. RNA blotting analysis revealed three transcripts of different lengths. Only the longest transcript (2.5 kb) corresponding to the predicted ORF of the Dart element produced a functional TPase. The other transcripts had a frame-shift generating a premature stop codon through alternative splicing. These transcripts were expressed from either of two potentially autonomous Dart elements, Dart01/28 and Dart02. The frequency of alternative splicing differed between the transcripts of the derivative elements. More than 90% of the transcripts from Dart02 were alternatively spliced, compared with only 3% from Dart01/28. The element-specific expression and alternative splicing may control the transposition of nDart. 3arice 3aalternative splicing 3aopen reading frames 3aOryza sativa 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransposons 2aAlternative Splicingxgenetics 2aBlotting, Northern 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTranscription, Geneticxgenetics 0agene expression regulation1 aMatsuda, Yasuyuki1 aSekiguchi, Hiroshi0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2009 Sept. 15, v. 166, no. 14 p.1537-1543dUrban & Fischerx0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2009.03.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090903b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/09/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02394naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001500175245014000190300001400330500002400344520105000368650002501418650001701443650001601460650001201476650001301488650002701501650002101528650001401549650002001563651001001583700001701593700001801610700001401628700001701642773010901659852000901768856008801777930003301865945002501898946001301923655001201936IND4425438120140725000000.0090901e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442543812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aWang, Dong10aResistance selection and biochemical characterization of spinosad resistance in Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 90-94.  aIncludes references  aA Helicoverpa armigera population was collected from Shandong province, China. After 15 generations of selection in the laboratory, the H. armigera strain developed more than 20-fold resistance to spinosad. At LD50 level, no significant cross-resistance was found between spinosad and chlorpyrifos, methomyl, avermectin and chlorfenapyr except for fenvalerate with a low cross-resistance of 2.4-fold. However, LD99 values of fenvalerate against the parental and resistant strains were not different significantly. After inhibitors were used, spinosad resistance could be partially suppressed by piperonylbutoxide (PBO) and triphenylphosphate (TPP), but not by diethylmaleate (DEM). Activities of p-nitroanisole O-demethylase (ODM) developed to 8.26-fold compared with the parental strain, but no obvious changes were found in activities of carboxyl esterase (CarE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The results indicated that resistance to spinosad in the cotton bollworm might be associated with an increase in cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3astrains 3aspinosad 3ainsecticide resistance 3across resistance 3asynergism 3aenzyme activity 3aChina1 aQiu, Xinghui1 aRen, Xuexiang1 aNiu, Fang1 aWang, Kaiyun0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2009 Oct., v. 95, no. 2 p.90-94dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.07.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090910b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/09  aOther US 7aarticle01269naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245004400130520014600174650002200320650001500342650001300357650001200370650001200382650002400394650001000418650002300428650001700451653001000468653002700478653002800505653002100533653002400554653002800578653002500606653002300631653002700654773010300681852000900784939003300793945000800826946001300834655001200847991599974260742620221120062000.0830706s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830059422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, C.C.10aBiochemistry and physiology of coccidia  acoccidia, biochemistry and physiology, extensive review (includes detailed reviews of phases of development, and metabolism and chemotherapy) 3aToxoplasma gondii 3ametabolism 3aProtozoa 3aenzymes 3aEimeria 3amechanism of action 3adrugs 3aanimal development 3amitochondria 0acysts 0aBiochemistry, Protozoa 0aCarbohydrates, Protozoa 0aLipids, Protozoa 0aMembranes, Protozoa 0aNucleic acids, Protozoa 0aPhysiology, Protozoa 0aProteins, Protozoa 0aReproduction, Protozoa0 tBiology of the Coccidia / edited by Peter L.

The enzyme levels added to the diets were 0.00% (control) and 500mg kg-1 DM. Enzyme supplementation significantly improved body weight gain, feed to gain ratio, relative growth, energy and protein efficiency from 11-28 d of age. Adding enzyme significantly increased body weight gain, decreased feed intake and improved feed to gain ratio, energy and protein efficiency from 29-44 d of age (p<0.05). Body weight gain, feed intake, relative growth, energy and protein efficiency was increased and feed to gain ratio was decreased by enzyme supplementation from 29-44 d (p<0.05). Enzyme addition significantly increased carcass and thigh percentages at 44 d of age. Adding enzyme significantly increased the concentration of blood triiodothyronine (T3) at 28 and 42 d and reduced the concentration of blood thyroxin (T4) at 42 d of age. Enzyme inclusion increased the concentration of blood total cholesterol at 10, 28 and 42 d of age, however HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations increased at d 10 and 42 (p<0.05). The concentration of blood uric acid was significantly decreased at d 28 and 42 in broilers fed enzyme supplemented diets. 3abroiler chickens 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aanimal growth 3acarcass characteristics 3adietary protein 3ablood lipids 3auric acid 3aenzymes 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3atriacylglycerols 3atriiodothyronine 3aliveweight gain 3acholesterol 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3abroiler feeding 0ablood chemistry 0athyroxine 0aprotein efficiency ratio1 aRezaei, M.1 aSayyahzadeh, H.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 12 p.1199-1205x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/fin1590.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100609b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/04  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04437naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002300161245008300184300001800267500001500285520287200300650002303172650002103195650002303216650002303239650001903262650002403281650001503305650001303320650002203333650001803355650003803373650001403411650003603425650001603461650002003477650001803497650002103515650002003536650001503556653003403571653001603605773009503621852000903716856007803725930003303803945002503836946001103861990002303872655001203895IND4434468820221120040320.0100325s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443446882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAl-Mayah, Ali A.S.10aEffect of Fish Oil on Immune Response in Broiler Chicks Vaccinated Against IBD  ap. 1156-1161.  a2019-12-04  aIBD can only be controlled by proper vaccination. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of an intermediate strain of live attenuated IBD vaccine in broiler chicks at 7th day of age, as well as the effect of fish oil on immune response in birds vaccinated with IBD vaccine. One hundred forty, day-old broiler chicks were reared and used for this purpose. The chicks were divided into 7 groups A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Groups A, B and C were vaccinated via drinking water route at 7th day whereas D, E and F were vaccinated at 14th day of age. Groups B, C, E and F were fed 50gm fish oil/kg diet for one week either before or after vaccination. Group G was acted as control. Three chicks from each group were sacrificed by decapitation one week interval from the first day until 28th day of age and bursa weight to body weight (Bursal index) was recorded at these periods. Blood samples were collected for detection IBD antibody titer using ELISA at all these periods from control group for detection MDA, whereas the blood has been collected from the treated groups at a period of seven days after vaccination until the end of the experiment at 28th day of age to detect the effect of time of vaccination and fish oil supplementation on the IBD antibody titer. On necropsy, the gross pathological changes were recorded. The changes were occurred after 7 days postvaccination. The affected bursa was edematous and covered with yellowish transudate, other showed pinpoint mucosal surface necrosis, whereas other undergo atrophy. The Bursal Index (BI) was gradually increased from 1st-28th day of age in the control group, whereas in group A it was increased from the 1st to the 7th day and decreased thereafter. In group D the index was increased from the 1st-14th day and decreased thereafter until the 28th day of age. The MDA of control group was decreased from the 1st to the 28th day. The antibody titer of group A was decreased in a way similar to that of the control group, but a significant (p<0.05) difference was present between them at 14th day and thereafter, whereas in group D it was decreased from the 1st-14th day and then increased at 21st and 28th of age. Fish oil supplemented groups exhibited a slight numerical increment of both BI and antibody titer. Although single dose at the 7th day old vaccination could induce slight increase of IBD antibody in comparison to that of the control, vaccination at the 14th day of age induced high and protective level of IBD antibody titer. These may be due to the ability of vaccine at each time of vaccination to neutralize different levels of MDA. It was concluded that single dose vaccination at the 7th day in broiler chickens with high MDA was ineffective and could not used in broiler chicks. The effect of fish oil on the immune response to IBD vaccine should be further investigated. 3atemporal variation 3abroiler chickens 3avertebrate viruses 3abursa of Fabricius 3ahistopathology 3aoral administration 3aantibodies 3anecrosis 3amaternal immunity 3alive vaccines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afish oils 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3avaccination 3aimmune response 3atissue weight 3afeed supplements 3abroiler feeding 3aanimal age 0amaternally derived antibodies 0abody weight0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 12 p.1156-1161x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/fin1581.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100609b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/04  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03272naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245009000164300001600254500001500270520182000285650001602105650002802121650001902149650002302168650002502191650002302216650002102239650002202260650001202282650001702294650002302311650002502334650002102359650001902380650001402399650002402413653002402437653002602461653002102487700001702508700002702525773013402552852000902686930003302695945002502728946001302753655001202766IND4434464520221120030826.0100324e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443446452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMills, Tessa M.10aPhysiological Responses of Gold Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) to Reduced Irrigation  ap. 677-683.  a2019-12-04  aInformation on water relations and water stress physiology of Actinidia chinensis Planch. is scant. We aimed at providing such information by exposing potted 1-year-old plants to reduced irrigation in a glasshouse. The treatments were control (C) receiving sufficient water to replace 100% of evapotranspiration, early (E) reduced irrigation for 13 days earlier in the experiment, late (L) reduced irrigation for 13 days later in the experiment, and recovery (R) undergoing E and L with 5 days of full irrigation in between to recover from E. All plants were fully watered between early and late episodes of reduced irrigation. Soil volumetric water content was lower in E, L, and R compared with C, leading to lower leaf water potential, photosynthetic rate (Pn), and stomatal conductance (gs). Pn was lower in the reduced irrigation vines only when g(s) was below 0.1 mol·m–2·s–1. High leaf temperature in the glasshouse imposed nonstomatal limitations to photosynthesis as indicated by elevated internal leaf CO2 concentrations (C(i)). Following rewatering, the stressed vines showed rapid recovery of leaf water potential and photosynthesis. However, C(i) and g(s) were slower to respond. There was an indication of osmotic adjustment in leaves under reduced irrigation. Discrimination against 13CO2 was the same among the treatments. A. chinensis had better stomatal control under water stress compared with Actinidia deliciosa, for which some information is available. Water stress history in A. chinensis encouraged more drought resistance in the subsequent water stress period, but this was not sustained. Although field performance of A. chinensis under water stress is expected to be better than what we have presented here, long periods of deficit irrigation for this species cannot be recommended. 3atemperature 3ainterspecific variation 3acarbon dioxide 3aevapotranspiration 3astomatal conductance 3asoil water content 3aosmotic pressure 3adrought tolerance 3adrought 3awater stress 3adeficit irrigation 3aleaf water potential 3airrigation rates 3aphotosynthesis 3akiwifruit 3aActinidia chinensis 0aspecies differences 0aplant-water relations 0aplant physiology1 aLi, Jianming1 aBehboudian, M.

The sterile line Bcajh97-01A was found to undergo aberrant cytokinesis during male meiosis. Transcriptional profiling of the flower buds of both fertile and sterile plants was performed at the periods preceding meiosis, at the tetrad to uninucleate pollen period, and at the binucleate to mature pollen period. Transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) from corresponding genes that were expressed in flower buds at these three different stages could be divided into nine classes. We sequenced a total of 14 new TDFs that were differentially displayed at particular pollen developmental stages, including eight genes with unknown or hypothetical functions and six genes showing significant homology with known genes. This characterization of the Bcajh97-01A genic male-sterile line allowed the identification of candidate genes underlying genic male sterility. 3atranscriptomics 3amessenger RNA 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aphenotype 3abuds 3avegetable crops 3acytokinesis 3aplant fertility 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3atranscriptome 3agreen leafy vegetables 3anucleotide sequences 3ameiosis 3apollen 0aandroecium 0agenic male sterility 0amolecular sequence data1 aYe, Wan-zhi1 aLiu, Ting-ting1 aCao, Jia-shu0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2009 Nov., v. 134, no. 6 p.632-640wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle03379naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008400130500011600214500002400330500001500354520197300369650003902342650002702381650002102408650002002429650000902449650001202458650003002470650002802500650001102528650002302539650001102562650001902573653001002592700001402602700001602616700001602632700001902648700001702667700001602684700001502700773011202715852000902827856008502836655001202921IND4464845820221123035411.0130131s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446484582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhrustaleva, L.14aThe chromosome organization of genes and some types of extragenic DNA in Allium  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Edible Alliaceae, held May 21-24, 2012, Fukuoka, Japan.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe have studied the physical organization of genes and non-coding DNA in two Allium species, A. cepa and A. fistulosum. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) clones and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of gene fragments obtained with primers designed for the gene sequences available in the public GenBank were physically mapped onto chromosomes using a Tyr-FISH technique. The allinase and lacrymatory factor synthase (LFS) genes that encoded enzymes operating in one metabolic way were cloned sequences and physically mapped onto A. cepa and A. fistulosum chromosomes. The alliinase gene probe (1100 bp) hybridized to the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 4 of A. cepa. The LFS gene probe (550 bp) hybridized to the proximal region of the long arm of chromosome 5 in both species. Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) that are located between SSR loci were used for chromosomal location of microsatellites in A. fistulosum using common FISH. The chromosomal organization of the Tyl-copia group retrotransposons were investigated in A. fistulosum. Dispersed hybridization of the probe along the chromosome arms apart from telomeric ends was detected. Chromosomal distribution of DNA methylation pattern in A. fistulosum L. was studied using a specific antibodies against 5-methylcytosine (anti-5mC). Highly methylated distal regions in all chromosomes were found. Differences in the methylation level between corresponding regions of homologue chromosomes were shown. We describe recent progress in exploiting the ultrasensitive Tyr-FISH technique for development of visual gene maps for chromosomes of A. cepa and A. fistulosum. The results on the chromosomal location of individual genetic loci aided in assembling physical and genetic maps. We related the physical organization of expressed genes to the contrasting patterns of chiasma distribution and to the organization of repetitive DNA family and highly methylated DNA in these two Allium species. 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aretrotransposons 3aDNA methylation 3aloci 3aenzymes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aclones 3achromosome mapping 3aAllium 3aintergenic DNA 0agenes1 aKirov, I.1 aRomanov, D.1 aBudylin, M.1 aLapitskaya, I.1 aKiseleva, A.1 aFesenko, I.1 aKarlov, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Dec., , no. 969dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/969/969_2.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02300naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245002200130500026100152500002400413520094000437650002201377650000901399650001601408650001101424650001301435650003001448650001201478650001401490650001001504650001101514650001501525650001101540650001401551650001201565651001301577700001801590700001701608700002001625700001501645773011201660852000901772856008501781655001201866IND4464842820221123035540.0130130s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446484282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyala-Silva, T.10a'Andrea' Tamarind  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on New Developments in Plant Genetics and Breeding, organized on the occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aTamarind, Tamarindus indica L., is a multipurpose tropical fruit tree used primarily for its fruits, which are eaten fresh or processed, used as a seasoning or spice, or are processed (along with the seeds) for non-food uses.

In this paper, we announce the release of a superior genotype of these species. Tamarindus indica 'Andrea' is a seedling selection from progeny grown from seed received in 1996 from Thailand. While the majority of the seedlings grown from this population produced inconsistent percent soluble sugars, this selection showed uniform high sugar content (brix) and yield. 'Andrea' is of smaller height than other known cultivars and it is fast-growing and has commercial potential as well as being useful as a landscape tree in USDA Hardiness Zones 9A-11 and similar geographical areas. 3aTamarindus indica 3abrix 3afruit trees 3afruits 3agenotype 3ageographical distribution 3aprogeny 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aspices 3asubtropics 3asugars 3atamarinds 3atropics 3aThailand1 aSchnell, R.J.1 aMeerow, A.W.1 aWinterstein, M.1 aGordon, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 June, , no. 935dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/935/935_5.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03148naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005000125500011600175500002400291500001500315520183400330650002902164650000902193650001702202650001002219650001102229650001202240650001202252650001802264650002302282650001102305650001202316650001102328650002402339650002002363650001602383650003002399651001002429651002102439651001002460653001402470773011202484852000902596856008502605655001202690IND4464845720221123035338.0130131s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446484572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPak, Hong.10aFood system of Allium vegetables in east Asia  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Edible Alliaceae, held May 21-24, 2012, Fukuoka, Japan.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aFood System Theory looks at the food question in an integrated manner that covers the industrial chain of production, processing, marketing (including import and export) and consumption, and its significance is increasing with the progress of globalization. In the East Asian countries of Japan, China and Korea, the focus of this study, Allium vegetables including the Japanese bunching onion and garlic have long been an indispensable part of people’s daily diets, and the onion has seen expanded consumption among recent generations. Together, these are an important component of the modern diet, and production has increased; currently 64.3% of the world’s onions are produced in Asia, with 30.4% coming from China, 3.4% from Japan and 2.2% from Korea. Japan, China and Korea are closely related in terms of agricultural trade. Exports from China have a great effect on production, circulation and consumption in Japan and Korea, especially with regard to the issue of food safety, which is becoming more and more important as consumer awareness rises. China is an exporter, while Japan and Korea are importers. For instance, China produces 15 million tons of onions, of which it exports 500 thousand tons - as much as half of Japan's production, and one third of Korea's. Thus, there is a marked dependence on imports from China. In Japan, domestic production is maintained on the farmer side by improvements in product quality and processing practices. However, imports have risen to the demand for low-priced goods in the food service and ready-made meal industries. In China, the income of the middle class has expanded, and with consumers voicing increasing concerns about food safety, it seems that the time has come for international cooperation toward higher productivity and better production management systems. 3aJapanese bunching onions 3adiet 3afood service 3afoods 3aincome 3aexports 3afarmers 3aglobalization 3amanagement systems 3agarlic 3aimports 3aAllium 3aproduct improvement 3aproduct quality 3afood safety 3ainternational cooperation 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aChina 0amarketing0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Dec., , no. 969dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/969/969_1.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02482naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008800127500026100215500002400476520118700500650001101687650002001698650001901718650001301737650001401750650001401764650001001778650001101788650001601799650001501815700001801830700001601848700001901864700001801883773011201901852000902013856008602022655001202108IND4464845520221123035507.0130130s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446484552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyunjun10aSelection of heat tolerant potato lines via in vitro screening of true potato seeds  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on New Developments in Plant Genetics and Breeding, organized on the occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this research is to develop an efficient and more rapid in vitro screening method for heat tolerant families while producing microtubers directly from plants grown from true seeds, without need for shoot transplantation. An in vitro system for early selection of heat tolerant potato was developed on the basis of the tuberization of plants grown from true seeds, without need of transplanting shoots. This culture technique is less time consuming than traditional in vitro or field selection methods to discriminate between families with differences in heat tolerance and maintains promising clones for adaptation to warm environments as microtubers. Thirty-nine hybrid families were assessed under three temperature regimes. At 20 and 25°C, all families produced microtubers in different proportions; while at 30°C the production of microtubers was strongly inhibited. The mean tuberization rates among seedlings were 10.1, 7.2 and 1.5% at 20, 25 and 30°C, respectively. The in vitro test results corresponded to the expected heat tolerance of the families. Further research will reveal the effectiveness of this in vitro technique in respect to field selection. 3aclones 3aearly selection 3aheat tolerance 3apotatoes 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 3atemperature 3atrue seeds1 aCho, Kwangsoo1 aCho, Jihong1 aPark, Youngeun1 aCho, Hyunmook0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 June, , no. 935dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/935/935_32.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02196naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014400126500026100270500002400531520091000555650003501465650002001500650001301520650001301533650001201546650001101558650001601569700001301585700002001598700001701618700001601635773011201651852000901763856008601772655001201858IND4464845320221123035409.0130130s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446484532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xu-hong10aCytological studies of 2n male gamete formation in the diploid non-heading Chinese cabbage (brassica campestris ssp. chinensis (L.)

The diploid non-heading Chinese cabbage (2n=2x=20) can be hybridized with tetraploid male sterile line (2n=4x=40) to produce tetraploid plants, and therefore, it was used to study the cytological mechanism of unreduced gamete (n=2x=20) formation. In the meiotic study of microspore mother cells (MMCs), it was found that the first meiotic division was normal, but at the second meiotic division, parallel and tripolar spindle appeared and dyads and triads were found at the tretrad stage, which lead to the formation of 2n pollen. Therefore, the formation of 2n gamete in non-heading Chinese cabbage is due to the first division restitution. It plays important role in the sexual polyploidization breeding of non-heading Chinese cabbage. 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aChinese cabbage 3abreeding 3adiploidy 3ameiosis 3apollen 3atetraploidy1 aLi, Ying1 aZhang, Shu-ning1 aZhong, Cheng1 aLi, Shi-jun0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 June, , no. 935dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/935/935_30.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03501naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002100169245011800190300001600308500002400324520160100348650002501949650001701974650001601991650002102007650002002028650001602048650000902064650001302073650001502086650001702101650001702118650002102135650001602156650001002172650001002182650000902192650002502201650003302226650002302259650002802282650001902310650001302329650001102342650001102353650001802364650002402382650001602406650004302422650001702465650002502482650002802507700002102535700002302556700001902579700002102598773013302619852000902752856009002761655001202851IND4464869020221122050111.0130204s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446486902DNAL7 a121665322pmid7 a10.1080/07315724.2002.107192332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieman, David C.10aReducing Diet and/or Exercise Training Decreases the Lipid and Lipoprotein Risk Factors of Moderately Obese Women  ap. 344-350.  aIncludes references  aObjective: This study was designed to measure the influence of diet, exercise or both on serum lipids and lipoproteins in obese women. Methods: Obese subjects were randomly divided into one of four groups: diet alone (1,200–1,300 kcal/day, NCEP, Step I), exercise alone (five 45 minute sessions per week at 78.4 ± 0.5% maximum heart rate), exercise and diet, and controls. Maximal aerobic power, body composition, diet, serum lipids and lipoproteins were measured in all subjects at baseline and after a 12-week intervention period. Subjects included 91 moderately obese (45.6 ± 1.1 y, body mass index 33.1 ± 0.6 kg/m2) and 30 nonobese (43.2 ± 2.3 y, body mass index 21.4 ± 0.34 kg/m2) women who were recruited from the surrounding community. Independent t tests were used to compare obese and nonobese subjects at baseline. The 12-week intervention data from the obese groups were analyzed using a 4 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA design. Results: Cross-sectional comparisons at baseline showed obese subjects had significantly higher total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol/HDL-C and LDL-C values and lower HDL-C values. Prospective results showed that subjects in diet and exercise and diet lost 7.8 ± 0.7 and 8.1 ± 0.6 kg body mass, with no significant change for exercise relative to control.

The effect of five transplanting dates (15 November, 1 and 15 December, 1 and 15 January) with three high solid white onion cultivars ('JWO807', 'JWO605’ and 'JWO16B') were tried to determine the appropriate transplanting date and cultivar to get optimum yields and Total Soluble Solids (TSS) content. The results showed that early transplanting (15 November) of onion gave significantly high yield, however, TSS content was low in all the cultivars. The highest onion yield of 37.5 mt/ha was recorded in 2010-2011 when transplanted on 15 November while lowest yield of 14.3 mt/ha in 2009-2010 when transplanted on 15 January in 'JWO807'. The transplanting date had significant effect on yield and other parameters studied. Among the transplanting dates and cultivars tried, 'JWO807' was found to be most promising, as it gave highest bulb yield (37.5 mt/ha) and least number of unmarketable bottle-shaped bulbs (0.6%) when transplanted on 15 November, highest average bulb weight (83.9 g) when transplanted on 1 December and highest Total Soluble Solids content (19%) when transplanted on 1 January. The transplanting on 15 November having comparatively less TSS content but gave significant yield differences in all the three cultivars than other transplanting dates, thus can be considered useful for raising high solid white onion bulb crop under short-day conditions. In the present study it was also observed that there is inverse correlation between yield and TSS content. 3aAllium cepa 3abulbs 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3aonions 3atotal soluble solids1 aDhake, A.V.1 aSane, P.V.1 aSubramaniam, V.R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Dec., , no. 969dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/969/969_18.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03731naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007100131300001800202500002400220500001500244520226900259650002302528650001302551650001002564650002402574650001502598650002502613650001302638650001302651650001802664650002602682650001102708650002602719650001502745650001102760650001202771650002702783650002002810650001402830650001702844650001702861650002202878650002602900650002002926650001302946653001902959700002802978700001603006700002203022773013603044852000903180655001203189IND4464870920221122035210.0130204s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSevenier, Robert10aIncreased Production of Nutriments by Genetically Engineered Crops  ap. 199S-204S.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPlants are the basis of human nutrition and have been selected and improved to assure this purpose. Nowadays, new technologies such as genetic engineering and genomics approaches allow further improvement of plants. We describe here three examples for which these techniques have been employed. We introduced the first enzyme involved in fructan synthesis, the sucrose sucrose fructosyltransferase (isolated from Jerusalem artichoke), into sugar beet. The transgenic sugar beet showed a dramatic change in the nature of the accumulated sugar, 90% of the sucrose being converted into fructan. The use of transgenic sugar beet for the production and isolation of fructans will result in a more efficient plant production system of fructans and should promote their use in human food. The second example shows how the over-expression of the key enzyme of flavonoid biosynthesis could increase anti-oxidant levels in tomato. Introduction of a highly expressed chalcone isomerase led to a seventyfold increase of the amount of quercetin glucoside, which is a strong anti-oxidant in tomato. We were also able to modify the essential amino acid content of potato in order to increase its nutritional value. The introduction of a feedback insensitive bacterial gene involved in biosynthesis of aspartate family amino acids led to a sixfold increase of the lysine content. Because the use of a bacterial gene could appear to be controversial, we also introduced a mutated form of the plant key enzyme of lysine biosynthesis (dihydrodipicolinate synthase) in potato. This modification led to a 15 times increase of the lysine content of potato. This increase of the essential amino acid lysine influences the nutritional value of potato, which normally has low levels of several essential amino acids. These three examples show how the metabolism of primary constituents of the plant cell such as sugar or amino acids, but also of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, can be modified by genetic engineering. Producing fructan, a soluble fiber, increasing the level of flavonoids, an antioxidant, in tomato or increasing the level of essential amino acids in potato are all clear examples of plant genetic modifications with possible positive effects on human nutrition. 3achalcone isomerase 3apotatoes 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3atechnology 3aJerusalem artichokes 3atomatoes 3afructans 3asoluble fiber 3asecondary metabolites 3alysine 3anitric oxide synthase 3asugar beet 3ahumans 3asucrose 3aamino acid composition 3ahuman nutrition 3aquercetin 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3atransgenic plants 3aessential amino acids 3anutritive value 3agenomics 0anew technology1 aMeer, Ingrid M. van der1 aBino, Raoul1 aKoops, Andries J.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2002 June, v. 21, no. 3S p.199S-204SdAmerican College of Nutritionx0731-57247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245004800128300001800176500002400194520117700218650002501395650001901420650001401439650002401453650001901477650002401496650001101520650001801531650002001549650001601569650001301585650001301598650000701611650001901618650001601637650000901653650002501662650000901687650001201696773013601708852000901844655001201853IND4464871220221122035220.0130204s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLonnerdal, Bo10aExpression of Human Milk Proteins in Plants  ap. 218S-221S.  aIncludes references  aHuman milk proteins are believed to have a multitude of biological activities benefiting the newborn infant. Such functions include antibacterial and antiviral activities, enhancement of the immune system and increased nutrient absorption. To date, only breast-fed infants have been exposed to these proteins. However, by using genetic engineering it is now possible to express these proteins in plants, such as rice, at very high levels. Recombinant human milk proteins can subsequently be added to infant formula and baby foods. Prior to such addition, safety tests and efficacy trials need to be conducted. The safety tests will initially be done in rats and then in humans. The efficacy trials should also evaluate stability against heat treatment (processing), pH (stomach conditions) and proteolytic enzymes (digestion). To date, we have expressed recombinant human lactoferrin, lysozyme and α1-antitrypsin in rice at very high expression levels. These recombinant proteins showed a stability and activities similar to those of the native milk proteins, suggesting that they may be able to exert biological activities in infants when added to formula or baby foods. 3aantiviral properties 3abreast feeding 3adigestion 3agenetic engineering 3aheat treatment 3ahuman milk proteins 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3ainfant formulas 3alactoferrin 3alysozyme 3aneonates 3apH 3aplant proteins 3aproteolysis 3arats 3arecombinant proteins 3arice 3astomach0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2002 June, v. 21, no. 3S p.218S-221SdAmerican College of Nutritionx0731-57247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245011600165300001600281500002400297520111800321650001901439650001701458650001001475650001601485650001101501650001201512650001201524650001001536700002101546700002201567700001801589700001801607700002301625773010101648852000901749856008301758856006801841655001201909IND4464877820221122035115.0130206s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487782DNAL7 a10.5344/ajev.2012.110912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanuti, Valentina10aEffect of Oenotannin Addition on the Composition of Sangiovese Wines from Grapes with Different Characteristics  ap. 220-231.  aIncludes references  aDifferent types of oenotannins were added to Vitis vinifera cv. Sangiovese grapes of various composition and the resulting wine color parameters were measured, including intensity, hue, total phenol index, monomer anthocyanin content, and colored polymeric pigment content. Oenotannins were also tested during pre- and postfermentation on grapes harvested in 2003 from two growing areas. Grapes from the 2004 harvest were tested at different ripeness using only oenotannins exhibiting the best wine color stabilization in 2003. The response of different oenotannins varied according to grape characteristics, with gallnut and grape seed tannins most reliably stabilizing and increasing color intensity even after six months of storage. The same tannins positively affected wine color stabilization, an effect further enhanced in wine produced from less ripe grapes. Timing of oenotannin addition and grape characteristics had a significant effect on color intensity and stabilization. The estimation of grape phenolic maturity may allow for improved wine color characteristics by tailoring the use of oenotannins. 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3agrape seeds 3agrapes 3aphenols 3atannins 3awines1 aPuccioni, Sergio1 aGiovani, Giovanna1 aSalmi, Monica1 aRosi, Iolanda1 aBertuccioli, Mario0 tAmerican journal of enology and viticulture.g2012 June, v. 63, no. 2 p.220-231x0002-92547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5344/ajev.2012.110913Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.ajevonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02968naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245010000165300001600265500002400281520158400305650002701889650001701916650001301933650001901946650001001965650001101975650001601986650002702002650002302029650002302052650001502075650001002090700001902100700002202119700001902141700001702160700002302177700002002200700002902220773010102249852000902350856008302359856006802442655001202510IND4464877520221122023221.0130206s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487752DNAL7 a10.5344/ajev.2012.110882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelsart, Cristele10aEnhanced Extraction of Phenolic Compounds from Merlot Grapes by Pulsed Electric Field Treatment  ap. 205-211.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this investigation was to study the influence of pulsed electric field application on fermentation process and wine characteristics. Investigations were related, in particular, to the effects of pulsed electric field pretreatment (500–700 V/cm) of grapes with a short treatment duration (40–100 ms) on the evolution of color intensity, anthocyanins, and phenolic content during the alcoholic fermentation of Merlot grapes and seven months after bottling. The kinetics of the extraction of valuable compounds during the vinification stage was established. Sensory analyses of untreated wines were compared to those of pulsed electric field-treated wines. These results showed that the permeabilization of Merlot skin by a pulsed electric field treatment resulted in increased extraction of polyphenols and anthocyanins. Pulsed electric field of moderate intensity and short duration accelerated the flow kinetics of phenolic compounds through the cell membranes. Compared to the classical process, pulsed electric field treatment has the advantage of nonthermal selective extraction (<5°C) involving no loss of product quality. Phenolic compounds have an important role in enology owing to their contribution to the sensory properties of wine and to their participation in various phenomena during the vinification and aging processes. Sensory analysis indicated that pulsed electric field treatment contributes to the enhancement of the sensory attributes of wine. This technique seems to be an interesting alternative to current prefermentative techniques. 3aalcoholic fermentation 3aanthocyanins 3abottling 3acell membranes 3acolor 3agrapes 3apolyphenols 3apulsed electric fields 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3awinemaking 3awines1 aGhidossi, Remy1 aPoupot, Christian1 aCholet, Celine1 aGrimi, Nabil1 aVorobiev, Eugène.1 aMilisic, Vladan1 aPeuchot, Martine Mietton0 tAmerican journal of enology and viticulture.g2012 June, v. 63, no. 2 p.205-211x0002-92547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5344/ajev.2012.110883Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.ajevonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03473naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005000126300001400176500013800190500002400328520190100352650001602253650001502269650002102284650002302305650001202328650000902340650001702349650001102366650001002377650002302387650004302410650002202453650001702475650001402492650001202506650002802518650000902546650001102555650001702566650001202583650001102595650001902606650001602625650001002641651000902651651001802660700002102678773013802699852000902837856008502846655001202931IND4464881620221122023141.0130206s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446488162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashefi, B.10aEffect of mycotoxins in dried figs production  ap. 37-40.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Mycotoxins in Nuts and Dried Fruits, held September 6-8, 2011, Damghan, Iran.  aIncludes references  aDried figs are the significant annual production and export in some countries such as Turkey, USA and Iran. Fungi activity, infection and mycotoxin contamination is the main risk of the fruit. Dried figs are produced and collected when fruits are ripened and shrivel on the tree in Iran. As a general rule, infection starts in-field, but it depends on both the product and the fungus. Emphasis should be placed on the fact that the strategies for a particular fig crop depends on the ambient or controlled climatic conditions. Usually, during the harvest and post-harvest stages suitable humid temperatures predispose the plant for penetration of spore-contaminated dust or insect transmission to the fruit. An important variety of fungi have been found to contain cyclopiazonic acid, aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and patulin. The recent research shows cyclopiazonic acid is a more common mycotoxin than aflatoxin in dried figs. The formation of aflatoxins is mainly due to contamination by Aspergillus species and especially A. flavus and A. parasiticus. Under stress conditions, aflatoxin contamination is probably high. Levels of the mycotoxins in dried figs are measured by Thin- Layer Chromatography (TLC), Liquid Chromatography (LC), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MAS) and Bright, Greenish Yellow Fluorescent (BGYF). It is important to provide good techniques for management and reduce mycotoxins such as decreasing A. flavus spores in the orchard, removal of damaged fruits, additional drying in a solar drier, fluorescence sorting, use sulfur dioxide followed by drying, sodium and potassium metabisulfite, ozone treatment and storage management. This review describes the production of dried figs in Iran, summarizes the available data on figs providing insights into possible infection routes and related studies on export products. 3aAspergillus 3aaflatoxins 3aclimatic factors 3acyclopiazonic acid 3aexports 3afigs 3afluorescence 3afruits 3afungi 3agas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aochratoxin A 3aozonation 3apatulin 3apotassium metabisulfite 3arisk 3asodium 3asolar drying 3asorting 3aspores 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3atrees 3aIran 3aUnited States1 aArabsorkhi, M.R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 963 p.37-40dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/963/963_4.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02014naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011400128300001400242500013800256500002400394520089100418650001601309650001901325650001701344650001101361650002501372650001201397700001601409700001801425700001301443773013801456852000901594856008501603655001201688IND4464881920221122023310.0130206s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446488192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedaghati, E.10aMorphological identification of Aspergillus species isolated from fresh grape and raisin in Rafsanjan markets  ap. 51-53.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Mycotoxins in Nuts and Dried Fruits, held September 6-8, 2011, Damghan, Iran.  aIncludes references  aThe incidence of Aspergillus species on grape (Vitis vinifera) and raisin in Rafsanjan, Kerman province, was studied.

In the surface disinfected method on PDA only Aspergillus section Nigri was recovered which included A. niger, A. tubingensis and A. citricus species. On the other hand, without surface disinfection and desiccators’ isolation methods Aspergillus section Nigri and section Flavi were detected. Overall, Aspergillus section Nigri was the most common species in grape and raisin in Rafsabjan markets. 3aAspergillus 3aVitis vinifera 3adisinfection 3agrapes 3aisolation techniques 3amarkets1 aRahmani, R.1 aKhodaygan, P.1 aNadi, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 963 p.51-53dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/963/963_7.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03372naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245007900123300001400202500013800216500002400354520175400378650001602132650002302148650001302171650001602184650002402200650001502224650001202239650003002251650001102281650002602292650003802318650001002356650001102366650001502377650001402392650001302406650001902419650002602438650001402464650001502478650002202493650001402515650002602529650001602555650002302571700001602594773013802610852000902748856008502757655001202842IND4464881820221122023338.0130206s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446488182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadi, M.10aImportance of mycotoxins and rapid detection of contamination in hazelnuts  ap. 47-50.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Mycotoxins in Nuts and Dried Fruits, held September 6-8, 2011, Damghan, Iran.  aIncludes references  aMycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites, a diverse group of chemical substances, from fungi which may affect the quality and safety of foods. The major toxic fungal genera producing mycotoxins include Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium. Aflatoxins are the most toxic and carcinogenic form of mycotoxins. Mycotoxins require certain environmental conditions of humidity and temperature to form as well as sufficient nutrients. These conditions are often provided during the growth, harvesting, drying, processing and when it is stored in an unsuitable way for a long time. Nuts and dried fruits, the major commodities produced and traded in the basin, may be contaminated with aflatoxins and ochratoxin A. Rhizomucor pusillus were the most common thermophilic fungi in hazelnut. As the maximum permissible mycotoxin values range between 0.025 and 15 μg/kg and fungal infestation usually takes place in localized areas. The Codex Alimentarius set a maximum level of 10 μg/kg for total aflatoxins in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios to eat, in 2010. Several chemical and biological systems are developed to measure of toxin contamination. Although these improve the detection of mycotoxin quantity, they do not have specificity. Mycotoxin identification is generally performed with rapid screening tests such as Spectrophotometer, Capillary Electrophoresis, Multispectral Imaging System, Chromatographic technique, Radioimmunoassay and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA). Different methods have advantages or limitations for the determining contaminations. This document points out the selection of best techniques with the potential use to improve the measurement and gives recommendations for the assessment of mycotoxins in hazelnut. 3aAspergillus 3aCodex Alimentarius 3aFusarium 3aPenicillium 3aRhizomucor pusillus 3aaflatoxins 3aalmonds 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adrying 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afoods 3afruits 3aharvesting 3ahazelnuts 3ahumidity 3aimage analysis 3amultispectral imagery 3anutrients 3apistachios 3aradioimmunoassays 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3atemperature 3athermophilic fungi1 aKashefi, B.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 963 p.47-50dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/963/963_6.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03549naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245015100163300001600314500002400330500001500354520215200369650001902521650001902540650001602559650001402575650001702589650001102606650002502617650001002642650003102652650001102683650001102694650001902705650001902724650001702743650001202760650001102772651001802783653001102801700001802812700002002830700002302850773010202873852000902975856008302984655001203067IND4464879520221122023530.0130206s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487952DNAL7 a10.5344/ajev.2012.111112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLenz, Marcel S.10aPhotosynthetic Performance of Pinot gris (Vitis vinifera L.) Grapevine Leaves in Response to Potato Leafhopper (Empoasca fabae Harris) Infestation  ap. 357-366.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPotato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae Harris) is a polyphagous insect pest that feeds on Vitis vinifera L. grapevines in North America. In sensitive grape cultivars such as Pinot gris, feeding symptoms include leaf yellowing, leaf cupping, and stunted vine growth. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine how photosynthesis and other physiological processes are affected by E. fabae infestation. In Experiment I, Pinot gris leaves at four different positions along shoots were infested with either 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 E. fabae nymphs for 43 hr to determine how the relationship between infestation level and leaf position affects leaf photosynthesis and whether or not damage thresholds exist for the photosynthetic response. Empoasca fabae infestation was inversely proportional to carbon assimilation (A), transpiration (E), and stomatal conductance (G(s)) and directly proportional to internal CO2 concentration (C(i)). There was a positive correlation between A and G(s), while A and C(i) were negatively correlated, indicating that reductions in A were due to both stomatal and nonstomatal limitations. Damage thresholds, defined as the number of insects necessary to cause damage to the plant, were calculated for A, E, G(s), and C(i) at most leaf positions. In Experiment II, response curves were generated for infested and uninfested regions of the same leaves to determine how light and CO2 utilization were affected by E. fabae infestation. Declining A in response to E. fabae infestation was due to a decreased capacity of leaf tissues to utilize light and CO2. Reductions in A were correlated with decreases in G(s) and increases in C(i), indicating that stomatal and nonstomatal limitations were relevant, with evidence of photosynthetic compensation in the postinfestation period. These results indicate that E. fabae infestation causes injury through rapid effects on the capacity of leaves to produce photosynthate through effects on internal tissues and on stomata. These effects might be transient at low infestation levels, but leaf tissue can be compromised at higher infestation levels, leading to irreversible damage. 3aEmpoasca fabae 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3ainsect pests 3agrapes 3astomatal conductance 3avines 3agreenhouse experimentation 3acarbon 3anymphs 3aVitis vinifera 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant damage 3astomata 3ashoots 3aNorth America 0aleaves1 aIsaacs, Rufus1 aFlore, James A.1 aHowell, G.

A taxonomic project running at Gatersleben for already more than 30 years elucidated infrageneric relationships and led to the establishment of new systematic treatments. More than 40 collecting missions together with material exchange resulted in a large living collection of 3354 accessions. A considerable proportion of vegetatively propagated material from collecting missions makes this collection very valuable. Field and pot culture is performed for vegetatively maintained material and for seed production. To counteract the vulnerability of field and pot collections, laboratory methods were developed, beginning with slow growth culture on artificial media. Meristem culture was used to clean material from viruses. In vitro storage was found to be possible, but longer storage caused increasing weakness of plantlets and endophytic accumulation. Cryopreservation turned out to be the better alternative resulting in increasing numbers of stored accessions, at present amounting to 84 accessions. Explants from bulbs, bulbils, young inflorescence bases and in vitro cultures are cryopreserved. In garlic, average regeneration of 40% was attained. The method is extended to other taxa such as hybrids and wild species like Allium obliquum. Furthermore, pollen storage was initiated enabling preservation of broader populations of material. Based on the living collections and field studies a herbarium of about 8050 Allium specimens and about 10,000 voucher photographs were assembled. Intensive analyses of general morphology, seed testa structure, flower, scape, root and leaf anatomy, and phenological, biochemical and karyological studies were performed. Along with the development of molecular methods, isoenzyme, RFLP, RAPD, AFLP, and sequence-based analyses resulted in a revised taxonomic classification. The genus Allium proved to be monophyletic and consists of three major evolutionary lineages. Fifteen subgenera are accepted and 79 sections are circumscribed. 3aAllium 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abulbs 3acryopreservation 3aendophytes 3aexplants 3aflowers 3agarlic 3agermplasm conservation 3aherbaria 3ahybrids 3aisozymes 3aleaves 3aleeks 3ameristems 3aonions 3aphotographs 3aphylogeny 3aplant collections 3aplantlets 3apollen 3apot culture 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ascientific expeditions 3atesta 3aviruses1 aBlattner, F.R.1 aFritsch, R.1 aPistrick, K.1 aSenula, A.1 aZanke, C.D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Dec., , no. 969dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/969/969_36.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02367naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245012800166300001600294500002400310500001500334520092600349650002101275650002001296650001701316650001101333650001301344650002601357650001301383650001101396650001101407650001501418650002501433650001101458650001901469650001701488650002201505653002001527653001801547700001701565700002101582700001901603773017801622852000901800856008801809655001201897IND4441186320221122011354.0100813s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444118632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Cheol-Ki10aControl of specific growth rate to enhance the production of a novel disintegrin, saxatilin, in recombinant Pichia pastoris  ap. 314-319.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is one of the best hosts for the production of foreign proteins because of the presence of a strong alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter that can be induced by methanol. Feeding the yeast, methanol induces protein production and provides an energy source for the host cells. However, excessive levels of methanol inhibit the growth of host cells, and insufficient methanol levels lead to poor growth and protein production. We have used various methanol feeding strategies to enhance the production of saxatilin. Saxatilin is a novel snake venom-derived disintegrin that inhibits tumor angiogenesis and metastasis and has been shown to suppress ovarian cancer cell invasion. A two-step increase feeding strategy to control the specific growth rate led to the best results in terms of specific protein production rates and final saxatilin amounts within the limited fermentation time. 3apromoter regions 3aalcohol oxidase 3afermentation 3aenergy 3aproteins 3aKomagataella pastoris 3amethanol 3avenoms 3ayeasts 3ametastasis 3aspecific growth rate 3asnakes 3aanimal ovaries 3aangiogenesis 3aovarian neoplasms 0aPichia pastoris 0acell invasion1 aLee, Jin-Won1 aChung, Kwang-Hoe1 aPark, Hong-Woo0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2010 Sept., v. 110, no. 3 p.314-319dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.03.0133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02585naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245011600164300001600280500002400296520131800320650002201638650001601660650001701676650001501693650002401708650000901732650001201741650001501753650000701768650001901775650002601794650001601820650000901836700001801845700001801863700001901881773017801900852000902078856008802087655001202175IND4441185620221122011550.0100813s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444118562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Jin Ik10aSimple polyacrylamide affinity gel electrophoresis using oleic acid for the isolation of chymotrypsin inhibitor  ap. 276-280.  aIncludes references  aProtease inhibitors have been usually isolated through a number of steps using various chromatographical methods, which are time consuming and tedious. In this report, an efficient and low-cost acrylamide affinity gel electrophoresis method for the detection and isolation of chymotrypsin inhibitor from a crude extract was studied. The affinity gel was obtained by immobilization of chymotrypsin on 5% (w/v) poly acrylamide-oleic acid gel, and the immobilized chymotrypsin showed high stability under varied concentrations of urea (0 to 8M), pH (4 to 10) and temperature (30 to 80°C). The affinity gel made of immobilized chymotrypsin was applied to polyacrylamide affinity gel electrophoresis and reverse electrode electro-elution using a modified commercial electrophoresis kit. Polyacrylamide affinity gel electrophoresis method showed higher isolation efficiency for chymotrypsin inhibitor from Ganoderma lucidum crude extract than a chromatographical method. Specific activity and yield of chymotrypsin inhibitor increased around 2.3-folds and 1.4-folds, respectively, compared with a chromatographical method. Also, two isomers of the inhibitor could be isolated by this method. Therefore, this method can be applied for the detection and isolation of bio-active molecules as a fast and economical method. 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aacrylamides 3achymotrypsin 3aelectrodes 3agel electrophoresis 3agels 3aisomers 3aoleic acid 3apH 3apolyacrylamide 3aproteinase inhibitors 3atemperature 3aurea1 aLim, Kook-Jin1 aNa, Yun-Cheol1 aLee, Yong-Keun0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2010 Sept., v. 110, no. 3 p.276-280dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.03.0073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03745naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002100155245012500176300001800301500002400319520140600343650001501749650001401764650001401778650001801792650001401810650001301824650001701837650002101854650002601875650000901901650002101910650002401931650001601955650001201971650006101983650006702044650005202111650003202163650002102195650002802216650006402244650003902308650003502347650004902382650004302431650000902474650000902483650002102492650002102513650001702534650005102551650006302602650003002665650003402695650002602729650002302755700002002778700001802798700001702816700001902833700001602852773010702868852000902975856003902984655001203023IND4442130020221122011409.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444213002DNAL7 a208122822pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.31402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Seung-Beom14aThe differential effect of high and low molecular weight fucoidans on the severity of collagen-induced arthritis in mice  ap. 1384-1391.  aIncludes references  aFucoidans have been extensively studied for their various biological activities but the exact role of fucoidans on the inflammatory processes associated with arthritic disease has not been studied. The effect of the treatment of high, medium and low molecular weight fucoidans (HMWF, MMWF and LMWF, respectively) on the progression of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was tested. A daily oral administration of HMWF enhanced the severity of arthritis, inflammatory responses in the joint cartilage and the levels of collagen-specific antibodies, while LMWF reduced the severity of arthritis and the levels of Th1-dependent collagen-specific IgG₂a. Further in vitro analyses, using macrophage cell lines, revealed that the HMWF induced the expression of various inflammatory mediators, and enhanced the cellular migration of macrophages. These stimulatory effects of fucoidan decreased in fucoidans with lower molecular weights and LMWF did not exhibit any pro-inflammatory effects. Interestingly, the oral administration of HMWF enhanced the production of IFN-γ, one of the Th1 cytokines, in collagen-stimulated spleen cells that had been isolated from CIA mice, while LMWF had the opposite effect. These results indicate that HMWF enhances arthritis through enhancing the inflammatory activation of macrophages while LMWF reduces arthritis through the suppression of Th1-mediated Immune reactions. 3aantibodies 3aarthritis 3acartilage 3acell movement 3acytokines 3afucoidan 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3amacrophage activation 3amice 3amolecular weight 3aoral administration 3asplenocytes 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aArthritis, Experimentalxdrug therapyximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aCartilagexdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aCollagen Type II 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aInflammationxchemically inducedxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aInflammation Mediatorsxmetabolism 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesis 2aJointsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred DBA 2aMolecular Weight 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPolysaccharidesxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aSpleenxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aTh1 Cellsxmetabolism 2aUndariaxchemistry1 aChun, Kwang-Rok1 aKim, Jae-Kwan1 aSuk, Kyungho1 aJung, Young-Mi1 aLee, Won-Ha0 tPhytotherapy research.g2010 Sept., v. 24, no. 9 p.1384-1391dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3140 7aarticle03357naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245004900148300001600197500001500213520216400228650002102392650002202413650002102435650001902456650001402475650001002489650001502499650000902514650001702523650001102540650000902551650001002560650001002570650001502580650001302595650002002608653000802628653000802636653001602644653002402660700001502684700001602699773007002715852000902785930003302794945001302827946001102840655001202851IND2206211820221122011710.0000803e199912  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220621182DNAL7 a220634632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZembayashi, M.10aDietary tea reduces the iron content of beef  ap. 221-226.  a2019-12-05  aWe hypothesized that the lightness of Japanese beef was related to the concentration of heme iron. In Experiment 1, six Japanese Black heifers were allotted randomly to one of three treatment groups: a basal concentrate ration (40% flaked corn) or the same diet and either 2 kg/d wheat bran or 0.5 kg/d green tea. After feeding the diets for 174 d, the cattle were slaughtered and the M. longissimus thoracis, M. semimembranosus, and M. gluteus medius were sampled for meat color, iron, and lipid content. The iron content of the M. semimembranosus from the tea-fed cattle was lower than in M. semimembranosus from the control cattle, and a* (redness) and square route of (a*2 + b*2) (saturation) values were lower in M. semimembranosus from bran- and tea-fed cattle than in control cattle. Treatment main effects (across muscles) indicated that inclusion of tea in the diet increased intramuscular lipid and reduced the muscle iron content. There was a significant negative correlation (r2 = 0.79) between muscle iron content and L* value (lightness). For Experiment 2, the effect of beef breed type on meat color and iron content of M. longissimus thoracis was investigated using stored meat samples from six breeds from a previous-fattening experiment done under a high nutritional plane. Muscle iron content was significantly lower in Japanese Black cattle than in Japanese Black X Holstein or Japanese Black X Japanese Black/Holstein. There was no relationship between muscle iron content and intramuscular lipid content (r2=0.00l). In Experiment 3, samples of M. longissimus dorsi were obtained from 17 Wagyu crossbred and 3 Angus crossbred cattle fed a corn concentrate diet in the USA for 148 d. Iron content of the M. longissimus thoracis from Japanese Black and Japanese Brown X Holstein cattle fattened in Japan was significantly less than the iron content of M. longissimus dorsi from cattle raised in the USA. Overall, the data indicate that it is possible to lower muscle iron, and lighten muscle color, by feeding green tea to Japanese cattle; also, there may be a genetic basis for the lower iron, and lighter color, of beef produced in Japan. 3aage at slaughter 3abreed differences 3ameat composition 3acattle feeding 3agreen tea 3aAngus 3acrossbreds 3airon 3ameat quality 3alipids 3abeef 3acolor 3aWagyu 3awheat bran 3aHolstein 3amineral content 0atea 0aage 0abeef breeds 0aintramuscular lipid1 aLunt, D.K.1 aSmith, S.B.0 tMeat science.g1999 Dec., v. 53, no. 4 p.221-226x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02242naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245010400164300001600268500002400284520100800308650002101316650002001337650001901357650001301376650001401389650002801403650001301431653002201444653002101466653001901487653000801506653001701514700001501531700001601546700001301562700001301575700001501588700001601603700001401619773009901633852000901732856005501741655001201796IND4437995020221121043256.0100604e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443799502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01719.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, J.10aDiscovery and transmission of functional QTL in the pedigree of an elite soybean cultivar Suinong14  ap. 235-242.  aIncludes references  aWith 3 figures and 5 tables In this study, we extended in silico mapping for single trait to analyse data from multiple environments by calculating intraclass correlations and to mapping pleiotropic QTL for multiple traits by defining new statistic to measure the correlation between multiple traits and the marker. Data sets include phenotypes of eight agronomic traits obtained from six different ecologic environments and years, and genotypic information from 477 polymorphic markers on 14 ancestral lines in the pedigree of 'Suinong14'. With in silico mapping, a total of 39 markers distributed on 14 linkage groups are detected as QTL responsible for eight agronomic traits and 10 QTL are identified as having pleiotropic effects. Tracing transmission of functional QTL in the pedigree indicated that certain QTL, such as Sat_036 on linkage group D1a, Satt182 on linkage group L, and Satt726 on linkage group B2 may be responsible for the contribution of exotic germplasm to the improved cultivars. 3aagronomic traits 3adata collection 3alinkage groups 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3asoybeans 0ain silico mapping 0asoybean cultivar 0aancestral line 0aQTL 0atransmission1 aYang, R.Q.1 aJiang, C.X.1 aLi, W.B.1 aLi, Y.H.1 aGuan, R.X.1 aChang, R.Z.1 aQiu, L.J.0 tPlant breeding.g2010 June, v. 129, no. 3 p.235-242dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01719.x 7aarticle02522naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245010000143300001600243500001500259520128300274650001601557650000901573650001201582650002701594650001701621650002101638650001901659650001601678650001301694650000901707650001401716650002101730650001301751650002001764653002001784653001401804653002201818653001601840700001101856700001101867700001401878773007001892852000901962930003301971945001302004946001102017655001202028IND2322639720221121033107.0010821e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232263972DNAL7 a220624352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, K.C.10aCholesterol oxidation products in irradiated raw meat with different packaging and storage time  ap. 431-435.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of irradiation and packaging conditions on the formation of cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) as well as lipid oxidation products was determined in raw turkey leg, beef, and pork loin meat during 7 days of storage. Ground turkey leg, beef, and pork loin muscles were prepared as patties. The patties were individually packaged either in oxygen-permeable or impermeable bags, irradiated at 0 or 4.5 kGy using a Linear Accelerator, and stored at 4 degrees C. The COPs such as 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol were detected in fresh raw meats at 0 day at the level of 10.9 to 49.2 microgram/g lipid. After 7 days of storage, other COPs such as epoxides, 20alpha-hyroxycholesterol, and choletanetriol were formed in mainly aerobically packaged and irradiated raw meats. Packaging effect was more crucial on the cholesterol and lipid oxidation than irradiation. In aerobically packaged and irradiated meats, turkey leg muscles had higher COPs value than beef or pork did. COPs and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values had a strongly positive correlation in turkey leg and pork. But, cholesterol oxidation in beef proceeded in irradiated and aerobically stored samples despite of its low level of TBARS value. 3aturkey meat 3apork 3apatties 3along chain fatty acids 3afood storage 3avacuum packaging 3afood packaging 3acholesterol 3aduration 3abeef 3aoxidation 3afood irradiation 3araw meat 3agamma radiation 0aturkey leg meat 0araw foods 0aaerobic packaging 0aderivatives1 aDu, M.1 aJo, C.1 aAhn, D.U.0 tMeat science.g2001 Aug., v. 58, no. 4 p.431-435x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02257naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009900165300001600264500002400280500001500304520117500319650001501494650002101509650001901530650001401549650001401563650001601577650001701593650001101610650001601621653001001637653002901647653001801676653002201694773009801716852000901814856004801823655001201871IND4398154220221121033227.0071125e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439815422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-007-0159-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDell'Aquila, A.10aPepper seed germination assessed by combined X-radiography and computer-aided imaging analysis  ap. 777-781.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA lot of pepper seeds having 87 % germination were subjected to X-ray inspection using a non lethal dose of radiation. Seeds with less than 2.7 % (on the basis of total seed area) of free space area, i.e. the spaces between embryo and endosperm, were classified as highly viable seeds (97-100 % germination) with the lowest level of abnormal seedlings. Seeds X-ray classified as good were subjected to a computerised image analysis to study seed imbibition and radicle elongation. The patterns of seed area increase, chosen as the most accurate indicator of seed swelling, resembled the triphasic curve of water uptake. The first phase was completed at 9 h followed by a second phase that varied widely in time until completion of germination between 52 and 96 h. The proportion of seeds with radicle protrusion between 52-56 h and 64-72 h assessed with the image analysis was significantly higher than that recorded using a conventional germination test. In addition, the rate of increase of seed area during the third phase of imbibition, mostly due to protrusion of the radicle tip and its growth, was highly correlated with the corresponding radicle elongation rate. 3aimbibition 3aseed germination 3aimage analysis 3aseedlings 3aendosperm 3alethal dose 3awater uptake 3apepper 3aX-radiation 0aseeds 0ainternal seed morphology 0aseed swelling 0aCapsicum annuum L0 tBiologia plantarum.g2007 Dec., v. 51, no. 4 p.777-781dSpringer Netherlandsx0006-31347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10535-007-0159-9 7aarticle02036naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245009300146300001600239500001500255520072300270650000900993650001801002650001401020650002101034650001701055650002001072650001801092650001801110650001001128650001101138650002701149650002001176650002301196650001201219653003001231653000901261653001901270653001001289653001701299653001501316653001801331653001401349700001901363773007001382852000901452930003301461945001301494946001101507655001201518IND2322638920221121033046.0010821e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232263892DNAL7 a220624322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbiola, S.S.10aEffect of substituting pork backfat with rind on quality characteristics of pork sausage  ap. 409-412.  a2019-12-05  aA study was conducted in which pork backfat in pork sausage was replaced with rind at 0, 33, 66 and 100% levels.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients with diabetes and stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) attending clinics in Manchester (U.K.). Patients were classified as either receiving dialysis therapy (dialysis) or not (no dialysis). Foot assessment included diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), prior foot ulceration and amputation, and foot self-care. Risk factors for prevalent foot ulceration were assessed by logistic regression. RESULTS: We studied 326 patients with diabetes and CKD (mean age 64 years; 61% male; 78% type 2 diabetes; 11% prevalent foot ulceration). Compared with no dialysis patients, dialysis patients had a higher prevalence of DPN (79 vs. 65%), PAD (64 vs. 43%), prior amputations (15 vs. 6.4%), prior foot ulceration (32 vs. 20%), and prevalent foot ulceration (21 vs. 5%, all P < 0.05). In univariate analyses, foot ulceration was related to wearing bespoke footwear (odds ratio 5.6 [95% CI 2.5-13]) dialysis treatment (5.1 [2.3-11]), prior foot ulceration (4.8 [2.3-9.8], PAD (2.8 [1.3-6.0], and years of diabetes (1.0 [1.0-1.1], all P < 0.01). In multivariate logistic regression, only dialysis treatment (4.2 [1.7-10], P = 0.002) and prior foot ulceration (3.1 [1.3-7.1], P = 0.008) were associated with prevalent foot ulceration. CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis treatment was independently associated with foot ulceration. Guidelines should highlight dialysis as an important risk factor for foot ulceration requiring intensive foot care.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamputation 3across-sectional studies 3adialysis 3aguidelines 3akidney diseases 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 2aAged 2aDiabetes Mellitusxphysiopathology 2aFemale 2aFoot Ulcerxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aHumans 2aKidney Failure, Chronicxphysiopathology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aRenal Dialysisxadverse effects 2aRisk Factors 3aUnited Kingdom1 aRutter, Martin K.1 aVileikyte, Loretta1 aWaradhana, Ānanda.1 aAsari, Ashwinbhai1 aJameel, Mehreen1 aTahir, Hassan A.1 aLavery, Lawrence A.1 aBoulton, Andrew J.M.0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.1811-1816dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-02553Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02614naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245016900136300001600305500001500321520091900336650002601255650001301281650002101294650001601315650001701331650001701348650002801365650002401393650001801417650002001435650001601455650001401471650002701485650001701512650002301529650002801552650001301580650001301593650001101606650001901617650001301636650003001649651001001679653001901689653002801708653001801736653001901754653001201773700001501785700002301800700002701823700001401850773007001864852000901934930003301943945001301976946001101989655001202000IND2203312620221121022320.0000327e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220331262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez-Fandos, M.E.14aThe influence of manufacturing and drying conditions on the survival and toxinogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus in two Spanish dry sausages (chorizo and salchichon)  ap. 411-419.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of formulation, starter culture and fermentation temperature on growth and synthesis of toxin A (SEA) and TNase by Staphylococcus aureus during fermentation and drying of Spanish chorizo were investigated.

In addition to an already known sensitivity of the instrument to ambient temperature, the laboratory investigations presented in this manuscript revealed a significant influence of the detector’s internal humidity status on its spectral sensitivity. An extreme variation of internal relative humidity from 9 to 70% Hr resulted in a 5% reduction of the instrument’s sensitivity at its maximum in the UVB range, whereas its sensitivity in the UVA range was reduced by more than a factor of 2. Even for a moderate variation of internal relative humidity from 9 to 35% Hr, which might well occur under outdoor conditions, the sensitivity reduction in the UVA range amounted to 40%. Consequences of these results for routine field measurements were estimated by weighting of global solar irradiance spectra with the respective sensitivity functions. At an internal relative humidity of 35% Hr, the detector’s sensitivity to solar UV irradiance was found to be reduced by 13% at 20° solar elevation and by 7% at 60° solar elevation, relative to an internally dry state (9% Hr). During an outdoor observation period of 50 days, the detector’s internal relative humidity gradually increased from 20 to 30% Hr, corresponding to a reduction of sensitivity by about 5% for solar elevations above 20°. Although other biometers showed quantitatively different behaviour, these results lead to the conclusion that long-term consistency of solar light biometer data can only be achieved by careful control of the instrument’s humidity status during field measurements. 3aambient temperature 3adetectors 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation1 aBlumthaler, Mario1 aSchreder, Josef0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2003 Dec. 24, v. 120, no. 1-4 p.39-43dElsevier Science Ltdx0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2003.08.010 7aarticle01825naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245009400146300001600240520073500256650000800991650001700999650002101016650001301037650001101050650001801061650001201079650001301091650001701104651001001121653002401131653002401155653001101179700001801190700001501208700001701223700001501240773007001255852000901325930003301334945001301367946001101380655001201391IND2321847020221121002413.0010701e200106  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232184702DNAL7 a220621132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTejeda, J.F.10aStudy of the branched hydrocarbon fraction of intramuscular lipids from Iberian fresh ham  ap. 175-179.  aBranched hydrocarbons from the unsaponifiable lipid fraction of the Biceps femoris muscle of Iberian pigs were analyzed.

The objective of this research was to add functional proteins from an extract of MDTM to PSE meat to create a value-added pork sausage product. Sausages manufactured from PSE incorporating an MDTM extract exhibited a 30% increase in rigidity (P < 0.05) compared to those manufactured using brine alone. Sausages made from PSE and normal pork with the MDTM extract demonstrated little difference in water holding capacity (P > 0.05), and reductions of 4.1 and 3.1% in cooking loss (P < 0.05), respectively, compared to sausages made employing brine alone. Introducing functional proteins derived from MDTM to processed meat made with PSE pork has the potential to enhance the economic value to both of these low value raw materials. 3aturkey meat 3apork 3amyosin 3acontractile proteins 3asausages 3awater holding capacity 3atexture 3aextracts 0aexudative meat 0abrine 0acooking losses 0amechanically deboned meat 0arigidity 0aactomyosins1 aWick, M.0 tMeat science.g2001 June, v. 58, no. 2 p.189-195x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02002naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245006200151300001600213500001500229520076500244650001901009650000801028650001601036650001401052650001401066650004401080653000901124653003501133653002201168653002201190653003501212653001101247653001101258653001501269653002801284653002601312653002901338653001201367700001701379773007001396852000901466930003301475945001301508946001101521655001201532IND2203312420221120231021.0000327e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220331242DNAL7 a220627032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVestergaard, C.S.10aLipid and cholesterol oxidation products in dry-cured ham  ap. 397-401.  a2019-12-05  aAn investigation was carried out on oxidative processes in dry-cured hams. Sixteen hams of various ageing times were divided into lean and fat parts, simulating typical consumer habits. All samples underwent analysis of peroxide value (PV), rancidity index (TBARs), 5 cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) and, in the lean samples, proximate composition. While the lean part was rather unaffected by oxidation, the external fat contained some of COPs, TBARs and PV. Comparison of hams at different ageing times revealed that lipid oxidation was substantially unaffected by the time of processing. It is concluded that good manufacturing practice will generally prevent oxidative damage in the edible part of dried hams, even if very long ageing times are used. 3aperoxide value 3aham 3acholesterol 3aoxidation 3arancidity 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0alean 0a5alpha,6alpha-epoxycholesterol 0a7-ketocholesterol 0aorganic compounds 0acholesterol oxidation products 0acuring 0alipids 0adry curing 0acholesterol derivatives 0a25-hydroxycholesterol 0a7beta-hydroxycholesterol 0apig fat1 aParolari, G.0 tMeat science.g1999 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.397-401x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02855naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002600155245014800181300001600329500002400345520090500369650002001274650002901294650001801323650001601341650001201357650001201369650001301381650002501394650001601419650002601435650001801461650002301479650003601502650006401538650004101602650003901643650002001682650003101702650003001733650002201763650006201785650008701847650002301934650005201957650006502009650002702074650003102101700002102132773008802153852000902241856003902250655001202289IND4404036420221120231030.0080404e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440403642DNAL7 a183278872pmid7 a10.1002/yea.15852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaithatha, Sheetal A.14aThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae CLB5 promoter contains two middle sporulation elements (MSEs) that are differentially regulated during sporulation  ap. 259-272.  aIncludes references  aThe B-type cyclins Clb5 and Clb6 are essential activators of DNA replication during sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The expression of CLB5 is maximally induced during the middle phase of sporulation by the transcription factor Ndt80. We have performed an analysis of the CLB5 promoter and have identified two middle sporulation elements (MSEs) that act as binding sites for Ndt80. Although both MSE sequences bind Ndt80 in vitro, they display differential effectiveness in their ability to function as cis-acting regulatory sequences in vivo. Mutation of both MSE sequences in the CLB5 promoter profoundly reduces the induction of CLB5 transcription during the middle phase of sporulation but results in no obvious defect in progression through meiosis and sporulation, implying that the Ndt80-dependent induction of CLB5 is not required for effective DNA replication or chromosome division. 3aDNA replication 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abinding sites 3achromosomes 3acyclins 3ameiosis 3amutation 3aregulatory sequences 3asporulation 3atranscription factors 2aBase Sequence 2aConserved Sequence 2aCyclin Bxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Reporter 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aResponse Elements 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSpores, Fungalxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aTranscription Factorsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTranscriptional Activation1 aStuart, David T.0 tYeast.g2008 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.259-272dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1585 7aarticle02211naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010300127300001600230500001500246520092700261650001401188650001501202650001101217650001001228650001701238650001301255650001301268650001101281650001001292650001801302650001301320650001401333650002001347650001301367653001901380653001401399653000901413653001601422653001801438653001101456653001501467653001001482700001701492700001701509700001901526773007001545852000901615930003301624945001301657946001101670655001201681IND2203311820221120231112.0000327e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220331182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhanda, J.S.14aThe infulence of goat genotype on the production of Capretto and Chevon carcasses. 2.

Age had no significant influence on cooking loss and sensory scores. 3ajuiciness 3acrossbreds 3aSaanen 3agoats 3ameat quality 3acrossing 3abody fat 3aflavor 3acolor 3awater content 3agenotype 3agoat meat 3aanimal breeding 3apigments 0acooking losses 0afat color 0aBoer 0agoat breeds 0aacceptability 0aangora 0atenderness 0ashear1 aTaylor, D.G.1 aMurray, P.J.1 aMcCosker, J.E.0 tMeat science.g1999 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.363-367x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02589naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245012500146300001600271500001500287520123400302650002101536650001401557650002401571650001101595650001001606650001901616650001301635650002001648650001801668650001301686650001801699650001101717650001501728650002001743653001901763653001101782653001301793653000901806653001101815653002001826653002401846700001701870700001901887700001701906773007001923852000901993930003302002945001302035946001102048655001202059IND2203311720221120230856.0000327e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220331172DNAL7 a220626962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhanda, J.S.14aThe influence of goat genotype on the production of Capretto and Chevon carcasses. 1.

BS and SF kids had significantly better average daily gain compared to other genotypes and took less time to reach the required liveweight for Capretto and Chevon production. The development of visceral organs was not influenced by genotype. Kids from dairy breeds (SA in case of Capretto and SF in case of the Chevon group) deposited more internal fat in comparison to other genotypes. Dressing percentage (based on empty body weight) of kids ranged from 50-55%. At the same liveweight, dressing percentage and eye muscle dimensions did not vary between genotypes. However, BS and SF kids produced longer carcasses. Subcutaneous fat thickness was significantly greater in Chevon carcasses from BA compared to other genotypes. A high correlation was found between fat thickness measured by ultrasound on the live animal and ruler measurement on the carcass at the 12/13th rib position. Based on growth and carcass characteristics BS and SF kids performed better than kids from other genotypes used in the present study. 3asubcutaneous fat 3ahistology 3adressing percentage 3aSaanen 3agoats 3acarcass weight 3acrossing 3aliveweight gain 3aanimal organs 3agenotype 3afat thickness 3alength 3acrossbreds 3aanimal breeding 0ameat carcasses 0agrowth 0abody fat 0aBoer 0aangora 0aeye muscle area 0acarcass composition1 aTaylor, D.G.1 aMcCosker, J.E.1 aMurray, P.J.0 tMeat science.g1999 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.355-361x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01484naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245013600170300001500306500002400321520048700345650002400832650001300856650000900869650001000878650002200888650001600910651001100926651002800937773013900965852000901104856005701113655001201170IND4456017720221120220251.0110408e196007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445601772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1960.tb02114.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWYLIE, H.G.10aSome factors that affect the annual cycle of the winter moth, operophtera brumata (l.)

It is based on the use of DLVO theory to estimate the electrostatic interactions between the charged surface of the ion-exchanger and the proteins. The corresponding charge distributions were evaluated as a function of pH and salt concentration using a molecular approach. The model was verified for the adsorption equilibrium of lysozyme, chymotrypsinogen A and four industrial monoclonal antibodies on two strong cation-exchangers. The adsorption equilibrium constants of these proteins were determined experimentally at various pH values and salt concentrations and the model was fitted with a good agreement using three adjustable parameters for each protein in the whole range of experimental conditions. Despite the simplifications of the model regarding the geometry of the protein-ion-exchanger system, the physical meaning of the parameters was retained. 3aadsorption 3achymotrypsinogen 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aion exchange chromatography 3alysozyme 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apH 3aproteins 3asalt concentration1 aStröhlein, Guido1 aLattuada, Marco1 aMorbidelli, Massimo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2010 Aug. 27, v. 1217, no. 35 p.5610-5621dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2010.06.0643Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02220naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008100127300001400208500011900222500001500341520124600356650001301602650001201615650002301627650001401650650002701664650002101691653002101712653002301733773008301756852000901839939003301848946001301881655001201894IND9300655120221120180238.0930201e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930065512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRalphs, M.H.10aContinued food aversion: training livestock to avoid eating poisonous plants  ap. 46-51.  aPaper presented at the "Symposium on Ingestion of Poisonous Plants by Livestock," February 15, 1990, Reno, Nevada.  a2019-12-05  aAnimals can be trained to avoid eating specific foods by offering them the food and subsequently administering an emetic to induce nausea. The animal associates the taste of the food with the induced illness and subsequently avoids eating that food. Conditioned food aversion (CFA) is a potential tool to prevent livestock poisoning from palatable and abundant poisonous plants. Cattle have been trained to avoid eating tall larkspur (Delphinium barbeyi L. Huth), a particularly troublesome poisonous plant. However, several factors influence the acquisition and retention of food aversions under field grazing conditions. The age and sex of an animal may influence its ability to form and retain aversions. Novelty of the plant and the intensity of the induced illness determine the strength of the aversion. Social facilitation or peer pressure motivates animals to sample the averted food, and the aversion will extinguish if it is not reinforced. Generalizing the aversion created under controlled conditions in a pen, to a complex vegetation community in the field, may be difficult for some animals. If these obstacles can be overcome, CFA may be an effective tool to reduce the risk of poisoning on poisonous plant infested rangeland. 3alearning 3agrazing 3aDelphinium barbeyi 3alivestock 3aavoidance conditioning 3apoisonous plants 0afeeding behavior 0atraining (animals)0 tJournal of range management.g1992 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.46-51x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03521naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002900171245008300200300001600283500002400299520166400323650002601987650001602013650001902029650001502048650002202063650001002085650001802095650001902113650001102132650001202143650002202155650002602177650001302203650002002216650002502236650001402261650001902275650003702294650002702331650005002358650001102408650002202419650001402441650003302455650003902488700002102527700002002548700002102568700002102589700002002610700002302630700002102653700001602674700001902690773011002709852000902819856005502828655001202883IND4450632920221120180344.0110311e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445063292DNAL7 a207231342pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-7652.2010.00552.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüttner-Mainik, Annette10aProduction of biologically active recombinant human factor H in Physcomitrella  ap. 373-383.  aIncludes references  aThe human complement regulatory serum protein factor H (FH) is a promising future biopharmaceutical. Defects in the gene encoding FH are associated with human diseases like severe kidney and retinal disorders in the form of atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis II (MPGN II) or age-related macular degeneration (AMD). There is a current need to apply intact full-length FH for the therapy of patients with congenital or acquired defects of this protein. Application of purified or recombinant FH (rFH) to these patients is an important and promising approach for the treatment of these diseases. However, neither protein purified from plasma of healthy individuals nor recombinant protein is currently available on the market. Here, we report the first stable expression of the full-length human FH cDNA and the subsequent production of this glycoprotein in a plant system. The moss Physcomitrella patens perfectly suits the requirements for the production of complex biopharmaceuticals as this eukaryotic system not only offers an outstanding genetical accessibility, but moreover, proteins can be produced safely in scalable photobioreactors without the need for animal-derived medium compounds. Transgenic moss lines were created, which express the human FH cDNA and target the recombinant protein to the culture supernatant via a moss-derived secretion signal. Correct processing of the signal peptide and integrity of the moss-produced rFH were verified via peptide mapping by mass spectrometry. Ultimately, we show that the rFH displays complement regulatory activity comparable to FH purified from plasma. 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3abioreactors 3ablood proteins 3acomplement 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amass spectrometry 3amosses and liverworts 3apatients 3apeptide mapping 3arecombinant proteins 3asecretion 3asignal peptide 2aBryopsidaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aComplement Factor Hxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPhenotype 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis1 aParsons, Juliana1 aJérôme, Hanna1 aHartmann, Andrea1 aLamer, Stephanie1 aSchaaf, Andreas1 aSchlosser, Andreas1 aZipfel, Peter F.1 aReski, Ralf1 aDecker, Eva L.0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2011 Apr., v. 9, no. 3 p.373-383dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-76447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2010.00552.x 7aarticle02804naa a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100006500115245010800180300001600288500005700304500003600361520012200397650001300519650001400532653003500546653003500581653003600616653003200652653003100684653002500715653003500740653003000775653003200805653003500837653003200872653003500904653003200939653003400971653002801005653003101033653003101064653003201095653003201127653003301159653003001192653003001222653003701252653003101289653003101320653003701351653003501388653002901423653003201452653002901484653003001513653003101543653003101574653002601605653002901631653003001660653003401690653003601724653003401760653003701794653003201831653003101863773007901894852000901973939003301982945000802015946001102023655001202034991599942980742620221120180151.0830720e198303  xx |||||o|||||||||||rus||7 aPAR830063672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebedev, V.I.

To help prevent coronary artery disease (CAD), it may he useful to understand risk factors during childhood and adolescence. In the present study, we evaluated low density lipoprotein particle size (LDL-size) by 2-16% gradient gel electrophoresis in 70 healthy children (30 boys and 40 girls) along with conventional lipid and lipoprotein parameters which are thought to affect LDL-size. The fractional and molar esterification rates (FER and MER) of cholesterol in plasma and HDL were also determined. As expected, plasma levels of TG, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apoA-I were closely associated with LDL sizes in both sexes (boys: r = -0.694, 0.708 and 0.701, girls: r = -0.579, 0.551 and 0.539, P < 0.001). However, a closer association was found between FER in HDL (FERHDL) and LDL-size (boys: r = -0.874, girls: r = -0.642, P < 0.001). In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, FERHDL alone accounted for 76% and 41% of the variability in LDL-size in boys and girls, respectively. MER in HDL accounted for additional 4% and 19% in boys and girls, respectively. Other parameters, including plasma TG, HDL-C and apoA-I had no significant additional effects. Thus, the determination of FERHDL is useful to predict the particle size of LDL in children. 3aadolescents 2aAdolescent 2aApolipoproteinsxblood 2aChild 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCoronary Diseasexbloodxenzymology. 2aEsterification 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoprotein(a)xanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aLipoproteins, LDLxblood 2aMale 2aParticle Size 2aPhosphatidylcholine-Sterol O-Acyltransferasexblood 2aProtein Precursorsxblood 2aRisk Factors1 aKakiuti, Y.1 aKurahara, K.1 aSaku, K.1 aNagata, N.1 aMatsuda, I.0 tJournal of lipid research.g1997 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.139-146x0022-22757nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle01979naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245011600132300001600248520112400264650002601388650001801414650001601432650002301448650001601471650001301487650002101500653001601521773008501537852000901622939003301631946001301664655001201677IND9300651620221120154140.0930201e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930065162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnsen, T.N.

Little] killed by tebuthiuron are not known, causing concern about potential residues and their release into the environment from decaying plants or burning wood. Utah juniper trees killed by tebuthiuron at 3 north-central Arizona locations were assayed for tebuthiuron and its metabolites by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection. Foliage, twigs, stems, and litter from recently killed trees averaged 13.3 +/- 0.4, 0.4 +/- 0.1, 0.4 +/- 0.1, and 4.0 +/- 6.6 mg/kg of tebuthiuron plus its metabolites, respectively. Dead stems averaged 0.5 +/- 0.4 mg/kg in sapwood, 0.1 +/- 0.1 mg/kg in heartwood, and 0.4 +/- 0.7 mg/kg in bark, 3 to 9 years after application. Root bark averaged 1.1 +/- 1.9 mg/kg, and root wood averaged 0.5 +/- 1.4 mg/kg. Although long lived, these small tebuthiuron residues should have little potential environmental harm if treated Utah juniper wood is used as firewood or fence posts. 3aJuniperus osteosperma 3abrush control 3atebuthiuron 3aherbicide residues 3ametabolites 3aduration 3aapplication rate 0apersistence0 tJournal of range management.g1992 Mar., v. 45, no. 2 p.167-170x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02598naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245014900144300001600293500001500309520119300324650002701517650001701544650001701561650002601578650001601604650001601620650001601636650004101652650001601693650001601709650003801725650003901763650001101802650002901813650000901842653000901851653003501860653004001895653001801935653001201953773008301965852000902048930003302057945001302090946001302103655001202116IND2054886620221120154141.0970114e199502  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205488662DNAL7 a77518222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuane, W.C.10aSerum lathosterol levels in human subjects reflect changes in whole body cholesterol synthesis induced by lovastatin but not dietary cholesterol  ap. 343-348.  a2019-12-05  aWe measured serum lathosterol levels and whole body cholesterol synthesis by sterol balance in 12 human subjects on a metabolic ward in four randomly allocated, 6-7 week periods: 1) lovastatin (40 mg b.i.d) + low cholesterol diet (mean 246 mg/day); 2) lovastatin + high cholesterol diet (mean 1071 mg/day); 3) low cholesterol diet alone; and 4) high cholesterol diet alone. Whole body cholesterol synthesis was significantly reduced both by lovastatin (P= 0.0004) and by high dietary cholesterol (P= 0.0005). Serum total lathosterol (micrograms/dl) was reduced by lovastatin (P < 0.0001), but was not significantly altered (and actually tended to increase) during consumption of the high cholesterol diet, presumably because eggs contained appreciable lathosterol as demonstrated by direct analysis. Results were similar for total versus free lathosterol and for lathosterol expressed as microgram/dl serum versus micrograms/100 mg cholesterol. We conclude that serum lathosterol does not reflect changes in cholesterol synthesis induced by dietary cholesterol. Studies using serum lathosterol as an indicator of cholesterol synthesis must be carefully controlled for dietary cholesterol. 3acholesterol metabolism 3adrug therapy 3abiosynthesis 3adiet study techniques 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3ameasurement 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3ametabolites 2aBiomarkers. 2aCholesterolxbiosynthesisxblood. 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aLovastatinxpharmacology 2aMale 0adiet 0a5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol 0ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase 0aintermediates 0asterols0 tJournal of lipid research.g1995 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.343-348x0022-22757nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02777naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005800125300001600183500001500199520138500214650002501599650001701624650002401641650001101665650001901676650002001695650001101715650001501726650001601741650002001757650002001777650001201797650001101809650002301820650002501843650002301868650001601891651001501907653000801922653001101930653002301941653001201964653001901976700001901995700001802014700001802032700001702050700001602067773008502083852000902168939003302177946001302210655001202223IND9300650820221120154059.0930201e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930065082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArthun, D.10aForb and shrub influences on steer nitrogen retention  ap. 133-136.  a2019-12-05  aTwo experiments with steers were conducted to evaluate the influence of native forbs and shrubs on nitrogen utilization by cattle. Diets in Exp. 1 were blue grams (Bouteloua gracilis [H.B.K.])(BG), BG plus 23% alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay (ALF), BG plus 42% forbs and BG plus 41% shrubs. Diets in Exp. 2 included barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) straw, and straw plus either 42% ALF, 63% forbs, or 62% shrubs. Forbs used in our study were scarlet globemallow (Sphaeralcea coccinea Nutt.) and leatherleaf croton (Croton pottsii Lam.). Shrubs included fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens [Pursh.]) and mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus Raf.) Forb and shrub mixtures were 50:50 of each species. Blue grams and straw basal diets contained 7.6 and 3.5% CP, respectively. Diets containing ALF, forbs, and shrubs were isonitrogenous (10.5% CP) in both experiments. In Exp. 1, no differences (P>.10) were observed among treatments for N retention (g/d). In Exp. 2, N retention was least (P<.05) for the straw diet, greatest for the ALF and shrub diets (P>.05), and intermediate for the forb diet. Inclusion of forbs or shrubs with low-quality forage diets was, in most instances, comparable to inclusion of ALF. Our results indicate that maintaining palatable forbs and shrubs on rangelands should reduce the need to supply cattle with protein during periods when grasses are dormant. 3aCercocarpus montanus 3abarley straw 3anitrogen metabolism 3ashrubs 3acattle feeding 3aHordeum vulgare 3aCroton 3arangelands 3abeef cattle 3aMedicago sativa 3anutritive value 3aalfalfa 3asteers 3aBouteloua gracilis 3aSphaeralcea coccinea 3aAtriplex canescens 3aalfalfa hay 3aNew Mexico 0ahay 0aforage 0anitrogen retention 0aquality 0acroton pottsii1 aHolechek, J.L.1 aWallace, J.D.1 aGalyean, M.L.1 aCardenas, M.1 aRafique, S.0 tJournal of range management.g1992 Mar., v. 45, no. 2 p.133-136x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02722naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245009000190300001300280500002400293500001500317520131300332650001501645650001401660650001401674650001201688650001501700650001501715650001601730650001001746650001701756650001101773650001201784650001701796650004901813650001101862650001801873650004801891650003801939653001901977700001501996700001702011700002202028773011402050852000902164856005502173655001202228IND4414947320221120144414.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441494732DNAL7 a189836222pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0264.2008.00894.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKäßmeyer, S.10aNew Insights in Vascular Development: Vasculogenesis and Endothelial Progenitor Cells  ap. 1-11.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the course of new blood vessel formation, two different processes - vasculogenesis and angiogenesis - have to be distinguished. The term vasculogenesis describes the de novo emergence of a vascular network by endothelial progenitors, whereas angiogenesis corresponds to the generation of vessels by sprouting from pre-existing capillaries. Until recently, it was thought that vasculogenesis is restricted to the prenatal period. During the last decade, one of the most fascinating innovations in the field of vascular biology was the discovery of endothelial progenitor cells and vasculogenesis in the adult. This review aims at introducing the concept of adult vasculogenesis and discusses the efforts to identify and characterize adult endothelial progenitors. The different sources of adult endothelial progenitors like haematopoietic stem cells, myeloid cells, multipotent progenitors of the bone marrow, side population cells and tissue-residing pluripotent stem cells are considered. Moreover, a survey of cellular and molecular control mechanisms of vasculogenesis is presented. Recent advances in research on endothelial progenitors exert a strong impact on many different disciplines and provide the knowledge for functional concepts in basic fields like anatomy, histology as well as embryology. 3atechnology 3asprouting 3ahistology 3asurveys 3aembryology 3astem cells 3abone marrow 3ablood 3aangiogenesis 3aadults 2aAnimals 2aCell Lineage 2aEndothelium, Vascularxcytologyxembryology. 2aHumans 2aMorphogenesis 2aNeovascularization, Physiologicxphysiology 2aStem Cellsxcytologyxphysiology. 0anew technology1 aPlendl, J.1 aCustodis, P.1 aBahramsoltani, M.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2009 Feb., v. 38, no. 1 p.1-11dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0340-20967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0264.2008.00894.x 7aarticle02051naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245006500160300001600225500002400241520095600265650000801221650001301229650002301242650003001265650003701295650000901332650001801341700001701359700001801376700001601394700001301410700001701423700001601440700001301456773010501469852000901574856008201583655001201665IND4441058420221120144602.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444105842DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2009003732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yingchang12aA developed DNA extraction method for different soil samples  ap. 401-407.  aIncludes references  aFour DNA extraction methods namely SDS-hyperhaline method (I), modified SDS-hyperhaline method (II), indirect method (III), alkaline lysis method (IV) were evaluated by comparing DNA yield, spectrophotometric quality, genomic integrity and PCR suitability in this paper. The results showed that high DNA yields were obtained by method I, II and IV. However, higher quality of DNA was gained by method III and IV. Based on the results of the Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), the completeness of DNA extracted by method IV was the best. About 6.0 μg DNA can be recovered from 1.0 g soil by method IV which involved to lysis cell by SDS and to precipitate impurities by adding potassium acetate and magnesium chloride Therefore, it is confirmed that method IV is a novel, reliable and versatile method for large-scale DNA extraction involving less purification steps for various soil samples.

A specially designed fireproof box was utilized to house and protect the data logger within the center of the burned area. Programming features allowed temperatures to be measured and recorded rapidly (each second) during the passage of the fire front and recorded as 1-minute means before and after the combustion interval. Strategic placement of thermocouples provided time-temperature profiles for various heights above ground, rate of spread, and duration of heat above specific temperatures. Additionally, measurement of preheating prior to the actual flame passage was obtained by placement of the recorder and thermocouples well within the burned area. This technique may provide better quantification of fire effects on vegetation, especially woody weeds targeted for control with fire, by documenting temperature extremes and their duration at critical growing points on plants. 3arangelands 3afires 3aprescribed burning 3ameasurement 3atemperature 3athermocouples 3afire behavior 3aTexas1 aAnsley, R.J.1 aTrevino, B.A.0 tJournal of range management.g1992 Mar., v. 45, no. 2 p.216-220x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01996naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011100164300001600275500002400291520107100315650001301386650001201399650001301411650003101424650002601455650002201481700002301503773011101526852000901637856004801646655001201694IND4405533920080606232358.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440553392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-007-0767-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaters, Marion10aAnalysis of coumarin in various foods using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection  ap. 637-642.  aIncludes references  aRecently authorities and the media have published reports of increased coumarin levels in Christmas biscuits, gingerbread, cinnamon cookies and other foods. The maximum tolerance limits for coumarin in food are set out in EC Directive 88/388/ECC. Since the standard use of analytical techniques, such as HPLC-UV, are only limitedly suitable for verifying compliance with the regulatory limit of 2 mg/kg for coumarin in food, a selective, sensitive isotope dilution LC-MS/MS method for determining coumarin content in foods was developed, tested and validated, and the results then compared to the HPLC-UV method. This LC-MS/MS method increased selectivity and raised sensitivity by a factor of 100 compared to the HPLC-UV technique. The respective limits of determination and quantification for the method were 0.03 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively, with an RSD of 1-8% and a linearity range of 0.1-500 ng/mL (corresponding to 0.05-250 mg/kg in food). In addition, a selection of around 500 food samples was also tested for coumarin content using the LC-MS/MS technique. 3abiscuits 3acookies 3acoumarin 3aisotope dilution technique 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry1 aMatissek, Reinhard0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2008 June, v. 227, no. 2 p.637-642dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-007-0767-9 7aarticle02162naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005600126300001200182500011900194520117300313650001101486650001001497650002101507650001101528650001301539650002001552650003201572651002601604653001101630700001801641700001701659773008101676852000901757939003301766946001301799655001201812IND9300654420221120144554.0930201e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930065442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, L.F.10aImpact of poisonous plant on the livestock industry  ap. 3-8.  aPaper presented at the "Symposium on Ingestion of Poisonous Plants by Livestock," February 15, 1990, Reno, Nevada.  aLivestock poisoning by plants is one of the serious causes of economic loss to the livestock industry. Losses can be classified as either direct or indirect. Direct losses include deaths, weight loss, abortions, lengthened calving intervals, decreased efficiency and other effects on the animals. Losses from death and some reproductive losses in the 17 western states are estimated at $340,000,000. In addition to these are the indirect losses such as fencing, herding, supplemental feeding, medical costs, management alterations, and loss of forage which are associated with efforts to prevent or minimize poisoning of livestock by plants. Nearly all plant communities include poisonous plants, thus most grazing animals are exposed to intoxication. However, the presence of these plants does not cause poisoning. Poisoning is usually associated with management errors, lack of forage due to range conditions, drought, and other events that would cause livestock to consume vegetation normally unacceptable. Often a sequence of events, such as storm, frost, cold, and other occurrences can influence an animal to where it will eat too much of a toxic plant too fast. 3acattle 3asheep 3apoisonous plants 3aforage 3atoxicity 3aeconomic impact 3alivestock and meat industry 3aWestern United States 0alosses1 aNielsen, D.B.1 aPanter, K.E.0 tJournal of range management.g1992 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.3-8x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03193naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245006300143300001800206500001500224520165700239650001801896650001101914650001601925650003001941650002701971650002001998650003002018650001202048650002302060650001402083650001602097650001502113650002702128650002102155650002802176650004002204650000902244650003002253650004202283650003202325650003302357653003202390653001502422700001302437700001802450700001702468773008602485852000902571930003302580945001302613946001302626655001202639IND2038902320221120144446.0940419e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203890232DNAL7 a82634202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoo, J.C.10aExpression of hormone-sensitive lipase mRNA in macrophages  ap. 1969-1974.  a2019-12-05  aMacrophages contain a neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase that can be activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Immunological studies strongly suggest that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is probably responsible for the cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity in macrophages; however, due to the very low level of expression in macrophages, it has been difficult to determine whether the macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolase and adipose HSL are, in fact, products of the same gene. We have used the sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to demonstrate expression of HSL mRNA in resident and thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages, as well as in the P388D(1) mouse macrophage cell line. PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primer sequences present on adjacent exons of the mouse HSL gene to allow discrimination between products derived from HSL mRNA or genomic DNA sequences; specificity of the PCR was demonstrated by the absence of a product in liver, which does not express HSL mRNA. Northern blot analysis of poly A)+ RNA from peritoneal macrophages with a mouse adipose HSL cDNA probe demonstrated a low abundance of mRNA of 3.2 kb, identical in size to HSL mRNA in adipose tissue. These findings, together with the results of previous studies demonstrating similarities between HSL and macrophage neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase, strongly support the conclusion that both are products of a single gene. The development of a PCR assay for HSL mRNA may allow further study of the regulation of neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase expression in macrophages and foam cells, and its potential role in atherogenesis. 3amessenger RNA 3ahumans 3amacrophages 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3agene expression 2aAdipose Tissuexchemistry 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCell Line 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA Probes 2aHormonesxpharmacology 2aLipasexgenetics 2aMacrophagesxmetabolism 2aMacrophages, Peritonealxmetabolism 2aMice 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSterol Esterasexmetabolism 2aThioglycolatesxpharmacology 0acholesteryl ester hydrolase 0ahydrolases1 aReue, K.1 aSteinberg, D.1 aSchotz, M.C.0 tJournal of lipid research.g1993 Nov., v. 34, no. 11 p.1969-1974x0022-22757nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03133naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245016700169300001600336500002400352520170900376650002302085650002802108650002002136650001902156650002302175650001902198650001002217650001302227650003102240650001002271650001802281650001902299650002702318650001402345650001902359650001302378650001402391700002002405700001502425700001502440700001502455700001802470773009902488852000902587856005502596655001202651IND4450180420221120144530.0110304e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445018042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02373.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWichmann, F.10aPhenotypic and molecular genetic characterization indicate no major race-specific interactions between Xanthomonas translucens pv. graminis and Lolium multiflorum  ap. 314-324.  aIncludes references  aBacterial wilt of forage grasses, caused by the pathogen Xanthomonas translucens pv. graminis (Xtg), is a major disease of forage grasses such as Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum). The plant genotype-bacterial isolate interaction was analysed to elucidate the existence of race-specific responses and to assist the identification of plant disease resistance genes. In a greenhouse experiment, 62 selected plant genotypes were artificially inoculated with six different bacterial isolates. Significant differences in resistance were observed among L. multiflorum genotypes (P < 0·001) and in virulence (intensity of disease symptoms) among Xtg isolates (P < 0·001) using the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). No significant genotype-isolate interaction (P > 0·05) could be observed using linear regression modelling. However, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction effects (ammi) analysis revealed five genotypes which did not cluster close to the origin of the biplot, indicating specific interactions between these genotypes and some bacterial isolates. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to identify marker-resistance associations using the same plant genotypes and bacterial isolates. The SSR marker NFA027 located on linkage group (LG) 5 was significantly associated with bacterial wilt resistance across all six bacterial isolates and explained up to 37·4% of the total variance of AUDPC values. Neither the inoculation experiment nor the SSR analyses revealed major host genotype-pathogen isolate interactions, thus suggesting that Xtg resistance, observed so far, is effective across a broad range of different bacterial isolates and plant genotypes. 3aLolium multiflorum 3aXanthomonas translucens 3aadditive effect 3abacterial wilt 3adisease resistance 3aforage grasses 3agenes 3agenotype 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahosts 3alinear models 3alinkage groups 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3aplant taxonomy 3avariance 3avirulence1 aMüller Hug, B.1 aWidmer, F.1 aBoller, B.1 aStuder, B.1 aKölliker, R.0 tPlant pathology.g2011 Apr., v. 60, no. 2 p.314-324dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02373.x 7aarticle04534naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001700162245013200179300001800311500002400329520202800353650001302381650001802394650002002412650002502432650001402457650001802471650003402489650001102523650000802534650002602542650001302568650002202581650002402603650000902627650002002636650001002656650001002666650000902676650002502685650006402710650002602774650007202800650001102872650007302883650001102956650001402967650006102981650000903042650002603051650001603077650005603093650006103149650007003210650002403280650006303304650000903367651001903376651001103395651003303406700001903439700002103458700002403479700002503503700001803528773013803546852000903684856008303693655001203776IND4457051720221120134212.0110423e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445705172DNAL7 a214301122pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.111.0123772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoh, Yet Hua10aN-nitroso compounds and cancer incidence: the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk Study  ap. 1053-1061.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Humans are exposed to preformed N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) and endogenous NOCs. Several NOCs are potential human carcinogens, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), but evidence from population studies is inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation between dietary NOCs (NDMA), the endogenous NOC index, and dietary nitrite and cancer incidence in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk, United Kingdom, study. DESIGN: This was a prospective study of 23,363 men and women, aged 40-79 y, who were recruited in 1993-1997 and followed up to 2008. The baseline diet was assessed with food-frequency questionnaires. RESULTS: There were 3268 incident cancers after a mean follow-up of 11.4 y. Dietary NDMA intake was significantly associated with increased cancer risk in men and women [hazard ratio (HR): 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.27; P for trend = 0.03] and in men (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.44; P for trend = 0.005) when the highest quartile was compared with the lowest quartile in age- and sex-adjusted analyses but not in multivariate analyses (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.24; HR for men: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.40; P for trend ≥ 0.05). When continuously analyzed, NDMA was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28), specifically of rectal cancer (HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.84) per 1-SD increase after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, cigarette smoking status, alcohol intake, energy intake, physical activity, education, and menopausal status (in women). The endogenous NOC index and dietary nitrite were not significantly associated with cancer risk. There was a significant interaction between plasma vitamin C concentrations and dietary NDMA intake on cancer incidence (P for interaction < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary NOC (NDMA) was associated with a higher gastrointestinal cancer incidence, specifically of rectal cancer. Plasma vitamin C may modify the relation between NDMA exposure and cancer risk. 3aalcohols 3aascorbic acid 3abody mass index 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahumans 3amen 3amultivariate analysis 3anitrites 3aphysical activity 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3asmoking (habit) 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAscorbic Acidxblood 2aCarcinogensxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aDietxadverse effects 2aDimethylnitrosaminexadministration & dosagexmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Neoplasmsxbloodxchemically inducedxepidemiology. 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aIron, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aMale 2aMeatxadverse effects 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasmsxbloodxchemically inducedxepidemiology. 2aNitritesxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aNitroso Compoundsxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aProspective Studies 2aRectal Neoplasmsxbloodxchemically inducedxepidemiology. 2aRisk 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEurope 0aGreat Britainxepidemiology.1 aJakszyn, Paula1 aLuben, Robert N.1 aMulligan, Angela A.1 aMitrou, Panagiota N.1 aKhaw, Kay-Tee0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2011 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1053-1061dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.0123773Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02334naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245008400174300001600258500002400274520131800298650002301616650000901639650001201648650002301660650001101683650001201694650002401706650001501730650001901745700002301764773014301787852000901930856005701939655001201996IND4456144920221120124359.0110408e198111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445614492DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1981.tb03102.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSPRADBERY, J.P.10aOosorption during ovarian development in the screw-worm fly, chrysomya bezziana  ap. 209-214.  aIncludes references  aThe majority of wild and laboratory-reared Chrysomya bezziana Villeneuve (Diptera: Calliphoridae) are autogenous, maturing their ovaries during the first ovarian cycle in the absence of external sources of protein. Very few females mature all their oocytes however, resorption occurring in approximately 30% of oocytes if protein is not available and 10% when protein is ingested. Protein-fed flies produce larger eggs than protein-deprived ones. Females which are underfed as larvae are small and anautogenous, requiring external sources of protein to mature their ovaries. Protein-fed autogenous and anautogenous females mature a similar proportion of oocytes. During the second and subsequent ovarian cycles C. bezziana females are physiologically anautogenous although ad lib. protein feeding during the first ovarian cycle results in most females reaching an early stage of vitellogenesis in the second ovarian cycle. Protein-deprived females cease second cycle development in a previtellogenic stage. When females are given access ad lib. to protein, approximately 16% fewer oocytes are matured in the second and subsequent ovarian cycles than in the first cycle. Oosorption occurs during the early stages of vitellogenesis (stages IV-VI) and follows a similar temporal pattern in successive ovarian cycles. 3aChrysomya bezziana 3aeggs 3afemales 3alaboratory rearing 3alarvae 3aoocytes 3aovarian development 3aresorption 3avitellogenesis1 aSCHWEIZER, GERHILT0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1981, v. 30, no. 3 p.209-214dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw30952wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1981.tb03102.x 7aarticle02086naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245005500195300001600250500002400266520104400290650001501334650001101349650001501360650002501375653002401400653001701424653002201441653001901463653002601482700001901508773010801527852000901635856009201644655001201736IND4441494720221120093751.0100820s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444149472DNAL7 a215650932pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02873.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaggiotti, Oscar E.10aQuantifying population structure using the F-model  ap. 821-830.  aIncludes references  aWe review a model-based approach to estimate local population FST's that is based on the multinomial-Dirichlet distribution, the so-called F-model. As opposed to the standard method of estimating a single FST value, this approach takes into account the fact that in most if not all realistic situations, local populations differ in their effective sizes and migration rates. Therefore, the use of this approach can help better describe the genetic structure of populations. Despite this obvious advantage, this method has remained largely underutilized by molecular ecologists. Thus, the objective of this review is to foster its use for studying the genetic structure of metapopulations. We present the derivation of the Bayesian formulation for the estimation of population-specific FST's based on the multinomial-Dirichlet distribution. We describe several recent applications of the F-model and present the results of a small simulation study that explains how the F-model can help better describe the genetic structure of populations. 3aecologists 3amodels 3apopulation 3apopulation structure 0aBayesian statistics 0aF-statistics 0agenetic structure 0ametapopulation 0amultinomial-Dirichlet1 aFOLL, MATTHIEU0 tMolecular ecology notes.g2010 Sept., v. 10, no. 5 p.821-830dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1755-09987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02873.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03365naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245019200149300001600341500001500357520177800372650001302150650001202163650001702175650001702192650002002209650001402229650002602243650002302269650001002292650002002302650002202322650001102344650002002355650001902375650002302394650000902417650002602426650000902452650001002461650001802471653001702489653001802506653001602524653002502540653002202565653003102587700001702618700001602635773007002651852000902721930003302730945001302763946001102776655001202787IND2207720720221120093613.0001109e200002  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220772072DNAL7 a220606142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVestergaard, M.10aInfluence of feeding intensity, grazing and finishing feeding on muscle fibre characteristics and meat colour of semitendinosus, longissimus dorsi and supraspinatus muscles of young bulls  ap. 177-185.  a2019-12-05  aForty-one autumn-born Friesian bull calves were allocated to two production systems (Extensive = "E" and Intensive = "I". In the E-system, animals were loose-housed and fed a roughage-based diet from October to May, followed by a grazing period from May to October. Ten animals were slaughtered directly from pasture (360 kg BW) and 11 after a 10-week finishing feeding in tie-stalls (460 kg). E-bulls were compared with intensively fed tie-stall housed young bulls (I) slaughtered at comparable weights (360 kg, n=11 and 460 kg, n=9). Semitendinosus (ST), longissimus dorsi (LD), and supraspinatus (SU) muscles were analysed histochemically, and the meat analysed for colour and pigmentation. In LD and SU, Type I % was higher in E- compared with I-bulls (P<0.05-0.006). In ST and LD, Type IIA % was higher in E- compared with I-bulls (P<0.01-0.009). As a result, Type IIB % was lower in all three muscles in E-compared with I-bulls (P<0.05-0.001). In E-compared with I-bulls, Type IIA and IIB fibre areas were larger in ST (P<0.05-0.03) and capillarization was higher in both ST and LD (P<0.001). In all three muscles, the activity of citrate synthase was higher (P<0.07-0.001) and that of lactate dehydrogenase lower (P<0.003-0.001) in E- compared with I-bulls. E-bulls had lower glycogen content than I-bulls in ST and LD at 360 kg, but higher at 460 kg following finishing feeding (P<0.008-0.001). Meat colour (lightness) was darker (P<0.001) and pigmentation was higher (P<0.001) in ST and LD of E- compared with I-bulls, with no effects in SU. In conclusion, histochemically different muscles respond differently to changes in the production system, and differences between the extensive and the intensive production system were narrowed after the finishing feeding. 3aglycogen 3agrazing 3aconcentrates 3apigmentation 3askeletal muscle 3afinishing 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aintensive forestry 3abulls 3aoxo-acid-lyases 3amuscle physiology 3acalves 3aenzyme activity 3ahistochemistry 3arestricted feeding 3aarea 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3abeef 3acolor 3amuscle fibers 0abull feeding 0afeeding level 0acapillaries 0aextensive production 0acapillary density 0amuscle metabolic potential1 aOksbjerg, N.1 aHenckel, P.0 tMeat science.g2000 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.177-185x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01800naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011300166300001600279500002400295520091000319650000901229650001601238650001301254650002101267650001101288700002401299700002301323773009501346852000901441856004801450655001201498IND4433074020221120093756.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443307402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-009-9256-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLayman, Craig A.10aLinking fish colonization rates and water level change in littoral habitats of a Venezuelan floodplain river  ap. 269-273.  aIncludes references  aChange in water level during the annual hydrologic cycle of tropical floodplain rivers results in continuous disassembly and reassembly of faunal communities in littoral habitat patches. As such, the rate of water level change should influence colonization rates of vagile organisms among habitat patches. We experimentally tested this hypothesis in a Venezuela floodplain river using artificial rocky patches as sampling units, water level change as the independent variable, and total number of individual fish that colonized a patch as the response variable. Water level significantly affected the total number of individuals that colonized patch habitats, i.e., rapidly receding waters were associated with higher colonization rates. Results suggest that water-level recession directly affects community assembly by influencing the rate at which individuals abandon and colonize local habitat patches. 3afish 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3ahydrologic cycle 3arivers1 aMontaña, Carmen G.1 aAllgeier, Jacob E.0 tAquatic ecology.g2010 Mar., v. 44, no. 1 p.269-273dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-25887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9256-5 7aarticle02281naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245009300144300001400237500001500251520097200266650000901238650002101247650001201268650001601280650001901296650001101315650002601326650001001352650000901362650000701371650002601378650001001404650002701414650001501441650001801456653002401474653001701498653001101515653001201526653001301538653001001551700001701561700002101578700001701599773006901616852000901685930003301694945001301727946001101740655001201751IND2203974020221120082845.0000420e199909  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220397402DNAL7 a220629322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChin, K.B.10aUtilization of soy protein isolate and konjac blends in a low-fat bologna (model system)  ap. 45-57.  a2019-12-05  aLow-fat bologna formulations (LFBMS, <2.0% fat) were manufactured in a model system with two levels (0.5 or 1%) of two konjac blends (KB; KSS = konjac flour/starch and KNC = konjac flour/carrageenan/starch), and three levels (0, 2.2, 4.4%, DWB) of prehydrated soy protein isolate (SPI) to replace 0, 2 and 4% of the meat protein, respectively.

Low-fat (10%) hot-processed (HP) and cold-processed (CP) beef were ground either through a 0.32 or 0.40 cm plate. A 20% fat CP product was also manufactured through a 0.32 cm plate. HP patties had higher pH, shorter sarcomere lengths, higher tenderness scores (including greater number of smaller particles during chewing) lower shear force values, higher flavor scores, less well-done cooked color, longer cooking times and higher cooking yields than CP patties (p < 0.01). The use of a 0.32 cm rather than a 0.40 cm plate improved tenderness properties, especially for HP patties. Other properties were not greatly influenced by grind size. Sensory evaluation and scanning imagery of patties suggested that the greater tenderness of hot processed patties may be due to the presence of smaller meat particles. Highly contracted muscle, providing resistance to grinding, could be responsible for the small meat particles. 3ajuiciness 3ahot boning 3asarcomeres 3aground beef 3ameat quality 3aflavor 3acolor 3apH 3ahamburgers 3awater holding capacity 3alength 3afrying 0acold boning 0afat 0asize 0atenderness 0ameat grinding size 0asensory properties 0afood processing 0ashear 0aboning1 aBigner-George, M.E.1 aEastridge, J.S.0 tMeat science.g1999 Sept., v. 53, no. 1 p.37-43x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02574naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245009800171300001400269520136400283650001501647650001001662650001201672650002001684650001201704650002501716650001501741650001701756650001701773650001401790650002001804650001401824653002101838653001901859653002001878773011901898852000902017856009202026930003302118946001302151655001202164IND4417637720221120072712.0090313e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441763772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7410.2008.00153.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirose, Euichi10aAscidian tunic cells: morphology and functional diversity of free cells outside the epidermis  ap. 83-96.  aTunic cells are free cells distributed in the tunic, the integumentary matrix of tunicates. In ascidians, various types of tunic cells have been described both in solitary and in colonial species. Many of them are functionally specialized and are related to the protection of the animal, such as phagocytosis to prevent infection, acid storage to avoid predation, and pigmentation to protect against solar radiation. While some tunic cells are known to play a role in colonial allorecognition, bioluminescence, and algal symbiosis, the functional roles of many cell types still remain to be determined. The composition of tunic-cell types varies among ascidian species, most likely reflecting the functional requirements of the tunic in each species. Although some cell types, e.g., tunic net cells and tunic bladder cells, are restricted to particular taxa of ascidians, tunic phagocytes are found in all known ascidians. Therefore, tunic phagocytes are hypothesized to be basal and shared with ancestral tunicates. In some ascidians, phagocytic cells are involved in other functions, such as pigmentation, intracellular photosymbiosis, and bioluminescence. These specialized phagocytic cells are hypothesized to be derived from tunic phagocytes, suggesting that tunic cells have a high potential to diversify and evolve a wide variety of cellular functions. 3aAscidiacea 3aalgae 3aanimals 3abioluminescence 3abladder 3afunctional diversity 3aphagocytes 3aphagocytosis 3apigmentation 3apredation 3asolar radiation 3asymbiosis 0achemical defense 0aphotosymbiosis 0aallorecognition0 tInvertebrate biology.g2009 Winter, v. 128, no. 1 p.83-96dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1077-83067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7410.2008.00153.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100825b20100903c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03023naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245016600161300001600327500001500343520162000358650002801978650001302006650001102019650002302030650001402053650001702067650002302084650001402107650002602121650002902147650002802176650001902204650001302223650001102236650002502247651001102272653001402283700001802297700001802315700001602333773010202349852000902451930003302460945002502493946001102518655001202529IND4365333620221120072532.0041101e20041101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436533362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Common sources of infection are undercooked chicken meat, unpasteurized milk and contaminated drinking water. One aim with our present study was to identify the species Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains from humans and chickens using a polymerase chain reaction/restriction enzyme analysis (PCR/REA) method, as well as traditional hippurate hydrolysis test. Another aim was to investigate the antibiotic resistance pattern of the human domestic C. jejuni/C. coli isolates from infected patients and isolates from healthy Swedish chicken, as well as isolates from humans infected abroad. If discrimination between C. jejuni and C. coli was based on testing for hippurate hydrolysis, 95% of the human domestic strains and 88% of the chicken strains were identified as C. jejuni. Based on genotyping by PCR/REA, 100% of the human domestic strains and 98% of the chicken strains were attributed to C. jejuni. The E-test and disc diffusion methods were used for phenotypic antibiotic resistance studies. The two methods gave similar results. Most Swedish C. jejuni/C. coli isolates both from humans and chickens were sensitive to doxycycline and erythromycin, which are antibiotics used to treat human infection. Only 7% of the human domestic strains and 2% of the chicken strains were resistant to the quinolones tested. As a comparison, more than 94% of strains isolated from travelers to Asia and southern Europe showed antibiotic resistance to one or more drugs. 3abacterial contamination 3adiarrhea 3ahumans 3aCampylobacter coli 3aphenotype 3achicken meat 3afood contamination 3aserotypes 3aantibiotic resistance 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogen identification 3afood pathogens 3agenotype 3acloaca 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aSweden 0aisolation1 aEngvall, E.O.1 aAndersson, L.1 aKaijser, B.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2004 Nov. 1, v. 96, no. 2 p.173-179x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20041115b20041201c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/11/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03065naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245007700170300001800247500002400265500001500289520183100304650001702135650002202152650001402174650001802188650001702206650001102223650001502234650000902249650001802258650000902276650000902285650001302294650002702307650002102334650002702355653001402382700001802396700002002414773012102434852000902555856005502564655001202619IND4460329020221120072526.0110722e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446032902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4530.2009.00533.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLIN, SHIH-BIN10aPhysical characteristics of surimi and bacterial cellulose composite gel  ap. 1363-1379.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, bacterial cellulose (BC) which has high water-absorption-ability was added to dolphin-fish (mahi-mahi) surimi to assess the characteristics of composites gels. Twelve days of Gluconacetobacter xylinum (BCRC12335) fermentation decreased the pH of this medium from 4.0 to 3.6, with nata growth on the surface reaching a thickness oSf about 0.7 cm. Alkali treatment altered BC structure, creating a dense and porous network. This alkali-treated nata (AT-nata) exhibited high water-holding capacity. The critical water content (CWC) of rigidity for mahi-mahi surimi was around 80% and, when surimi water content exceeded the CWC, we found a remarkable decrease in both rigidity and gel strength of the heated surimi. The addition of 5% AT-nata improved the gel strength of the 80% water content heated surimi predominantly by enhancing its breaking force. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In traditional Chinese-style fish balls, a certain amount of lard is typically added to give heated surimi products a smoother mouth-feel. In consideration of healthfulness and enhanced gelation properties, plant gums and cellulose gels are now frequently used as lard replacements in surimi products. In this study, bacterial cellulose, which has high water-absorption ability, was added to mahi-mahi surimi to assess the characteristics of composites gels. The surimi to which alkali-treated nata was added demonstrated characteristics of a phase-separated network mix gel model. The addition of an appropriate level (5% or less) of nata did not diminishing surimi gel gelation properties. The application of nata as a fat replacement and additional dietary fiber source in processed surimi-based products appears feasible. These results make nata a potentially competitive “high-fiber-low-fat” healthy surimi product emulsifier. 3agel strength 3aGluconacetobacter 3amouthfeel 3adietary fiber 3afermentation 3asurimi 3aplant gums 3agels 3awater content 3alard 3afish 3agelation 3awater holding capacity 3aalkali treatment 3acarboxymethylcellulose 0acellulose1 aCHEN, LI-CHEN1 aCHEN, HUI-HUANG0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2011 Aug., v. 34, no. 4 p.1363-1379dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2009.00533.x 7aarticle02242naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245010000141300001600241520092400257650001401181650001801195650003101213650002501244650001001269650002701279650002301306650002601329650001501355650002101370650003701391650002001428650003701448650001901485650000701504650001601511653002201527700001401549700001501563700001401578773010201592852000901694930003301703945002501736946001101761655001201772IND4365333520221120072647.0041101e20041101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436533352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Addition of 20 IU/ml caused a 4 log unit decrease in S. thermophilus counts of a culture not exposed previously to nisin, whereas no decrease was observed in the culture exposed to nisin for 2 h. Transfer of immunity genes as responsible for nisin resistance was discarded. The presence of extracellular or intracellular specific nisin-degrading enzymes was not detected in the nisin-resistant variant of S. thermophilus INIA 463. Nisin resistance was caused by the induction of a resistance mechanism. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the nisin-resistant variant of S. thermophilus INIA 463 had a thickened cell wall compared to the wild strain. Resistance to nisin was lost after one transfer (4 h growth) in nisin-free skim milk. 3askim milk 3aculture media 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3alactic acid bacteria 3anisin 3aantibacterial proteins 3ainduced resistance 3aresistance mechanisms 3acell walls 3amicrobial growth 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aenzyme activity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3apH 3aplate count 0anisinase activity1 aAvila, M.1 aMedina, M.1 aNunez, M.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2004 Nov. 1, v. 96, no. 2 p.165-172x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20041115b20041201c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/11/12  aNon-US 7aarticle04494naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245011900166300001600285500002400301520302500325650001603350650002603366650001603392650001903408650002503427650002003452650001203472650002903484650001503513650002903528650001603557650002203573650001303595650001403608650001503622650003603637650001903673650001703692650001903709650003803728650001003766650001103776650001203787700001403799773011103813852000903924856005503933655001203988IND4383306720221120072504.0060903e199906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438330672DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00386.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSTITT, M.14aThe interaction between elevated carbon dioxide and nitrogen nutrition: the physiological and molecular background  ap. 583-621.  aIncludes references  aAGPase, ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase GS, glutamine synthetase GOGAT, glutamate : oxoglutarate amino transferase NADP-ICDH, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase NR, nitrate reductase OPPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway 3PGA, glycerate-3-phosphate PEPCase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase SPS, sucrose phosphate-synthase This review first summarizes the numerous studies that have described the interaction between the nitrogen supply and the response of photosynthesis, metabolism and growth to elevated [CO₂]. The initial stimulation of photosynthesis in elevated [CO₂] is often followed by a decline of photosynthesis, that is typically accompanied by a decrease of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), an accumulation of carbohydrate especially starch, and a decrease of the nitrogen concentration in the plant. These changes are particularly marked when the nitrogen supply is low, whereas when the nitrogen supply is adequate there is no acclimation of photosynthesis, no major decrease in the internal concentration of nitrogen or the levels of nitrogen metabolites, and growth is stimulated markedly. Second, emerging evidence is discussed that signals derived from nitrate and nitrogen metabolites such as glutamine act to regulate the expression of genes involved in nitrate and ammonium uptake and assimilation, organic acid synthesis and starch accumulation, to modulate the sugar-mediated repression of the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, and to modulate whole plant events including shoot-root allocation, root architecture and flowering. Third, increased rates of growth in elevated [CO₂] will require higher rates of inorganic nitrogen uptake and assimilation. Recent evidence is discussed that an increased supply of sugars can increase the rates of nitrate and ammonium uptake and assimilation, the synthesis of organic acid acceptors, and the synthesis of amino acids. Fourth, interpretation of experiments in elevated [CO₂] requires that the nitrogen status of the plants is monitored. The suitability of different criteria to assess the plant nitrogen status is critically discussed. Finally the review returns to experiments with elevated [CO₂] and discusses the following topics: is, and if so how, are nitrate and ammonium uptake and metabolism stimulated in elevated [CO₂], and does the result depend on the nitrogen supply? Is acclimation of photosynthesis the result of sugar-mediated repression of gene expression, end-product feedback of photosynthesis, nitrogen-induced senescence, or ontogenetic drift? Is the accumulation of starch a passive response to increased carbohydrate formation, or is it triggered by changes in the nutrient status? How do changes in sugar production and inorganic nitrogen assimilation interact in different conditions and at different stages of the life history to determine the response of whole plant growth and allocation to elevated [CO₂]? 3aacclimation 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aamino acids 3acarbon dioxide 3adevelopmental stages 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutamates 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3ametabolites 3anitrate reductase 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aphosphates 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aplant response 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aroots 3astarch 3asucrose1 aKRAPP, A.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g1999 June, v. 22, no. 6 p.583-621dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00386.x 7aarticle03286naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002200161245013200183300001400315520192200329650000902251650001102260650002002271650001502291650001502306650001902321650002502340650002902365650001802394650001902412650001902431650002802450650002302478650001802501650002202519650001402541650001602555650003702571700001802608773010002626852000902726930003302735945002502768946001102793655001202804IND4368201320221120062931.0050405e20041201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436820132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

It was found to be effective against all the test organisms with Gram positive strains being more sensitive than Gram negative strains. Significant differences (P<0.01) were found among the bacteria and between the non-neutralized and neutralized extracts with non-neutralized being more effective against all the bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract for each bacterial strain was studied by a gradient plate method. Among the Gram positive organisms, Bacillus species (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus thuringiensis) were found to be the most sensitive showing MICs of 0.25-0.32% (after 24 h incubation) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (0.49%), while Listeria monocytogenes was found to be the least sensitive demonstrating a MIC of 0.67%. Of the Gram negative organisms, Salmonella enteritidis was found to be the most resistant with a MIC of 0.67% followed by Escherichia coli Type I, E. coli O157:H7, Proteus vulgaris and Hafnia alvei having MICs of 0.63%, 0.60%, 0.55% and 0.45%, respectively; whereas Citrobacter freundii was found to be the least resistant surviving up to 0.42%. Some loss of antimicrobial activity was, however, observed after incubation for 3 days. Bacteriostatic/bactericidal effects of sumac, as studied by enumerating survival by the viable count technique after 1 h direct contact of each microorganism with various concentrations of sumac extract, revealed a 4-5 log cycle reduction in Bacillus spp. and 2-3 log cycle reduction in other bacteria tested with 1.0% sumac extract. 3aRhus 3aspices 3aspecialty crops 3aflavorings 3acondiments 3aplant extracts 3achemical composition 3aantibacterial properties 3afood spoilage 3amicroorganisms 3afood pathogens 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3aculture media 3apathogen survival 3aviability 3aplate count 3aminimum inhibitory concentration1 aHalkman, A.K.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2004 Dec. 1, v. 97, no. 1 p.63-69x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20050816b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/14  aNon-US 7aarticle01230naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245014900134300001900283500002500302520003500327650001200362650001400374651001000388653003100398653003100429653002300460653006200483653002600545653002700571653003000598653003000628700001500658700001700673773009300690852000900783939003300792945000800825946001100833655001200844991599931910742620221120062941.0830913e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830081612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalhotra, S.K.10aHimalaya pauriensis gen. et sp. nov., as a representative of the family Himalayidae nov. with a revised definition of the order Anoplocephalidea  ap. 211-217 (p.  aSummary in Japanese.  aphylogeny of tapeworms revised 3aCestoda 3aevolution 3aIndia 0aAnoplocephalidae (Cestoda) 0aAnoplocephalidea (Cestoda) 0aHimalaya (Cestoda) 0aHimalaya pauriensis (Cestoda)Oryctolagus cuniculus (Host) 0aHimalayidae (Cestoda) 0aLinstowiidae (Cestoda) 0aThysanosomiidae (Cestoda) 0aTriplotaeniidae (Cestoda)1 aSawada, I.1 aCapoor, V.N.0 tJapanese journal of parasitology.g1983 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.211-217 (px0021-51717nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830913c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01378naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245009400130300001900224500005700243500003700300520035900337650002900696653001700725653002000742653001600762653002400778653001600802653002500818700001500843700001600858773009300874852000900967939003300976945000801009946001101017655001201028991599931360742620221120045823.0830913e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||jpn||7 aPAR830081522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNogami, S.10aMigration of adult worms of Dipetalonema viteae subcutaneously transplanted into the jird  ap. 137-142 (p.  aTitle in original language could not be transcribed.  aIn Japanese; Summary in English.  aDipetalonema viteae, susceptibility of Meriones unguiculatus to infection and recovery ratio of adult worms age- and sex-dependent, location of recovery sites, subcutaneous transplantation failed to concentrate adult worms at definite local region, concluded that subcutaneous transplantation provided little advantage for macrofilaricide screening tests 3aAcanthocheilonema viteae 0alocalization 0atransplantation 0aAge of host 0aMigration, Nematoda 0aSex of host 0aTechnique, Treatment1 aTanaka, H.1 aMatsuda, H.0 tJapanese journal of parasitology.g1983 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.137-142 (px0021-51717nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830913c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03638naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001300161245007900174300001600253500001500269520204500284650001802329650001902347650005902366650001602425650002602441650002602467650003002493650003702523650001102560650002202571650001902593650001802612650001802630650002302648650001602671650001802687650003802705650005402743650000702797650003102804653002202835653001402857700001602871700001702887773010202904852000903006930003303015945002503048946001103073655001203084IND4367779420221120045851.0050318e20050201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436777942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLind, H.10aAntifungal effect of dairy propionibacteria--contribution of organic acids  ap. 157-165.  a2019-12-05  aLarge amounts of food and feed are lost every year due to spoilage by moulds and yeasts. Biopreservation, i.e. the use of microorganisms as preservatives instead of chemicals, has gained increased interest. Lactic acid bacteria and propionibacteria might be particularly useful due to their important role in many food fermentations. Knowledge of the antifungal effects of the organic acids produced by these bacteria is necessary to understand their inhibitory activity. We evaluated the antifungal activity of the type strains of five dairy propionibacteria, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, P. jensenii, P. thoenii, P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii and P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii against eight food- and feedborne moulds and yeasts. A dual culture system assayed the inhibitory activity on three different agar media, sodium lactate (SL), de Man Rogosa Sharp (MRS) and MRS without acetate (MRS-ac). The amounts of organic acids produced during growth of propionibacteria in liquid SL, MRS and MRS-ac were also determined. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of propionic, acetic and lactic acid were established for all fungi at pH 3, 5 and 7. Propionic acid, followed by acetic acid, was the most potent antifungal acid. Inhibition at pH 7 generally required concentrations above 500 mM for all three acids, at pH 5 the MIC values for propionic and acetic acids were 20-120 mM and above 500 mM for lactic acid. At pH 3, the MIC values were, with one exception, below 10 mM for both propionic and acetic acid and above 160 mM for lactic acid. The yeast Pichia anomala was the fungus most resistant to organic acids. The propionibacteria exhibited a pronounced species variation in antifungal activity on MRS (+/-acetate) agar, with P. thoenii being the most potent. Four of the five propionibacteria species produced more propionic and acetic acid in liquid SL medium than in MRS (+/-acetate) broth. However, when SL agar was used as the growth medium, none of the propionibacteria inhibited fungal growth. 3afood spoilage 3apropionic acid 3aPropionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 3alactic acid 3asecondary metabolites 3aantifungal properties 3aPropionibacterium thoenii 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ayeasts 3afood preservation 3adairy products 3aculture media 3amolds (fungi) 3afood preservatives 3aacetic acid 3abioprocessing 3aPropionibacterium acidipropionici 3aPropionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 3apH 3aPropionibacterium jensenii 0aPropionibacterium 0aisolation1 aJonsson, H.1 aSchnurer, J.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2005 Feb. 1, v. 98, no. 2 p.157-165x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20050815b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03013naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245024700142300001600389500001500405520155000420650002601970650001301996650002802009650002202037650002302059650005202082650001502134650001902149650001002168650002402178650002502202650001402227650002302241653002202264653001402286700001602300700001402316700001702330700001602347773010202363852000902465930003302474945002502507946001102532655001202543IND4367779820221120045735.0050318e20050201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436777982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aScherm, B.10aDetection of transcripts of the aflatoxin genes aflD, aflO, and aflP by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction allows differentiation of aflatoxin-producing and non-producing isolates of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus  ap. 201-210.  a2019-12-05  aThe aim of this study was to test the suitability of the RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) technique to differentiate aflatoxin-producing from aflatoxin-non-producing strains of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Total RNAs of 13 strains grown under inducing yeast extract-sucrose (YES) and non-inducing yeast extract-peptone (YEP) media, respectively, were analyzed by using specific primers based on the conserved regions of nine structural genes (aflD, aflG, aflH, aflI, aflK, aflM, aflO, aflP, and aflQ) and two regulatory genes aflS and aflR of the aflatoxin B1 biosynthetic pathway. Transcription was confirmed by the expression of the beta-tubulin gene. The expression of the majority aflatoxin biosynthetic genes including aflR and aflS of all strains varied with regard to the aflatoxin-producing ability and the growth conditions. Nonetheless, we found that the expression profile of the three genes aflD, aflO, and aflP was consistently correlated with a strain's ability to produce aflatoxins or not in YES as well as the inability to produce aflatoxins in YEP. The devised RT-PCR profiling method reflects aflatoxin concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 60 microgram/ml of the culture filtrates as determined by fluorescence HPLC. The results are discussed in relation to the suitability of RT-PCR as well as cDNA-based array techniques in diagnostic laboratory settings where individual isolates are being tested for potential toxin production to identify toxigenic isolates of Aspergillus species. 3atranscription factors 3amycology 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3atoxigenic strains 3afood contamination 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aaflatoxins 3afood pathogens 3agenes 3amicrobial detection 3anontoxigenic strains 3avirulence 3aAspergillus flavus 0afood microbiology 0aisolation1 aPalomba, M.1 aSerra, D.1 aMarcello, A.1 aMigheli, Q.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2005 Feb. 1, v. 98, no. 2 p.201-210x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20050815b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/04  aNon-US 7aarticle01784naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002500097040001800122100002400140245020900164300001600373500005000389500002300439520043200462650002100894650001400915650001000929650001900939651001200958653002900970653005900999653002901058653005701087700001801144773010001162852000901262856007501271939003301346945000801379946001101387655001201398991599930870742620221120045834.0830902e198004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830079012DNAL7 a10.1139/z80-0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeverley-Burton, M.10aHaplocleidus dispar (Mueller, 1936) and Pterocleidus acer (Mueller, 1936) (Monogenea: Ancyrocephalinae) from Lepomis gibbosus L.

Mold spore germination time and radial growth rates (RGR) were significantly (p<0.05) affected by the variables. For equal antimicrobial concentration, reduction in pH or a(w) had important effects, lowering RGR and delaying germination time. Depending on a(w) and pH, increase in antimicrobial concentration slightly reduced RGR until a critical concentration where RGR was drastically reduced or mold growth was inhibited. Germination time increased as antimicrobial agent concentration increased and when a(w) and pH decreased. Important antimicrobial differences were observed, being, in general, the natural antimicrobials less pH-dependent than chemical preservatives. A. flavus exhibited higher sensitivity to thymol, eugenol, carvacrol, potassium sorbate, sodium bisulfite, and sodium benzoate (at pH 3.5) than to vanillin or citral. 3aculture media 3afood preservatives 3apotassium sorbate 3asodium benzoate 3asodium sulfite 3anatural additives 3acarvacrol 3aeugenol 3avanillin 3acitral 3aantifungal properties 3awater activity 3apH 3aAspergillus flavus 3atoxigenic strains 3afood pathogens 3afood contamination 3amicrobial growth 3aviability 3apathogen survival 3afood preservation1 aAlzamora, S.M.1 aPalou, E.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2005 Mar. 15, v. 99, no. 2 p.119-128x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20080708b20080801c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03214naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245017200168300001800340500002400358520193700382650001102319650001302330650002302343650001902366650001402385650004302399650001202442650002002454650001202474650003702486650002002523650003302543650001102576650001302587700001702600773010202617852000902719856008802728655001202816IND4441757720221120042109.0100827s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444175772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2010.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegro, Scott S.10aHigh-temperature solvent stability of sol-gel germania triblock polymer coatings in capillary microextraction on-line coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography  ap. 5746-5752.  aIncludes references  aGermania-based sol-gel organic-inorganic hybrid coatings were prepared for on-line coupling of capillary microextraction with high-performance liquid chromatography. For this, a germania-based sol-gel precursor, tetra-n-butoxygermane and a hydroxy-terminated triblock copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) were used. These sol-gel germania triblock polymer coatings were chemically anchored to the inner walls of a fused silica capillary (0.25mm I.D.) in course of its evolution from the sol solution. Scanning electron microscopy images of the sol-gel germania triblock polymer coating were obtained to estimate the coating thickness. For the first time, the analyte distribution constants between a sol-gel germania organic-inorganic hybrid coating and the samples (K cs) were determined. For a variety of analytes from different chemical classes, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), ketones, alcohols, phenols and amines, the K cs values ranged from 8.1×10¹ to 5.6×10⁴. Also, for the first time, the stability of the sol-gel germania-based coating in high-temperature reversed-phase solvent environment was evaluated. The sol-gel germania triblock polymer coatings were capable of surviving exposure to high-temperature solvent conditions (200°C) with little change in extraction capabilities. This demonstrates that sol-gel germania triblock polymer hybrid materials might be suitable for further applications in high-temperature HPLC. The reproducibility of the method for preparation of the sol-gel germania triblock polymer coatings was also evaluated, and the capillary-to-capillary RSD values ranged from 5.3 to 6.5%. The use of higher flow rates in extraction was found to significantly reduce the time required (from 30-40 to 10-15min) to reach equilibrium between the sol-gel germania triblock polymer coating and the analytes in the sample solution. 3aamines 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3aethylene oxide 3aevolution 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aketones 3amicroextraction 3aphenols 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apropylene oxide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asolvents1 aMalik, Abdul0 tJournal of chromatography.g2010 Sept. 10, v. 1217, no. 37 p.5746-5752dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2010.07.0383Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02842naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245013700160300001600297500001500313520125900328650001601587650001801603650003001621650001801651650002601669650002301695650002501718650001001743650003001753650001601783650002701799650001501826650001001841650001501851650003701866650002601903650000901929650002901938650003101967653002401998700002302022700001802045700001602063700001302079700001502092773010302107852000902210930003302219945002502252946001102277655001202288IND4367778220221120042251.0050318e20050215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436777822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Two groups of 10 rats were fed with either prebiotics containing fructo-oligosaccharides or probiotics containing viable Bifidobacterium lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. The composition of their caecal microbiota was analyzed both by classical plate count of the main bacterial groups and by PCR amplification of a V3 fragment of 16S rRNA genes and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Both diets induced a significant reduction of clostridia and Bacteroides spp. compared to a control diet, whereas prebiotics were also able to reduce the number of coliforms and to increase the presence of bifidobacteria. DGGE analysis showed a significant increase of 16S rRNA gene fragments in rats fed with either probotics or prebiotics. Nineteen bands were sequenced and most of them showed similarity to cultured bacteria. Detection of Bifidobacterium spp. by this technique using genus-specific primers only permitted these bacteria to be detected in prebiotics-fed rats, whereas the use of Lactobacillus group-specific primers gave similar results in rats fed with any diet, in agreement with the plate count results. 3afood intake 3adietary fiber 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aribosomal RNA 3amicrobial competition 3aexperimental diets 3alactic acid bacteria 3acecum 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aplate count 3afructooligosaccharides 3aprobiotics 3agenes 3aprebiotics 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3amolecular systematics 3arats 3aBifidobacterium animalis 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 0adietary supplements1 aGarcia-Albiach, R.1 aPozuelo, M.J.1 aPintado, C.1 aGoni, I.1 aRotger, R.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2005 Feb. 15, v. 98, no. 3 p.281-289x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20050815b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03150naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245015300155300001800308500002400326520192000350650001702270650001402287650001602301650002502317650001702342650001102359650002002370650003702390650003202427650001402459653001602473700002302489700002702512700002802539773011302567852000902680856007502689655001202764IND4441754220221120042058.0100827s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444175422DNAL7 a10.1071/RD080862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlad, Romina S.10aImmunohistochemical study of the ubiquitin-nuclear factor-ΚB pathway in the endometrium of the baboon (Papio anubis) with and without endometriosis  ap. 1118-1130.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of the present study was to conduct a semiquantitative immunohistochemical investigation into the levels of intermediary proteins within the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway throughout the menstrual cycle in a non-human primate, namely the baboon (Papio anubis), with and without endometriosis. Formalin-fixed eutopic (n = 2-4) and ectopic (n = 6-7) endometrial tissues from baboons at the mid-luteal phase were embedded in paraffin and examined for NF-κB pathway components (i.e. IκB kinase (IKK) α, IKKβ, phosphorylated (phospho-) IκBα and phospho-NF-κB p65 subunit), ubiquitin, 19S proteasome and the NF-κB activator tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Similarly, endometrial tissues from baboons at the late follicular, mid-luteal and menses phase (n = 2-4) were investigated to determine the levels of these proteins throughout the menstrual cycle. Cytoplasmic stromal IKKα and glandular 19S proteasome immunostaining was elevated in the ectopic endometrium, whereas levels of ubiquitin, phospho-p65, IKKβ, TNF-α and nuclear 19S proteasome were similar in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium. A significant decrease in phospho-IκBα nuclear immunostaining was observed within glandular cells of the ectopic endometrium. In the eutopic endometrium, IKKα, ubiquitin and 19S proteasome immunostaining was elevated in different phases of the menstrual cycle, whereas levels of phospho-p65, IKKβ, phospho-IκBα and TNF-α remained unchanged. We have demonstrated that, in the baboon endometriosis model, levels of IKKα immunostaining are elevated, whereas those of phospho-IκBα are reduced, consistent with the hypothesis that excessive NF-κB activity plays a role in reducing ectopic endometrial apoptosis, which contributes to the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Further studies are required to confirm a causal association between elevated IKKα levels and reduced endometrial apoptosis. 3aPapio anubis 3aapoptosis 3aendometrium 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amenstruation 3amodels 3apathophysiology 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aubiquitin 0aIκB kinase1 aFleming, Steven D.1 aMurphy, Christopher R.1 aFazleabas, Asgerally T.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2010, v. 22, no. 7 p.1118-1130dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD080863Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01195naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115242018400139245018500323300001600508500002400524520006100548651001000609653002700619653008600646700002600732773008600758852000900844939003300853945000800886946001100894655001200905991599929850742620221120042139.0830902e198007  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aPAR830078892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuevara Benitez, D.10aMites of the genus Ptilonyssus Berlese and Trouessart, 1889 (Mesostigmata: Rhinonyssidae) parasites of nasal fossa of Spanish Passeriforme.

We have hypothesized that an actin-modifying agent, staurosporine, could be used with fibrochondrocytes to increase the gene expression and synthesis of critical fibrocartilage proteins. A range of concentrations (0.1-100 nM) was applied to fibrochondrocytes in monolayer and evaluated after 24 h and after 4 days. High-dose staurosporine treatment (10-100 nM) increased cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 60- to 500-fold and aggrecan gene expression two-fold. This effective range of staurosporine was then applied to scaffoldless tissue-engineered fibrochondrocyte constructs for 4 weeks. Whereas glycosaminoglycan synthesis was not affected, collagen content doubled, from 27.6 ± 8.8 μg in the untreated constructs to 55.2 ± 12.2 μg per construct with 100 nM treatment. When analyzed for specific collagens, the 10-nM group showed a significant increase in collagen type I content, whereas collagen type II was unaffected. A concomitant dose-dependent reduction was noted in construct contraction, reflecting the actin-disrupting action of staurosporine. Thus, staurosporine increases the gene expression for important matrix proteins and can be used to enhance matrix production and reduce contraction in tissue-engineered fibrocartilage constructs. 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3acollagen 3adose response 3agene expression 3aglycosaminoglycans 3amicrofilaments 3aprotein synthesis 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aChondrocytesxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCollagenxmetabolism 2aExtracellular Matrix Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMale 2aPhalloidinexmetabolism 2aStaining and Labeling 2aStaurosporinexpharmacology 2aTime Factors 2aTissue Engineering 0aTissue engineering 0aFibrocartilage 0aStaurosporine 0aα-Smooth muscle actin 0aFibrochondrocytes1 aAthanasiou, K.

Like human economies, ecosystems are arenas where agents compete for locally limiting resources. Like economies, but unlike genes, ecosystems are not units of selection. In both economies and ecosystems, productivity, diversity of occupations or species and intensity of competition presuppose interdependence among many different agents. In both, competitive dominants need abundant, varied resources, and many agents' products or services, to support the activity and responsiveness needed to maintain dominance. Comparing different-sized land masses suggests that productivity is lower on islands whose area is too small to maintain some of the interdependences that maintain diversity, productivity and competitiveness in mainland ecosystems. Islands lacking the rare, metabolically active dominants that make competition so intense in mainland ecosystems are more easily invaded by introduced exotics. Studies of islets in reservoirs identify mechanisms generating these phenomena. These phenomena suggest how continued fragmentation will affect future 'natural' ecosystems. 3aislands 0afragmentation 0aintensity of herbivory 0aintensity of competition 0adiversity 0aproductivity 0ainterdependence1 aVERMEIJ, G.J.1 aWIKELSKI, M.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2009 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.1-12dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01624.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle04388naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003200110040001800142100001700160245017500177300001800352520255300370650002302923650002602946650002002972650001202992650002003004650001203024650002603036650002203062650003003084650005403114650004603168650002103214650002803235650004603263650003703309650004603346650003203392650004203424653001503466653001503481653001503496700001903511700001503530700002103545773009503566852000903661856008203670930003303752945001303785946001303798990002303811655001203834IND2050285220221120032823.0960312e19950210mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205028522DNAL7 a78523132pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.270.6.25172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, J.C.10aGlycan requirements of glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C from Trypanosoma brucei. Glucosaminylinositol derivatives inhibit phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C  ap. 2517-2524.  aGlycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from Trypanosoma brucei and phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus sp. both cleave glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs). However, phosphatidylinositol, which is efficiently cleaved by PI-PLC, is a very poor substrate for GPI-PLC. We examined GPI-PLC substrate requirements using glycoinositol analogs of GPI components as potential inhibitors. Glucosaminyl(alpha 1 leads to 6)-D-myo-inositol (GlcN (alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins), GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate, GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)-2-deoxyIns, and GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate inhibited GPI-PLC. GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins was as effective as Man(alpha leads to 4)GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins; we surmise that GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins is the crucial glycan motif for GPI-PLC recognition. Inhibition by GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate suggests product inhibition since GPIs cleaved by GPI-PLC possess a GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate at the terminus of the residual glycan. The effectiveness of GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)-2-deoxy-Ins indicates that the D-myo-inositol (Ins) 2-hydroxyl is not required for substrate recognition, although it is probably essential for catalysis. GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)-2-deoxy-L-myo-inositol, unlike GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)2-deoxy-Ins, had no effect on GPI-PLC; hence, GPI-PLC can distinguish between the two enantiomers of Ins. Surprisingly, GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate was not a potent inhibitor of Bacillus cereus PI-PLC, and GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins had no effect on the enzyme. However, both GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins 1-phosphate and GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate were competitive inhibitors of PI-PLC. These observations suggest an important role for a phosphoryl group at the Ins 1-position in PI-PLC recognition of GPIs. Other studies indicate that abstraction of a proton from the Ins 2-hydroxyl is not an early event in PI-PLC cleavage of GPIs. Furthermore, both GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)-2-deoxy-Ins 1-phosphate and GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)-2-deoxy-L-myo inositol inhibited PI-PLC without affecting GPI-PLC. Last, the aminoglycoside G418 stimulated PI-PLC, but had no effect on GPI-PLC. Thus, these enzymes represent mechanistic subclasses of GPI phospholipases C, distinguishable by their sensitivity to GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins derivatives and aminoglycosides. Possible allosteric regulation of PI-PLC by GlcN(alpha 1 leads to 6)Ins analogs is discussed. 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aphosphatidylinositols 3aphospholipase C 3aglucans 3aenzyme activity 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aEnzyme Activation 2aGentamicinsxpharmacology 2aGlycosylphosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase 2aGlycosylphosphatidylinositolsxmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase 2aPhosphoinositide Phospholipase C 2aPhosphoric Diester Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aTrypanosoma brucei bruceixenzymology 0aregulation 0ainhibition 0asubstrates1 aPing-Sheng, L.1 aShen, T.Y.1 aMensa-Wilmot, K.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 Feb. 10, v. 270, no. 6 p.2517-2524x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.270.6.25173Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02000naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002100139245006100160300001800221500001500239520087400254650002501128650001401153650000901167650004301176650001801219650002201237650001501259653002401274653002201298653002801320700001601348773010301364852000901467856007901476930003301555945001301588946001301601655001201614IND2051022720221118181312.0960426e199410  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205102272DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00046a0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZwickenpflug, W.10aSynthesis and occurrence of nitrosated cyanazine in soil  ap. 2333-2337.  a2019-12-04  aIn the course of our studies on the contamination of maize-cultured fields treated with a commercial herbicide formulation containing cyanazine, a more lipophilic species besides the s-triazine itself was observed in HPLC chromatograms of soil extracts. GC-MS analysis suggested it to be a nitrosated cyanazine species. Nitrosation of cyanazine in aqueous media yielded three products. The main product is the mononitroso derivative containing the nitroso group attached to the propanenitrile group. This nitroso derivative coeluted with the unknown compound extracted from soil samples. It was detected in all cyanazine-contaminated soils. The nitrosation of two other well-known s-triazines, atrazine and simazine, yielded three and two products, respectively, which were clearly separated in HPLC from each other as well as from the nitroso derivatives of cyanazine. 3achemical composition 3acyanazine 3asoil 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asoil analysis 3anitroso compounds 3aseparation 0atriazine herbicides 0aoccurance in soil 0anitrosation derivatives1 aRichter, E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1994 Oct., v. 42, no. 10 p.2333-2337x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00046a0483Available from publisher's Web site  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03944naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100002000147245016500167300001800332500002400350500001500374520162600389650000802015650002302023650001002046650002902056650001202085650002302097650001302120650003102133650002202164650002502186650002402211650004802235650001002283650000902293650004102302650004702343650002302390650002402413650002402437650001102461650005602472650005602528650000902584650001602593650000902609653001602618700002302634700002502657700002402682700002002706700002002726700002602746700001802772700002102790700002602811700002502837700002102862700001902883773013002902852000903032856008603041930003303127945002503160946001303185655001203198IND4397751720221118181136.0071111e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439775172DNAL7 a179916592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aVrieling, Alina10aLycopene supplementation elevates circulating insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 and -2 concentrations in persons at greater risk of colorectal cancer  ap. 1456-1462.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Higher circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations have been related to a greater risk of cancer. Lycopene intake is inversely associated with cancer risk, and experimental studies have shown that it may affect the IGF system, possibly through an effect on IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the effect of an 8-wk supplementation with tomato-derived lycopene (30 mg/d) on serum concentrations of total IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3. DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study in 40 men and 31 postmenopausal women with a family history of colorectal cancer, a personal history of colorectal adenoma, or both. RESULTS: Lycopene supplementation significantly (P = 0.01) increased serum IGFBP-1 concentrations in women (median relative difference between serum IGFBP-1 concentrations after lycopene supplementation and after placebo, 21.7%). Serum IGFBP-2 concentrations were higher in both men and women after lycopene supplementation than after placebo, but to a lesser extent (mean relative difference 8.2%; 95% CI: 0.7%, 15.6% in men and 7.8%; 95% CI: -5.0%, 20.6% in women). Total IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 concentrations were not significantly altered by lycopene supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study known to show that lycopene supplementation may increase circulating IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 concentrations. Because of high interindividual variations in IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 effects, these results should be confirmed in larger randomized intervention studies. 3amen 3aat-risk population 3awomen 3anutritional intervention 3aadenoma 3agender differences 3alycopene 3arandomized clinical trials 3ablood circulation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adietary supplements 3ainsulin-like growth factor binding proteins 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosage 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxprevention & control 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aHumans 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1xblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2xblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk 0arisk groups1 aVoskuil, Dorien W.1 aBonfrer, Johannes M.1 aKorse, Catharina M.1 aDoorn, Jaap van1 aCats, Annemieke1 aDepla, Annekatrien C.1 aTimmer, Robin1 aWitteman, Ben J.1 aLeeuwen, Flora E. van1 aVeer, Laura J. van't1 aRookus, Matti A.1 aKampman, Ellen0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 Nov., v. 86, no. 5 p.1456-1462dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/16  aOther US 7aarticle03682naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100001500178245007100193300001800264500002400282500001500306506007600321520171700397506003702114650001702151650002402168650001802192650000802210650001002218650001702228650002502245650002202270650002202292650001002314650000902324650000902333650001102342650002402353650001102377650000902388650001602397650003202413650002402445650001702469653000902486653004102495653002502536700001802561700002002579700003202599700003002631700001702661700002202678773013002700852000902830856008602839930003302925945002502958946001302983655001202996IND4397752620221207144152.0071111e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439775262DNAL7 a179916632pmid7 aPMC22251682pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT300 0aX3801 aGao, Xiang10aProspective study of dietary pattern and risk of Parkinson disease  ap. 1486-1494.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Several studies have shown associations between Parkinson Disease (PD) risk and individual foods and nutrients with inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: We examined associations between dietary patterns and risk of PD in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2002) and the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2000). DESIGN: We included 49 692 men and 81 676 women free of PD at baseline and used principal components analysis to identify major dietary patterns and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed) to assess diet quality. Relative risks (RRs) were computed by using Cox proportional hazards models within each cohort and were pooled by using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We documented 508 new PD cases after 16 y of follow-up. The principal components analysis identified 2 dietary patterns: prudent and Western. The prudent dietary pattern, characterized by high intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fish, was inversely associated with PD risk, but the Western pattern was not. The pooled multivariate-adjusted RR for the top compared with the bottom quintiles of the prudent score was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.07; P for trend = 0.04). For the AHEI, the pooled multivariate-adjusted RR for the top compared with the bottom quintile was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.94; P for trend = 0.01) and for aMED was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.00; P for trend = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns with a high intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, fish, and poultry and a low intake of saturated fat and a moderate intake of alcohol may protect against PD. Benefits of a plant-based dietary pattern including fish to PD merit further investigation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alow fat diet 3aprospective studies 3aeating habits 3amen 3awomen 3arisk factors 3alongitudinal studies 3aplant-based foods 3aParkinson disease 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aParkinson Diseasexetiology 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 0adiet 0aHealth Professionals Follow-Up Study 0aNurses' Health Study1 aChen, Honglei1 aFung, Teresa T.1 aLogroscino, G.q(Giancarlo)1 aSchwarzschild, Michael A.1 aHu, Frank B.1 aAscherio, Alberto0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 Nov., v. 86, no. 5 p.1486-1494dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/16  aOther US 7aarticle04042naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100002100147245016500168300001800333500002400351500001500375520172800390650001302118650001902131650001102150650001902161650001702180650002202197650001502219650001302234650002302247650003402270650001202304650001202316650002002328650001502348650002202363650001502385650001002400650001702410650002002427650003802447650001002485650002102495650001202516650001102528650002202539650001102561650002002572650000902592650001202601650003002613650001402643650002402657650000902681651001202690653002802702653004502730700002202775700002502797700002102822700001902843700003302862700002202895700002302917773013002940852000903070856008603079930003303165945002503198946001303223655001203236IND4397753220221118181435.0071111e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439775322DNAL7 a179916662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aKivimäki, Mika.10aSubstantial intergenerational increases in body mass index are not explained by the fetal overnutrition hypothesis: the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study  ap. 1509-1514.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: According to the fetal overnutrition hypothesis, intrauterine influences of maternal obesity increased lifelong obesity risk in the offspring. If the hypothesis is true, then the association between maternal body mass index (BMI; in kg/m²) and offspring BMI should be stronger than the association between paternal BMI and offspring BMI, because only the mother directly influences the fetal environment. OBJECTIVES: We prospectively examined intergenerational change in BMI and tested the fetal overnutrition hypothesis. DESIGN: Data on offspring weight were obtained from mothers. BMI was assessed from 2980 complete parent-offspring trios when the offspring were 3 to 18 y of age. The assessment of offspring BMI was repeated 21 y later at age 24-39 y. RESULTS: Adult BMI of the offspring was 1.21 units higher than the BMI of their parents at the same age, which indicates an increase in obesity levels across generations (P < 0.0001). Maternal BMI was more strongly associated with offspring birth weight than was paternal BMI (P = 0.0009). However, there were no such differences in parent-offspring associations for BMI at later developmental stages when offspring were aged 3-39 y (P > 0.35). The results did not materially change in a sensitivity analysis for 1% to 15% nonpaternity. CONCLUSIONS: Because offspring share all genes with their parents, the observed substantially higher adult BMI for offspring than for parents is likely explained by environmental influences. No support was found for any specific influence from fetal environment on this intergenerational increase in adult obesity. The findings were consistent with the fetal overnutrition hypothesis only in relation to birth weight. 3aetiology 3aglycemic index 3ahumans 3acohort studies 3arisk factors 3afetal development 3aovereating 3acataract 3amaternal nutrition 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aobesity 3aprogeny 3abody mass index 3aprediction 3adisease incidence 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBirth Weight 2aBody Mass Index 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiology 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFathers 2aFemale 2aFetusxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMale 2aMothers 2aOvernutritionxembryology 2aPregnancy 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk 3aFinland 0aepidemiological studies 0aCardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study1 aLawlor, Debbie A.1 aDavey Smith, George.1 aElovainio, Marko1 aJokela, Markus1 aKeltikangas-Järvinen, Liisa1 aViikari, Jorma SA1 aRaitakari, Olli T.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 Nov., v. 86, no. 5 p.1509-1514dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/16  aOther US 7aarticle02520naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009700163300001600260500001500276520113800291650001601429650002101445650001201466650002201478650002601500650002001526650001201546650002201558650001701580650002801597650001501625650001401640650002201654650002101676650002101697653001401718653001601732653001801748653001301766700001501779773007901794852000901873856008501882930003301967945001302000946001302013655001202026IND2058626220221118181301.0970725s1996    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205862622DNAL7 a10.1080/019041696093651732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurcell, L.C.10aDrought and nitrogen source effects on nitrogen nutrition, seed growth, and yield in soybean  ap. 969-993.  a2019-12-04  aDrought in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] decreases yield-related processes and N2 fixation is more sensitive to drought than are many other of these processes. Therefore, application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer may increase drought tolerance over those plants primarily dependent on N2 fixation. In a field experiment, NH4NO3 applications (+N) to drought-stressed soybean resulted in biomass and N accumulation rates similar to those rates for an irrigated treatment without N fertilizer (-N). In contrast, biomass and N accumulation rates were decreased for the -N treatment. N fertilization increased seed growth rate and decreased seed fill duration for irrigated and drought treatments. In the drought treatment, N application increased seed number per unit area, which resulted in higher yields. In a greenhouse experiment, fertilization with either KNO3 or NH4Cl increased biomass and N accumulation rates during drought over those of plants dependent solely on N2 fixation. It was concluded that application of N fertilizer to soybean increases drought tolerance because of the extreme sensitivity of N2 fixation to drought. 3aGlycine max 3anitrogen content 3aureides 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3adrought 3apotassium nitrate 3awater stress 3adry matter accumulation 3acrop yield 3aacetylene 3aammonium chloride 3aammonium nitrate 3aseed development 0areduction 0aseed weight 0awater deficit 0anitrates1 aKing, C.A.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1996, v. 19, no. 6 p.969-993x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041696093651733Available from publisher's Web site  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02785naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001500163245012600178300001600304500002400320520134400344650001301688650000901701650001101710650001701721650002101738650001201759650001801771650002601789650001401815650001401829650001401843650001801857650001601875650001101891650001401902650001801916651001501934700001601949700001701965700001601982773010601998852000902104856008502113930003302198945002502231946001102256655001202267IND4397801520221118180929.0071111e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439780152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2007.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aBirch, CJ.10aKinetics of leaf extension in maize: Parameterization for two tropically adapted cultivars planted on two dates at Gatton  ap. 215-224.  aIncludes references  aThe kinetics of extension of individual leaves and component laminae and sheaths in maize were studied in two field experiments at Gatton (Australia) using two cultivars, Pioneer 3527 and Pioneer C87, in one experiment and Pioneer C87 only in the second. Destructive sampling based on non-destructive observations to ensure accurate representation of the population was used to establish timing of leaf initiation, leaf tip appearance, ligule being able to be discerned and full extension of organs. The appearance and extension of leaves were related to thermal time, calculated from temperature measured in the region of cell division and extension. Extension of leaves and sheaths was analysed using the first three phases of a four phase framework consisting of two exponential phases, rapid (linear) extension and transition to final organ length. The last phase was not examined as there were insufficient data. Final organ length was related to leaf position, and linear extension rates of leaves and laminae were linearly related to final organ length, with differing equations for upper and lower leaves. The study has proposed extensions to an existing analytical approach, and argues that regular patterns of extension of leaves and sheaths can be explained in relation to the position of the ear using a physiological approach. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3aplant adaptation 3atropics 3aplanting date 3afield experimentation 3acultivars 3aphenology 3aheat sums 3acell division 3acell growth 3alength 3aequations 3amorphogenesis 3aQueensland1 aAndrieu, B.1 aFournier, C.1 aKroesen, C.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2007 Oct., v. 27, no. 2-4 p.215-224dGauthier-Villarsx1161-03017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2007.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03182naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011700128300001400245500001500259520211600274650001802390650001702408650001602425650001102441650001402452650002102466650001202487650002202499650002102521650001802542651001402560653002002574700001102594700001902605773009402624852000902718930003302727945001302760946001102773655001202784IND2321837320221118180920.0010630e200101  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232183732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansour, M.P.14aThe occurrence of trans-18:1 isomers in plasma lipids classes in humans.

Design: After a 2 week baseline (habitual) diet, all subjects consumed a moderate fat (NE) diet for 3 weeks with the fat being derived mainly from margarine and the rest from lean beef, and then a very low fat (VLF) diet for 3 weeks with the TFA being derived only from the lean beef. Blood samples were collected 2 days prior to the end and also on the last day of each dietary period. Setting: Deakin Institute of Human Nutrition, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia. Subjects: Ten free-living mildly hypercholesterolaemic subjects aged 22-66 were recruited in Geelong. Outcome measures: TFA intake was calculated from analyses of Australian margarines, butter, lean meat and animal fat. The TFA in plasma lipid fractions were separated by AgNO3 thin-layer chromatography and quantitated by capillary gas-liquid chromatography using internal standards. Results: The phospholipid (PL) fraction contained more than 60% of the trans-18:1 isomers in the plasma lipids in all subjects. On the baseline diet, the predominant positional isomer of trans-18:1 in PL was delta11, whereas in the other lipid classes it was the delta9 isomer. The concentration of the delta9 isomer increased on the MF diet, particularly in the PL fraction, while the concentration of the delta11 isomer decreased in all fractions. On the VLF diet, the total TFA level decreased by approximately 50%, mainly due to decreases in the TFA isomers in the PL and TG fractions. Changes in plasma total and PL TFA, PL delta9, delta10 and delta11 were strongly correlated with dietary TFA intake (P < 0.0001). There were also significant association between dietary TFA intake and PL delta12 (P=0.003), triacylglycerol delta9 (P=0.009), delta11 (P=0.0005), total triacylglycerol (P=0.023) and free fatty acid TFA (P=0.042). Conclusions: The results suggest that the measurement of trans-18:1 in plasma PL and TAG, and plasma total TFA could be used to estimate the intake of TFA. 3ameat products 3ablood lipids 3adietary fat 3ahumans 3amargarine 3atriacylglycerols 3aisomers 3atrans fatty acids 3alipid metabolism 3aphospholipids 3aAustralia 0ablood chemistry1 aLi, D.1 aSinclair, A.J.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2001 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.59-64x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02800naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013200129300001600261520168700277650001101964650001201975650002001987650001602007650001802023650002002041650001302061650002302074650001302097650002002110650002002130650002002150651001102170653001502181700001602196700001702212773009502229852000902324930003302333945001302366946001102379655001202390IND2201987620221118181005.0991216e199905  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220198762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindroos, A.K.10aDoes degree of obesity influence the validity of reported energy and protein intake? Results from the SOS Dietary Questionnaire  ap. 375-378.  aObjective: To test the validity of a dietary questionnaire which was developed with the particular goal of measuring dietary intake in obese subjects. Design: Reported energy intake was compared with 24 h energy expenditure measured in a chamber for indirect calorimetry (24 EE) and reported nitrogen intake with nitrogen in urine collected during the 24 h in the chamber. Subjects: Twenty-nine overweight men and women, body mass index (BMI) ranging from 25.5-9.5 kg/m(2). Results: Reported energy intake correlated significantly with 24 EE (r = 0.50, P = 0.006) and reported urinary nitrogen correlated significantly with urinary nitrogen excretion (r = 0.56, P = 0.0015). Mean reported energy intake +/- s.d. was 10.2 +/- 3.6 MJ and mean 24 EE +/- s.d. was 10.3 +/- 1.9 MJ. Although this difference was small and non significant, it indicates some underreporting if one can assume that these overweight subjects are less physically active in the chamber than in free-living conditions. Reported nitrogen intake also suggested underreporting at the group level. However, when the data were analysed at the individual level it was clear that the underreporting errors did not increase with increasing degree of obesity. Conclusions: Previous studies with the SOS dietary questionnaire have demonstrated that it is possible to obtain plausible energy intakes from both obese and nonobese subjects. This present analysis further demonstrates that the questionnaire discriminates overweight subjects with high and low intakes of energy and protein, using unbiased biomarkers to judge validity. These data provide additional support for the usefulness of the SOS dietary questionnaire. 3aadults 3aobesity 3adata collection 3afood intake 3aenergy intake 3adietary protein 3avalidity 3aenergy expenditure 3anitrogen 3anutrient intake 3adietary surveys 3aself-perception 3aSweden 0aevaluation1 aLissner, L.1 aSjostrom, L.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1999 May, v. 53, no. 5 p.375-378x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02797naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245014200168300001600310500001500326520143300341650002101774650001901795650001101814650001901825650001801844650002101862650001101883650001201894650002801906650002001934650003601954650001801990650001002008650001902018653001302037653001402050653001102064700002002075773007902095852000902174856008502183930003302268945001302301946001302314655001202327IND2058794020221118181012.0970804s1996    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205879402DNAL7 a10.1080/019041696093651552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd El-Samad, H.M.10aComparative effect of sodium carbonate, sodium sulphate, and sodium chloride on the growth and related metabolic activities of pea plants  ap. 717-728.  a2019-12-04  aOsmotic and specific ion effects are the most frequently mentioned mechanisms by which saline substrates reduce plant growth. However, the relative importance of osmotic and specific ion effect on plant growth seems to vary depending on the salt tolerance of the plant under study. Pea plants grew in Na2SO4 and NaCl treatments up to the -1800 kPa level, but only in the Na2CO3 treatments up to the -1200 kPa level. The higher toxicity of Na2CO3 compared to that of Na2SO4 and NaCl treatments was observed. This point was made clear by their effects on fresh dry matter and water content of the pea plants. The value of osmotic pressure was markedly increased with increasing NaCl concentration in the soil and under the moderate levels of the Na2SO4 treatments, while it was significantly decreased with increasing Na2CO3 concentration. This was also related to the accumulation of soluble saccharides, proteins, amino acids, and prolines in plants treated with NaCl and in plants grown under Na2SO4, with the accumulation of soluble saccharides and proteins observed. The chloride (Cl) and sulphate (SO4) contents accumulated to a greater degree for plants treated with NaCl and Na2SO4, respectively. Thus, these anion accumulations may contribute to the osmotic adjustment for the Cl- and SO4-treated plants. Therefore, the degree of salt tolerance during pea plant growth in NaCO3, NaSO4, or NaCl may not be always the same. 3asodium carbonate 3asalt tolerance 3asugars 3asodium sulfate 3aphytotoxicity 3afree amino acids 3ashoots 3aproline 3adry matter accumulation 3asodium chloride 3achemical constituents of plants 3aPisum sativum 3aroots 3aplant proteins 0asulfates 0achlorides 0agrowth1 aShaddad, M.A.K.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1996, v. 19, no. 5 p.717-728x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041696093651553Available from publisher's Web site  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02064naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001700172245008300189300001600272500002400288520078600312650002001098650001101118650001501129650001501144650001701159650003001176650002201206650001701228650002301245651001001268653002701278700002001305700002001325773011001345852000901455856008501464930003301549945002501582946001101607655001201618IND4397803920221118180931.0071111e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439780392DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797070053522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF140 0aF200 0aF8311 aLockwood, G.10aHeritability of single plant yield and incidence of black pod disease in cocoa  ap. 455-462.  aIncludes references  aBroad sense heritabilities were estimated in three long-term cocoa clone trials in Ghana, with 20, 18 and 15 entries. They were 0.15, 0.05 and 0.15 for yield in pods per plant, and 0.26, 0.19 and 0.40 for incidence of 'bad' pods, mostly due to black pod disease, caused by infection with Phytophthora spp. The low heritability of single plant yield, which has been known for 80 years, has been widely overlooked in cocoa research and extension, compromising the success of clone selection programmes. The heritability of the incidence of black pod disease is high enough to justify mass selection where family level data are not available. The findings will be applied in a new large-scale programme in Ghana to select clones that are high yielding in the presence of P. megakarya. 3aTheobroma cacao 3aclones 3acrop yield 3acocoa pods 3aPhytophthora 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease incidence 3aheritability 3aselection criteria 3aGhana 0aPhytophthora megakarya1 aOwusu-Ansah, F.1 aAdu-Ampomah, Y.0 tExperimental agriculture.g2007 Oct., v. 43, no. 4 p.455-462dCambridge University Pressx0014-47977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797070053523Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/02/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02712naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001500143245010400158300001600262520141300278650001501691650002001706650001701726650001601743650001601759650002801775650001301803650000901816650001701825650001201842650001101854650002501865650004001890650001301930650001701943650002001960650001501980650001001995700001802005773009502023852000902118856008302127939003302210946001102243655001202254IND4464148620221118180901.0120921e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446414862DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBokura, H.10aChitosan decreases total cholesterol in women: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  ap. 721-725.  aBackground: Hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Orally administered chitosan binds lipids in the small intestine and reduces their absorption. Chitosan has been shown to decrease serum cholesterol in animal and human studies. This study investigated the effectiveness of chitosan in reducing serum cholesterol without concomitant diet therapy. Methods: Ninety female volunteers (age 34-70 y) with confirmed mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia were enrolled into the study. They were randomly assigned to receive chitosan (1.2 g per day) or placebo in a double-blind manner. Serum lipids, body weight and adverse events were assessed at baseline and after 28 and 56 days of treatment. Subjects maintained their usual diet and documented the type and gross amount of food consumed. Results: Eighty-four subjects (41 chitosan, 43 placebo) were included in the analysis. Chitosan significantly (F=3.19, P=0.04) reduced total cholesterol compared to placebo. In a subgroup of subjects with over 60 y of age, chitosan group significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol (F=4.21, P=0.02, and F=3.46, P=0.04, respectively) compared with placebo. Adverse effects were few; no serious events were reported. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that chitosan is safe and effective for lowering cholesterol. However, the effect of chitosan for decreasing cholesterol is mild. 3aabsorption 3aadverse effects 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acardiovascular diseases 3achitosan 3adiet 3adiet therapy 3afemales 3ahumans 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aplacebos 3arisk factors 3asmall intestine 3avolunteers 3awomen1 aKobayashi, S.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.721-725x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016033Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120925  aNon-US 7aarticle03375naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001900191245010000210300001400310500002400324500001500348520153300363650001801896650001601914650001901930650000901949650002001958650002401978650001102002650001202013650001202025650003202037650000902069650003202078650003202110650001102142650003202153650003802185650003002223650002402253650005502277650002802332653001402360653001602374700002102390700001802411700001802429700002702447773011202474852000902586856008502595930003302680945002502713946001102738655001202749IND4431432820221118181244.0100115e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443143282DNAL7 a200121892pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-009-9333-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL210 0aL2001 aAjitkumar, G. 10aComparative efficacy of bromocriptine, cabergoline and thyroxine in inducing oestrus in bitches  ap. 65-69.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aForty bitches in anoestrus for more than six months from the last heat, with a serum progesterone level less than 1 ng/ml were subjected to oestrus induction trials using anti-prolactin drugs and levothyroxine, once daily orally for 20 consecutive days.

Silver is a well-known disinfectant that is widely used in the treatment of clinical disease. In this study, we separated bovine mammary gland epithelial cells (BMEC) using an enzyme probe. We also examined safe concentrations for the application of silver ions in bovine mastitis, particularly in cases induced by Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus-derived α-toxins induced cell damage through DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and the dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) in BMEC. Silver ion treatment doses of lower than 2 ppm did not induce BMEC damage, but silver ion concentrations greater than 4 ppm was accompanied by DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, silver ions doses below 2 ppm inhibited α-toxin-induced cell damage through the reduction of ROS generation. Recognizing this, it demonstrate that low doses of silver ions inhibit α-toxin-induced BMEC damage and suggest that silver ions may be a potentially beneficial treatment against bovine mastitis, particularly in cases induced by S. aureus. 3acattle 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abovine mastitis 3amammary glands 3aepithelial cells 3acultured cells 3asilver 3aions 3areactive oxygen species 3aDNA fragmentation 3atoxins 3adosage 0amitochondrial transmembrane1 aKang, Seog-Jin 1 aPark, Sang-Youel 0 tVeterinary research communications.g2010 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.33-42dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-009-9330-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03318naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001900173245008100192300001400273500002400287520140900311650001401720650002001734650002401754650001701778650001801795650003001813650004501843650002201888650002301910650001901933650002401952650002501976650001502001650001702016650006102033650005102094650001202145650001102157650003802168650002702206650001602233650005602249650001902305650002402324650002402348651000902372653002802381700002002409773011202429852000902541856008502550930003302635945002502668946001102693655001202704IND4431432620221118181746.0100115e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443143262DNAL7 a200130502pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-009-9331-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aNoaman, Vahid 12aA new PCR-RFLP method for detection of Anaplasma marginale based on 16S rRNA  ap. 43-50.  aIncludes references  aSpecies of the genus Anaplasma (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) are obligate intracellular tick borne pathogens. Three species of Anaplasma that infect cattle and sheep (A. marginale, A. centrale and A. ovis) are well recognized. Of these erythrocytic Anaplasma, A. marginale can cause diseases in the livestock with high economical losses. Species-specific PCR based on 16S rRNA gene is commonly used for detection of Anaplasma species but can not differentiate A. marginale, A. centrale and A. ovis because of sequence similarity. In this study DNA extraction was performed on 50 blood samples with presence of Anaplasma spp. in marginal point of erythrocytes in their blood smears. The extracted DNA from blood cells was analyzed by PCR and PCR-RFLP using primers derived from 16S rRNA gene and restriction endonuclease Bst1107 I. The restriction endonuclease Bst1107I only recognizes the sequence (GTATAC) in corresponding PCR product of A. marginale and cut it. The nucleotide sequence of the A. marginale 16S rRNA gene was determined and compared with the sequences of A. marginale in GenBank. The 16S rRNA of A. marginale in Iran was completely similar to the related sequence deposited in GenBank at accession number of M60313. In the present study we propose a new PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) method based on 16S rRNA gene for specific detection of A. marginale. 3alivestock 3aanimal diseases 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aanaplasmosis 3aribosomal RNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3adisease detection 3amicrobial genetics 3ablood sampling 3arestriction mapping 3anucleotide sequences 3agene banks 3aerythrocytes 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysisxmethods 2aAnaplasmaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDNA Restriction Enzymesxgenetics 2aErythrocytesxvirology 2aGenes, rRNA 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Lengthxgenetics 2aRNA, Bacterial 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16S 2aSpecies Specificity 3aIran 0amolecular sequence data1 aShayan, Parviz 0 tVeterinary research communications.g2010 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.43-50dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-009-9331-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03231naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001100135245022200146300001600368500002400384520181600408650001702224650001702241650001702258650002002275650001802295650001002313650002102323650001502344650002302359650001502382650001202397650001602409650000902425650001102434650002502445650002402470650001302494651001002507700001302517700001202530700001102542700001302553700001202566773011202578852000902690856003802699655001202737IND4437851720221118180428.0100528e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443785172DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.9742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Y.10aAgrobiodiversity loss and livelihood vulnerability as a consequence of converting from subsistence farming systems to commercial plantation-dominated systems in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China: A household level analysis  ap. 274-284.  aIncludes references  aProduction of rice (Oryza sativa) under a shifting cultivation system (swidden rice) and paddy fields (wet rice) is an important livelihood strategy in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China where households are facing conversion from subsistence systems to commercial plantation-dominated systems represented by smallholder rubber plantations. However, there are few studies of the effects on rice production and varieties diversity, as well as livelihood effects at a household level during this conversion. This paper presents a household level analysis of agrobiodiversity loss and food security, as well as livelihood vulnerability during agroecosystems' conversion in Xishuangbanna. First, a quantitative assessment was made of the statistical data for rice and rubber production during the past 50 years in Xishuangbanna and at a village level from 1985 to 2005 for three villages from the valley floor and upland hills, respectively. Second, at a household level, 60 per cent of households from the three villages were investigated with a questionnaire from 1998 to 2005. The process of transformation has led to significant changes in the household's income and its proportion. Meanwhile, households have suffered livelihood vulnerability from excessive rubber plantations. The centrality of rice in Southeast Asian agricultural and social systems, contrasted with the significant erosion of rice-based agroecosystem of local households, calls for increased attention to the livelihood vulnerability during this conversion. Correspondingly, practical strategies to resolve livelihood vulnerability are proposed, such as construction of paddy and effective irrigation systems for food security, agroforestry systems in rubber plantation, instead of monoculture, and diversification of sources of household income. 3aOryza sativa 3aagroforestry 3abiodiversity 3acrop production 3afood security 3ahills 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3airrigation systems 3alivelihood 3apaddies 3aplantations 3arice 3arubber 3ashifting cultivation 3asubsistence farming 3avillages 3aChina1 aChen, J.1 aGuo, H.1 aHu, H.1 aChen, A.1 aCui, J.0 tLand degradation & development.g2010 May, v. 21, no. 3 p.274-284dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1085-32787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.974 7aarticle02846naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012900185300001800314500002400332520101400356650001801370650001001388650001401398650001201412650001301424650002701437650001001464650000901474650001601483650001201499650001401511650001501525650001201540650001801552650001201570650002801582650002301610650003701633650003301670650003401703650002101737650002001758650003701778650001701815650001301832650003701845650002001882650002301902650001301925650001401938700002601952700001901978700002001997700002402017773011002041852000902151856004802160655001202208IND4442581020221118175759.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444258102DNAL7 a205637902pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-010-1376-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüttner, Bianca12aA survey of EMS-induced biennial Beta vulgaris mutants reveals a novel bolting locus which is unlinked to the bolting gene B  ap. 1117-1131.  aIncludes references  aBeta vulgaris is a facultative perennial species which exhibits large intraspecific variation in vernalization requirement and includes cultivated biennial forms such as the sugar beet. Vernalization requirement is under the genetic control of the bolting locus B on chromosome II. Previously, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis of an annual accession had yielded several mutants which require vernalization to bolt and behave as biennials. Here, five F2 populations derived from crosses between biennial mutants and annual beets were tested for co-segregation of bolting phenotypes with genotypic markers located at the B locus. One mutant appears to be mutated at the B locus, suggesting that an EMS-induced mutation of B can be sufficient to abolish annual bolting. Co-segregation analysis in four populations indicates that the genetic control of bolting also involves previously unknown major loci not linked to B, one of which also affects bolting time and was genetically mapped to chromosome IX. 3aBeta vulgaris 3abeets 3abiennials 3abolting 3acrossing 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3agenes 3aloci 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aphenotype 3asugar beet 3asurveys 3avernalization 2aAlleles 2aBeta vulgarisxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosome Segregationxgenetics 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aData Collection 2aEthyl Methanesulfonatextoxicity 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenotype 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aMutagensxtoxicity 2aMutation 2aPhenotype1 aAbou-Elwafa, Salah F.1 aZhang, Wenying1 aJung, Christian1 aMüller, Andreas E.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2010 Oct., v. 121, no. 6 p.1117-1131dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-010-1376-8 7aarticle03535naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245007500164300001600239520208600255650002002341650001602361650001602377650001602393650000902409650001702418650002502435650002202460650001202482650003302494650002202527650001102549650001402560650004002574650002402614650001002638650001702648650001802665650001702683650001502700700001602715700001702731700002002748700001802768773009502786852000902881856008302890939003302973946001103006655001203017IND4464148120221118175803.0120921e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446414812DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16015982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendriks, H.F.J.10aSafety of long-term consumption of plant sterol esters-enriched spread  ap. 681-692.  aObjective: To evaluate both efficacy and safety in humans of long-term consumption of spreads containing plant sterol esters. Design: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel trial. Subjects: Hundred and eighty-five healthy volunteers (35-64 y). Interventions: Volunteers daily consumed 20 g spread enriched with 1.6 g plant sterols as fatty acid esters or a control spread for 1 y. They continued their habitual diet and lifestyle. Outcome measures included efficacy markers such as total and LDL-cholesterol, a large range of safety parameters, and reporting of adverse events. Results: Consumption of the plant sterol ester-enriched spread consistently lowered total and LDL cholesterol during the 1 y period on average by 4 and 6%, respectively (0.01<P<0.05). Plant sterols intake did on average not result in a lower carotenoid concentration (when expressed per LDL-cholesterol) after 52 weeks (P>0.05). However, carotenoid concentrations changed over time. Plant sterols intake reduced lipid adjusted α- and β-carotene-concentrations by only 15-25% after 1 y, relative to control. Lipid-adjusted fat-soluble vitamin concentrations remained unchanged. Plant sterol concentrations in serum were increased from 2.76 to 5.31 (μmol/mmol total cholesterol) for campesterol (P<0.0001) and from 1.86 to 2.47 (mol/mmol total cholesterol) for β-sitosterol (P<0.0001). The increase in total plant sterol concentration in red blood cells (5.29–9.62 μg/g) did not affect red blood cell deformability. Hormone levels in males (free and total testosterone) and females (luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, β-estradiol and progesterone) as well as all clinical chemical and hematological parameters measured were unaffected. Adverse events reported were not different between subjects consuming control spread and subjects consuming plant sterol esters-enriched spread. Conclusions: Consumption of a plant sterol esters-enriched spread is an effective way to consistently lower blood cholesterol concentrations and is safe to use over a long period of time. 3abeta-sitosterol 3ablood serum 3acampesterol 3acarotenoids 3adiet 3aerythrocytes 3afat soluble vitamins 3afatty acid esters 3afemales 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3ahematologic tests 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3aprogesterone 3asterol esters 3atestosterone 3avolunteers1 aBrink, E.J.1 aMeijer, G.W.1 aPrincen, H.M.G.1 aNtanios, F.Y.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.681-692x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16015983Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120925  aNon-US 7aarticle03666naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100003100183245015500214300001600369500002400385506007600409520147800485506003701963650002502000650001002025650001802035650001702053650001002070650002802080650001802108650001202126650001302138650001402151650002202165650002502187650001602212650001402228650005002242650005002292650004802342650003802390650003302428650002802461650001802489650001302507650001402520650001402534650004502548650003302593650006002626650005502686650003902741700002702780700002402807773010602831852000902937856008202946655001203028IND4419927420221207135827.0090501e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441992742DNAL7 a193049372pmid7 aPMC26717092pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.108.0619602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKandasamy, Muthugapatti K.12aA Single Vegetative Actin Isovariant Overexpressed under the Control of Multiple Regulatory Sequences Is Sufficient for Normal Arabidopsis Development  ap. 701-718.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe relative significance of gene regulation and protein isovariant differences remains unexplored for most gene families, particularly those participating in multicellular development. Arabidopsis thaliana encodes three vegetative actins, ACT2, ACT7, and ACT8, in two ancient and highly divergent subclasses. Mutations in any of these differentially expressed actins revealed only mild phenotypes. However, double mutants were extremely dwarfed, with altered cell and organ morphology and an aberrant F-actin cytoskeleton (e.g., act2-1 act7-4 and act8-2 act7-4) or totally root-hairless (e.g., act2-1 act8-2). Our studies suggest that the three vegetative actin genes and protein isovariants play distinct subclass-specific roles during plant morphogenesis. For example, during root development, ACT7 was involved in root growth, epidermal cell specification, cell division, and root architecture, and ACT2 and ACT8 were essential for root hair tip growth. Also, genetic complementation revealed that the ACT2 and ACT8 isovariants, but not ACT7, fully rescued the root hair growth defects of single and double mutants. Moreover, we synthesized fully normal plants overexpressing the ACT8 isovariant from multiple actin regulatory sequences as the only vegetative actin in the act2-1 act7-4 background. In summary, it is evident that differences in vegetative actin gene regulation and the diversity in actin isovariant sequences are essential for normal plant development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aactin 3acell division 3acytoskeleton 3agenes 3agenetic complementation 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aplant development 3aregulatory sequences 3aroot growth 3aroot tips 2aActinsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMorphogenesis 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Rootsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Isoformsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid1 aMcKinney, Elizabeth C.1 aMeagher, Richard B.0 tplant cell.g2009 Mar., v. 21, no. 3 p.701-718dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.108.0619603Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03374naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001500190245008700205300001600292500002400308500001500332520179400347650002002141650002502161650001202186650001602198650001502214650002602229650001602255650001302271650001602284650002002300650001702320650001902337650001902356650002102375650001702396650001602413650001002429650002202439651001202461653001702473653001002490700002102500773010002521852000902621856008502630930003302715945002502748946001102773655001202784IND4431433720221118175931.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443143372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-009-9250-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aJ700 0aK001 0aL300 0aB2001 aKarki, Uma10aCattle distribution and behavior in southern-pine silvopasture versus open-pasture  ap. 159-168.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aShade present in silvopasture systems could reduce heat stress associated with microclimatic conditions that characterize warm-weather portions of the year on the Coastal Plain of the Southeast USA. Objectives of this research were to: (1) quantify diurnal distribution patterns of landscape use and behavior of cattle in loblolly-pine (Pinus taeda) silvopasture versus open-pasture landscapes, and (2) relate observed differences in landscape use and cattle behavior patterns between the two pastures to differences in microclimatic conditions, and forage quantity and quality. The research was conducted in Chipley, Florida USA within a 5-ha cell of a loblolly-pine-bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) silvopasture (tree age 20 year), and a 5-ha open bahiagrass pasture with unlimited access to an adjacent 1-ha wooded area. One-day observations of diurnal distribution and behavior of cattle were conducted in March, June, and September 2007; microclimatic conditions were measured, and forage quantity and quality were estimated within each landscape. Cattle utilized the landscape more evenly in the silvopasture versus the open-pasture and this difference was mainly attributed to reduced solar radiation recorded in the silvopasture. Grazing was the dominant behavior in the silvopasture while loafing was dominant in the open-pasture. Shade present in silvopasture appeared to reduce heat stress for cattle grazing during warm-weather portions of the year on the Coastal Plain of the Southeast USA. Further study is needed to determine how this reduction in heat stress influences cattle performance in southern-pine silvopasture, and the nature and extent of the interactions among animal distribution and behavior, microclimatic conditions, and forage characteristics in these systems. 3aanimal behavior 3aspatial distribution 3agrazing 3abeef cattle 3acrop yield 3asilvopastoral systems 3aPinus taeda 3apastures 3aheat stress 3asolar radiation 3amicroclimate 3aforage grasses 3aforage quality 3aPaspalum notatum 3aforage crops 3ashade trees 3ashade 3adiurnal variation 3aFlorida 0afood animals 0atrees1 aGoodman, Mary S.0 tAgroforestry systems.g2010 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.159-168dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-43667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-009-9250-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110621b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03450naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245016300161300001600324520217700340650001402517650002102531650001602552650001602568650001602584650001202600650001802612650001202630650001602642650000902658650001202667650001102679650002302690650001802713651002302731700001402754700001602768773009602784852000902880856008302889939003302972946001103005655001203016IND4464142620221118180106.0120921e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446414262DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakashita, R.10aSelection of reference foods for a scale of standards for use in assessing the transitional process from milk to solid food in infants and pre-school children  ap. 803-809.  aObjective: This paper describes the development of a reliable scale of standards for use in evaluating the progress of the transition from milk to solid food in infants and preschool children. The maturation of chewing and swallowing behavior in infants and young children, which enables processing of solid food, varies, and a scale would assist not only in the instruction of mothers and nurses but also in preventing delay in the introduction of solid food. Design: A range of 159 reference foods were selected on the basis of intake during the period of transition from liquid to solid food. These foods were listed in our previous study, Validity and reliability were tested to create a scale. Methodology: Foods were selected on the basis of 50% of the subjects studied being able to eat them, and on the food groups classified by cluster analyses using the Varclus procedure of SAS. Validity, of the scale was tested by using Pearson's correlation coefficient between the scale score of selected food items and the total score of all 159 food items. The total score of 159 food items was calculated using the general linear models (GLM) procedure of SAS. Reliability was tested using Cronbach's coefficient . Setting: Public health centers in Aomori, Tokyo, Saitama, Nagano, and Okinawa (Japan). Subjects: Five hundred and eighty healthy mothers and children from 2 to 46 months were randomly selected and 470 (81.0%) completed the study. To avoid regional bias, subjects were drawn from northern to southern prefectures in Japan, namely Aomori, Tokyo, Saitama, Nagano, and Okinawa. Results: Twenty food items were selected. By analyzing the score correlation using Pearson's correlation coefficient (R=0.97, P<0.001) and GLM (R2=0.95, P<0.001), it was confirmed that these 20 food items adequately represented the original 159. The reliability was also found to be sufficient (Cronbach's coefficient =0.96). Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that a scale of standards for measuring progress in chewing ability can be created using 20 food items. Such a standard will provide a useful basis against which to assess delay of solid food introduction in childhood. 3achildhood 3acluster analysis 3acorrelation 3adeglutition 3afood groups 3ainfants 3alinear models 3aliquids 3amastication 3amilk 3amothers 3anurses 3apreschool children 3apublic health 3aRyukyu Archipelago1 aInoue, N.1 aTatsuki, T.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.803-809x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016123Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle01563naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011400162300001600276520055800292653001800850653001800868653002500886653003100911653003200942700002200974773012500996852000901121856008501130930003301215946001301248655001201261IND4432503520221118180047.0100205e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443250352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10913-009-0070-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSher, E.

Little is known about the acute effect of individual dietary saturated fatty acids on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Objective: To investigate the effect of two prevalent dietary saturated fatty acids, stearic and myristic acid on postprandial and 24 h fasting plasma lipoprotein TAG and cholesterol concentrations. Design: Ten young healthy men were served two meals (1.2 g fat/kg body weight) containing fat enriched in either stearic acid (S) (shea butter) or myristic acid (M) (produced by inter-esterification) in a randomised, cross-over study. The meals were given in the morning after 12 h of fasting and again after 8 h (in the afternoon). The S and M containing meals were given at different days separated by a washout period. Blood samples were taken before the meal and 2,4,6,8, and 24 h after the first meal. Results: The M meal resulted in a higher postprandial HDL TAG response than S (P=0.03 I), (diet x time interaction), while no differences were observed in other lipid fractions. Twenty-four hours after the M meal fasting, HDL cholesterol was higher (P=0.05) and HDL TAG lower (P<0.001) than at baseline. Conclusions: Intake of individual dietary SFA may affect fasting HDL cholesterol within 24 h. Thus after this short period HDL cholesterol concentration was higher after myristic acid than stearic acid. Myristic acid resulted in a higher increase in postprandial HDL TAG than stearic acid. 3ablood lipids 3ablood sampling 3abody weight 3across-over studies 3adiet 3afasting 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amen 3amyristic acid 3arisk 3ashea butter 3astearic acid 3atriacylglycerols1 aVessby, B.1 aSandstrom, B.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.735-742x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016053Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle03560naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002000182245012000202300001400322500002400336520151100360650001101871650001901882650002601901650002301927650002801950650002101978650001401999650001502013650003102028650002102059650001402080650001402094650001502108650001702123650001402140650001602154650002302170650001302193650002102206650004802227650001202275650002102287650003802308650003002346650002402376650001402400650003102414650001102445650001902456653003302475653002402508700002002532700001802552700001702570773011202587852000902699856008502708930003302793945002502826946001102851655001202862IND4431433120221118180209.0100115e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443143312DNAL7 a200121882pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-009-9334-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8311 aMoran, Gabriel.10aIn vitro bioassay to detect reaginic antibodies from the serum of horses affected with Recurrent Airway Obstruction  ap. 91-99.  aIncludes references  aIn horses, Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO) is an allergic disease that involves IgE mediated Type I Hypersensitivity responses. The development of this type of allergy involves a series of events that begins with reaginic antibodies, mainly IgE and some IgG subclasses. These reaginic antibodies bind with high affinity, via the Fc portion, to FcεRI receptors on the membrane of mast cells and basophils. Once bound, environmental allergens cross-link the antibodies, which results in mast cell degranulation leading to the production of histamine and other chemical mediators that act together to induce airway inflammation. RAO-affected horses present with coughing, respiratory distress, airway obstruction and poor performance. The aspect of the RAO has been extensively studied, yet the precise sequence of events is still not well understood. Therefore, this study proposes a bioassay for reaginic antibody detection from horse serum of RAO-affected individuals, in order to determine the etiology of disease, which mediate immediate type reactions. The technique involves measuring in vitro calcium mobilization in RBL-2H3 cells following incubation with horse serum from affected or unaffected horses and one of the RAO antigens (Aspergillus fumigatus). The results presented here demonstrate that 30% of RAO-affected horses react positively in this in vitro bioassay, whereas unaffected horses do not. This bioassay may facilitate further research on RAO and other allergic diseases in horses. 3ahorses 3ahorse diseases 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3arespiratory system 3ahypersensitive response 3ahypersensitivity 3aallergens 3aantibodies 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ahistamine 3abasophils 3amast cells 3ainflammation 3abioassays 3ablood serum 3aantibody detection 3aetiology 3ain vitro studies 2aAirway Obstructionximmunologyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Fungal 2aAspergillus fumigatusximmunology 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aHorse Diseasesximmunology 2aHorses 2aReaginsxblood 0arecurrent airway Obstruction 0areaginic antibodies1 aBurgos, Rafael 1 aAraya, Oscar 1 aFolch, Hugo 0 tVeterinary research communications.g2010 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.91-99dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-009-9334-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03737naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072001700151072001700168100002400185245011200209300001600321500001500337520157600352650002201928650002201950650002301972650004101995650002902036650000802065650002302073650002002096650000902116650001202125650001902137650002002156650003702176650001402213650001202227650002002239650003402259650001102293650001102304650004602315650000902361650000902370650002102379650004802400650004802448650005502496650001402551650000902565650005702574650002002631650001902651653002702670653002302697700003202720700002502752700002102777700002602798700002102824773007802845852000902923930003302932945002502965946001302990655001203003IND4412642720221118180210.0081118e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441264272DNAL7 a187247772pmid7 aPMC27060372pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Viral DNA was detected by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in lymphoid tissues, gonad, sperm, and feces of all MPV1b-inoculated SCID mice. Viral DNA was detected in 1 of 16 aliquots of embryos from infected male SCID mice and in 12 of 18 aliquots of embryos from infected female SCID mice. All recipient female mice implanted with embryos from infected SCID male mice and their progeny were negative by serology and qPCR. In contrast, 3 of 5 recipient female mice implanted with embryos from infected SCID female mice and 14 of 15 progeny mice from these recipients were seropositive by multiplex fluorescent immunoassay (MFI) for MPV capsid antigen (rVP2). All of these mice were negative by MFI for parvovirus nonstructural protein antigen (rNS1) and by qPCR, with the exception of 1 recipient female mouse that displayed weak rNS1 seroreactivity and low levels of MPV DNA in lymphoid tissues. Seroreactivity to rVP2 declined over time in all progeny mice from infected SCID female mice until all were seronegative by 20 wk of age, consistent with maternal antibody transfer. Given that the high levels of MPV contamination detected in our experimentally infected SCID mice are unlikely in naturally infected immunocompetent mice, these data indicate that embryo transfer rederivation is effective for the eradication of MPV from infected colonies. 3adisease detection 3aantigen detection 3avirus transmission 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aRodent protoparvovirus 1 3aDNA 3alaboratory animals 3adisease control 3amice 3aprogeny 3aviral antigens 3aembryo transfer 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aEmbryo Transfer 2aEmbryo, Mammalianxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfectious Disease Transmission, Vertical 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aMice, SCIDxgeneticsximmunologyxvirology. 2aMinute Virus of Micexgeneticsximmunology. 2aParvoviridae Infectionsximmunologyxtransmission. 2aPregnancy 2aRats 2aRodent Diseasesximmunologyxtransmissionxvirology. 2aSerologic Tests 2aSuperovulation 0aexperimental infection 0aMouse parvovirus 11 aRomero-Aleshire, Melissa J.1 aMunger, Stephanie J.1 aMarcus, Emily C.1 aHenderson, Kenneth S.1 aWagner, April M.0 tComparative medicine.g2008 Aug., v. 58, no. 4 p.353-359x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  a20081125b20081206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/11/25  aOther US 7aarticle02493naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245008800161300001600249520141500265650001601680650001901696650001601715650001101731650001001742650001701752650001301769650001001782650000801792650002901800651001401829700001701843700001501860773009601875852000901971856008301980939003302063946001102096655001202107IND4464144020221118180237.0120921e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446414402DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhuja, K.D.K.10aEffects of a high monounsaturated fat, tomato-rich diet on serum levels of lycopene  ap. 832-841.  aObjective: To compare the effect of a modified fat, monounsaturated-fat-enriched diet and a high-carbohydrate low-fat diet with high lycopene content on the serum concentration of lycopene and other carotenoids. Design: A randomised crossover dietary intervention study. Setting: Melbourne, Australia - Healthy free-living men. Subjects: A total of 13 healthy males between the age of 20 and 70 y, recruited via advertisements in newspapers and university newsletter. Intervention: A randomised dietary intervention with two diets of 14 days each. The two diets were - (1) high-fat monounsaturated-fat-enriched (MUFA) and (2) high-carbohydrate low-fat (HCLF). Both the diets contained the same basic foods and a controlled carotenoid content high in lycopene. Results: A significant increase in serum total lycopene occurred, by 126% on the MUFA diet (P<0.001) and 108% on the HCLF diet (P=0.001). A reduction in serum cryptoxanthin (27% on MUFA diet and 25% on HCLF) and alpha-carotene (43% on the MUFA diet and 25% on the HCLF diet) was observed. No change was observed for the other carotenoids. Comparing the end of the two diets, no statistically significant difference was observed for lycopene or the other carotenoids. Conclusion: In all, 15% of energy from fat or 38% of energy from fat (predominantly monounsaturated fat) in the diet does not have a significant differential effect on serum lycopene. 3aadvertising 3aalpha-carotene 3ablood serum 3aenergy 3afoods 3alow fat diet 3alycopene 3amales 3amen 3anutritional intervention 3aAustralia1 aAshton, E.L.1 aBall, M.J.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.832-841x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016173Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle02865naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009900163300001800262500001500280520169800295650002101993650001102014650002302025650002602048650001402074650002202088650001302110650002002123653001702143653001102160653001702171653001102188700002102199773008202220852000902302856008502311930003302396945001302429946001302442655001202455IND2060647220221118180931.0971124s1996    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206064722DNAL7 a10.1080/019041696093652262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBednarz, C.W.10aPartitioning of potassium in the cotton plant during the development of a potassium deficiency  ap. 1629-1638.  a2019-12-04  aVisual potassium (K) deficiency symptoms of modern cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars are similar to classical descriptions. Unlike classical descriptions, however, they occur first at the top of these more heavily fruiting cultivars and progress from younger to older leaves. Studies were initiated to closely monitor the development of K deficiency symptoms in a modern cotton cultivar. Growth chamber experiments were conducted in 1993 and 1994 to determine how K is partitioned throughout cotton plants during the development of K deficiency symptoms. Experiments were conducted in 8-L sand filled pots in a growth chamber at the Altheimer Laboratory in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Two treatments were established at the pin-head square growth stage 35 days after planting and consisted of nutrient solutions containing 0 and 6 mM K. The onset of K deficiency was first detected in upper canopy petioles 4 days after treatment establishment (DATE). On this day, petiole K concentration in the plus-K treatment was approximately 70 to 80 g.kg-1 (w/w) and 40 to 60 g.kg-1 (w/w) in the no-K treatment. Differences in leaf K were also observed first in the upper canopy with approximately 30 g.kg-1 (w/w) in the plus-K leaves and 20 g.kg-1 (w/w) in the no-K leaves 4 DATE. Significant differences in petiole and leaf K were next observed in mid and lower canopy petioles 14 and 28 DATE, respectively. Differences in fruit K were not observed until 28 DATE. Thus, these experiments suggest upper canopy petioles and leaves exhibit lower levels of K than lower canopy petioles and leaves at given times and conditions. These results should be considered when sampling to detect a K deficiency. 3anutrient content 3acanopy 3aGossypium hirsutum 3anutrient deficiencies 3apotassium 3aspatial variation 3apetioles 3amineral content 0alower canopy 0afruits 0aupper canopy 0aleaves1 aOosterhuis, D.M.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1996, v. 19, no. 12 p.1629-1638x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041696093652263Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02933naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001500154245020800169300001600377500002400393520131800417650001201735650001201747650003701759650001201796650001301808650001401821650001401835650001001849650002101859650003001880650001101910650001101921650002501932650000901957650003901966650001402005650001902019650004802038650002802086650002202114653003702136700001402173700001402187700001902201773011102220852000902331856007502340655001202415IND4436214720221118181606.0100430s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443621472DNAL7 a204508372pmid7 a10.1071/RD092682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Juan10aSuccessful pregnancy following oocyte activation by strontium in normozoospermic patients of unexplained infertility with fertilisation failures during previous intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment  ap. 852-855.  aIncludes references  aFertilisation failures occur in 2-3% of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles and are mostly caused by failure of oocyte activation. Assisted oocyte activation (AOA) may be an efficient treatment option to overcome oocyte activation failure. To evaluate the effectiveness of ICSI combined with AOA by strontium, six couples with complete fertilisation failure or low fertilisation rates (ranging from 0% to 16.7%; mean = 7.7%) in previous ICSI cycles were involved in the present study. In the latest ICSI cycles, AOA by strontium treatment was combined with ICSI to improve clinical outcomes. Fifty-two mature oocytes retrieved from six females were stimulated by strontium treatment after ICSI procedure, and 41 (78.8%) of them were successfully fertilised. The high-quality embryo rate was 41.5% (17/41) after culture for 5 days. Thirteen embryos were transferred (ranging from 2 to 3 per individual) resulting in three clinical pregnancies and three healthy babies were born. Furthermore, a pregnancy resulting in the birth of a healthy female infant was achieved following transfer of three frozen-thawed embryos. In conclusion, it appears that strontium treatment would be an effective method for AOA to improve fertilisation rates and embryo quality in cases with fertilisation failure after ICSI. 3afemales 3ainfants 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3aoocytes 3apatients 3apregnancy 3astrontium 2aAdult 2aCryopreservation 2aEmbryo Culture Techniques 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfertilityxtherapy 2aMale 2aOocytesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aSperm Injections, Intracytoplasmicxmethods 2aStrontiumxpharmacology 2aTreatment Failure 0aassisted oocyte activation (AOA)1 aQian, Yun1 aTan, Yong1 aMima, Hirofumi0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2010, v. 22, no. 5 p.852-855dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD092683Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02282naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008300166300001400249500002400263500001500287520116700302650001501469650001201484650001301496650001301509650001701522650003701539650002501576650001901601650001401620653001501634700001901649700002301668700002501691773008601716852000901802856008501811655001201896IND4435965320221118181106.0100423s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443596532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-010-0105-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirasak, Kanjana10aDo mitochondria in Dendrobium petal mesophyll cells form vacuole-like vesicles  ap. 51-61.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aUsing transmission electron microscopy, we investigated the ultrastructure of mitochondria in petal mesophyll cells of the orchid Dendrobium cv. Lucky Duan, from the time of floral opening to visible petal senescence. Cells close to the vascular bundle contained many mitochondria, some of which showed internal degeneration. This inner mitochondrial breakdown was accompanied by an eightfold increase in mitochondrial volume. Small electron-dense granules (approximately 0.04 μm in diameter) at the periphery of the mitochondrial matrix remained. These granules were used as an indicator of still later stages of mitochondrial development in these cells. The apparent final stage of mitochondrial degeneration was a single-membrane-bound vesicle, resembling a vacuole. No evidence was found for the idea that mitochondria became transferred (intact or degenerated) into a lytic vacuole. Taken together, the data suggest the hypotheses that (a) mitochondria in cells close to the vascular bundle in petals of open Dendrobium cv. Lucky Duan flowers undergo large-scale internal degeneration and that (b) such degenerating mitochondria form vacuole-like vesicles. 3aDendrobium 3acorolla 3agranules 3avacuoles 3amitochondria 3atransmission electron microscopy 3acytoplasmic granules 3aultrastructure 3amesophyll 0asenescence1 aKetsa, Saichol1 aImsabai, Wachiraya1 avan Doorn, Wouter G.0 tProtoplasma.g2010 May, v. 241, no. 1-4 p.51-61dSpringer Viennax0033-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-010-0105-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03767naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072000900142100002000151245011200171300001600283500002400299500001500323520203000338650003002368650001802398650002002416650001302436650002202449650002702471650001302498650000902511650002802520650001802548650002302566650002202589650001402611650002202625650001502647650002102662650001302683650002502696650002102721651001702742653003202759653002802791653001202819653001302831700001602844700001702860700001902877773010702896852000903003856008203012930003303094945002503127946001303152655001203165IND4397822520221118181104.0071113e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439782252DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-91-6-07112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8321 aGoszczynska, T.10aIsolation and Identification of the Causal Agent of Brown Stalk Rot, A New Disease of Maize in South Africa  ap. 711-718.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDuring 2004 to 2005, an unreported disease of maize (Zea mays) was observed on commercial fields in the Northwest and Mpumalanga Provinces of South Africa. Infected plants were stunted, with a vertical crack at the first internode. Inside the stem, a dark-brown, narrow lesion was present along the crack. Internal browning inside the stem extended upward, reaching the top internode in some plants. Seed cobs were underdeveloped. Diseased plants were scattered in the fields and 10 to 70% of the crop was affected. Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria were consistently isolated from diseased tissues. Pathogenicity tests established that representative strains induced disease symptoms similar to those observed on maize plants in the field. Physiological and biochemical characterization using the API 20E and API 50CHE systems and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed that the strains belonged to the genus Pantoea. The results of these tests also separated the strains into two groups. The first group, giving a positive reaction in the indole test, was similar to Pantoea ananatis. The second group of strains was indole negative and resembled P. agglomerans. The fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (F-AFLP) genomic fingerprints generated by the indole-positive strains and P. ananatis reference strains were similar and clustered together in the dendrogram, confirming that the indole-positive bacteria causing brown stalk rot on maize were P. ananatis. The F-AFLP fingerprints produced by the indole-negative strains were distinctly different from those generated by P. ananatis, P. agglomerans, P. dispersa, P. citrea, P. stewartii subsp. stewartii, and P. stewartii subsp. indologenes. The results indicated that indole-negative bacteria causing brown stalk rot on maize might belong to a previously undescribed species of the genus Pantoea. This is the first report of a new disease on maize, brown stalk rot, caused by two bacterial species, P. ananatis and an undescribed Pantoea sp. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aribosomal RNA 3alesions (plant) 3anecrosis 3adisease incidence 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aZea mays 3acorn 3apathogen identification 3apathogenicity 3amicrobial genetics 3adisease diagnosis 3acorn ears 3aemerging diseases 3ainternodes 3aPantoea ananatis 3astem rot 3anucleotide sequences 3aseed development 3aSouth Africa 0asigns and symptoms (plants) 0amolecular sequence data 0aPantoea 0aetiology1 aBotha, W.J.1 aVenter, S.N.1 aCoutinho, T.A.0 tPlant disease.g2007 June, v. 91, no. 6 p.711-718dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-91-6-07113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/16  aOther US 7aarticle03546naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245008400192300001600276520150700292650000801799650001501807650001001822650002301832650001301855650001701868650001501885650001101900650001001911650001201921650001701933650001401950650001401964650001101978650001001989650001201999650004002011650001702051650002502068650001202093650001802105650001502123650001402138650005602152650001202208650003702220650002302257650001702280650003002297650005402327650004702381650005402428653001502482653001302497700002202510700002502532700002002557700002002577773011302597852000902710856008502719930003302804946001102837655001202848IND4419047720221118181040.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441904772DNAL7 a192144682pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-009-0508-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-González, Ana 10aMicrobial Cretaceous park: biodiversity of microbial fossils entrapped in amber  ap. 551-564.  aMicroorganisms are the most ancient cells on this planet and they include key phyla for understanding cell evolution and Earth history, but, unfortunately, their microbial records are scarce. Here, we present a critical review of fossilized prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms entrapped in Cretaceous ambers (but not exclusively from this geological period) obtained from deposits worldwide. Microbiota in ambers are rather diverse and include bacteria, fungi, and protists. We comment on the most important microbial records from the last 25 years, although it is not an exhaustive bibliographic compilation. The most frequently reported eukaryotic microfossils are shells of amoebae and protists with a cell wall or a complex cortex. Likewise, diverse dormant stages (palmeloid forms, resting cysts, spores, etc.) are abundant in ambers. Besides, viral and protist pathogens have been identified inside insects entrapped in amber. The situation regarding filamentous bacteria and fungi is quite confusing because in some cases, the same record was identified consecutively as a member of these phylogenetically distant groups. To avoid these identification errors in the future, we propose to apply a more resolute microscopic and analytical method in amber studies. Also, we discuss the most recent findings about ancient DNA repair and bacterial survival in remote substrates, which support the real possibility of ancient DNA amplification and bacterial resuscitation from Cretaceous resins. 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aamber 3aanalytical methods 3abacteria 3abiodiversity 3acell walls 3acortex 3afungi 3ainsects 3amicrofossils 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aspores 2aAmber 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBiodiversity 2aBiological Evolution 2aBiology 2aDNAxgenetics 2aDNA Repair 2aEcosystem 2aEukaryotaxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aFossils 2aFungixclassificationxgenetics. 2aGene Amplification 2aPaleontology 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aSpores, Bacterialxclassificationxpathogenicity. 2aSpores, Fungalxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aVirusesxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 0aCretaceous 0aProtists1 aWierzchos, Jacek 1 aGutiérrez, Juan C. 1 aAlonso, Jesús 1 aAscaso, Carmen 0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2009 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.551-564dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0508-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01927naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245013500169300001600304500001500320520070900335650001801044650001701062650001301079650002801092650001301120650001301133650001101146650002001157650001001177650001101187650001101198653002601209700001601235700002201251773007901273852000901352856008501361930003301446945001301479946001301492655001201505IND2060229320221118180743.0971023s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206022932DNAL7 a10.1080/019041697093652412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta de Macedo, C.10aEffects of duration and intensity of aluminum stress on growth parameters in four rice genotypes differing in aluminum sensitivity  ap. 181-193.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of aluminum (Al) stresses of varying intensities and durations on growth parameters were investigated in four Oryza sativa L. genotypes (two Al sensitive, two Al resistant). Our results support the current opinion that the use of only one parameter cannot easily account for differences in Al resistance, since Al concentration or stress duration can affect plant responses in opposite directions. For short stress duration (40 days) at Al 500 micromolar, weight parameters appear to be more discerning than length parameters Necrosis evaluation is a more reliable criterion for plants maintained for long time (80 days) in the presence of high Al concentrations (A1 1000 of 1500 micromolar). 3aphytotoxicity 3aOryza sativa 3anecrosis 3adry matter accumulation 3aaluminum 3agenotype 3alength 3ametal tolerance 3aroots 3aleaves 3ashoots 0abiological resistance1 aKinet, J.M.1 aSint Jan, V. van.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1997, v. 20, no. 1 p.181-193x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041697093652413Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03488naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100004200142245014600184300001600330500002400346520205700370650001902427650001402446650003002460650001902490650001402509650001602523650002302539650002202562650001902584650001302603650002102616650001902637650001702656650002002673650001002693650000902703650001802712650001702730650001902747650001002766650002702776700002202803773012702825852000902952856004502961655001203006IND4427544520091107000000.0091016e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442754452DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2008000212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchenck zu Schweinsberg-Mickan, Mario10aImpact of effective microorganisms and other biofertilizers on soil microbial characteristics, organic-matter decomposition, and plant growth  ap. 704-712.  aIncludes references  aIncubation and pot experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of commercially distributed biofertilizers (effective microorganisms [EM], BIOSTIMULATOR, BACTOFIL-A, and BACTOFIL-B) on soil microbial-biomass content and activity, net N mineralization in soil, and growth of Lolium perenne. According to the manufacturers, the products tested are based on microbial inoculants or organic growth stimulants, and are supposed to influence soil microbial properties and improve soil conditions, organic-matter decomposition, and plant growth. In the incubation experiment (40 d, 20.6°C, 50% maximum water-holding capacity), EM was repeatedly applied to soil together with different organic amendments (nonamended, chopped straw, and lupine seed meal). Under the experimental conditions of this study, no or only marginal effects of EM on organic C, total N, and mineral N in soil could be observed. In soil treatments without any organic amendment, EM suspension slightly enhanced microbial activity measured as soil CO₂ evolution. In soil with easily degradable plant residues (lupine seed meal), EM suspension had a suppressive effect on microbial biomass. However, comparisons with sterilized EM and molasses as the main additive in EM suspension showed that any effect of EM could be explained as a pure substrate effect without the influence of added living organisms. In the pot experiment with Lolium perenne (air-conditioned greenhouse cabin, 87 d, 16.8°C, 130 klxh d⁻¹ light quantity), the products EM, BIOSTIMULATOR, BACTOFIL-A, and BACTOFIL-B were tested in soil with growing plants. The products were repeatedly applied for a period of 42 d. Within this study, no effects of the different biofertilizers on mineral N in soil were detectable. There were clear suppressive effects of all tested biofertilizers on microbial-biomass content and activity. Comparisons with sterilized suspensions showed that the effects were not due to living microorganisms in the suspensions, but could be traced back to substrate-induced processes. 3aLolium perenne 3aadditives 3abeneficial microorganisms 3abiofertilizers 3aevolution 3agreenhouses 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3amolasses 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3aplant growth 3aproduct testing 3aseeds 3asoil 3asoil analysis 3asoil quality 3asoil treatment 3astraw 3awater holding capacity1 aMüller, Torsten.0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2009 Oct., v. 172, no. 5 p.704-712dWiley-VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200800021 7aarticle02834naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001800163245009000181300001600271500002400287500001500311520112100326650001901447650002701466650001601493650001701509650001101526650002501537650001301562650002201575650001701597650002001614650001201634650001201646650002001658650001001678650002501688650003101713650002101744650001901765653002801784653001901812700001601831700001701847700001601864700001601880700001501896700001301911700001501924773011801939852000902057856008502066930003302151945002502184946001102209655001202220IND4431437920221118180719.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443143792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-009-9628-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF8411 aJin, Taicheng10aStress-inducible expression of GmDREB1 conferred salt tolerance in transgenic alfalfa  ap. 219-227.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn attempt to improve salt tolerance of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) plants, a soybean DREB orthologue, GmDREB1, was introduced into alfalfa plants under the control of Arabidopsis Rd29A promoter. Its incorporation and expression in transgenic plants were confirmed by DNA and RNA gel-blot analyses. The level of salt tolerance of transgenic lines was significantly higher than that of wild-type control plants as measured by ion leakage, chlorophyll fluorescence value, contents of free proline and total soluble sugars. Moreover, northern blot analysis revealed that the transcript level of Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) was up-regulated in the transgenic plants. These results suggested that the stress-inducible expression of GmDREB1 conferred salt tolerance in transgenic alfalfa plants. In addition, no visible phenotypic alternations were observed in the transgenic plants due to the use of stress-inducible Rd29A promoter. It was the first to describe transgenic expression of DREB genes in alfalfa and these transgenic lines with high salt-tolerance are of significance in the forage breeding. 3asalt tolerance 3agenetic transformation 3achlorophyll 3aforage crops 3asugars 3atotal soluble solids 3asalinity 3atransgenic plants 3afluorescence 3aMedicago sativa 3aproline 3aalfalfa 3agene expression 3agenes 3aphenotypic variation 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 3aplant proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0asoluble solids1 aChang, Qing1 aLi, Wangfeng1 aYin, Dongxu1 aLi, Zhijian1 aWang, Deli1 aLiu, Bao1 aLiu, Lixia0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2010 Feb., v. 100, no. 2 p.219-227dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-009-9628-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100331b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02566naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010600162300001400268500002400282520129300306650000801599650002701607650002801634650003101662650001901693650001701712650002501729650002201754650001701776650003701793650000901830650001401839700001501853700001801868700001401886700001801900700001701918700001701935773008601952852000902038856008502047655001202132IND4435965720221118181656.0100423s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443596572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-009-0101-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Chaofeng10aFlow cytometric analysis of mitochondrial populations in HL-CMS systems of rice under H₂O₂ stress  ap. 91-98.  aIncludes references  aCytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has often been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In this report, the heterogeneity of mitochondria was analyzed in both Honglian (HL) CMS (YtA) rice seedlings and those of its corresponding maintainers (YtB) by flow cytometry and staining with rhodamine-123 (Rh-123). Both lines revealed two distinct fluorescence populations: high fluorescence populations (HFP) and light fluorescence populations (LFP), and a somewhat lower LFP/HFP ratio was detected in conjunction with the higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in YtA. In addition, use of the specific effector hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) demonstrated a correlation between the LFP/HFP ratio and ROS levels in both lines. Higher ROS content caused a more swift decrease of F₀F₁-ATPase activity and ATP contents in YtA than those in YtB, which accompanied with an obvious decline of the LFP/HFP ratio in YtA. Furthermore, a mitochondrial genomic DNA smear was detected by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Taken together, these results implied that HL-CMS line rice seedlings and those of its corresponding maintainer have different proportion of Rh-123 staining mitochondria populations, which may be accounted for by ROS contents on the basis of ATPase activity and ATP contents. 3aDNA 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3afluorescent lighting 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amitochondria 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arice 3aseedlings1 aSun, Q.

A high frequency of shoot organogensis was obtained when explants were incubated on MS medium supplemented with 8 μM BA, 6 μM NAA, and 6 μM giberrellic acid (GA₃). However, adding 24 μM silver nitrate (AgNO₃) to this medium markedly enhanced shoot regeneration frequency (63%) and mean number of shoots per explant (11.26) and length of shoots (2.22 cm). Highest frequency of in vitro rooting, mean number of roots/shoot (4.32), and mean root length (2.71 cm) were obtained when regenerated shoots were transferred to half-strength MS medium supplemented with 0.02% activated charcoal. Well-rooted plantlets were acclimatized, and then transferred to soil medium. Moreover, when zygotic embryos of P. granatum, excised from seeds collected at 16 weeks following full bloom, were incubated on MS medium containing 30 g l⁻¹ sucrose, 15% coconut water, 21 μM NAA, and 9 μM BA, they developed the highest frequency of embryogenic callus, clumps with globular embryos, and mean number of both globular and heart-shaped embryos per callus clump. Subjecting zygotic embryo explants to six-week dark incubation period was essential for embryogenic callus induction, and these were subsequently transferred to 16 h photoperiod for further growth and development of somatic embryos. Germination of somatic embryos was observed when these were transferred to MS medium was supplemented with 60 g l⁻¹ sucrose. 3acallus formation 3aactivated carbon 3agermination 3apomegranates 3aPunica granatum 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3aexplants 3asucrose 3acotyledons 3azygote 3abenzyladenine 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aphotoperiod 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3acallus 3aorganogenesis 0aembryo (plant)1 aJoseph, Jomy 1 aDeepika, Raj 0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2010 Feb., v. 100, no. 2 p.199-207dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-009-9637-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03902naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001600143245011500159300001600274520238300290650001802673650001602691650002102707650001702728650002002745650001202765650002202777650002802799650003702827650001202864650001802876650001602894650001102910650001402921650001402935650001702949650002402966650001802990650002403008650001303032650001403045650001203059650001003071650000903081700002003090700001803110773009603128852000903224856008303233939003303316946001103349655001203360IND4464257120221118181718.0121005e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446425712DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16015772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlich, J.Z.10aBone and nutrition in elderly women: protein, energy, and calcium as main determinants of bone mineral density  ap. 554-565.  aObjective: Nutrition is an important factor in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Our goal was to examine the relationship between various nutrients and bone mass of several skeletal sites in elderly women, taking into account possible confounding variables. Design/methods: A cross-sectional study in 136 healthy Caucasian, postmenopausal women, free of medications known to affect bone was carried out. Bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition (lean and fat tissue) were measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry using specialized software for different skeletal sites. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D, 25(OH)D, as possible confounders, were determined in serum samples. Dietary intake, including all supplements, was assessed by 3-day dietary record and analyzed using Food Processor®. Past physical activity and present walking were examined as well and accounted for as potential confounders. Simple and multiple regression models were created to assess the relationships between nutrients and BMD. To examine the co-linear variables and their possible independent association with bone, subgroup analyses were performed. Results: Showed independent influence of calcium, energy, and protein, examined separately and in multiple regression models on BMD of several skeletal sites. Magnesium, zinc and vitamin C were significantly related to BMD of several skeletal sites in multiple regression models (controlled for age, fat and lean tissue, physical activity and energy intake), each contributing more than 1% of variance. Serum PTH and 25(OH)D did not show significant association with bone mass. Conclusions: Despite the cross-sectional nature of our study we were able to show a significant relationship between BMD and several critical nutrients: energy, protein, calcium, magnesium, zinc and vitamin C. The exact involvement of these nutrients and their clinical significance in bone health need to be further elucidated in humans and conclusions about the effects of a single nutrient on bone mass must be given cautiously, taking into account its interaction and co-linearity with others. Understanding relationships among nutrients, not just limited to calcium and vitamin D, but others that have not been investigated to such extent, is an important step toward identifying preventive measures for bone loss and prevention of osteoporosis. 3aascorbic acid 3ablood serum 3abody composition 3abone density 3abone resorption 3acalcium 3acomputer software 3across-sectional studies 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aelderly 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3ahumans 3amagnesium 3anutrients 3aosteoporosis 3aparathyroid hormone 3apostmenopause 3aregression analysis 3avariance 3avitamin D 3awalking 3awomen 3azinc1 aBrownbill, R.A.1 aTamborini, L.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Apr., v. 57, no. 4 p.554-565x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16015773Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20121007  aNon-US 7aarticle02328naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002600163245010600189300001600295500002400311520105600335650002201391650001301413650002101426650001601447650001901463650001001482650003601492650002601528653004001554700002201594700002101616773011801637852000901755856008501764930003301849945002501882946001101907655001201918IND4431437520221118173729.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443143752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-009-9635-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF6001 aYadav, Satya Prakash 10aEstimation of the chlorophyll content of micropropagated potato plants using RGB based image analysis  ap. 183-188.  aIncludes references  aA method has been developed for rapid and non invasive determination of chlorophyll content of leaves of micropropagated potato plants using RGB based image analysis. Among the trichomatic colors, R and G negatively correlated with the chlorophyll content, while a positive correlation was observed with B chromate. Compared to mean brightness value, the use of mean brightness ratio considerably improved the relationship of the tricolors with chlorophyll content. The brightness values and ratios of the primary colors are modeled as linear correlation functions for chlorophyll content. A significant correlation was observed between the model predicted chlorophyll content with the chlorophyll content measured by chlorophyll content meter. Spectral properties such as luminosity and saturation were also found to be negatively correlated with the chlorophyll content. The relationship was improved by combining the mean brightness ratio at B band region with luminosity. The potential of the imaging system in micropropagation has been discussed. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3amicropropagation 3achlorophyll 3aimage analysis 3acolor 3achemical constituents of plants 3ain vitro regeneration 0ared green blue based image analysis1 aIbaraki, Yasuomi 1 aDutta Gupta, S. 0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2010 Feb., v. 100, no. 2 p.183-188dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-009-9635-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02796naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024008000092040001800172100001800190245011000208300001600318500002400334520159100358650002901949650001301978650001301991650001902004650001702023650002102040650001202061650001302073650001102086650000702097650002302104650001102127700002702138700001802165700002202183773009102205852000902296856009302305655001202398IND4445711020221118173736.0101126e19960615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444571102DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0061(19960615)12:7&lt;673::AID-YEA958&gt;3.0.CO;2-C2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeulers, Marc10aSynchronization affector of autonomous short‐period‐sustained oscillation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 673-682.  aIncludes references  aWhen the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown under aerobic continuous culture, an autonomous shortperiod‐sustained oscillation appeared. This oscillation was observed in concentrations of various extracellular and intracellular parameters, such as ethanol, acetate, glycogen, dissolved oxygen and intracellular pH. In this work the synchronization affecter of this oscillation was investigated. Ethanol was found not to be the synchronizer of the oscillation because a pulse of ethanol did not affect the phase or period of the oscillation. The oscillation was dependent on the aeration rate, i.e., the oscillation occurred only between 150 and 600 ml min⁻¹. However, the oxygen concentration did not influence synchronization as an upward shift in the oxygen concentration of the gas flow did not affect the sustainability of the oscillation. On the other hand, synchronization was stopped by an enhanced gas flow rate, keeping dissolved oxygen tension at the oscillatory condition, suggesting that synchronization was caused by a volatile compound in the culture. A stepwise increase in carbon dioxide concentration of the gas flow rate ceased synchronization, yet the oscillation seem to continue in each individual cell. Oscillatory behaviour of intracellular pH and carbon dioxide evolution rate showed a phase difference of 90 degrees. Based on these facts it is postulated that carbon dioxide, through the influence of its dissociation on intracellular pH, could be the synchronization affector of the autonomous short‐period‐sustained oscillation of S. cerevisiae. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetates 3aaeration 3acarbon dioxide 3adissociation 3adissolved oxygen 3aethanol 3aglycogen 3aoxygen 3apH 3avolatile compounds 3ayeasts1 aSatroutdinov, Aidar D.1 aSuzuki, Takao1 aKuriyama, Hiroshi0 tYeast.g1996 June 15, v. 12, no. 7 p.673-682dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0061(19960615)12:7&lt;673::AID-YEA958&gt;3.0.CO;2-C 7aarticle02292naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245008000145300001600225500001500241520079200256650001301048650002601061650001301087650002001100650001901120650002501139650001201164650002201176650002501198650002901223650002501252650001501277650002301292650004801315650002201363650002101385650003301406650002701439650002501466650002301491653001701514653002001531700001601551700001501567700001401582773008801596852000901684930003301693945001301726946001101739655001201750IND2205740220221118173730.0000713e199912  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220574022DNAL7 a106075142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinova, D.10aLactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme distribution and patterns in chicken organs  ap. 309-312.  a2019-12-05  aUnlike most mammals, chicken lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes cannot be separated using the 'Titan-Gel' electrophoresis.

Generally, three characteristic groups were seen: (a) those having a cathodic domination (breast muscle and serum) with mainly lactate dehydrogenase-5 (b) those having an anodic domination (heart, muscle, liver, pancreas, kidney, erythrocytes) of mainly lactate dehydrogenase--1 and 2 and (C) those with a more uniform distribution (spleen, lung, and brain). The total lactate dehydrogenase activity was the highest in the breast muscle, followed by the heart muscle, liver and serum with the lowest activities in the lung and pancreas. 3achickens 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aisozymes 3aenzyme activity 3aanimal tissues 3aisoelectric focusing 2aAnimals 2aBrainxenzymology 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aErythrocytesxenzymology 2aIsoelectric Focusing 2aIsoenzymes 2aKidneyxenzymology 2aL-Lactate Dehydrogenasexbloodxmetabolism. 2aLiverxenzymology 2aLungxenzymology 2aMuscle, Skeletalxenzymology 2aMyocardiumxenzymology 2aPancreasxenzymology 2aSpleenxenzymology 0adistribution 0aelectrophoresis1 aRosival, I.1 aAvidar, Y.1 aBogin, E.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1999 Dec., v. 67, no. 3 p.309-312x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02255naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100002200173245006800195300001600263500002400279520123100303650001301534650001101547650001201558650001501570650001101585650002301596650002401619650002001643650002101663650001201684700002101696773011001717852000901827856005701836655001201893IND4446173620221118173926.0101208e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444617362DNAL7 a211290232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.1989.tb00242.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobson, Andrew P.14aThe Population Dynamics and Conservation of Primate Populations  ap. 362-380.  aIncludes references  aPrimates are among the most threatened taxa, with more than half of all species in jeopardy. In this paper we develop population models to use the kind of data on wild primates that primatologists actually collect. Our survey of recentprimate journals suggests that the average field study uses 1.5 years of data from 50 animals The models are based on the simple Leslie-Lefkovitch matrix. They suggest a simple method that allows assessment from a few years'data, of whether a population is collapsing and requires intervention To a good approximation, populations will collapse when adult survival, per inter-birth interval, is less than 70 percent. Modifications of the basic model incorporate more realistic assumptions about social organization and densitydependent resource limitation. These allow us to identify population densities at which potential Allee effects operate, and permit more precise estimates of the minimum population sizes and compositions required for successful reintroductions to the wild The most important result is that populations of primates that live in small family groups may be more prone to “demographic” extinction than are more promiscuous species that live in more extended groups. 3aPrimates 3aadults 3aanimals 3aextinction 3amodels 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3asocial structure 3asurveys1 aLEES, ANNA MARIE0 tConservation biology.g1989 Dec., v. 3, no. 4 p.362-380dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw20959x0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.1989.tb00242.x 7aarticle03930naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245014700168300001600315500001500331520260100346650001102947650002102958650001002979650002602989650002203015650002803037650002103065650002103086650001103107653002203118653001703140653002803157653001303185700001903198700001803217700001703235773007903252852000903331856008503340930003303425945001303458946001303471655001203484IND2060317920221118173858.0971029s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206031792DNAL7 a10.1080/019041697093652872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrossopoulos, J.B.10aDistribution profiles of dry matter and total nitrogen in leaves and stems of oriental field-grown tobacco plants at different nitrogen levels  ap. 695-713.  a2019-12-04  aOriental tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Myrodata Agrinion) were grown without nitrogen (N) fertilization (N0) and with added ammonium nitrate at a rate of 50 kg. ha-1 (N1) and 100 kg.ha-1 (N2). Non-uniform patterns for leaf FW and DW changes per node showed a decreasing trend from lower to upper nodes during the vegetative stage. From approaching flowering to fruit set, these patterns became more uniform. Plants which were fertilized with N had increased leaf FW and DW accumulation levels and non-uniform distribution patterns, primarily during the reproductive stage, and leaves of the lower nodes were found in the older plants. By contrast, the median values of leaf FW for the unfertilized plants were reduced during the reproductive period. The DW/FWx100 ratio values revealed a stable relationship between leaf FW and DW from the vegetative to the reproductive stage, while modified patterns of DW/FWx100 appeared later in the plant cycle. Nitrogen fertilization resulted in an early appearance of modified patterns of DW/FWx100 in the plant life cycle and higher accumulation of dry matter per unit leaf area. Patterns of total leaf N concentration showed an increasing trend from the lower to the upper nodes for all plant ages and treatments. Total N concentration values varied from 1.6%, 1.9%, and 1.8% on a dry matter basis, for the lower node up to 5.5%, 6.3%. and 6.1% for the upper node in young tobacco plants in the N0, N1, and N2 treatments, respectively. After fruit set, a more uniform distribution of total leaf N was observed among the leaves in all treatments. Concentration values for total leaf N in older plants varied from 1.9%, 2.1%, and 2.2% for the lower node up to 3.4%, 3.3% and 3.2% for the upper node in the N0, N1, and N2 treatments, respectively. These results suggest a progressive decrease with plant age for total leaf N concentration in the plant as a whole. The increased N fertilizer level affected the total N level in young plants but not in the older ones. Inflorescence and fruit set periods are critical for plant N balance except for the plants which received the increased N fertilization. The determined total stem N concentration was less than that for the leaves. This change in the stem, similar to leaves, showed an increasing trend from the basal to the upper part and a decreasing trend from the vegetative to the reproductive stage. The total stem N level declined from 1.0-1.2%, 1.6-1.7%, and 2.2-2.9% on a dry matter basis to 0.5-0.6%, 1.0-1.2%, and 1.2-1.6% for the basal, middle, and upper part of the stem, respectively. 3aweight 3anitrogen content 3astems 3anutrient availability 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adry matter partitioning 3aapplication rate 3aammonium nitrate 3aleaves 0acrop growth stage 0afresh weight 0adry matter accumulation 0aleaf age1 aBouranis, D.L.1 aAivalakis, G.1 aTsomokos, A.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1997, v. 20, no. 6 p.695-713x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041697093652873Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03008naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245014000204300001800344500002400362506007600386520144000462506003701902650001301939650001701952650001301969650001201982650001301994650002102007650001802028650001202046650001302058650001302071650001802084650001202102650002502114650001802139650001402157650002202171700002702193700002202220700001802242700001902260773013402279852000902413856008002422655001202502IND4419915520221207143359.0090501e20090501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441991552DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02697-082doi7 aPMC26817182pmcid7 a192701352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeissinger, Oliver14aThe Ultramicrobacterium "Elusimicrobium minutum" gen. nov., sp. nov., the First Cultivated Representative of the Termite Group 1 Phylum  ap. 2831-2840.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInsect intestinal tracts harbor several novel, deep-rooting clades of as-yet-uncultivated bacteria whose biology is typically completely unknown. Here, we report the isolation of the first representative of the termite group 1 (TG1) phylum from sterile-filtered gut homogenates of a humivorous scarab beetle larva. Strain Pei191T is a mesophilic, obligately anaerobic ultramicrobacterium with a gram-negative cell envelope. Cells are typically rod shaped, but cultures are pleomorphic in all growth phases (0.3 to 2.5 μm long and 0.17 to 0.3 μm wide). The isolate grows heterotrophically on sugars and ferments D-galactose, D-glucose, D-fructose, D-glucosamine, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine to acetate, ethanol, hydrogen, and alanine as major products but only if amino acids are present in the medium. PCR-based screening and comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain Pei191T belongs to the "intestinal cluster," a lineage of hitherto uncultivated bacteria present in arthropod and mammalian gut systems. It is only distantly related to the previously described so-called "endomicrobia" lineage, which comprises mainly uncultivated endosymbionts of termite gut flagellates. We propose the name "Elusimicrobium minutum" gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain, Pei191T = ATCC BAA-1559T = JCM 14958T) for the first isolate of this deep-branching lineage and the name "Elusimicrobia" phyl. nov. for the former TG1 phylum.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIsoptera 3aScarabaeidae 3aacetates 3aalanine 3abacteria 3adigestive system 3aendosymbionts 3aethanol 3afructose 3ahydrogen 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA 3ascreening 3asequence analysis1 aHerlemann, Daniel P.R.1 aMörschel, Erhard1 aMaier, Uwe G.1 aBrune, Andreas0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 May 1, v. 75, no. 9 p.2831-2840dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02697-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02790naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011500164300001600279500001500295520153800310650002201848650001401870650002501884650002401909650001801933650002301951650002301974650002101997650001002018653001202028653001002040653001502050700002102065700002202086700001602108773007902124852000902203856008502212930003302297945001302330946001302343655001202356IND2060318320221118174435.0971029s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206031832DNAL7 a10.1080/019041697093652912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCieslinski, G.10aLow molecular weight organic acids released from roots of durum wheat and flax into sterile nutrient solutions  ap. 753-764.  a2019-12-04  aKnowledge of the composition and quantity of organic substances released from roots of different plant species is necessary for understanding the chemical and biological processes in the rhizosphere. The present study was undertaken to quantify low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) released from roots of five cultivars/lines of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum L.): Kyle, Sceptre, DT618, DT627, and DT637 and four cultivars/lines of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.): Somme, Flanders, AC Emerson, and YSED 2. Plants were grown in sterile nutrient solution cultures and amounts of organic acids exuded by roots were analyzed by gas chromatography. The LMWOAs varied significantly among both durum wheat and flax cultivars and oxalic, malonic, fumaric, succinic, acetic, malic, citric and tartaric acids were detected in root exudates of both species. Generally, oxalic and acetic acids were predominant in durum wheat exudates and oxalic, acetic and malic acids were predominant in flax root exudates. High oxalic acid concentrations occurred in root exudates of durum wheat cultivars DT627 and DT637, and flax cultivar YSED 2. Compared with the other durum wheat cultivars, Kyle released the lowest total amount of LMWOAs, whereas among the flax cultivars, YSED 2 had the highest total amount of acids secreted from roots. The data showed that the release of LMWOAs from roots was cultivar dependent. The results provide valuable background information for studying the role of root exudates in soil-plant relationships. 3aTriticum turgidum 3acultivars 3amonocarboxylic acids 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aroot exudates 3adicarboxylic acids 3anutrient solutions 3aroot shoot ratio 3aroots 0arelease 0alines 0adry matter1 aVan Rees, K.C.J.1 aSzmigielska, A.M.1 aHuang, P.M.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1997, v. 20, no. 6 p.753-764x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041697093652913Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01399naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002100132245013900153300001400292500002400306500001500330520008900345650001400434650001200448650003200460650001000492650002400502650002800526651002100554653003100575653002400606653001800630653012300648653002400771653002500795700002500820773007100845852000900916939003300925945000800958946001100966655001200977991632015370742620221118174029.0840731s1978    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840048652DNAL7 a6405212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBondarenko, S.K.10aLife-cycle of the cestode Wardium calumnacantha (Schmidt, 1963) comb. n.

Aggregation of unfolded β-lactoglobulin was found to be rate limiting on heating aqueous protein solutions, while stoichiometric additions of calcium indicated that the unfolding reaction was limiting. Increased binding of calcium reduced the zeta potential of β-lactoglobulin to a minimum of -5 mV, resulting in first-order denaturation/aggregation kinetics at pH 7.0. Thiol-disulphide interchange reactions had a positive effect on the aggregation of unfolded β-lactoglobulin at low protein concentrations and low ionic strength. In the presence of calcium, the absence of thiol-disulphide interchange reactions did not affect the protein aggregation kinetics. Thiol-disulphide interchange reactions had little effect on storage modulus development of heated β-lactoglobulin (3%, w/w) acid gels; however, they enhanced the strain stability. Results showed the importance of non-specific forces in controlling the heat-induced aggregation of unfolded β-lactoglobulin. 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3adisulfide bonds 3aprotein aggregates 3areaction kinetics 3achemical reactions 3acalcium 3adenaturation 3aheat treatment 3athiols 3agelation 0aN-ethylmaleimide 0alactoglobulins1 aO'Kennedy, B.T.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2007 Sept., v. 17, no. 9 p.1034-1042dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2006.12.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01716naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245005700131300001400188300002200202500001500224520085300239650001701092650002901109650002601138650001701164650001301181650002301194650001201217653001701229773006901246852000901315939003301324945000801357946001301365655001201378991632010780742620221118173917.0861107e198505  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860114092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotil, K.J.10aAggressive nutritional therapy in growth retardation  ap. 75-84.  ap. 75-84. charts.  a2019-12-05  aA review of published studies of the use of therapeutic diets for managing or preventing childhood growth retardation describes the growth process and its biological regulation, identifies diseases requiring nutritional intervention, provides guidelines for such intervention, and recommends specific modalities for nutritionally rehabilitating infant and child growth failure.

Processing of milk into yoghurt, the addition of FOS alone and storage for 28 d did not significantly affect CLA isomer formation in yoghurts (P>0.05). However, significant increases in both isomer formation were obtained by using L. acidophilus or B. animalis in yoghurt manufacture (P<0.05).

While mozzarella cheese behaves as a semisolid at room temperature, it behaves mostly as a liquid at higher temperatures (typically greater than 40 °C). The rheological data obtained from the various pieces of rheometers were compared. Differences among the various data sets were observed and these were demonstrated to be due to the inherent changes to the material structure during testing and to the changes in the physical properties of the cheese at different temperatures. Mozzarella cheese is a viscoelastoplastic material at room temperature, which becomes viscoelastic at about 60 °C. Its yield stress gradually decreases with increase of temperature pointing to structural changes that occur at elevated temperatures. A Herchel-Buckley viscoplastic rheological model was found to describe adequately its rheology. 3amozzarella cheese 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity 3amodel food systems 3aheat treatment 3astress relaxation 3ashear stress 3adeformation1 aHatzikiriakos, S.G.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2007 Sept., v. 17, no. 9 p.1063-1072dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.01.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02949naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001600167245023000183300001800413500002400431500001500455520121400470650004801684650004401732650001801776650001601794650001401810650002901824650003001853650001601883650003001899650004501929650002101974650001901995650002902014650003102043653002402074700001502098700001402113700001502127700001602142773010602158852000902264856008902273930003302362945002502395946001102420655001202431IND4397879620221118174359.0071116e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439787962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ5011 aTabasco, R.10aSelective enumeration and identification of mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei and Bifidobacterium lactis in fermented milk  ap. 1107-1114.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study describes selective plating methodologies for enumeration of mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei and Bifidobacterium lactis in fermented milk based on selective antibiotic-free media. Enumeration of S. thermophilus was performed using M17-lactose. MRS-fructose was suitable for enumeration of L. bulgaricus and MRS-maltose for differentiation between L. acidophilus and L. paracasei. The selective enumeration of B. lactis was obtained using MRS-raffinose containing 0.05% LiCl. The bacterial counts obtained using selective methods were equivalent to those under optimum culture conditions at a probability level of 95%. Performance of the methods was verified in fermented milk products where identification of the enumerated species was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. This study shows that combination of species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis has great detection and identification potential for verification of accurate species labelling in fermented milk without prior isolation of the bacteria. 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afood analysis 3aantibiotics 3adetection 3amultiple strain starters 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aplate count 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aLactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei 3afood composition 3afermented milk 3aBifidobacterium animalis 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 0agel electrophoresis1 aPaarup, T.1 aJaner, C.1 aPelaez, C.1 aRequena, T.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2007 Sept., v. 17, no. 9 p.1107-1114dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.01.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01506naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245003900133300001600172300003000188500001500218520058600233650001300819650002200832650000900854650001100863650003200874650002600906650000900932650001300941650001100954650001400965653001900979773007100998852000901069939003301078945000801111946001301119655001201132991632009940742620221118174343.0880516e198705  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880008362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandra, R.K.10aTrace elements and immune response  ap. 118-125.  ap. 118-125. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: Nutrition is a critical determinant of immunocompetence and risk of infection.

To measure the consequences of a severe thermal stress during development on male reproduction, a cold shock (1 h at -18 °C) was tested on Dinarmus basalis pupae. D. basalis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) is a parasitoid wasp in which sperm management in both male and female is of prime importance. After a cold shock, developmental success was reduced, with a quarter of cold-shocked males not emerging correctly. The stress effects were estimated at the level of sperm stock in seminal vesicles of males at different ages and on the ability of 2-day-old males to access females in single and multiple mating and in male-male competition. Cold-shocked males had a reduced sperm stock compared to control males and this difference persisted with age. The rate of sperm production was similar in both groups. The consequences of a cold shock on male reproductive ability were perceptible in multiple mating and male-male competition but not in single mating. Cold-shocked males were at a disadvantage, inseminating fewer females and copulating less frequently. Finally, male pupae of D. basalis were able to withstand severe temperature stresses and their reproductive functions were partially preserved. 3aDinarmus basalis 3aparasitoids 3amales 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa 3amating behavior 3amating competitiveness 3aage 3apupae 3acold stress 3apupal development 3ainsect reproduction 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aCold Temperature 2aFemale 2aMale 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSperm Count 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 2aWaspsxphysiology 0asperm supply 0asperm stock 0amultiple mating 0amale mating ability 0amale fitness1 aBressac, C.1 aChevrier, C.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2007 Oct., v. 53, no. 10 p.1008-1015dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2007.05.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080102b20080202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/01/02  aNon-US 7aarticle01767naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245005000131300001400181300002200195520102700217650001901244650001401263650001101277650002601288653003101314773006901345852000901414939003301423945000801456946001301464655001201477991632008700742620221118174346.0880126e198603  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870026232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, L.H.10aTrace minerals and outcome of human pregnancy  ap. 72-77.  ap. 72-77. charts.  aExtract: The known effects of trace minerals on the outcome of pregnancy have been reviewed. Ethical and methodologic constraints on research in this area are such that minimal information is available. Maternal iron deficiency is common, and while its effects on neonatal iron status are not severe, other reported adverse sequelae include reduced pregnancy weight gain, short gestational age, maternal and neonatal complications of pregnancy, low birth weight, and impaired neonatal immune status. Low maternal intakes of copper, manganese, and selenium have not been associated with adverse outcomes of pregnancy, but the possibility that chromium deficiency is relatively common in pregnancy needs further investigation. Excessive maternal exposure to lead clearly produces harmful effects on the fetus. Supplementation of the pregnant woman's diet with fluoride appears to increase fetal and neonatal fluoride content, and the potential benefits to the child's dental health warrant additional investigations.(author) 3atrace elements 3apregnancy 3ahumans 3anutrient deficiencies 0atrace element deficiencies0 tClinical nutrition.g1986 , v. 5, no. 2 p.72-77x0733-23277nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880126c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01479naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245003400134300001600168300002400184520071300208650002300921650001800944650002100962653001500983653002700998700001801025773007101043852000901114939003301123945000801156946001301164655001201177991632008530742620221118174316.0880420e198612  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880001632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobson, H.N.10aPattern analysis in nutrition  ap. 249-253.  ap. 249-253. charts.  aExtract: As the research hypotheses of today's scientists become more complex, methods of developing more complex and sophisticated variables is mandated.

The techniques for the management of adult patients on home parenteral nutrition programs continues to evolve. Home parenteral nutrition can be of benefit to patients with short-bowel syndrome, motility disorders, Crohn's disease, enteral fistulas, intractable diarrhea, and malabsorption. One of the most important factors is adequate training to prepare patients for discharge. It is inappropriate to consider patients who are senile, psychotic, depressed, unable to master the necessary techniques, or have no family members to assist with home parenteral nutrition. Acceptable patients are stabilized with a solution before discharge and are taught to monitor fluid status at home. Nutritional requirements may be altered as patients' gastrointestinal absorption increases, necessitating adjustment of parenteral and enteral intake. Support is provided by a team approach that includes a nurse clinician, a medical social worker, a pharmacist, and a visting nurse. The above personnel may be part of the outpatient assessment during follow-up visits. The data on 139 patients receiving home parenteral nutrition at UCLA Medical Center during 1985 to 1986 are presented. Information on morbidity, duration of treatment, mortality, and discontinuation of nutritional support is reviewed.(author) 3aparenteral feeding 3adigestive system diseases 3aadults 0ahome care0 tClinical nutrition.g1987 , v. 6, no. 1 p.28-35x0733-23277nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880420c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01241naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245002700131300001600158300002100174520053600195650001900731650002300750650003100773653002500804773007100829852000900900939003300909945000800942946001300950655001200963991632008240742620221118174335.0880420e198609  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880001562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosma, J.F.10aDevelopment of feeding  ap. 210-218.  ap. 210-218. ill.  aExtract: Infant feeding practices are a critical component of early childhood health and well being. At each stage of growth infants are differentially able to ingest foods that vary in texture and particle size. Through behavioral cues, they communicate their level of oral-motor readiness to their parent or care person. Consequently, feeding is a developmental process in which both infants and care persons play active roles. While suckle feeding has been extensively studied little is known about transitional feeding.(author) 3ainfant feeding 3ainfant development 3aparent-child relationships 0atransitional feeding0 tClinical nutrition.g1986 , v. 5, no. 5 p.210-218x0733-23277nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880420c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02735naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001700196245013700213300001800350500002400368520113000392650002201522650000801544650001601552650001901568650001601587650001601603650001301619650001401632650002301646650004201669650001201711650002801723650002101751650001101772650002201783650000901805650002101814650002201835650001701857653002301874700001701897773009901914852000902013856009002022930003302112945002502145946001102170655001202181IND4397883120221118174350.0071116e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439788312DNAL7 a176285872pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2007.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL001 0aL3001 aShintani, Y.10aRelationship between rapid cold-hardening and cold acclimation in the eggs of the yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris  ap. 1055-1062.  aIncludes references  aRapid cold-hardening (RCH) and cold acclimation (ACC) were examined in eggs of the yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris (Pascoe) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). When eggs incubated at 25 °C were transferred directly to conditions of -22 °C for 2 h, less than 30% survived, whereas exposure to 0 °C for 4 h prior to transfer to -22 °C increased survival to nearly 60%. The rapidly enhanced cold tolerance (RCH) was transient and lost rapidly after 1 h at 25 °C. Incubation at 15.5 °C for 9 days (ACC) also enhanced cold tolerance. Comparison of the cold tolerance of non-treated eggs and eggs pre-treated to give RCH, ACC, or ACC+RCH allowed the relationship between the two hardening processes to be determined. At a mild subzero temperature (-10 °C) an RCH effect was not detected, whereas only RCH is effective at the severest subzero temperature just above the SCP (-26 °C). At intermediate temperatures (-16, -22 and -25 °C), ACC and RCH enhanced survival in combination. Therefore, the two hardening processes have different physiological bases but operate concomitantly over a wide temperature range. 3aPsacothea hilaris 3aova 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3aacclimation 3atemperature 3aduration 3amortality 3asupercooling point 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aCold Temperature 2aFemale 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aMale 2aOvumxphysiology 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTime Factors 0afreeze intolerance1 aIshikawa, Y.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2007 Oct., v. 53, no. 10 p.1055-1062dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2007.05.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20080104b20080202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/01/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03687naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100002100187245010300208300001800311500002400329500001500353520163400368650002802002650001202030650001602042650002102058650001802079650001102097650001102108650002502119650002202144650002302166650001202189650001202201650002802213650003302241650002702274650002602301650002402327650002502351650001802376650002902394650001302423650003502436650002502471650003402496653002402530653002702554653003602581653002502617653002802642700002502670700001902695700002002714773009902734852000902833856009002842930003302932945002502965946001102990655001203001IND4397882220221118174314.0071116e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439788222DNAL7 a176406632pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2007.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL0011 aRuiz-Sanchez, E.10aTransepithelial transport of salicylate by the Malpighian tubules of insects from different orders  ap. 1034-1045.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe organic anion salicylate is a plant secondary metabolite that protects plants against phytophagous insects. In this study, a combination of salicylate-selective microelectrodes and a radioisotope tracer technique was used to study the transepithelial transport of salicylate by the Malpighian tubules of 10 species of insects from five orders. Our results show that salicylate is transported into the lumen of the Malpighian tubules in all the species evaluated, except Rhodnius prolixus. The transepithelial transport of salicylate by the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila simulans, Drosophila erecta, Drosophila sechellia, and Acheta domesticus was saturable, Na+-dependent and inhibited by α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. This transport system resembles that previously found in tubules of Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast, transepithelial transport of salicylate by Malpighian tubules of Tenebrio molitor, Plagiodera versicolora, Aedes aegypti, and Trichoplusia ni was unaffected by Na+-free bathing saline. The presence of both salicylate and salicylate metabolites in the secreted fluid samples from the Malpighian tubules of A. domesticus, R. prolixus, T. molitor, and T. ni indicates that insect Malpighian tubules may both transport and metabolize salicylate. The highest capacities to rid the hemolymph of salicylate were found in T. molitor, P. versicolora and Drosphila spp. Our results suggest that transport of salicylate by the Malpighian tubules might contribute to elimination of this organic anion from the hemolymph, particularly in some species that encounter high levels of organic anion in the diet. 3ainterspecific variation 3aInsecta 3asalicylates 3aepithelial cells 3aion transport 3aanions 3asodium 3ametabolic inhibitors 3aelectrophysiology 3aMalpighian tubules 3ainsects 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxmetabolism. 2aCoumaric Acidsxpharmacology 2aDrosophilaxmetabolism 2aHemolymphxmetabolism 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInsectaxmetabolism. 2aIon Transport 2aIon-Selective Electrodes 2aKinetics 2aMalpighian Tubulesxmetabolism 2aRhodniusxmetabolism 2aSalicylatesxpharmacokinetics 0aspecies differences 0asalicylate elimination 0aα-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid 0asalicylate transport 0aorganic anion transport1 aVan Walderveen, M.C.1 aLivingston, A.1 aO'Donnell, M.J.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2007 Oct., v. 53, no. 10 p.1034-1045dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2007.05.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080103b20080202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/01/02  aNon-US 7aarticle01952naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245013100124300001500255500001500270520095200285650001301237650002601250650002301276650002201299650003001321650001801351650003601369650001401405650002201419653000801441773008701449852000901536930003301545945001301578946001101591655001201602IND2207342420221118174020.0001017e200002  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220734242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, H.J.10aTissue print hybridisation and reverse transcriptase PCR in the detection of infectious bursal disease virus in bursal tissues  ap. 99-101.  a2019-12-05  aThe genome segments of infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV) in the bursa of Fabricius from experimently infected chickens or field samples were detected by tissue print hybridization (TPH) with subsequent reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bursae were imprinted onto nylon membrane and then hybridized with a cloned digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cDNA probe. Tissue prints on nylon membrane were readily distinguished from control prints by color development and differences in signal intensity. In order to verify the TPH test, RT-PCR was used to amplify a 643-base pair fragment on the vp2 gene of IBDV in the bursa of Fabricius. With all isolates, a cDNA fragment of 643 bp long was generated as expected and further confirmed the specificity of TPH. Our results suggest that a large number of field samples or selected tissues can be rapidly examined by TPR technique when combined with a cloned DIG-labeled cDNA probe. 3achickens 3adiagnostic techniques 3abursa of Fabricius 3acomplementary DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ahybridization 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3adetection 3adisease diagnosis 0aDNA0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2000 Feb., v. 68, no. 1 p.99-101x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02857naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100003000129245007700159300001400236500001500250520104200265650001401307650002301321650002301344650001001367650001201377650001401389650001101403650002301414650000901437650001401446650001201460650002501472650001001497650001201507650002101519650004601540650005901586650001101645650005201656650003601708650003501744650001401779650006701793650002401860650001001884650005101894653001701945653001901962653001801981653001001999700001902009700002102028700001802049773008602067852000902153930003302162945001302195946001102208655001202219IND2207342020221118174033.0001017e200002  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220734202DNAL7 a106847622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Charles Rochester.10aEnteric colonisation following natural exposure to Campylobacter in pigs  ap. 75-78.  a2019-12-05  aA survey was conducted to establish the prevalence of Campylobacter in pigs from an integrated commercial hog farm. This study was carried out in four different groups of pigs: 1) adult gilts (50); 2) pregnant sows (9); 3) piglets at day-of-birth (73); 4) weaned piglets (20). Rectal and/or caecal samples were collected from each pig. Campylobacter was cultured and enumerated from such samples using Bolton enrichment broth and Campy-Cephex agar plates. Both biochemical and serological tests were used to determine Campylobacter species. Gilts had a 76 per cent incidence of Campylobacter with a mean of 76.3 per cent for C. jejuni, 21 per cent for C. coli and 2.6 per cent for C. lari. Pregnant saws had a 100 per cent incidence of Campylobacter with a mean of 87 per cent for C. jejuni and 13 per cent for C. coli. Newborn piglets had a 57.8 per cent incidence of Campylobacter, rising to 100 per cent by the time of weaning. Thus it appears that pigs, from the day of birth, are highly susceptible to colonisation by Campylobacter. 3ainfection 3aCampylobacter coli 3adisease prevalence 3acecum 3asurveys 3apregnancy 3arectum 3aCampylobacter lari 3asows 3aincidence 3apiglets 3aCampylobacter jejuni 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCampylobacterxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aHelicobacter pylorixpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmicrobiology 2aIntestine, Smallxmicrobiology 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Infectiousxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxmicrobiologyxphysiopathology. 0acolonization 0aidentification 0aCampylobacter 0aswine1 aAnderson, H.R.1 aNisbet, David R.1 aStanker, L.H.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2000 Feb., v. 68, no. 1 p.75-78x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02111naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245008000133300001600213520132100229650001701550650001701567650001401584650001401598650001501612650001201627650001001639653001401649773007101663852000901734939003301743945000801776946001301784655001201797991632006770742620221118174042.0900315e198909  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900003722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherman, S.S.10aOvarian hormone deficiency and bone: a review of studies in humans and rats  ap. 203-209.  aAge-related bone loss appears to be a universal phenomenon reflecting an impairment in the mechanisms maintaining calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Although the problems of bone loss and osteoporosis are shared by the aging male population, the impact on women is much more profound and pervasive. In women the menopause plays a pivotal role in the etiology of osteoporosis, because a dramatic acceleration of bone loss occurs at that time. The ovariectomized rat has been used as a model to study human postmenopausal osteoporosis, because as in humans, gonadal hormone insufficiency leads to an enhancement in bone resorption and a reduction in bone density. The vitamin D endocrine system and specifically 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, play a central role in the regulation of bone mineral homeostasis. This article summarizes various physiological and nutritional aspects relating to bone loss in the context of the vitamin D endocrine system. Also reviewed is a study from our laboratory using the ovariectomized retired breeder rat as a model of bone loss in middle-aged women. We have evaluated (1) the physiological effects of ovariectomy on skeletal dynamics and (2) the efficacy of exogenous dietary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in preventing bone loss in this mature rat model. 3aosteoporosis 3abone density 3aestrogens 3avitamin D 3ametabolism 3acalcium 3awomen 0abone loss0 tClinical nutrition.g1989 , v. 8, no. 5 p.203-209x0733-23277nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03302naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162100001600171245013700187300001800324500002400342500001500366520153100381650002501912650002601937650002201963650001801985650001802003650002502021650003002046650003002076650002802106650003802134650002702172650002802199650001302227650001702240653001602257653001602273653002902289653002202318700002802340700003202368700002302400700002002423700001902443773011102462852000902573856008302582930003302665945002502698946001302723655001202736IND4397810520221118173747.0071113e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439781052DNAL7 a189441772pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-97-9-11192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aKox, L.F.F.10aDiagnostic Values and Utility of Immunological, Morphological, and Molecular Methods for In Planta Detection of Phytophthora ramorum  ap. 1119-1129.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, six methods for the detection of Phytophthora ramorum in planta were compared using naturally infested rhododendron plant material. The methods included two immunological methods, one an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the other using a lateral flow format (LFD). Three molecular tests based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TaqMan chemistry also were assessed, including two assays designed for specific detection of P. ramorum and one designed for genus-level detection of Phytophthora. Isolation followed by morphological identification also was assessed. The diagnostic values of each of the methods, evaluated based on diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, were calculated based upon the test results from 148 field samples. The “gold standard” used for the calculations was the final diagnosis, which was based on either a positive PCR result or successful isolation of P. ramorum. The Phytophthora spp. TaqMan PCR, ELISA, and LFD had higher sensitivities than the P. ramorum-specific methods, which make them useful as prescreening methods, where positive results must be confirmed by PCR or isolation. The article discusses practical advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods and how they are valuable in the diagnostic process, according to the circumstances of use (that is, diagnosis or surveillance) and in relation to the prevalence of P. ramorum infestation in the population to be tested. 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease detection 3anursery crops 3aserodiagnosis 3adisease surveillance 3afungal diseases of plants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apathogen identification 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aornamental woody plants 3aaccuracy 3aRhododendron 0amethodology 0anew methods 0alateral flow immunoassay 0adisease diagnosis1 aBrouwershaven, I.R. van1 aVossenberg, B.T.L.H. van de1 aBeld, H.E. van den1 aBonants, P.J.M.1 aGruyter, J. de0 tPhytopathology.g2007 Sept., v. 97, no. 9 p.1119-1129dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-97-9-11193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle02864naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015800125300001600283500001500299520145000314650000901764650002501773650002201798650002301820650002501843650001901868650002201887650001401909650002201923653002801945653005501973653001802028653002402046653003302070653003002103653001902133653001502152700001702167700001702184700001802201700001702219773008002236852000902316930003302325945001302358946001102371655001202382IND2056368020221118173840.0970408e199610  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205636802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, M.W.10aSopE, a secreted protein of Salmonella dublin, is translocated into the target eukaryotic cell via a sip-dependent mechanism and promotes bacterial entry  ap. 327-338.  a2019-12-05  aThe entry of Salmonella into cultured epithelial cells is dependent on genes located in several adjacent chromosomal loci. One of these loci encodes the recently identified secretory proteins, denoted Sips (Salmonella invasion proteins). SipB,C,D proteins are essential for the ability of the pathogen to invade epithelial cells. To examine if additional invasion-associated proteins were secreted by Salmonella dublin, the genes encoding already characterized secretory proteins were inactivated to facilitate this analysis. The proteins produced and secreted by a double fliM/polar sipB mutant of S. dublin were analysed; this revealed a set of novel secreted proteins. These proteins, which we denoted Sops (Salmonella outer proteins), formed large filamentous aggregates in the medium of bacterial culture growing at 37 degrees C. These aggregates contained five predominant proteins. Here we report the identification and characterization of one of these proteins, SopE, which is a novel invasion-associated secretory protein of S. dublin. A specific sopE mutant of S. dublin was found to be defective for invasion into epithelial cells. Upon interaction of Salmonella with HeLa cells, SopE was found to be translocated into the cytoplasm of the target cell by extracellular bacteria. The translocation of SopE was shown to be dependent on the Sip proteins because a polar sipB mutant did not translocate SopE across the HeLa cell membrane. 3aloci 3aamino acid sequences 3aprotein transport 3abacterial proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3acell membranes 3aprotein secretion 3avirulence 3aSalmonella Dublin 0amolecular sequence data 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin 0acell invasion 0avirulence effectors 0asalmonella invasion proteins 0asalmonella outer proteins 0agenbank/l78932 0ahela cells1 aRosqvist, R.1 aMullan, P.B.1 aEdwards, M.H.1 aGalyov, E.E.0 tMolecular microbiology.g1996 Oct., v. 22, no. 2 p.327-338x0950-382X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle01752naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009300165300001600258520080300274650001401077650002601091653001801117653002301135653002801158700002601186773009801212852000901310856008501319930003301404946001301437655001201450IND4419050120221118173821.0090410e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441905012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11062-009-9067-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorogod, S.

The modelled neuron contained a monostable passive soma and dendrites with the bistable membrane, whose active properties were due to the presence of NMDA-type channels responsible for a persistent inward current. The geometrical prerequisite for tristability was the metrical asymmetry due to the difference between the dendritic lengths. This feature caused unequal coupling of lateral currents, endowing the whole-cell input current-voltage relation with additional stable steady states. The existence of a certain range of geometrical parameters of the dendrites critical for whole-cell tristability was found. 3adendrites 3aelectrical properties 0aneuron models 0ametrical asymmetry 0aelectrical tristability1 aChernetchenko, D.

In an attempt to establish correlates of protective immunity, two commonly proposed parameters predictive of immunity were measured: (1) serologic responses (ELISA and neutralizing antibodies), (2) frequency of gamma interferon-producing cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction. The vaccines compared consisted of two commercially available products that are regularly marketed in Spain: one modified live virus and one killed vaccine. The efficacy assay was carried out by vaccinating twice 3 weeks apart groups of 5 and-a-half month-old female swine and then challenging them with a European type 1 PRRSV strain (Lelystad). The results obtained indicate that the modified live virus vaccine was the only type of vaccine capable of establishing protective immunity, as measured by viral load in blood and tissues. The killed vaccine, in spite of this product evoking a spontaneous interferon-gamma response and post-challenge titers of virus-neutralizing antibody, evoked no measurable protective immunity. In the case of the modified live vaccine, the protection exhibited did not appear to be based on humoral but rather on cell-mediated immunity. 3aveterinary drugs 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aserodiagnosis 3ainactivated vaccines 3adrug evaluation 3aviremia 3alive vaccines 3acell-mediated immunity 3avaccination 3ainterferons 3aswine 3aSpain 0avaccines 0agamma interferon 0aviral challenge1 aAlvarez Garcia, E.1 aLuque, I.D.1 aChristopher-Hennings, J.1 aDoster, A.1 aBrito, M.1 aOsorio, F.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2007 July 20, v. 123, no. 1-3 p.69-85dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.02.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02116naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002300148245018900171300001800360500002400378520097900402650001501381650001401396650004301410650001901453650001901472650001701491650001501508650000701523650001101530650001201541650001601553773010001569852000901669856008801678655001201766IND4436221820221118174159.0100430s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443622182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2010.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCalley, David V.10aStudy of the selectivity, retention mechanisms and performance of alternative silica-based stationary phases for separation of ionised solutes in hydrophilic interaction chromatography  ap. 3408-3417.  aIncludes references  aThe separation of a mixture of neutral, strongly acidic and strongly basic compounds was studied in hydrophilic interaction chromatography using a bare silica phase, and bonded silica phases with diol, zwitterionic, amide and hydrophilic/hydrophobic groups. The mobile phase was acetonitrile-ammonium formate buffer at low pH. Differences in selectivity between these various columns indicate that the stationary phase cannot function merely as an inert support for a water layer into which the solutes partition from the bulk mobile phase. Attempts to fit the retention data to equations which describe either partition or adsorption mechanisms were inconclusive. Ion exchange was a significant contributor to the retention of ionised bases on all columns studied. Van Deemter plots indicated that the efficiency as a function of flow rate varied between the columns, which might be attributable in part to the presence of either monomeric or polymeric bonded phase layers. 3aadsorption 3aequations 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aion exchange 3aionization 3apH 3asilica 3asolutes 3azwitterions0 tJournal of chromatography.g2010 May 14, v. 1217, no. 20 p.3408-3417dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2010.03.0113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03058naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001400157245008100171300001600252500002400268500001500292520155300307650001901860650002601879650001901905650000901924650000901933650001701942650001601959650002301975650001001998650001702008650002502025650002602050650002202076650002302098653002802121653002602149653002802175653001202203700002002215700001302235700001702248773009702265852000902362856008802371930003302459945002502492946001102517655001202528IND4397814720221118174614.0071113e20070720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439781472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aMalik, S.10aPresence and diversity of the β-lactamase gene in cat and dog staphylococci  ap. 162-168.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStaphylococci are part of the normal microflora of humans and animals and some are potential pathogens that have become resistant to almost all known antibiotics. Despite the widespread reports of penicillin resistance in cat and dog staphylococci, the mechanism underlying penicillin resistance has not been examined. This study was aimed at investigating the molecular basis of resistance to penicillin in cat and dog staphylococcal isolates that showed phenotypic resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. An 861 bp fragment of the structural blaZ gene which codes for β-lactamase production in staphylococci was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the products were sequenced. Sequenced fragments were analysed by protein signature typing and sequences were compared to published blaZ sequences of human and bovine staphylococcal strains held in a public database. Four known protein signature types (1, 3, 5 and 6) and one new type (12) were identified in this study. When sequences were compared with published blaZ sequences, gene phylogenetic analysis revealed three major groups. The four variants of β-lactamases types (A, B, C and D) belonged to each major group except for types A and D which were both in group II. These findings confirm that the blaZ gene is responsible for β-lactamase production leading to subsequent resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in feline and canine staphylococci and that the gene shows similar diversity and relatedness as found with blaZ sequences obtained from human and bovine staphylococci. 3aStaphylococcus 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3acats 3adogs 3adog diseases 3apenicillins 3astrain differences 3agenes 3acat diseases 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3amicrobial genetics 0abeta-lactam antibiotics 0apenicillin resistance 0amolecular sequence data 0astrains1 aChristensen, H.1 aPeng, H.1 aBarton, M.D.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2007 July 20, v. 123, no. 1-3 p.162-168dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.02.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02631naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001400166245019800180300001600378500002400394500001500418520106400433650002001497650003001517650002701547650002701574650002101601650002301622650001201645650001601657650002601673650001101699650001601710650002201726653002901748700001701777700001701794700001701811700001601828700001801844773009701862852000901959856008801968930003302056945002502089946001102114655001202125IND4397817920221118174439.0071113e20070720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439781792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8321 aDziva, F.10aVaccination of calves with EspA, a key colonisation factor of Escherichia coli O157:H7, induces antigen-specific humoral responses but does not confer protection against intestinal colonisation  ap. 254-261.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEnterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infections in humans are frequently associated with direct or indirect contact with ruminant faeces and may result in haemorrhagic colitis and severe renal and neurological sequelae. Broadly cross-protective vaccines for control of EHEC do not yet exist and the molecular mechanisms that influence bacterial persistence in the intestines of ruminants are incompletely understood. We sought to determine the role in colonisation and protective efficacy of EspA, which forms a filamentous extension of the locus of enterocyte effacement-encoded type III secretion system that injects EHEC proteins into enterocytes. A non-polar deletion of espA severely impaired the ability of E. coli O157:H7 to colonise the intestines of calves.

To further investigate the mechanisms involved in parental genome separation, complex hybrids between synthetic Brassica allohexaploids (2n = 54, AABBCC) from three sources and O. violaceus were obtained and characterized. METHODS: Genomic in situ hybridization, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) were used to explore chromosomal/genomic components and rRNA gene expression of the complex hybrids and their progenies. KEY RESULTS: Complex hybrids with variable fertility exhibited phenotypes that were different from the female allohexaploids and expressed some traits from O. violaceus. These hybrids were mixoploids (2n = 34-46) and retained partial complements of allohexaploids, including whole chromosomes of the A and B genomes and some of the C genome but no intact O. violaceus chromosomes; AFLP bands specific for O. violaceus, novel for two parents and absent in hexaploids were detected. The complex hybrids produced progenies with chromosomes/genomic complements biased to B. juncea (2n = 36, AABB) and novel B. juncea lines with two genomes of different origins. The expression of rRNA genes from B. nigra was revealed in all allohexaploids and complex hybrids, showing that the hierarchy of nucleolar dominance (B. nigra, BB > B. rapa, AA > B. oleracea, CC) in Brassica allotetraploids was still valid in these plants. CONCLUSIONS: The chromosomes of three genomes in these synthetic Brassica allohexaploids showed different genome-specific stabilities (B > A > C) under induction of alien chromosome elimination in crosses with O. violaceus, which was possibly affected by nucleolar dominance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3achromosome elimination 3achromosomes 3acrossing 3agene expression 3agenome 3ahexaploidy 3ahybrids 3ain situ hybridization 3ameiosis 3amitosis 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aBrassicaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBrassicaceaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aChromosomal Instabilityxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aHybridization, Geneticxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aPolymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformationalxgenetics 2aPolyploidy 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction1 aWang, Jing1 aLi, Zai-Yun0 tAnnals of botany.g2009 July, v. 104, no. 1 p.19-31dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcp0993Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03554naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002200183245011200205300001600317500002400333506007600357520145700433506003701890650002501927650000801952650001001960650002101970650001101991650002302002650001702025650001402042650001902056650001102075650001402086650001102100650002602111650002002137650002402157650003902181650004902220650004502269650003502314650002802349650003002377650003402407650003302441700002302474700002202497700002102519700002402540700002302564700002402587700002402611700002302635700001902658700001802677773010602695852000902801856008202810655001202892IND4434624520221207140531.0100326e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443462452DNAL7 a201541522pmid7 aPMC28454062pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.108.0648162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEklund, D.

The disruption of normal auxin biosynthesis in mouse-ear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) leads to severe abnormalities, suggesting that spatiotemporal regulation of auxin biosynthesis is fundamental for normal growth and development. We have shown previously that the induction of the SHORT-INTERNODES/STYLISH (SHI/STY) family member STY1 results in increased transcript levels of the YUCCA (YUC) family member YUC4 and also higher auxin levels and auxin biosynthesis rates in Arabidopsis seedlings. We have also shown previously that SHI/STY family members redundantly affect development of flowers and leaves. Here, we further examine the function of STY1 by analyzing its DNA and protein binding properties. Our results suggest that STY1, and most likely other SHI/STY members, are DNA binding transcriptional activators that target genes encoding proteins mediating auxin biosynthesis. This suggests that the SHI/STY family members are essential regulators of auxin-mediated leaf and flower development. Furthermore, the lack of a shoot apical meristem in seedlings carrying a fusion construct between STY1 and a repressor domain, SRDX, suggests that STY1, and other SHI/STY members, has a role in the formation and/or maintenance of the shoot apical meristem, possibly by regulating auxin levels in the embryo.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3aYucca 3aapical meristems 3aauxins 3abinding properties 3abiosynthesis 3aflowering 3agene targeting 3aleaves 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3atranscription factors 3avascular plants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aCarrier Proteinsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTrans-Activatorsxmetabolism1 aStåldal, Veronika1 aValsecchi, Isabel1 aCierlik, Izabela1 aEriksson, Caitriona1 aHiratsu, Keiichiro1 aOhme-Takagi, Masaru1 aSundström, Jens F.1 aThelander, Mattias1 aEzcurra, Inés1 aSundberg, Eva0 tplant cell.g2010 Feb., v. 22, no. 2 p.349-363dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.108.0648163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01233naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005400127500005300181520020300234650002200437650001000459650002600469650001800495650001100513650001400524650001300538650002000551650002500571653002300596653001600619653002600635700001400661700001800675700002200693773005200715852000900767930003300776945001300809946001300822655001200835IND2063079320221118173413.0980413s1995    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206307932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolemans, K.10aMaternal diabetes: consequences for the offspring  aDiscussion by workshop participants, p. 147-148.  aThis chapter examines fetal and long-term results of experimental diabetes in rats, and discusses findings in this animal model in terms of the possible long term effects of human maternal diabetes. 3adiabetes mellitus 3afetus 3along term experiments 3aanimal models 3ahumans 3apregnancy 3achildren 3amaternal effect 3agestational diabetes 0aliterature reviews 0acomparisons 0aexperimental diabetes1 aAerts, L.1 aVerhaeghe, J.1 aAssche, F.A. van.0 tDiabetes.dNew York : Raven Press, c1995.7nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01505naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004300125500005100168500001500219520044600234650001300680650001000693650001200703650001800715650002000733650002000753650001600773650001900789650001200808650001400820650001900834650001400853653002800867653002300895653002000918653002500938773005200963852000901015930003301024945001301057946001301070655001201083IND2063077720221118173429.0980413s1995    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206307772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirard, J.10aHormonal control of glucose metabolism  aDiscussion by workshop participants, p. 19-22.  a2019-12-06  aThis chapter briefly reviews the mechanisms by which the rate of glucose production and uptake is finely regulated during a 24 hour period in normal resting humans, and how they are coordinated by hormones and alternative substrates to maintain the plasma glucose level within a normal range.

  1 aArriaga, S.10aImproving hexane removal by enhancing fungal development in a microbial consortium biofilter  ap. 107-115.  aThe removal of hydrophobic pollutants in biofilters is often limited by gas liquid mass transfer to the biotic aqueous phase where biodegradation occurs. It has been proposed that the use of fungi may improve their removal efficiency. To confirm this, the uptake of hexane vapors was investigated in 2.6-L perlite-packed biofilters, inoculated with a mixed culture containing bacteria and fungi, which were operated under neutral or acid conditions. For a hexane inlet load of around 140 g.m-3.h-1, elimination capacities (EC) of 60 and 100 g.m-3.h-1 were respectively reached with the neutral and acid systems. Increasing the inlet hexane load showed that the maximum EC obtained in the acid biofilter (150 g.m-3.h-1) was twice greater than in the neutral filter. The addition of bacterial inhibitors had no significant effect on EC in the acid system. The biomass in the acid biofilter was 187 mg.g-1dry perlite without an important pressure drop (26.5 mm of water.m-1reactor). The greater efficiency obtained with the acid biofilter can be related to the hydrophobic aerial hyphae which are in direct contact with the gas and can absorb the hydrophobic compounds faster than the flat bacterial biofilms. Two fungi were isolated from the acid biofilter and were identified as Cladosporium and Fusarium spp. Hexane EC of 40 g.m-3.h-1 for Cladosporium sp. and 50 g.m-3.h-1 for Fusarium sp. were obtained in short time experiments in small biofilters (0.230 L). A biomass content around 30 mg.g-1dry perlite showed the potential for hexane biofiltration of the strains. 3avolatile organic compounds 3afiltration 0abiofilter1 aRevah, S.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g2005 Apr. 5, v. 90, no. 1 p.107-115x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.204243Available from publisher's Web site  a20060125b20060202c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/01/25  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02824naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100002000154245011000174300001600284520174400300650002602044650002602070650001402096650001702110653002302127653003202150700001802182773009402200852000902294856007702303930003302380945002502413946001302438990002302451655001202474IND4376912220221118172907.0051229e20050930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437691222DNAL7 a10.1002/bit.205532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLamboursain, L.10aCritical influence of Eschscholzia californica cells nutritional state on secondary metabolite production  ap. 827-837.  aIn this study, we investigated the influence of initial internal nutrient concentrations at the time of elicitation on the ability of Eschscholzia californica (EC) cells to produce alkaloids. Three EC cell suspensions cultivated in culture media differing in their PO4(3⁻) and NO3⁻ contents were sampled daily for 12 days and analyzed for extracellular and intracellular nutrient concentrations. The ability of the cells to produce alkaloids was tested along the three cell suspension cultures. Sampled cells were then further cultured for 7 days in a production medium containing the elicitor and an extraction resin. The alkaloid production of the cells was measured 7 days post-elicitation. In the low-N medium, starch, glucose, and phosphate contents in the biomass was increased by 470, 1624 and 70%, respectively, 10 days after inoculation compared to the control culture in standard B5 medium. Cell concentration was significantly reduced from 10.3 to 8.6 millions cell/mL on this low-N medium compared to the control, nevertheless alkaloid production was multiplied by 39 at day 10 when cells were elicited. Cells grown on the low-N or low-P media accumulated 83% and 188% more carbon, respectively, than control cells at the end of the culture. This intracellular C was mainly stored in the form of starch in low-P medium and both in the form of starch and glucose in the low-N medium. The ability of EC cells to produce alkaloids upon elicitation was shown to be strongly dependent on the initial intracellular C and P content at the time of elicitation. This suggests that reproducibility and productivity during EC cell culture could be enhanced by manipulating the intracellular C and P content at the time of elicitation. 3asecondary metabolites 3abiological production 3aalkaloids 3acell culture 0aplant cell culture 0aplant secondary metabolites1 aJolicoeur, M.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g2005 Sept. 30, v. 91, no. 7 p.827-837x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.205533Available from publisher's Web site  a20060127b20060202c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/01/27  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03058naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001300154245012700167300001600294520200900310650002202319650002802341700001202369700001302381700001302394700001302407700001402420773009402434852000902528856007702537930003302614945002502647946001302672990002302685655001202708IND4376913220221118172835.0051229e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437691322DNAL7 a10.1002/bit.205102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSu, W.W.10aObserver-based online compensation of inner filter effect in monitoring fluorescence of GFP-expressing plant cell cultures  ap. 213-226.  aThe green fluorescent protein (GFP) isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is a very useful reporter for real-time bioprocess sensing. GFP culture fluorescence is a composite signal that can be influenced by factors such as culture autofluorescence, inner filter effect (IFE), and photobleaching. These factors complicate accurate estimation of GFP concentrations from the culture fluorescence. IFE is especially problematic when using GFP in monitoring transgenic plant cell suspension cultures, due to the aggregated nature of the cells and the high biomass concentration in these culture systems. Reported approaches for online compensation of IFE in monitoring culture NADH fluorescence or bioluminescence require online measurement of biomass density or culture turbidity/optical density, in addition to fluorescence/bioluminescence measurement. In this study, culture GFP fluorescence was used successfully to estimate GFP concentration and other important states in bioreactor culture of transgenic tobacco cells, while the influences of IFE and culture autofluorescence were rectified without the need for an additional biomass sensor. This was achieved by setting up a novel model-based state observer. First, we developed an improved model for a backscatter fluorescence probe that takes into account the influence of IFE and autofluorescence on reporting culture GFP concentration from online fluorescence. The state observer was then established using the extended Kalman filter (EKF), based on the fluorescence probe model, a dynamic state model of the plant cell bioreactor, and online GFP fluorescence measurement. Several versions of the observer were introduced to address practical requirements associated with monitoring GFP fluorescence of plant cell cultures. The proposed approach offers an effective means for online compensation of IFE to enable quantitative interpretation of the culture fluorescence signals for accurate reporting of GFP or GFP-fusion protein expression. 3atransgenic plants 3acell suspension culture1 aLiu, B.1 aLu, W.B.1 aXu, N.S.1 aDu, G.C.1 aTan, J.L.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g2005 July 20., v. 91, no. 2 p.213-226x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.205103Available from publisher's Web site  a20060112b20060202c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/01/12  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02922naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001800154245013900172300001600311520170600327650002502033650001602058650001502074650002002089700001902109700001502128700001702143700001302160700001702173700001602190700001502206700001802221773009302239852000902332856007702341930003302418945002502451946001302476990002302489655001202512IND4377575720221118172846.0060202e20051230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437757572DNAL7 a10.1002/bit.206682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSchroeder, M.10aDifferentiation and lineage selection of mouse embryonic stem cells in a stirred bench scale bioreactor with automated process control  ap. 920-933.  aIt is well established that embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes in vitro. ES-derived cardiomyocytes could be used for pharmaceutical and therapeutic applications, provided that they can be generated in sufficient quantity and with sufficient purity. To enable large-scale culture of ES-derived cells, we have developed a robust and scalable bioprocess that allows direct embryoid body (EB) formation in a fully controlled, stirred 2 L bioreactor following inoculation with a single cell suspension of mouse ES cells. Utilizing a pitched-blade-turbine, parameters for optimal cell expansion as well as efficient ES cell differentiation were established. Optimization of stirring conditions resulted in the generation of high-density suspension cultures containing 12.5 x 10(6) cells/mL after 9 days of differentiation. Approximately 30%-40% of the EBs formed in this process vigorously contracted, indicating robust cardiomyogenic induction. An ES cell clone carrying a recombinant DNA molecule comprised of the cardiomyocyte-restricted alpha myosin heavy chain (αMHC) promoter and a neomycin resistance gene was used to establish the utility of this bioprocess to efficiently generate ES-derived cardiomyocytes. The genetically engineered ES cells were cultured directly in the stirred bioreactor for 9 days, followed by antibiotic treatment for another 9 days. The protocol resulted in the generation of essentially pure cardiomyocyte cultures, with a total yield of 1.28 x 10(9) cells in a single 2 L bioreactor run. This study thus provides an important step towards the large-scale generation of ES-derived cells for therapeutic and industrial applications. 3aembryonic stem cells 3abioreactors 3aautomation 3aprocess control1 aNiebruegge, S.1 aWerner, A.1 aWillbold, E.1 aBurg, M.1 aRuediger, M.1 aField, L.J.1 aLehman, J.1 aZweigerdt, R.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g2005 Dec. 30, v. 92, no. 7 p.920-933x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.206683Available from publisher's Web site  a20060216b20060302c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/02/15  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02111naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001300154245006900167300001600236520116000252650001901412650002101431650001601452653002401468700002101492773009201513852000901605856007701614930003301691945002501724946001301749990002301762655001201785IND4377841820221118172916.0060213e20060105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437784182DNAL7 a10.1002/bit.207002doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aXiao, J.10aExpanded thermodynamic model for microbial true yield prediction  ap. 110-121.  aThermodynamic methods to predict true yield and stoichiometry of bacterial reactions have been widely used in biotechnology and environmental engineering. However, yield predictions are often inaccurate for certain simple organic compounds. This work evaluates an existing method and identifies the cause of prediction errors for compounds with low degree of reductance of carbon. For these compounds, carbon, not energy or reducing equivalents, constrains growth. Existing thermodynamically-based models do not account for the potential of carbon-limited growth. The improved method described here consists of four balances: carbon balance, nitrogen balance, electron balance, and energy balance. Two efficiency terms, K1 and K2 are defined and estimated from a priori analysis. The results show that K1 and K2 are nearly the same in value so that only one coefficient, K = 0.41 is used in the modified model. Comparisons with observed yields show that use of the new model and parameters results in significantly improved yield estimation based on inclusion of the carbon balance. The average estimation error is less than 6% for the data set presented. 3athermodynamics 3anutrient balance 3acell growth 0acarbon-limit growth1 aVanBriesen, J.M.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g2006 Jan. 5, v. 93, no. 1 p.110-121x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.207003Available from publisher's Web site  a20060405b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/05  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03329naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180100001400197245011200211300001600323500001500339520115300354650002101507650002201528650002401550650002601574650001701600650001601617650000901633650002001642650001801662650002101680650001701701650001901718650002301737650002001760650001701780650002401797650002701821650001001848650002101858650003901879650007201918650001201990650001302002650003702015650002102052650005702073650002402130650000902154650005602163650006502219653002102284700001802305700001802323700001602341700001902357773008102376852000902457856008402466930003302550945002502583946001102608655001202619IND4371357820221118172910.0050614e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437135782DNAL7 a159574322pmid7 a10.1080/00716605000651512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A study was set up to investigate the influence of sodium salicylate on fever and acute phase reaction after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in broiler chickens. 2. An acute phase reaction was provoked through the intravenous injection of Escherichia coli LPS. Four oral doses of sodium salicylate were tested. Apart from body temperature, other inflammation indices, such as plasma corticosterone and ceruloplasmin, serum thromboxane B2 and zinc concentrations were monitored. 3. Intravenous LPS induced a fever of about 1 degrees C. A dose-dependent attenuation of the fever response of the chickens in the salicylate treated groups was observed. LPS-injected chickens also showed elevated plasma corticosterone and ceruloplasmin, while serum thromboxane and zinc concentrations decreased. Except for thromboxane B2, no linear relationship with increasing salicylate dose could be shown for the other blood variables. 4. These data confirm that sodium salicylate is an effective antipyretic agent after injection of LPS in chickens, if used at an appropriate dosage. No dose-related change could be found for the other inflammation indices. 3abroiler chickens 3asodium salicylate 3alipopolysaccharides 3aintravenous injection 3aantipyretics 3aferroxidase 3azinc 3adrug evaluation 3adose response 3apoultry diseases 3ainflammation 3acorticosterone 3abacterial antigens 3aimmune response 3athromboxanes 3aoral administration 3aEscherichia infections 3afever 3aEscherichia coli 2aAcute-Phase Reactionxdrug therapy 2aAnalgesics, Non-Narcoticxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEscherichia coli 2aFeverxchemically inducedxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aLipopolysaccharides 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxchemically inducedxdrug therapy. 2aSodium Salicylatexadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 0abody temperature1 aDuchateau, L.1 aDe Boever, S.1 aCherlet, M.1 aBacker, P. de.0 tBritish poultry science.g2005 Apr., v. 46, no. 2 p.137-143x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00716605000651513Available from publisher's Web site  a20060911b20061003c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03411naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100002000198245009200218300001600310500001500326520144400341650001001785650001901795650002101814650002301835650001801858650001601876650001701892650000901909650001301918650001701931650001201948650001101960650002101971650001601992650001002008650001202018650004402030650002502074650003602099650001102135650003502146650002202181650000902203650003302212650003402245650003702279650003602316650003702352653002102389653001602410653001702426700002002443700001802463773008102481852000902562856008502571930003302656945002502689946001102714655001202725IND4373169520221118172833.0050810e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437316952DNAL7 a160501812pmid7 a10.1080/000716605000983272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The use of nitrofuran antibiotics in food-producing animals is prohibited within the EU. Countries in the EU, as well those intending to export food to the EU, must ensure that their products are free from nitrofuran residues. 2. As a result of recent global problems where chicken meat from a wide range of countries has been contaminated with nitrofuran metabolites, an investigation was performed to discover whether or not residues of the nitrofurans might be transferred from parent breeder chickens to their offspring broilers. 3. Four groups of broiler breeders were each treated with one of the nitrofurans: furazolidone, nitrofurazone, nitrofurantoin or furaltadone. Residues of their side-chain metabolites, AOZ, SEM, AHD and AMOZ, were detected in the fertilised eggs at concentrations up to 1567?μg/kg. 4. However, in the chicks that subsequently hatched from these eggs, residue concentrations of SEM, for example, were only found up to 26·6 and 32·5?μg/kg in liver and muscle, respectively, for 1-d-old chicks. Residue concentrations in tissues had fallen below the detection limit of the analytical method for 40-d-old broiler chicks, for all compounds except for semicarbazide (SEM, the nitrofurazone metabolite). 5. Relatively high concentrations of nitrofurans are available to the newly hatched chick through the egg yolk. However, most of these residues are neither utilised nor deposited in the liver or muscle. 3aliver 3asemicarbazones 3abroiler breeders 3apoultry production 3adrug residues 3afuraltadone 3achicken meat 3aeggs 3aegg yolk 3afurazolidone 3aprogeny 3achicks 3ahuman food chain 3ametabolites 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxpharmacokinetics 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aDrug Residuesxpharmacokinetics 2aFemale 2aFurazolidonexpharmacokinetics 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aNitrofuransxpharmacokinetics 2aNitrofurantoinxpharmacokinetics 2aNitrofurazonexpharmacokinetics 2aOxazolidinonesxpharmacokinetics 0abroiler chickens 0anitrofurans 0acontaminants1 aRhijn, J.A. van1 aKennedy, D.G.0 tBritish poultry science.g2005 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.287-292x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716605000983273Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03497naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001700198245010100215300001600316500001500332520180500347650001402152650000902166650001702175650002102192650002302213650001802236650002402254650002002278650001102298650001002309650002402319650002102343650000902364650001502373650001702388650001202405650005202417650002602469650001102495650001002506650003702516653001502553653002602568700002102594700001802615700001802633773008102651852000902732856008502741930003302826945002502859946001102884655001202895IND4371359620221118172847.0050614e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437135962DNAL7 a159574392pmid7 a10.1080/000716605000657892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aShafey, T.M.10aEffect of intensity of eggshell pigment and illuminated incubation on hatchability of brown eggs  ap. 190-198.  a2019-12-04  a1. The effects of intensity of brown eggshell pigment (light (LBP), medium (MBP) and dark (DBP)) and light intensity during incubation (low and high, 900 to 1380 and 1430 to 2080 lux, respectively) on eggshell characteristics, embryonic growth, hatchability traits, chick hatching weight and hatching time were investigated using eggs from a meat-type breeder (Hybro) flock at 32, 36 and 41 weeks of age in three trials. 2. With eggs of similar weights the intensity of brown pigment was not associated with eggshell weight and thickness, and did not influence embryo weight and egg weight loss during incubation. 3. The shade of brown pigment of eggs laid by young hens influenced the percentage hatchability (HP) of eggs incubated under light. Illuminated incubation improved HP of LBP eggs (compared with MBP and DBP eggs) from 32- and 36-week-old hens, but had no significant effect on HP of eggs from 41-week-old hens. 4. Light intensity during incubation did not influence egg weight loss. High intensity of light during incubation reduced HP and increased early death percentage (EDP) in the LBP and MBP groups, and did not influence HP and EDP in the DBP group. 5. Brown eggshell pigment and intensity of light during incubation did not influence hatching time. 6. It is concluded that the shade of brown pigment, intensity of light during incubation and age of the breeder hens influenced the hatchability performance of embryos from brown eggs. Light during incubation improved the hatchability of embryos in light brown eggs laid by young hens and the shade of brown pigment of eggs laid by older hens did not influence hatchability under illuminated incubation. 7. High intensity of light during incubation reduced hatchability of light and medium brown eggs, but not the dark brown eggs. 3aegg shell 3ahens 3apigmentation 3abroiler breeders 3apoultry production 3aembryogenesis 3aegg shell thickness 3alight intensity 3achicks 3acolor 3aembryonic mortality 3aegg hatchability 3aeggs 3aanimal age 3abirth weight 2aAnimals 2aChick Embryoxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEgg Shellxphysiology 2aFemale 2aLight 2aPigments, Biologicalxphysiology 0aincubation 0aHybro (chicken breed)1 aAl-Batshan, H.A.1 aGhannam, M.M.1 aAl-Ayed, M.S.0 tBritish poultry science.g2005 Apr., v. 46, no. 2 p.190-198x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716605000657893Available from publisher's Web site  a20060911b20061003c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03220naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001500215245011500230300001600345520157700361650002101938650002301959650002001982650001802002650002002020650002202040650001802062650002102080650001802101650002002119650001802139650001702157650000802174650001602182650004702198650001202245650003502257650004602292650002302338700001802361700002202379700002102401773008102422852000902503856008502512930003302597945002502630946001102655655001202666IND4373464420221118173640.0050820e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437346442DNAL7 a160501832pmid7 a10.1080/000716605001266562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aEtts, R.M.10aDietary balanced protein in broiler chickens. 1. A flexible and practical tool to predict dose-response curves  ap. 300-309.  a1. An empirical model of exponential form was developed, different versions of which can be used to predict growth rate, feed conversion and carcase and breast meat yield of broiler chickens as a function of dietary balanced protein (DBP) content. The model was developed to support decision-making by nutritionists. The model helps in determining DBP contents that maximise profit. 2. The model avoids the practical disadvantages of existing methods. In contrast with mechanistic models, only data that are generally known by broiler nutritionists are required as input. Compared with predictions derived from one or a few feeding trials, the model predictions are more accurate (because the model was derived from many data-sets) and more flexible (because a description of the type of broiler was included as input for the model). 3. Broiler response studies from the literature and the Nutreco Poultry and Rabbit Research Centre (27 data-sets in total) were used in the model development to select significant variables, to quantify the parameters and to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. 4. Input variables were DBP content, maximum performance level, age, year (indicating genetic potential) and sex. The model, including the assumption that the shape of the dose-response curves to DBP content is independent of broiler and feed characteristics, gave an accurate simulation of growth rate, feed conversion and breast meat for nearly all data-sets. Effects of DBP content on carcase yield were relatively small, except for carcases without skin and skin fat. 3abroiler chickens 3apoultry production 3abroiler feeding 3agrowth models 3adietary protein 3ahigh protein diet 3adose response 3anutrient balance 3aanimal growth 3afeed conversion 3acarcass yield 3achicken meat 3aage 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aModels, Biological1 aKwakkel, R.P.1 aVerstegen, M.W.A.1 aHartog, L.A. den0 tBritish poultry science.g2005 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.300-309x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716605001266563Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02978naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001600181245009200197300001600289500001500305520144100320650003301761650002001794650002201814650002001836650001701856650001901873650002001892650000801912650001201920650004201932650001201974650004301986650001102029650004002040650001302080650001002093650004102103653001302144700001602157700001602173700001502189773008102204852000902285856008502294930003302379945002502412946001102437655001202448IND4375199920221118173636.0051014e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437519992DNAL7 a162681102pmid7 a10.1080/000716605001580062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Shaver White and ISA Brown pullets were reared to 140 d in cage groups of 8 on a 10-h photoperiod of incandescent light and maintained at an illuminance of 3 or 25 lux, or transferred from 3 to 25 lux or from 25 to 3 lux at 63 or 112 d of age. 2. Plasma follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration at 63 and 112 d was higher in both breeds for pullets maintained at an illuminance of 25 lux compared with 3 lux. After 2-4 d, and relative to constant-illuminance controls, plasma FSH increased significantly for ISA Brown transferred from 3 to 25 lux at 63 d and for Shaver White transferred at 112 d. Irrespective of genotype, plasma FSH for pullets given a decrease in illuminance at 63 or 112 d showed a tendency for less change than did constant-illuminance controls. 3. There was no significant difference in sexual maturity for ISA Brown maintained on 3 or 25 lux, but Shaver White pullets exposed to constant 3 lux matured later than those maintained on 25 lux. Shaver White matured later following an increase from 3 to 25 lux at 63 and 112 d, and earlier subsequent to a decrease from 25 to 3 lux at 112 d. ISA Brown pullets were not significantly affected by a change in illuminance at 63 or 112 d, though their responses were in the same direction as Shaver White. 4. Changes in plasma FSH in the 2- to 4-d period following a change in illuminance at 63 or 112 d were not significantly correlated with sexual maturity. 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3asexual maturity 3abreed differences 3ablood chemistry 3afood animals 3achicken breeds 3alight intensity 3aage 3apullets 2aAgingxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aAnimals 2aChickensxbloodxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexblood 2aGenotype 2aLight 2aSexual Maturationxradiation effects 0achickens1 aCiccone, N.1 aSharp, P.J.1 aLeeson, S.0 tBritish poultry science.g2005 Aug., v. 46, no. 4 p.506-509x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716605001580063Available from publisher's Web site  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/11/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02119naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245007800166300001600244500002400260520098700284650001601271650001701287650002301304650001601327650002701343650001001370650001101380650001201391650001901403650001401422650001501436650001401451650001301465700001401478700001701492700001401509700001101523773009901534852000901633856005501642655001201697IND4451848420221118173132.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445184842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2010.01844.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, H.10aIdentification and gene mapping of a soybean chlorophyll-deficient mutant  ap. 133-138.  aIncludes references  aWith 5 figures and 2 tables ABSTRACT: Chlorophyll variation mutants are important materials for studying chlorophyll metabolism, photosynthesis, chloroplast biogenesis and related physiological processes. In this study, a chlorophyll-deficient soybean mutant (cd1) was isolated by screening M₂ progenies of cultivar ‘Nannong 86-4' treated with 0.4% ethyl methanesulfonate. cd1 displayed yellow-green leaves from seedling stage V1 to fully flowering stage R2, abnormal chloroplasts, lower total chlorophyll content (30-66% reduction), lower plant height and lower seed yield compared to its wild-type control. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the visible yellow-green trait was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. Subsequently, the cd1-mutant gene was mapped at a 6.9-cM interval on chromosome 10, flanked by two simple sequence repeat markers Satt633 and Sat_291. These results provide us with the opportunity to study a novel gene regulating chlorophyll synthesis. 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3agenes 3aleaves 3amutants 3aphotosynthesis 3ascreening 3aseed yield 3aseedlings 3asoybeans1 aZhang, D.1 aHan, Siyuan.1 aZhang, X.1 aYu, D.0 tPlant breeding.g2011 Apr., v. 130, no. 2 p.133-138dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2010.01844.x 7aarticle02519naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100001700175245008000192300001800272520122000290650002101510650001901531650000701550650002801557650001301585650001401598650001101612650001501623650001501638650002301653650001301676650002601689653002201715653001901737700001801756700001801774773010801792852000901900856008101909930003301990945002502023946001302048655001202061IND4376570320221118173437.0051208s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437657032DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000590762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCavins, T.J.10aTiming of PourThru affects pH, electrical conductivity, and leachate volume  ap. 1573-1581.  aThe time between irrigation and PourThru sampling had not been extensively examined for affects on pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and leachate volume in greenhouse production. A greenhouse study with 16.5 and 19.2 cm wide containers using Fafard 4P and Metro Mix 320 soilless substrates was implemented, and PourThru leachates were extracted and tested for pH, EC, and volume at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after irrigation. Substrates and pot sizes affected PourThru pH and EC; however, timing did not affect these values in this study. The elapsed time between irrigation and sampling affected leachate volumes and mass wetness of the substrates such that values decreased when 120 or 240 minutes elapsed from irrigation to sampling. Based upon the fluctuations in leachate volumes and mass wetness values, it is recommended that 60 minutes elapse from time of irrigation to PourThru sampling. Sixty minutes is sufficient time to allow for nutrient equilibration so the greenhouse crop producers can obtain a representative sample of the plant available nutrient status, yet maintain sufficient moisture status to prevent EC shifts due to moisture content variation leachate volumes from becoming too low. 3aplant containers 3asoilless media 3apH 3aelectrical conductivity 3aleaching 3aleachates 3avolume 3aextraction 3airrigation 3aapplication timing 3asampling 3asoil matric potential 0aPourThru sampling 0awater addition1 aWhipker, B.E.1 aFonteno, W.C.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 11-12 p.1573-1581x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000590763Available from publisher's Web site  a20060325b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/07  aOther US 7aarticle02567naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158072001700175100001500192245005200207300001800259520106600277650001701343650001301360650001901373650002401392650003201416650002801448650001801476650001201494650001901506650001801525650001901543650002701562650000901589650002001598650001901618650002101637650002201658650001201680700001401692700001701706700001601723700001701739773010801756852000901864856008101873930003301954945002501987946001302012655001202025IND4376571020221118173334.0051208s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437657102DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000591162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The study was therefore carried out to observe trends in N mineralization in saline soils amended with manure and urea. The electrical conductivity (ECe) of saline soils was 0.2 (S0), 4.1 (S1), and 11.4 dSm(-1) (S2). The N sources were applied at the rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) and incubated for 8 weeks at 25 degrees C. The pattern of N mineralization was a function of both soil salinity and N sources. The amount of NH4-N released was significantly higher in S0 than S1 or S2, especially in urea treated soils. The NH4-N release varied in the order of urea>manure>control with a peak period of release at the 4th week of incubation. Nitrification of NH4-N to NO3-N was reduced by salinity treatments. Patterns of NO3-N release during incubation were opposite that of NH4-N. Total mineralized N was highest in the urea treatment. Manure application increased ECe of soil by 18%. 3asaline soils 3anitrogen 3amineralization 3asoil microorganisms 3abiological activity in soil 3aelectrical conductivity 3asoil salinity 3aammonia 3avolatilization 3anitrification 3aammonification 3afertilizer application 3aurea 3asoil amendments 3aanimal manures 3anitrate nitrogen 3aammonium nitrogen 3asoil pH1 aHonna, T.1 aYamamoto, S.1 aEneji, A.E.1 aYamasaki, N.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 11-12 p.1681-1689x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000591163Available from publisher's Web site  a20060325b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/07  aOther US 7aarticle02983naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158072001700175072001700192072001700209100001800226245006800244300001800312520157000330650002201900650001001922650001401932650002101946650002001967650002501987650002302012650001602035650002202051650002302073650002502096650002102121650001602142651001402158653002902172700001902201773010802220852000902328856008102337930003302418945002502451946001302476655001202489IND4377285320221118172731.0060118s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437728532DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000624462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZubillaga, M.10aAssessment of nitrogen status in wheat using aerial photography  ap. 1787-1798.  aNontraditional technologies like aerial photography could be an interesting alternative for monitoring wheat nutritional status during the growing season. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of nitrogen (N) rates and landscape position on the spectral indices obtained with color and color infrared aerial photographs and their relationships with N in a wheat crop. The experiment was conducted in the central western Pampas (35 degrees 27'S; 60 degrees 53'W) on two soils located in the same field. Nitrogen treatments were 0, 45, 85, and 125 kg N ha(-1) (N0, N45, N85, and N125) on two landscape positions in a field: upper land (U) and lower land (L). The N rate affected aboveground biomass, leaf area, N concentration, and chlorophyll at final tillering (GS 30) and grain filling (GS 73) stages, which indicated an improvement in crop N nutrition status proportional to the rate of fertilizer. The visible wavelength (red, green, and blue) reflectance decreased as N rate increased. Red digital counts (R) were better correlated with N concentration (r=0.75, p<0.05) than green (G) or blue (B) digital counts. For both crop stages, R explained approximately 72% of the N uptake. At GS 30, NNI and N uptake could be better predicted in season by using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) because the index also takes into account variations in N concentration and biomass. The nondestructive measurements of crop reflectance from aerial photography would appear to be appropriate indicators of the current N status in wheat crop. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3acultivars 3anitrogen content 3aplant nutrition 3adevelopmental stages 3aaerial photography 3areflectance 3aspectral analysis 3alandscape position 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3agrain yield 3aArgentina 0anitrogen nutrition index1 aUrricariet, S.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 13-14 p.1787-1798x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000624463Available from publisher's Web site  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/04/10  aOther US 7aarticle02690naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002800158245007800186300001800264500002400282520162600306650001301932650001301945650001501958650001501973650001401988650001202002650001002014650001402024650001002038700002202048700002102070700002002091773011702111852000902228856007902237655001202316IND4444590620221118173119.0101105e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444459062DNAL7 a216168262pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.10001942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwendemann, Andrew B.10aOrganization, anatomy, and fungal endophytes of a Triassic conifer embryo  ap. 1873-1883.  aIncludes references  aPremise of the study: Much is known about the Paleozoic conifers and the conifers assignable to extant families that appear in the Jurassic; however, relatively little is known about the transitional conifers of the early Mesozoic, especially the Voltziales. To better understand the evolution of this group, we aim to increase knowledge of voltzialean anatomy and morphology. A fossil embryo of the group is described in this study. METHODS: Several permineralized seeds, one containing a well-preserved embryo, were collected from the early Middle Triassic Fremouw Peak locality in the Central Transantarctic Mountains. Samples were prepared using the standard acetate peel technique and studied in transmitted light. Key results: The embryo belongs to Parasciadopitys aequata, a member of the Voltziales. The embryo and megagametophyte tissues are exquisitely preserved. The embryo is colonized by two distinct fungi. Sporocarps of the fungi are found in the megagametophyte and in the space between the megagametophyte and nucellus. The additions of embryo and megagametophyte characters to the description of P. aequata have made it one of the most completely known fossil taxa reproductively. CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of fossil embryos, although rare, can expand the array of characters available in tracing the evolutionary history of plants. The embryo of P. aequata shares similarities with embryos of other extinct and extant conifer families. The association of the embryo with Combresomyces cornifer and Mycocarpon asterineum increases our understanding of the roles of microorganisms in Triassic ecosystems. 3aacetates 3aconifers 3aecosystems 3aendophytes 3aevolution 3afossils 3afungi 3amountains 3aseeds1 aTaylor, Thomas N.1 aTaylor, Edith L.1 aKrings, Michael0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2010 Nov., v. 97, no. 11 p.1873-1883dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.10001943Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01934naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245015800169300001600327500002400343520094600367650001801313650001301331650001001344650001601354650001201370650001401382650002301396773014701419852000901566856005701575655001201632IND4451018120221118173538.0110320e19950112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445101812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.1995.tb00584.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakken, M.10aSex-ratio variation and maternal investment in relation to social environment among farmed silver-fox vixens (Vulpes vulpes) of high competition capacity  ap. 463-468.  aIncludes references  aSUMMARY: The sex ratio and body weights of offspring from 13 non-infanticidal farmed silver-fox vixens of high-competition capacity (HCC), reared under two different neighbouring conditions, were measured. Seven vixens had other HCC vixens as neighbours, whereas the other group had neighbouring vixens of low-competition capacity (LCC). The vixens with LCC neighbours gave birth to and weaned more cubs, with a significantly higher proportion of males (73%), and female cubs of a relatively better quality at 30 days of age (female cubs on average 11 g heavier than their brothers), than the vixens with HCC neighbours (31% males, female cubs on average 79 g lighter than their brothers). This study indicates sex-ratio regulation in relation to social environment among farmed silver-fox vixens of high-competition capacity. The results are discussed in relation to the future behavioural and reproductive consequences for the female cubs. 3aVulpes vulpes 3abrothers 3amales 3aparturition 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3asocial environment0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g1995 Jan. 12, v. 112, no. 1-6 p.463-468dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.1995.tb00584.x 7aarticle01341naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245012500132300001400257520033600271650002600607650002200633650002100655650001200676650001500688650001200703651001000715653001100725653002200736653002400758653003300782700001700815773008400832852000900916939003300925945000800958946001300966655001200979991631980540742620221118174033.0831004e198206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830088362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoniat, T.M.14aThe effects of parasitism by Perkinsus marinus on the free amino acid composition of Crassostrea virginica mantle tissue  ap. 25-28.  aPerkinsus marinus in Crassostrea virginica, effects on free amino acid composition of oyster mantle tissue, ratios of specific free amino acids, particularly glycine, with taurine showed correlation with level of parasitism; taurine-to-glycine ratio useful as biochemical measure of stress, P. marinus may be agent of stress: Texas 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aPerkinsus marinus 3afree amino acids 3aoysters 3aparasitism 3ataurine 3aTexas 0astress 0aAmino acids, Host 0aPathology, Protozoa 0aPerkinsus marinus (Protozoa)1 aKoenig, M.L.0 tJournal of shellfish research.g1982 June, v. 2, no. 1 p.25-28x0730-80007nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831004c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle01570naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002800181245010500209300001800314500002400332506007600356520032100432506003700753650002800790650003100818650002400849700002300873700002100896700002200917700001900939700002500958773013600983852000901119856008001128655001201208IND4440361320221207144114.0100723e20100801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444036132DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00382-102doi7 aPMC29164702pmcid7 a205430442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCascioferro, Alessandro10aXer Site-Specific Recombination, an Efficient Tool To Introduce Unmarked Deletions into Mycobacteria  ap. 5312-5316.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenetic manipulation of mycobacteria still represents a serious challenge due to the lack of tools and selection markers.

Therefore, in the present study the number and morphometric parameters of muscle fibres and the innervation ratio of motor units in the medial gastrocnemius muscle were studied in male and female Wistar rats. The study additionally aimed at determining reasons of gender differences in motor unit force parameters, i.e. the number and diameter of muscle fibres, and mean values of the motor unit innervation ratios. Following staining of reticuline fibres by silver impregnation, the number, diameter and cross-section area of muscle fibres were determined on microscopic images of transverse muscle sections. In males, the muscles were approximately 1.5 times larger by mass and contained about 11 800 muscle fibres, whereas in females the muscles contained around 8000 fibres. In addition, the mean diameter and mean cross-section area of muscle fibres were 14 and 29% larger in males, respectively. Based on previously determined numbers of motoneurons innervating the medial gastrocnemius muscle in male and female rats, the mean innervation ratio, i.e. the number of muscle fibres innervated by one motoneuron, was estimated. This ratio was approximately 26% greater in males compared to females, with values of 207 and 153 fibres per motoneuron, respectively. Therefore, the differences in muscle fibre morphometric parameters and in the innervation ratio are responsible for higher forces of motor units in male muscles. 3afemales 3agender differences 3ainnervation 3amales 3amorphometry 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3arats 3asilver 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHindlimbxanatomy & histology 2aMale 2aMotor Neuronsxphysiology 2aMuscle Fibers, Skeletalxphysiology 2aMuscle, Skeletalxanatomy & histologyxinnervation. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSex Factors1 aDrzymała-Celichowska, H.1 aCelichowski, J.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2011 Aug., v. 40, no. 4 p.249-255dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0340-20967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0264.2011.01066.x 7aarticle02816naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013200169300001600301520142700317592002801744650002301772650001101795650002101806650002001827650003801847650002601885650001501911650002401926650003301950650002701983650002502010650002102035650003702056700002502093700002302118700002002141700001902161700002102180773008702201856008502288852000902373655001202382IND60597019020221122052816.0200601e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059701902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Simon G.10aProbing of polymer to carbon nanotube surface interactions within highly aligned electrospun nanofibers for advanced composites  ap. 207-214.  aBy electrospinning poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-blended sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) functionalized carbon nanotube (CNT) solutions, we engineered single- and double-walled nanotubes into highly aligned arrays. CNT alignment was measured using electron microscopy and polarised Raman spectroscopy. Mechanical tensile testing demonstrates that a CNT loading of 3.9 wt% increases the ultimate tensile strength and ductility of our composites by over a factor of 3, and the Young's modulus by over a factor of 4, to ∼260 MPa. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals how the aligned nanotubes provide a solid structure, preventing polymer chains from slipping, as well as polymer crystallisation structures such as ‘shish-kebabs’ forming, which are responsible for the improved mechanical properties of the composite. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals micellar and hexagonal columnar structures along the axis of the fibers, some of which are associated with the presence of the CNT, where these hexagonal structures are associated with the SDS functionalization on the CNT surfaces. This work demonstrates the benefits of CNT alignment within composites, revealing the effectiveness of the electrospinning technique, which enables significantly improved functionality, increasing the utility of the composites for use in many different technological areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananofibers 3apolyethylene glycol 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurface interactions 3atensile strength 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aTerrill, Nicholas J.1 aGoodwin, Andrew J.1 aStevens, Robert1 aStolojan, Vlad1 aSilva, S.Ravi P.0 tCarbon.g2018 Nov., v. 138 p.207-214dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013700168300001600305500001900321520233000340592002802670650000802698650002802706650001602734650001602750650001702766650000802783650001302791650001202804650001102816650001902827650001502846650001102861650001102872651000902883651001702892700003102909700002802940700002702968773013202995856008203127852000903209655001203218IND60691311420221122144218.0200429e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069131142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-020-03131-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi, Mahmoud10aSeasonal and annual segregation of liquid water and ice clouds in Iran and their relation to geographic components and precipitation  ap. 963-982.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEfficient and proper understanding of the state of the clouds regarding different seasons of the year will have profound effects on different economic and environmental sectors. The purpose of this study is to determine the hourly dissociation of ice and liquid clouds in Iran. To this end, cloud optical thickness (COT) data, as well as optical depth of clouds in two phases of liquid and ice were obtained and processed from 31 synoptic meteorological stations (1960–2015), MODIS data from Terra satellite during the years 2001 to 2011, and they were processed then. Next, using the RegCM4 model, the cloud fraction (clt) was simulated to accurately identify the cloud cover situation in Iran. The results showed that the maximum annual mean abundance of liquid and ice clouds was 18.95 days for the time 15:00 and 3.99 days for the time 06:00, respectively. Climatic zones of the Caspian and Persian Gulf coasts at 15 o’clock had the highest decreasing trend of liquid clouds. Ice clouds in all parts of Iran’s climate, with the exception of the eastern plateau, also declined. From south to north and east to west of Iran, the occurrence of ice and liquid clouds is increasing. Therefore, the spatio-temporal distribution of liquid and ice clouds in the country was also dependent on spatial components and latitude had the greatest impact. From the satellite and modeled data, the RegCM4 model has been able to detect the Monsoon phenomenon in southeastern Iran during the summer. CLT simulation in Iran has also shown that cloud cover in Iran fluctuates between 28 and 65% on average, with 81.5% of Iranian stations having a significant change in the amount of annual cloud cover. Correlation of liquid and ice clouds with precipitation showed that liquid clouds in summer and ice clouds in spring had higher correlation with precipitation in Iran. Northern coasts of Iran due to greater ascent mechanisms such as coastal compressors, north latitude atmospheric circulation systems, and maximum winds in the north and west of Iran due to the location of western systems entry and sufficient thermal gradient, had maximum ice clouds in the last half century. Also, south of Iran, despite having extended and great water-bodies, is less cloudy due to descending air in Hadley’s circulation (Hadley cell) of air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimatology 3acloud cover 3adissociation 3aice 3alatitude 3aliquids 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3asatellites 3aspring 3asummer 3aIran 3aPersian Gulf1 aDadashi-Roudbari, Abbasali1 aAkbari-Azirani, Tayebeh1 aNasiri-Khuzani, Behnaz0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 May, v. 140, no. 3-4 p.963-982dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03131-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01518naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013300161300001800294520034500312592002800657650001300685650002400698650002400722650001800746650001200764650001300776700002200789700001900811700002200830700002100852700002200873700002000895700002300915773012300938856007401061852000901135655001201144IND60683967620221120153809.0200214e20200212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068396762DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra10140c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyakawa, Masato10aContinuous syntheses of carbon-supported Pd and Pd@Pt core–shell nanoparticles using a flow-type single-mode microwave reactor  ap. 6571-6575.  aContinuous syntheses of carbon-supported Pd@Pt core–shell nanoparticles were performed using microwave-assisted flow reaction in polyol to synthesize carbon-supported core Pd with subsequent direct coating of a Pt shell.

Herein, copper-based halide perovskite CsCuCl₃ and the corresponding Br–-substituted sample (CsCuCl₂Br) are designed and explored as the catalysts for photocatalytic CO₂ reduction for the first time. A facile antisolvent recrystallization process with pre-prepared single crystals as the precursor is employed to controllably synthesize CsCuCl₃ and CsCuCl₂Br microcrystals (MCs). The electronic structure and charge transfer property analysis by theoretical and experimental investigation reveal that CsCuCl₃ possesses a satisfying bandgap (1.92 eV) and conduction band minimum (CBM) to harvest the sunlight and drive the conversion of CO₂ to CH₄ and CO. The Br– substitution can not only narrow the bandgap but also facilitate the transportation of charge carriers. Thus, a total electron consumption rate of 44.71 μmol g–¹ h–¹ is achieved for CsCuCl₂Br MCs, which is much better than that of same-sized CsPbBr₃ microcrystals or even better than many perovskite nanocrystal photocatalysts. This study suggests that Cu-based perovskites can serve as promising candidates for artificial photosynthesis or other photocatalytic applications, which may propose a new thought to construct lead-free, low-cost photocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data  a21875288cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22005351cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22175202cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2020A1515110937cGuangdong Science and Technology Departmentdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007162  aNAcCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  a2017BT01C161cGuangdong Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3acarbon dioxide 3acopper 3acrystallization 3ananocrystals 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotosynthesis 3asolar radiation 3atoxicity 3atransportation 0aCsCuCl3 0aCsCuCl2Br 0aCO2 reduction 0alead-free perovskite1 aLiao, Jin-Feng1 aDeng, Yuan,1 aChen, Hong-Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6704-16651 aKuang, Dai-Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6773-23190 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 19, v. 14, no. 38 p.43354-43361dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c126953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245010200174300001300276520153700289592002801826650002001854650002201874650001501896650001501911650002001926650001501946650001701961653001401978653001501992653001202007653001602019653001002035653001502045700001802060700001702078700005802095773010702153856008702260852000902347655001202356IND60593750720221122074227.0180508e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059375072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBukvic, Anamaria14aThe role of proximity to waterfront in residents' relocation decision-making post-Hurricane Sandy  ap. 8-19.  aThe experience with Superstorm Sandy advanced the dialogue on the long-term response options that would minimize risks and ensure livability in high-risk coastal environments. One strategy considered permanent relocation of homes from flood-prone areas. However, little is known about the factors that might influence a homeowner's decision to relocate, how their home's proximity to the shoreline may affect their risk perceptions and willingness to relocate. This paper explores the role that proximity to the oceanfront plays in relocation decision-making. It examines geospatial determinants collected as a part of a 2013 household survey conducted post Hurricane Sandy and their relationship with survey responses and socioeconomic predisposition. The analysis uses geospatial data to assess the proximity attributes of participating households. The proximity parameters were statistically compared to the socioeconomic profile and survey responses. The results demonstrate that the location of surveyed households, even though adequately dispersed to the oceanfront proximity, had only a minor effect on the willingness to relocate, suggesting that non-geophysical factors, such as household-level confidence in the ability to adapt and continue habitation in such locations, values, and other qualitative personal factors play a larger role. The findings also show that participants living closer to the bay are more likely to consider relocation if exposed to repetitive flooding and offered participation in buyout program.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3ahurricanes 3arisk perception 3ashorelines 3aspatial data 0aProximity 0aRelocation 0aRetreat 0aPerceptions 0aSandy 0aWaterfront1 aZhu, Hongxiao1 aLavoie, Rita1 aBecker, Austin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9224-79130 tOcean & coastal management.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 154 p.8-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001400188245011900202300001200321506007600333520122900409592002801638596007201666596010701738506003701845650001801882650002001900650001601920650001901936650001701955650003501972650001202007650001702019650001902036650000902055700001302064700001702077700001702094700005402111773011702165856008202282852000902364655001202373IND60663960920221207121421.0210403e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066396092DNAL7 aPMC67315542pmcid7 a314921892pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-019-2071-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jia13aAn enhanced expression of hypothalamic neuronal nitric oxide synthase in a rat model of simulated transport stress  ap. 323.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Transport stress not only causes physiological changes but also induces behavioral responses, including anxiety-like and depression-like behavioral responses in animals. The neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) plays a pivotal role in transport stress. This study aimed to investigate the effects of acute transport stress on the expression of nNOS and the distribution of nNOS-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus in rats and to explore the neuroendocrine mechanism of transport stress. RESULTS: In this study, for the first time, we investigated the effects of transport stress on nitric oxide (NO)-NOS in the hypothalamus. After simulated stress, rats exhibited behavioral changes in the open field test (OFT), increased serum corticosterone (CORT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels, and increased NO content in the hypothalamus. In addition, nNOS expression in the hypothalamic PVN was upregulated, and its distribution was altered in stressed rats compared with that of unstressed rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that simulated transport stress increases nNOS expression and alters its distribution in the PVN of the rat hypothalamus.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772686 and 31502025cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201403051-07cPublic Service Sectors Agriculture Research Projects of Ministry of Agriculture of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3abehavior change 3ablood serum 3acorticosterone 3ahypothalamus 3aneuronal nitric oxide synthase 3aneurons 3anitric oxide 3anorepinephrine 3arats1 aLi, Jiao1 aYu, Mingyuan1 aWang, Yuying1 aMa, Yunfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6176-34960 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.323-323dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2071-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010500167300001600272520111100288592002801399650002601427650002801453650001501481650002801496650002501524650002101549650002201570650001101592650001901603650001201622653002201634653002201656653002601678653002201704700001701726773012901743856008601872852000901958655001201967IND60760496420221116151123.0211223e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076049642DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2021.19674392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chao10aAgricultural business and product marketing effected by using big data analysis in smart agriculture  ap. 980-991.  aTo expand agricultural business and upgrade the effects of product marketing, supported by the concept of smart agricultural, this paper introduces us the methods to undertake agricultural business promotion and build up product marketing system in combination with big data technology and machine learning technology, put forward the application of fuzzy c-means algorithm in the agricultural marketing data.

The oxygen isotopic composition of zircons, for which uranium-lead and hafnium isotopic data provide age constraints, is a key archive of crustal reworking. We identified systematic variations in hafnium and oxygen isotopes in zircons of different ages that reveal the relative proportions of reworked crust and of new crust through time. Growth of continental crust appears to have been a continuous process, albeit at variable rates. A marked decrease in the rate of crustal growth at approximately 3 billion years ago may be linked to the onset of subduction-driven plate tectonics.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahafnium 3aisotopes 3amodels 3aoxygen 3atectonics1 aHawkesworth, Chris J.1 aCawood, Peter A.1 aStorey, Craig D.0 tScience.g2012 Mar. 16, v. 335, no. 6074 p.1334-1336dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1216066  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100003100192245010900223300001600332506007600348520103500424592002801459506003701487650001801524650001901542650001801561650001701579653003301596653001101629653002001640653001601660653001201676653002701688653001601715653001401731653001401745700002701759700004101786700002001827700002501847700001501872773010301887856008501990852000902075655001202084IND60691196020221207073833.0200428e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069119602DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2015.10199982doi7 aPMC46158432pmcid7 a258064052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes-Filho, José Vicente10aSense overlapping transcripts in IS1341-type transposase genes are functional non-coding RNAs in archaea  ap. 490-500.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe existence of sense overlapping transcripts that share regulatory and coding information in the same genomic sequence shows an additional level of prokaryotic gene expression complexity. Here we report the discovery of ncRNAs associated with IS1341-type transposase (tnpB) genes, at the 3'-end of such elements, with examples in archaea and bacteria. Focusing on the model haloarchaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1, we show the existence of sense overlapping transcripts (sotRNAs) for all its IS1341-type transposases. Publicly available transcriptome compendium show condition-dependent differential regulation between sotRNAs and their cognate genes. These sotRNAs allowed us to find a UUCA tetraloop motif that is present in other archaea (ncRNA family HgcC) and in a H. salinarum intergenic ncRNA derived from a palindrome associated transposable elements (PATE). Overexpression of one sotRNA and the PATE-derived RNA harboring the tetraloop motif improved H. salinarum growth, indicating that these ncRNAs are functional.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHalobacterium 3anon-coding RNA 3atranscriptome 3atransposases 0asense overlaping transcripts 0aIS1341 0aHgcC RNA family 0aIS1341-type 0aRNA-seq 0aoverlaping transcripts 0atransposons 0aIS200/605 0atetraloop1 aZaramela, Livia Soares1 aItaliani, Valéria Cristina da Silva1 aBaliga, Nitin S1 aVêncio, Ricardo Z N1 aKoide, Tie0 tRNA biology.g2015 May 4, v. 12, no. 5 p.490-500dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2015.10199983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04656naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009800169300001600267520265500283592002802938650002702966650001202993650001103005650001903016650002603035650001703061650002403078650001603102650001703118650002903135650002103164650002203185650002603207650001903233650001103252650001803263650002903281650001503310650003303325650001403358650002103372650001603393650000903409653002303418653001703441653001903458653002603477653000903503653002203512653002703534653002103561700002803582700003103610700001903641700001803660700002703678700001803705700002403723700002003747773010803767856008603875852000903961655001203970IND60114130720221119082820.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011413072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeloot, Nele10aShort-term CO2 and N2O emissions and microbial properties of biochar amended sandy loam soils  ap. 401-410.  aBiochar produced during pyrolysis of biomass has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils. In order to evaluate the effect of four different biochar additions on the emission of the greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O, two incubation experiments were established in a temperate sandy loam soil. Digestate, a waste-product of the wet fermentation of swine manure, and willow wood was slowly pyrolyzed at 350 °C and 700 °C, yielding four biochar types (DS350, DS700, WS350 and WS700). In the first incubation experiment (117 days), C mineralization was monitored in soil amended with biochar at a quantity of 10 Mg ha−1 on an area-basis (biochar to soil ratio of 1:69 on a mass basis) at 50% water filled pore space (WFPS). CO2 emissions from the 350 °C biochar treatments were significantly higher than the control (no biochar) treatment, while we observed no significantly different net C mineralization in the treatments with the 700 °C biochars compared to the control. After fitting a combined zero- plus first-order model to the cumulative C mineralization data, the parameter for the easily mineralizable C pool (CAf) positively correlated with the volatile matter (VM) contents of the biochars. Microbial biomass carbon consistently increased due to all biochar additions, while the dehydrogenase activity increased in the 350 °C biochar treatments but decreased in the 700 °C biochar treatments. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the extracted phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) demonstrated that divergent microbial community structures established after the addition of all biochars. The markers for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were more abundant in the 350 °C biochar treatments compared to the control and to the other biochar treatments. Net N mineralization was higher in the digestate biochar treatments than in the willow biochar treatments and decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperatures and increasing C:N ratio. In a second incubation experiment (15 days) N2O emissions were measured at WFPS of 70% and the same biochars were added in the same quantity as for C mineralization, with the addition of 40 mg KNO3–N kg−1. The cumulative N2O emission after 15 days was positively correlated with the volatile matter content of the biochars and was significantly lower in the 700 °C biochar treatments compared to the control, while no significant differences were found for the 350 °C biochar treatments. This study suggests that volatile matter content could be an important property of biochars in explaining short-term CO2 and N2O emissions from biochar-amended soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acarbon sinks 3acommunity structure 3acorrelation 3afermentation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3amodels 3anitrous oxide 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3apig manure 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyrolysis 3asandy loam soils 3atemperature 3awood 0aCO2 mineralization 0aN2O emission 0aSlow pyrolysis 0aPyrolysis temperature 0aPLFA 0aMicrobial biomass 0aDehydrogenase activity 0aN mineralization1 aDe Neve, S.q(Stefaan),1 aJegajeevagan, Kanagaratnam1 aYildiz, Güray1 aBuchan, David1 aFunkuin, Yvonne Nkwain1 aPrins, Wolter1 aBouckaert, Liesbeth1 aSleutel, Steven0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 57 p.401-410dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012000168500001400288520122300302592002801525650002301553650001401576650001301590650001701603650002701620650001701647700002301664700002501687700002001712700002101732700001301753700002001766700002001786700002301806700001401829773012301843856008101966852000902047655001202056IND60732194320221119090903.0210326e20210322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073219432DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100303792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaseb, Ahmed  O.14aThe Impact of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Expression on the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19 Infection  aNAL-light  aThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented threat to the international community and raised major concerns in terms of public health safety. Although our current understanding of the complexity of COVID-19 pathogenesis remains limited, the infection is largely mediated by the interaction of viral spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The functional importance of ACE2 in different demographic and comorbid conditions may explain the significant variation in incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in vulnerable groups, and highlights its candidacy as a potential therapeutic target. We provide evidence supporting the idea that differences in incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection may be related to ACE2. Emerging data based on the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among those with established high levels of ACE2 expression strongly support our hypothesis. Considering the burden of COVID-19 infection in these vulnerable groups and the impact of the potential therapeutic and preventive measures that would result from adopting ACE2-driven anti-viral strategies, our hypothesis may expedite global efforts to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3amortality 3apandemic 3apathogenesis 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3atherapeutics1 aMohamed, Yehia  I.1 aMalek, Alexandre  E.1 aRaad, Issam  I.1 aAltameemi, Lina 1 aLi, Dan 1 aKaseb, Omar  A.1 aKaseb, Safa  A.1 aSelim, Abdelhafez 1 aMa, Qing 0 tPathogens.g2021 Mar. 22, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100303793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014400170300001600314520178800330592002802118650000802146650001102154650001102165650001002176650000902186650002402195650003002219650002602249650001302275650001002288653001502298653001802313653002102331653002302352653001602375653001002391700002502401700001602426700001502442773009502457856008702552852000902639655001202648IND60526626920221119190745.0190408e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052662692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemeke, Tigst10aAbsolute quantification of genetically engineered traits with droplet digital PCR: Effect of DNA treatments and spiking with non-target DNA  ap. 105-111.  aLow level presence of unapproved genetically engineered (GE) materials in non-GE grains has been a challenge for grain importers and exporters and many countries also have regulatory requirements for use and cultivation of GE crops. Digital PCR has been used for absolute quantification of GE traits. The need for DNA pre-treatment for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has not been well assessed. The effect of non-shearing, QIAshredding and hydroshearing of genomic DNA (300 ng) on quantitative analysis of low concentrations of OXY235 canola, FP967 flax and DP305423 soybean samples was assessed using RainDance RainDrop™ Digital PCR system. 1000 ng DNA was also used for ddPCR to determine if pre-treatment is required for high DNA concentration. The measured percentage values were close to the expected 0.01, 0.1 and 1% values for non-sheared, QIAshredded and hydrosheared samples for three GE traits using 300 ng DNA. The ddPCR results were also similar to the expected 0.01, 0.1 and 1% values for non-sheared and QIAshredded samples for the three GE traits using 1000 ng DNA. The feasibility of absolute quantification of low levels of OXY235 canola, FP967 flax and DP305423 soybean samples spiked in non-GE barley and wheat samples was investigated using ddPCR. Successful quantification of OXY235 canola, FP967 flax and DP305423 soybean DNA samples spiked in barley and wheat DNA samples was achieved at 0.01, 0.1 and 1% levels. ddPCR carried out with DNA extracted from ground DP305423 soybean samples spiked in wheat and barley samples resulted in percentage values close to the expected 0.01, 0.1 and 1% values with some exceptions. The result shows the feasibility of using ddPCR for absolute quantification of low level presence of GE materials in other grain samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abarley 3acanola 3acrops 3aflax 3agenetic engineering 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative analysis 3asoybeans 3awheat 0aFP967 flax 0aOXY235 canola 0aDP305423 soybean 0aLow level presence 0aSheared DNA 0addPCR1 aHoligroski, Michelle1 aEng, Monika1 aXing, Juan0 tFood control.g2016 Oct., v. 68 p.105-111dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245003700212300001600249506007600265520096300341592002801304506003701332650001501369650001501384650001701399650001001416650001801426650001701444650001801461653003201479653001801511653002001529653002701549653001301576700001301589773010401602856008501706852000901791655001201800IND60691196320221207073837.0200428e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069119632DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2015.10202712doi7 aPMC46153712pmcid7 a257468342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ling-Ling10aRegulation of circRNA biogenesis  ap. 381-388.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnlike linear RNAs terminated with 5′ caps and 3′ tails, circular RNAs are characterized by covalently closed loop structures with neither 5′ to 3′ polarity nor polyadenylated tail. This intrinsic characteristic has led to the general under-estimation of the existence of circular RNAs in previous polyadenylated transcriptome analyses. With the advent of specific biochemical and computational approaches, a large number of circular RNAs from back-spliced exons (circRNAs) have been identified in various cell lines and across different species. Recent studies have uncovered that back-splicing requires canonical spliceosomal machinery and can be facilitated by both complementary sequences and specific protein factors. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of the regulation of circRNA biogenesis, including both the competition between splicing and back-splicing and the previously under-appreciated alternative circularization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogenesis 3acell lines 3acircular RNA 3aexons 3amessenger RNA 3aspliceosomes 3atranscriptome 0aalternative circularization 0aback-splicing 0acircularization 0acomplementary sequence 0asplicing1 aYang, Li0 tRNA biology.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 12, no. 4 p.381-388dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2015.10202713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010100174300001500275520177700290592002802067650001702095650002802112650002102140650001702161650001702178650001402195650001802209650002302227650002102250650001402271650002002285650001402305650001502319653002002334653001602354653001902370653002502389700002002414773014102434856008602575852000902661655001202670IND60760496820221116151054.0211223e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076049682DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.18120482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahidi, Fereidoon10aPreservation of aquatic food using edible films and coatings containing essential oils: a review  ap. 66-105.  aEdible films and coatings have recently received growing attention in the food packaging sector due to their protective ability from the external environment and biodegradability characteristic. Generally, any layer of biomaterial incorporated into food to prolong its shelf-life and that can be consumed along with the food with or without further peeling is defined as an edible film or coating. These biodegradable films improve mechanical properties, moisture and gas barriers, microbial protection, sensory perception, and the shelf-life of food products. In particular, films obtained from polysaccharides are characterized by better gas barrier properties, whereas proteins are known for their excellent mechanical properties. However, both polysaccharides and proteins show poor water barrier properties in films which can be improved by incorporating lipids as well as combining one or more hydrocolloids (proteins and polysaccharides). Moreover, essential oils (EOs) consist mainly of volatile components obtained from plants, which can be added to the film to improve antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. On the other hand, fishery products are highly perishable due to the combined action of chemical reaction, lipid oxidation, endogenous enzymes, and microbial growth. Cold storage and freezing with or without vacuum packaging are often used to preserve fishery products, but they do not always completely preserve quality. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the components and chemistry of edible films and coatings, and their application to aquatic food for quality preservation. Moreover, deterioration of aquatic food and how these films and coatings can improve antimicrobial, antioxidant, physical, and sensory properties are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3acold storage 3aedible films 3afisheries 3ahydrocolloids 3alipid peroxidation 3amicrobial growth 3anutrition 3apolysaccharides 3asensation 3ashelf life 0aedible coatings 0abiopolymers 0aessential oils 0aaquatic food quality1 aHosena, Ābula,0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 Jan. 2, v. 62, no. 1 p.66-105dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.18120483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001800159245011400177300001600291500000900307520183900316592002802155650001502183650001802198650002702216650002102243650002102264650001802285650001802303650001502321650001202336650002002348650001202368650002202380650001102402650002102413650001602434650001002450650001202460651001002472700001502482700001602497700001402513700002402527700002102551773019102572852000902763856007702772655001202849IND4406092320221118082210.0191028e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440609232DNAL7 a184534182pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2007.02962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenéndez, S.14aThe Effect of Cattle Slurry Electroflotation Products as Fertilizers on Gaseous Emissions and Grassland Yield  ap. 956-962.  aepub  aThe climatic conditions of the Basque Country (northern Spain) provide the favorable conditions for the growth of grasslands and the development of livestock enterprises. The intensification of the farms is leading to serious environmental risks due to the great generation of manures and slurries and their subsequent inefficient management. Their application involves N losses that can be pollutant. The environmental company ADE BIOTEC S.L. is developing the process called “electroflotation” with the aim of reducing the volume of slurries from intensive livestock farms. The process consists basically of an electrolysis of the slurry catalyzed by iron which leads to the flocculation of the solid particles, giving as a final result a solid and a liquid fraction. The objective of this work was to assess the usefulness of these two fractions as fertilizers. With this aim, the environmental risk of their application was determined regarding gaseous emissions to the atmosphere (i.e., of NO, NH₃, N₂O, and CO₂) and their fertilizer capacity was investigated by determining their effects on grassland yield and N uptake in comparison to the untreated slurry. The untreated slurry and the solid and the liquid fractions were all applied at a rate of 70 kg NH₄ ⁺–N ha⁻¹ The application of the products of electroflotation did not affect N₂O and CO₂ losses, being of the same magnitude as those caused by the application of the original slurry. However, after their application, a reduction in NH₃ volatilization losses was induced in the short term and a reduction in NO losses was caused in the long term. The solid and liquid fractions both increased biomass yield with respect to the untreated slurry. The solid fraction even induced a higher N uptake than the liquid fraction and the untreated slurry.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasslands 3acattle manure 3afertilizer application 3aapplication rate 3agreenhouse gases 3agas emissions 3aair pollution 3acrop yield 3abiomass 3anutrient uptake 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aCattle 2aElectrochemistry 2aFertilizers 2aGases 2aPoaceae 3aSpain1 aMerino, P.1 aLekuona, A.1 aPinto, M.1 aGonzález-Murua, C.1 aEstavillo, J.

S.10aRethinking the Contribution of Drained and Undrained Grasslands to Sediment-Related Water Quality Problems  ap. 906-914.  aepub  aGrass vegetation has been recommended for use in the prevention and control of soil erosion because of its dense sward characteristics and stabilizing effect on the soil. A general assumption is that grassland environments suffer from minimal soil erosion and therefore present little threat to the water quality of surface waters in terms of sediment and sorbed contaminant pollution. Our data question this assumption, reporting results from one hydrological year of observations on a field-experiment monitoring overland flow, drain flow, fluxes of suspended solids, total phosphorus (TP), and molybdate-reactive phosphorus (<0.45 μm) in response to natural rainfall events. During individual rainfall events, 1-ha grassland lysimeters yield up to 15 kg of suspended solids, with concentrations in runoff waters of up to 400 mg L⁻¹ These concentrations exceed the water quality standards recommended by the European Freshwater Fisheries Directive (25 mg L⁻¹) and the USEPA (80 mg L⁻¹) and are beyond those reported to have caused chronic effects on freshwater aquatic organisms. Furthermore, TP concentrations in runoff waters from these field lysimeters exceeded 800 μg L⁻¹ These concentrations are in excess of those reported to cause eutrophication problems in rivers and lakes and contravene the ecoregional nutrient criteria in all of the USA ecoregions. This paper also examines how subsurface drainage, a common agricultural practice in intensively managed grasslands, influences the hydrology and export of sediment and nutrients from grasslands. This dataset suggests that we need to rethink the conceptual understanding of grasslands as non-erosive landscapes. Failure to acknowledge this will result in the noncompliance of surface waters to water quality standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasslands 3adrainage 3arunoff 3awater erosion 3awater quality 3awater pollution 3asediment yield 3atotal suspended solids 3aphosphorus 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sediments 2aPoaceae 2aWater 2aWetlands 3aUnited Kingdom1 aBrazier, R.

The genetic diversity of malaria parasites may affect malaria transmission and malaria control strategies. In China, imported malaria was significantly increased in recent years, among which numerous migrant workers were infected with Plasmodium falciparum from Africa. However, little was known about genetic diversity of these populations in China. In this study, we evaluated genetic polymorphism and allele frequencies of msp1, msp2, and glurp genes in P. falciparum among Chinese migrant workers returnee from Africa between 2013 and 2017. Of the 381 P. falciparum isolates, 89.0% for msp1 gene, 71.7% for msp2 gene, and 78.0% for glurp gene were successfully genotyped. In msp1, 29 different alleles were observed, among which the K1 allelic family (71.7%) was predominant. In msp2, 21 different alleles were detected, of which the 3D7 allelic family (91.2%) was more frequent than FC27 allelic family (72.5%). For glurp, 12 individual alleles were detected in the samples. Taken together, the findings showed a high genetic diversity of these isolates, which provided the baseline data for African P. falciparum population imported to China.  aPublisher supplied data  a202001050479cmedicine and health science technology development plan of shandong province 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aalleles 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3amalaria 3aparasitology 3apublic health 3aresearch 3aAfrica 3aChina1 aHuang, Bingcheng1 aWei, Qingkuan1 aLi, Jin1 aKong, Xiangli1 aXiao, Ting1 aSun, Hui1 aZhao, Guihua1 aYan, Ge1 aGong, Maoqing1 aYin, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8638-80980 tParasitology research.g2022 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.461-464dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07368-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245008000213300001100293500001900304520172200323592002802045650001102073650001602084650003602100650002602136650001602162650001102178651001202189773009902201856008302300852000902383655001202392IND60716625120221119180002.0210209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071662512DNAL7 a10.1186/s40795-020-00380-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShchubelka, Khrystyna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7630-325710aVitamin D status in adults and children in Transcarpathia, Ukraine in 2019  ap. 48.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem, it is assessed by measuring serum 25-hydroxivitamin D (25(OH) D), nevertheless epidemiological data for many countries remains underreported. OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency throughout the calendar year in a large cohort recruited ina multiethnic Transcarpathian region of Ukraine. METHODS: In this retrospective study 25(OH) D serum concentration was measured during all 12 months of the year 2019 by electrochemoluminescent assay on the automatic analyzer Cobas e411 in 1823 subjects, including both children and adults (1551 females (85.03%) and 273 males (14.97%)). RESULTS: The mean 25(OH) D concentration in adults demonstrates significantly lower levels compared to children (22.67 ± 8.63 ng/ml vs. 26.00 ± 10.72 ng/ml respectively, p < 0.001). Adult women expressed significantly lower mean annual serum 25 (OH) D concentrations in comparison to men (22.29 ± 8.46 ng/ml vs. 25.75 ± 9.38 ng/ml respectively, p < 0.001). In contrast, children did not show a significant difference between sexes (girls 24.98 ± 10.38 ng/ml vs. boys 27.01 ± 11.01 ng/ml, p = 0.2003). In the winter months, 25(OH) D levels fell below 20 ng/ml in 51,74% of adult population of Thranscarpathia, and in 12.91%, − below 12 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study contradict the previously reported evaluations of the vitamin D levels in Ukraine which were assessed by measuring serum 25(OH) D. Specifically, only approximately half of the studied population is vitamin D deficient during winter season. This study features the most representative sample size in Ukraine to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood serum 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aretrospective studies 3asample size 3awinter 3aUkraine0 tBMC nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.48-48dBioMed CentralwJournal:27315x2055-09287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40795-020-00380-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245022700212300001600439506007600455520162400531592002802155506003702183650001202220650002002232650002002252650003102272650002902303650001002332650001302342650001902355650001502374650001302389650001302402650001502415650001402430650001702444653001402461653002802475653002902503653001702532700001802549700001502567700001302582700001502595700001702610700001602627700001402643700001802657700001802675700001202693773010402705856008502809852000902894655001202903IND60691196620221207053128.0200428e20150603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069119662DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2015.10227022doi7 aPMC46155942pmcid7 a259851172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanqiong12aA systematic investigation based on microRNA-mediated gene regulatory network reveals that dysregulation of microRNA-19a/Cyclin D1 axis confers an oncogenic potential and a worse prognosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 643-657.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to a wide variety of human diseases by regulating gene expression, leading to imbalances in gene regulatory networks. To discover novel hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related miRNA-target axes and to elucidate their functions, we here performed a systematic investigation combining biological data acquisition and integration, miRNA-target prediction, network construction, functional assay and clinical validation. As a result, a total of 117 HCC differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, and 728 high confident target genes of these miRNAs were collected. Then, the interaction network of target genes was constructed and 221 key nodes with topological importance in the network were identified according to their topological features including degree, node-betweenness, closeness and K-coreness. Among these key nodes, Cyclin D1 had the highest node-betweenness, implying its bottleneck role in the network. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miRNA-19a, which was one of HCC downregulated miRNAs, directly targeted Cyclin D1 in HCC cells. Moreover, miR-19a might play inhibitory roles in HCC malignancy via regulating Cyclin D1 expression. Further clinical evidence also highlighted the prognostic potential of miR-19a/Cyclin D1 axis in HCC. In conclusion, this systematic investigation provides a framework to identify featured miRNAs and their target genes which are potent effectors in the occurrence and development of HCC. More importantly, miR-19a/Cyclin D1 axis might have promising applications as a therapeutic target and a prognostic marker for patients with HCC.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acyclins 3adata collection 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3ahepatoma 3ahuman diseases 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3apatients 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3atherapeutics 0acyclin D1 0agene regulatory network 0ahepatocellular carcinoma 0amicroRNA-19a1 aGuo, Xiaodong1 aLi, Zhiwei1 aLi, Boan1 aLi, Zhiyan1 aLi, Ruisheng1 aGuo, Qiuyan1 aXiong, Lu1 aYu, Lingxiang1 aZhao, Jingmin1 aLin, Na0 tRNA biology.g2015 June 3, v. 12, no. 6 p.643-657dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2015.10227023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245017200168500001400340520136100354592002801715650002901743650002601772650001701798650001601815650001501831650001801846651001201864700003301876700002701909700002101936700002601957700003801983700002902021700001902050773012302069856008102192852000902273655001202282IND60732194920221119090755.0210326e20210323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073219492DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100303842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Block, Tessa 10aWGS of Commensal Neisseria Reveals Acquisition of a New Ribosomal Protection Protein (MsrD) as a Possible Explanation for High Level Azithromycin Resistance in Belgium  aNAL-light  aIn this study, we characterized all oropharyngeal and anorectal isolates of Neisseria spp. in a cohort of men who have sex with men. This resulted in a panel of pathogenic Neisseria (N. gonorrhoeae [n = 5] and N. meningitidis [n = 5]) and nonpathogenic Neisseria (N. subflava [n = 11], N. mucosa [n = 3] and N. oralis [n = 2]). A high proportion of strains in this panel were resistant to azithromycin (18/26) and ceftriaxone (3/26). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of these strains identified numerous mutations that are known to confer reduced susceptibility to azithromycin and ceftriaxone in N. gonorrhoeae. The presence or absence of these known mutations did not explain the high level resistance to azithromycin (>256 mg/L) in the nonpathogenic isolates (8/16). After screening for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, we found a ribosomal protection protein, Msr(D), in these highly azithromycin resistant nonpathogenic strains. The complete integration site originated from Streptococcus pneumoniae and is associated with high level resistance to azithromycin in many other bacterial species. This novel AMR resistance mechanism to azithromycin in nonpathogenic Neisseria could be a public health concern if it were to be transmitted to pathogenic Neisseria. This study demonstrates the utility of WGS-based surveillance of nonpathogenic Neisseria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantibiotic resistance 3aazithromycin 3aceftriaxone 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3aBelgium1 aLaumen, Jolein  Gyonne Elise1 aVan Dijck, Christophe 1 aAbdellati, Said 1 aDe Baetselier, Irith 1 aManoharan-Basil, Sheeba  Santhini1 aVan den Bossche, Dorien 1 aKenyon, Chris 0 tPathogens.g2021 Mar. 23, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100303843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245010100210300001600311520126500327592002801592596007301620596007301693650002601766650001101792650001801803650000901821650001301830650001401843650001701857650001101874650001701885650001501902650001301917650000901930700002101939700005601960700005902016773012802075856008302203852000902286655001202295IND60762730820221123003315.0220112e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076273082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-021-07356-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWunderlich, Alison1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9222-853610aExperimental evidence that host choice by parasites is age-dependent in a fish-monogenean system  ap. 115-126.  aHost age is known to influence the risk of parasite infection, but there is very little experimental evidence on whether parasites show preference towards potential hosts of a specific age. To investigate how host age affects host choice by parasites, we used the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as a fish parasite model and manipulated its gill ectoparasitic monogeneans in mesocosm experiments. Our experimental setting combined three age classes (juvenile, subadult, and adult) of both infected donor hosts and uninfected potential target hosts assigned to each treatment. We predicted that adult target hosts would be more susceptible to parasites than juveniles and adults because they represent high-quality habitat patches. Contrary to our prediction, we found that subadults were more susceptible to parasites than juvenile and adult target hosts. Our models confirmed that variation in target host age influenced parasite choice, suggesting that subadults might represent the most favourable option for parasites regarding a balance between host quality and susceptibility. We provide experimental evidence that host choice by parasites is age-dependent, and that this life-history trait can play a major role in structuring parasite populations.  aPublisher supplied data  a17/16650-5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a19/04033-7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aadults 3aectoparasites 3afish 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3amodels 3aparasitology 3aprediction 3aresearch 3arisk1 aSimioni, Willian1 aZica, Érica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0800-17481 aSiqueira, Tadeu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5069-29040 tParasitology research.g2022 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.115-126dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07356-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003600150245012900186300001600315520096400331592002801295650001301323650001601336650002501352650001501377650001901392650002501411650001101436650001501447650001701462650002401479650002301503653002301526653002201549653002101571653002501592700002101617700002301638700001901661700001901680700002101699773008901720856008401809852000901893655001201902IND60546082220221119170044.0170412e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054608222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.08.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJovašević-Stojanović, Milena10aOn the use of small and cheaper sensors and devices for indicative citizen-based monitoring of respirable particulate matter  ap. 696-704.  aRespirable particulate matter present in outdoor and indoor environments is a health hazard. The particle concentrations can quickly change, with steep gradients on short temporal and spatial scales, and their chemical composition and physical properties vary considerably. Existing networks of aerosol particle measurements consist of limited number of monitoring stations, and mostly aim at assessment of compliance with air quality legislation regulating mass of particles of varying sizes. These networks can now be supplemented using small portable devices with low-cost sensors for assessment of particle mass that may provide higher temporal and spatial resolution if we understand the capabilities and characteristics of the data they provide. This paper overviews typical currently available devices and their characteristics. In addition it is presented original results of measurement and modelling in the aim of one low-cost PM monitor validation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3achemical composition 3acompliance 3ahealth hazards 3alaws and regulations 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3aphysical properties 3aportable equipment 0aParticulate matter 0aLow-cost monitors 0aLow-cost sensors 0aReal time monitoring1 aBartonova, Alena1 aTopalović, Dušan1 aLazović, Ivan1 aPokrić, Boris1 aRistovski, Zoran0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2015 Nov., v. 206 p.696-704dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.08.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012900169300001800298520120800316592002801524650000901552650002601561650001501587650001101602650001701613650001101630650001501641650002001656650001501676650001701691650001301708650002201721650001101743650001301754650002201767650002001789650002901809650004301838653001101881653002101892653001501913653002701928653001801955653001801973653000901991653001602000653002002016653001902036700001502055700001802070700001602088700001302104700001702117700001702134700002902151700001702180700001702197700001702214700001702231773011002248856008602358852000902444655001202453IND60114131420221119082935.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011413142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallander, H.10aEvaluation of methods to estimate production, biomass and turnover of ectomycorrhizal mycelium in forests soils – A review  ap. 1034-1047.  aMycorrhizal fungi constitute a considerable sink for carbon in most ecosystems. This carbon is used for building extensive mycelial networks in the soil as well as for metabolic activity related to nutrient uptake. A number of methods have been developed recently to quantify production, standing biomass and turnover of extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia (EMM) in the field. These methods include minirhizotrons, in-growth mesh bags and cores, and indirect measurements of EMM based on classification of ectomycorrhizal fungi into exploration types. Here we review the state of the art of this methodology and discuss how it can be developed and applied most effectively in the field. Furthermore, we also discuss different ways to quantify fungal biomass based on biomarkers such as chitin, ergosterol and PLFAs, as well as molecular methods, such as qPCR. The evidence thus far indicates that mycorrhizal fungi are key components of microbial biomass in many ecosystems. We highlight the need to extend the application of current methods to focus on a greater range of habitats and mycorrhizal types enabling incorporation of mycorrhizal fungal biomass and turnover into biogeochemical cycling models.  aPublisher supplied data 3abags 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3achitin 3aecosystems 3aectomycorrhizae 3aergosterol 3aforest soils 3ahabitats 3amicrobial biomass 3amodels 3amycelium 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrient uptake 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aChitin 0aExploration type 0aErgosterol 0aExtramatrical mycelium 0aIn-growth bag 0aMinirhizotron 0aPLFA 0aRhizomorphs 0aSampling design 0aTurnover rates1 aEkblad, A.1 aGodbold, D.L.1 aJohnson, D.1 aBahr, A.1 aBaldrian, P.1 aBjörk, R.G.1 aKieliszewska-Rokicka, B.1 aKjøller, R.1 aKraigher, H.1 aPlassard, C.1 aRudawska, M.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 57 p.1034-1047dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005300188245014100241300001200382500001100394506007600405520121500481592002801696596007901724596006101803596007201864596009101936506003702027650001602064650002002080650003102100650001002131650003402141650002702175650001602202650002502218650002502243650001402268650001702282650000902299650001602308650002202324650001702346700001702363700001802380700001502398700001502413700001602428773011702444856008202561852000902643655001202652IND60663961820221207133442.0220411e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066396182DNAL7 a315440122pmid7 aPMC67309742pmcid7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1880-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3987-696110aGenome-wide analysis of the rice J-protein family: identification, genomic organization, and expression profiles under multiple stresses  ap. 358.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aJ-proteins which function as molecular chaperone played critical roles in plant growth, development, and response to various environment stresses, but little was reported on this gene family in rice. Here, we identified 115 putative rice J-proteins and classified them into nine major clades (I–IX) according to their phylogenetic relationships. Gene-structure analysis revealed that each member of the same clade has same or similar exon–intron structure, and most rice J-protein genes of clade VII were intronless. Chromosomes mapping suggested that tandem duplication was occurred in evolution. Expression profile showed that the 61 rice J-protein genes were expressed in at least one tissue. The result implied that they could be involved in the process of rice growth and development. The RNA-sequencing data identified 96 differentially expressed genes, 59.38% (57/96), 67.71% (65/96), and 62.50% (60/96) genes were induced by heat stress, drought stress, and salt stress, respectively. The results indicated that J-protein genes could participated in rice response to different stresses. The findings in this study would provide a foundation for further analyzing the function of J-proteins in rice.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0301502cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2018JJ2144cNatural Science Foundation of Nanhu Province  a18A480cScientific Research Foudation of Hunan Education Department  a17XKY005cScientific Research Foudation of Hunan University of Science and Engineering0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromosomes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agrowth and development 3aheat stress 3amolecular chaperones 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3arice 3asalt stress 3asequence analysis 3awater stress1 aFang, Baohua1 aWang, Weiping1 aYang, Ying1 aRao, Liqun1 aZhang, Chao0 t3 Biotech.g2019 Oct., v. 9, no. 10 p.358-358dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1880-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245008600206300001200292520070800304592002801012650001901040650001501059650001101074650001701085650001301102650002601115650001401141700002501155700002101180700002501201700001801226700002501244700002301269773010301292856008201395852000901477655001201486IND60712718720221120233105.0220929e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071271872DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-019-1841-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOndov, Brian D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0740-179310aMash Screen: high-throughput sequence containment estimation for genome discovery  ap. 232.  aThe MinHash algorithm has proven effective for rapidly estimating the resemblance of two genomes or metagenomes.

However, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the Na plating/stripping process and the problem of safety hinder their practical application. Herein, we report a facile strategy for employing the fluorinated phosphate solvents to realize highly reversible Na plating/stripping and improve the safety performance. The fluorinated phosphate molecules reduce the polarity of the solvent and lower the coordination number to Na⁺, which makes it possible to form the anion-induced ion–solvent-coordinated (AI-ISC) structures with high reduction tolerance. Moreover, the fluorination treatment enhances the oxidation resistance of the phosphate solvent, enabling compatibility with the high-voltage Na₃V₂(PO₄)₂F₃ (NVPF) cathode. As expected, the Na@Al//NVPF full cell with the as-prepared 0.9 M NaFSI/tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP) demonstrates a capacity retention of 83.4% after 200 cycles with an average CE of 99.6%. This work opens a new avenue for designing high-energy-density RSBs with improved safety performance.  aPublisher supplied data  a21972108cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aU20A20249cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2022T150494cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858  a2020BAA030cHubei Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3asodium 3asolvents 0asodium rechargeable batteries 0anonflammable electrolytes 0afluorinated phosphate 0aintrinsically safe 0aanion-induced ion−solvent coordinated1 aChen, Hui1 aShen, Xiaohui1 aLiu, Xingwei1 aFang, Yongjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8988-525X1 aZhong, Faping1 aAi, Xinping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8280-08661 aYang, Hanxi1 aCao, Yuliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6092-56520 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 14, no. 38 p.43387-43396dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c132953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245017500174300001600349520104500365592002801410650002901438650001501467650001701482650002201499650002001521650001501541650001601556650001401572651001001586700001701596700001501613773009801628856008201726852000901808655001201817IND60663961920221121094557.0190910e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066396192DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-019-00656-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltaye, Solomon Zewdu10aMolecular insights into the enhanced performance of royal jelly secretion by a stock of honeybee (Apis mellifera ligustica) selected for increasing royal jelly production  ap. 436-453.  aThe genetic selection of a high royal jelly (RJ)-producing strain of bees (RJBs) from Italian bees (ITBs) has been conducted for nearly four decades in China since the 1980s. RJBs are the most important producers of RJ in the world and produce > 90% of the total output with an annual market value of > $40 million. With technological advancements in proteomics, the mechanism underpinning the high RJ production by RJBs has been explored to new depths in the last decades. Here, we give an overview that the mechanism driving the enhanced performance of RJ secretion by RJBs. First, the selection of RJBs, high-efficiency technology for RJ production, and advances in genetic characterization of RJBs are reviewed. Then, proteome and phosphoproteome characterization that decipher the augmented RJ production using honeybee organs and tissues are summarized. This may be potentially useful in gaining a complete mechanistic insight into the high performance of RJ yields in honeybees, and expands understanding of the honeybee biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera ligustica 3ahoney bees 3amarket value 3anatural selection 3aphosphoproteome 3aproteomics 3aroyal jelly 3asecretion 3aChina1 aMeng, Lifeng1 aLi, Jianke0 tApidologie.g2019 Aug., v. 50, no. 4 p.436-453dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-019-00656-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04083naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012300172300001600295500001500311520236400326592002802690650003102718650002002749650002202769650001502791650001102806650001702817650001402834650001502848650001202863650001202875650001502887650001802902650002402920650001502944650002202959650001802981650002102999650002203020650001303042651001203055653001903067653002203086653002903108653001303137653002203150653001503172653001803187653001103205653002103216700002003237700002103257773010803278856008603386852000903472655001203481IND60114131620221119083208.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011413162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSackett, Tara E.10aIndirect and direct effects of exotic earthworms on soil nutrient and carbon pools in North American temperate forests  ap. 459-467.  a2019-12-04  aEarthworm invasions in North American temperate forests cause considerable changes to soil and litter horizons, which can lead to changes in soil biogeochemistry and plant communities. These ecosystem changes have complex causal relationships, and the cascades of indirect effects from earthworm burrowing and feeding may have larger net effects on soil biogeochemistry than direct effects. In this study we partitioned the effects of earthworms on particular soil nutrient and carbon pools into direct and indirect effects. We defined direct effects as consisting of the association between the soil nutrient or carbon pool and earthworm biomass, whilst indirect effects included the impacts earthworms have on these soil pools through changing litter layer depth and soil chemical and biotic factors. We quantified these direct and indirect effects using a path analysis approach applied to data collected from 24 plots across an earthworm gradient in a northern hardwood forest stand in Ontario, Canada. As potential predictors, we measured earthworm functional group biomass, litter depth, microbial biomass, soil pH, texture, and organic matter. We related these predictors to extractable nutrient and carbon concentrations, including nitrate/nitrite, ammonium, orthophosphate, and dissolved organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. We found few direct effects and primarily indirect effects of earthworms on the soil nutrient and carbon pools we measured. Endogeic earthworms had the strongest indirect effects via changes to pH, microbial biomass carbon, and proportion of soil organic matter. Anecic earthworms only indirectly affected soil and nutrient pools through changes in pH, and epigeic earthworms did not have either direct or indirect effects. Because endogeic earthworms had indirect effects through changing multiple soil factors, for some soil and nutrient pools these indirect effects augmented each other (primarily yielding negative effects), although in some cases indirect positive effects mitigated negative effects. Overall, the net effects of exotic earthworms on soil and nutrient pools were mostly negative. Of particular concern was the potential exacerbation by endogeic earthworms of phosphorus limitation in N-saturated forest systems, as well as carbon loss from mineral soils in addition to losses from the forest floor.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3aorthophosphates 3atemperate forests 3asoil depth 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aburrowing 3aphosphorus 3atexture 3asoil pH 3aecosystems 3amineral soils 3asoil organic matter 3aearthworms 3aplant communities 3aforest litter 3ahardwood forests 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrates 3aOntario 0aorganic matter 0aMicrobial biomass 0aNorthern hardwood forest 0aNitrogen 0aExotic earthworms 0aPhosphorus 0aPath analysis 0aCarbon 0aIndirect effects1 aSmith, Sandy M.1 aBasiliko, Nathan0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 57 p.459-467dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245010500179300001600284520112100300536017501421592002801596650002001624650001801644650001801662650002001680650000901700650002301709650001101732650001601743650002201759650001301781650001101794653001901805653001101824653002501835653001001860700003001870700002401900700002601924700001601950700002401966700001901990700002602009700001902035773014202054856008602196852000902282655001202291IND60760497420221122144814.0211223e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076049742DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.18136852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuevas-González, P.

Therefore, different physical and chemical strategies for the control of human exposure to such dietary carcinogens has been explored; however, most of these strategies are complex, costly, and have low efficiency which limited their applications. Hence, microbiological methods have been receiving more attention. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeast may act as dietary carcinogen-binding agents. This review describes the promising protective role of strains belonging mainly to the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces genera by acting as dietary carcinogen-binding agents. This property suggests that these microorganisms may have a protective role by reducing the bioaccessibility of dietary carcinogens, thereby decreasing their toxic effects. The mechanisms by which the binding process takes place have not been completely elucidated; thus, the possible underlying mechanisms and factors influencing carcinogens-binding will be addressed.  aThe authors wish to thank the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACyT) of Mexico for the graduate fellowship for authors Cuevas-González and Aguilar-Toalá.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aLactobacillus 3aSaccharomyces 3abioavailability 3adiet 3afood contamination 3ahumans 3alactic acid 3aprotective effect 3atoxicity 3ayeasts 0abinding agents 0acancer 0alactic acid bacteria 0ayeast1 aGonzález-Córdova, A.

It causes milder clinical disease than its more virulent counterpart, Theileria equi, in experimentally infected horses, and can superinfect T. equi-positive horses. The current equi merozoite antigen 1 (EMA1)-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)used in the U.S. to detect equine theileriosis detects T. equi but not T. haneyi, and the complexity of molecular assays precludes widespread use for epidemiologic studies. In order to facilitate urgently needed studies on the prevalence of T. haneyi, the goal of this study was to develop a sensitive and specific serologic assay for the diagnosis of T. haneyi based on the equi merozoite antigen 11 (ThEMA11). To achieve this objective, ThEMA11 was recombinantly expressed in eukaryotic cells and its antigenicity assessed using sera from T. haneyi-experimentally infected horses. Confirmation of sera reactivity enabled design and optimization of an indirect ELISA. Specificity of the ELISA for T. haneyi was assessed using a cohort of sera from horses experimentally infected and confirmed PCR-positive for either T. equi or T. haneyi. Data from field samples further demonstrate that the ThEMA11 ELISA is capable of identifying T. haneyi antibodies in horses from multiple continents around the world.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTheileria equi 3aantigens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahorses 3amerozoites 3atheileriosis 3avirulence1 aSears, Kelly  P.1 aDinkel, Kelcey  D.1 aKappmeyer, Lowell 1 aUeti, Massaro  W.1 aKnowles, Donald  P.1 aFry, Lindsay  M.0 tPathogens.g2021 Feb. 27, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100302703Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245008400181300001600265520131200281592002801593650001901621650001501640650002201655650002301677650001301700650001301713650002001726650001601746651001301762653002501775653001701800653003001817700002901847773010901876856008801985852000902073655001202082IND60593751920221122073945.0190325e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059375192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangiuliano, Stephen J.12aA quality management review of Scotland's sectoral marine plan for tidal energy  ap. 217-226.  aAs coastal communities continue to increase in size and population, associated marine economies will have to expand in unison. This relationship gives rise to an increase in user – user and user – environment conflicts. Such conflicts demand the implementation of marine spatial planning (MSP) in order to effectively manage users and uses within the marine environment. Furthermore, climate change increasingly threatens the integrity of marine ecosystems, thereby affecting the economies of coastal communities. Political support for the adoption of offshore renewable energy has increased in order to assist a transition away from carbon-based economies. These drivers have triggered Scotland to construct and implement the world's first sectoral marine plan for tidal energy (SMPTE). As this SMPTE is the first of its kind, it is important to include a quality assurance element in the plan framework. The authors have undertaken a quality management review of Scotland's SMPTE against guidelines set out in the International Council for Exploration of the Sea's Marine Spatial Planning Quality Management System (ICES MSP QMS). Conformity of the SMPTE to criteria set out in the ICES MSP QMS are ranked, gaps in quality management are analyzed, and recommendations are made for further improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aguidelines 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3aplanning 3apolitics 3aquality control 3awater power 3aScotland 0aSectoral marine plan 0aTidal energy 0aQuality management review1 aDavies, I.

The aims of this study were (1) to determine the sensory characteristics of fresh human fore and hind milk, (2) to establish relationships between sensory properties and composition of fresh human milk, and (3) to assess the relationship between bitterness of the maternal diet and human milk. Twenty-two lactating mothers generated sensory terms to describe perception of their milk and received training on sensory attribute intensity rating. Mothers kept a 24-h food diary followed by a sensory self-assessment of their fore and hind milks. The odor of human fresh milk was described as neutral, creamy, and sweet, taste as sweet and bitter, and mouthfeel as thin, watery, smooth, and fatty. Sweetness was equivalent to 1.53 g of sucrose/100 mL and was not significantly different between fore and hind milk. Fore milk was significantly less creamy, less fatty, thinner, more watery, and lower in vanilla flavor intensity than hind milk. Carbohydrate content of human milk was positively correlated with sweetness and glutamic acid content with umami. The bitterness of the diet consumed 24 h before lactation was moderately positively correlated with bitterness of fore milk, but not hind milk. We conclude that the consumption of bitter foods may influence the bitterness of human fore milk, which may be another way for breastfed children to learn to accept bitter vegetables and, hence, develop healthier food preferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3abitterness 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3acarbohydrate content 3achildren 3afood choices 3afood records 3aglutamic acid 3ahumans 3alactating women 3alactation 3amaternal nutrition 3amilk 3amothers 3amouthfeel 3aodors 3asweetness 3ataste 3aumami 3avegetables 0abreastfeeding 0ahuman milk 0asensory perception 0abitterness 0amaternal diet1 aRuark, Angelica1 aWeenen, Hugo1 aStahl, Bernd1 aStieger, Markus0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 Feb., v. 102, no. 2 p.1116-1130dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-153393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245016700182300001600349520088600365592002801251650001601279650001901295650001701314650001301331650001401344650001301358650001801371650001901389650001801408650000701426650001201433650001701445650001601462653001301478653001301491653001801504653001701522653001901539653002501558700002001583700001801603700001801621700002201639773010001661856008701761852000901848655001201857IND60526040020221122050238.0190402e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052604002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.01.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGültekin-Özgüven, Mine10aFortification of dark chocolate with spray dried black mulberry (Morus nigra) waste extract encapsulated in chitosan-coated liposomes and bioaccessability studies  ap. 205-212.  aFine-disperse anionic liposomes containing black mulberry (Morus nigra) extract (BME) were prepared by high pressure homogenization at 25,000psi. Primary liposomes were coated with cationic chitosan (0.4, w/v%) using the layer-by-layer depositing method and mixed with maltodextrin (MD) (20, w/v%) prior to spray drying. After that, spray dried liposomal powders containing BME were added to chocolates with alkalization degrees (pH 4.5, 6, 7.5) at conching temperatures of 40°C, 60°C, and 80°C. The results showed that, compared to spray dried extract, chitosan coated liposomal powders provided better protection of anthocyanin content in both increased temperature and pH. In addition, encapsulation in liposomes enhanced in vitro bioaccessability of anthocyanins.

Its distribution pattern is scattered. The variability of the mtDNA gene encoding cytochrome oxidase I was studied in populations of S. degrangei from the Western Carpathians in Slovakia and in the northern Hellenides of Greece. In the analyzed samples, 21 haplotypes were recorded, of which twenty were private and occurred in only one mountain range, but one haplotype was found in all three studied populations from the Western Carpathians. Both haplotypes from the Hellenides were private, but these were not isolated and they fit into the haplotype network of the Western Carpathians. Statistics of genetic variability, different designs of analysis of molecular variation with non-significant differences and the pair-wise genetic distances support the hypothesis that there are no differences between the analyzed populations. Similarly, using nested clade phylogeographical analysis, no genetic-geographical structure was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSimulium 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3astatistics 3aGreece 3aSlovakia 0aSimulium degrangei Dorier & Grenier 0acytochrome oxidase I 0aWestern Carpathians 0aHellenides 0agenetic variability1 aKÃºdela, MatÃºÅ¡1 aSzemes, TomÃ¡Å¡1 aCelec, Peter0 tBiologia.g2012 June 30, v. 67, no. 4 p.777-787dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-012-0057-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010100162300001200263520166500275592002801940596005201968650002802020650002002048650002702068650001102095650001102106650002702117650001402144650002502158650001402183700001902197700005802216773010302274856008202377852000902459655001202468IND60712719220221122052433.0220929e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071271922DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-019-1858-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Anbo10aEvaluating nanopore sequencing data processing pipelines for structural variation identification  ap. 237.  aBACKGROUND: Structural variations (SVs) account for about 1% of the differences among human genomes and play a significant role in phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. The emerging nanopore sequencing technology can generate long sequence reads and can potentially provide accurate SV identification. However, the tools for aligning long-read data and detecting SVs have not been thoroughly evaluated. RESULTS: Using four nanopore datasets, including both empirical and simulated reads, we evaluate four alignment tools and three SV detection tools. We also evaluate the impact of sequencing depth on SV detection. Finally, we develop a machine learning approach to integrate call sets from multiple pipelines. Overall SV callers’ performance varies depending on the SV types. For an initial data assessment, we recommend using aligner minimap2 in combination with SV caller Sniffles because of their speed and relatively balanced performance. For detailed analysis, we recommend incorporating information from multiple call sets to improve the SV call performance. CONCLUSIONS: We present a workflow for evaluating aligners and SV callers for nanopore sequencing data and approaches for integrating multiple call sets. Our results indicate that additional optimizations are needed to improve SV detection accuracy and sensitivity, and an integrated call set can provide enhanced performance. The nanopore technology is improving, and the sequencing community is likely to grow accordingly. In turn, better benchmark call sets will be available to more accurately assess the performance of available tools and facilitate further tool development.  aPublisher supplied data  aStartupcHuman Genetics Institute of New Jersey 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3adisease susceptibility 3agenome 3ahumans 3ainformation processing 3ananopores 3aphenotypic variation 3apipelines1 aLin, Daoliang,1 aXing, Jinchuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6469-87330 tGenome biology.g2019 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.237-237dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1858-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245017200167300001600339520123400355592002801589650001601617650002001633650004301653650001801696650002101714650003301735650001501768650001901783650001901802653006501821653004301886653000901929653002501938653004701963653004502010653004702055653007502102653007502177653003402252653003302286653003202319700002002351700001502371700001802386773009602404856008702500852000902587655001202596IND60526627920221119192748.0190408e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052662792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Juan10aMethod development for the analysis of phthalate esters in tea beverages by ionic liquid hollow fibre liquid-phase microextraction and liquid chromatographic detection  ap. 278-284.  aA novel method, termed ionic liquid-based hollow fibre liquid phase microextraction (IL-HF-PLME), coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed for separation and preconcentration of three phthalate esters (PAEs) in tea beverage. In the present study, ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methy-limidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIm]PF6) was placed in the porous-walled polypropylene hollow fibre as the acceptor phase, and nonanol was used as the supported liquid membrane phase that accomplished extraction. Several important parameters influencing the extraction efficiency were investigated in detail. Under the optimized conditions, good linearity occurred in the range of 5–1000 ng mL−1 with the correlation coefficients values above 0.998. The limits of detection ranged from 0.67 to 1.73 ng mL−1. Recoveries of three PAEs in two kinds of spiked tea beverage samples (PAEs, 10.0–100.0 ng mL) were between 94.2 and 103.4%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 1.77 to 3.02%. The enrichment factors were 200. The developed IL-HF-PLME method allowed the simple, rapid, and sensitive determination of phthalate esters in tea beverage samples with an extraction time of just 4 min.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionic liquids 3aliquid membranes 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3aphthalates 3apolypropylenes 3atea (beverage) 0aIonic liquid-based hollow fibre liquid phase microextraction 0aHigh-performance liquid chromatography 0aPAEs 0aTea beverage samples 0aBenzyl butyl phthalate (PubChem CID: 2347) 0aDi-n-butyl phthalate (PubChem CID: 3026) 0aDicyclohexyl phthalate (PubChem CID: 6777) 0a1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (PubChem CID: 2734174) 0a1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (PubChem CID: 2734175) 0aHeptanol (PubChem CID: 31289) 0aNonanol (PubChem CID: 31289) 0aDecanol (PubChem CID: 8174)1 aHuang, Shansong1 aWang, Ping1 aCangmingshui,0 tFood control.g2016 Sept., v. 67 p.278-284dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520144900293592002801742650002001770650001801790650001101808650001201819650001001831650001301841650001201854650001601866650001101882650001301893650000901906650002101915650001401936650001001950650002301960650002101983650001602004700002202020700002502042773010202067856004802169852000902217655001202226IND50063186820221119090746.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006318682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-012-1123-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalal, Monika10aIdentification and expression analysis of group 3 LEA family genes in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Group 3 LEA genes from barley and rice have been shown to play crucial role in abiotic stress tolerance. Here, we present a genome-wide analysis of LEA3 genes in sorghum. We identified four genes encoding LEA3 proteins in the sorghum genome and further classified them into LEA3A and LEA3B subgroups based on the conservation of LEA3 specific motifs. Further, expression pattern of these genes were analyzed in seeds during development and vegetative tissues under abiotic stresses. SbLEA3A group genes showed expression at early stage of seed development and increased significantly at maturity, while SbLEA3B group genes expressed only in matured seeds. Expression of SbLEA3 genes in response to abiotic stresses such as soil moisture deficit (drought), osmotic, salt, and temperature stresses, and exogenous ABA treatments was also studied in the leaves of 2-weeks-old seedlings. ABA and drought induced the expression of all LEA3 genes, while cold and heat stress induced none of them. Promoter analysis revealed the presence of multiple ABRE core cis-elements and a few low temperature response (LTRE)/drought responsive (DRE) cis-elements. This study suggests non-redundant function of LEA3 genes in seed development and stress tolerance in sorghum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aabscisic acid 3abarley 3adrought 3agenes 3agenomics 3agrasses 3aheat stress 3aleaves 3aproteins 3arice 3aseed development 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil water deficit 3astress tolerance 3atemperature1 aSandeep Kumar, G.1 aMayandi, Karthikeyan0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2013 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.979-984dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-012-1123-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013700178500002200315520137100337592002801708650001101736650001701747650001001764650001801774650002301792650002301815650001801838650002301856650003001879650003301909650001701942650001201959650000901971650002501980653001502005653001102020653001502031653001402046700001802060700002702078700002102105773008102126856008502207852000902292655001202301IND60585899820221120025823.0171114s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058589982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhaffarzadegan, Tannaz10aEffects of barley variety, dietary fibre and β-glucan content on bile acid composition in caecum of rats fed low and high fat diets  aPre-press version  aDiet-induced obesity and insulin resistance have been linked to changes in bile acid (BA) profiles, which in turn is highly dependent on the dietary composition and activity of the gut microbiota. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fibre had an effect on caecal BA composition when included in low and high fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fibre. BAs were pre-concentrated using hollow fibre liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas-chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs; lithocholic-, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low fat diets (p < 0.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs; ursodeoxycholic acid and β- and ω-muricholic acids were two to five times higher (p<0.05) in groups fed low fat diets than in groups fed high fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fibre in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3acecum 3adietary fiber 3aexperimental diets 3agas chromatography 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3alow fat diet 3aobesity 3arats 3aursodeoxycholic acid 0aBile acids 0aBarley 0aβ-glucans 0aCellulose1 aZhong, Yadong1 aHållenius, Frida Fåk1 aNyman, Margareta0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016400172500001400336520145100350592002801801650001501829650002601844650001801870650001101888650001701899650001601916650001201932650002901944650001601973650003001989650001402019650001802033650001702051651001702068700002402085700002302109700002602132773012302158856008102281852000902362655001202371IND60732195720221119090814.0210326e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073219572DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100302732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokgophi, Thelma  M.10aAntimicrobial Resistance Profiles of Salmonella Isolates on Chickens Processed and Retailed at Outlets of the Informal Market in Gauteng Province, South Africa  aNAL-light  aThe study determined the antimicrobial resistance profiles of Salmonella on chickens processed and retailed at outlets of the informal markets in Gauteng province, South Africa. The study also investigated the relationship of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella to the source and type of samples and their serotypes. Carcass swabs, cloacal swabs and carcass drips were randomly collected from each of 151 slaughtered chickens from six townships. Isolation and identification were performed using standard and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. The disc diffusion method was used to determine the resistance of Salmonella isolates to 16 antimicrobial agents and PCR to determine their serovars. Ninety-eight (64.9%) of the 151 chickens were contaminated with Salmonella of which 94.9% (93/98) were resistant serovars. The frequency of antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates was high to erythromycin (94.9%) and spectinomycin (82.7%) but was low to ciprofloxacin (1.0%) and norfloxacin (1.0%) (p < 0.05). All 170 isolates of Salmonella tested exhibited resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents and the frequency varied significantly (p < 0.05) across the townships, the type of samples and the serovars. The prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in Salmonella was 81.8% (139/170). Our findings pose zoonotic, food safety and therapeutic risks to workers and consumers of undercooked, contaminated chickens from these outlets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aantibiotic resistance 3aciprofloxacin 3acloaca 3aerythromycin 3afood safety 3amarkets 3amultiple drug resistance 3anorfloxacin 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3aspectinomycin 3atherapeutics 3aSouth Africa1 aGcebe, Nomakorinte 1 aFasina, Folorunso 1 aAdesiyun, Abiodun A.,0 tPathogens.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100302733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011200168300001600280520113900296592002801435650001501463650001501478650001701493650001001510650001901520650002001539650000901559650001101568650001201579650002301591650001501614650001201629650002101641650001901662651001101681653001601692653003901708653002301747653001901770653002001789700001901809700001801828700001701846700001701863700001901880773008901899856008401988852000902072655001202081IND60546082920221119170130.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054608292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.08.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pei-Wei10aPrenatal nonylphenol exposure, oxidative and nitrative stress, and birth outcomes: A cohort study in Taiwan  ap. 145-151.  aData concerning the effects of prenatal exposures to nonylphenol (NP) and oxidative stress on neonatal birth outcomes from human studies are limited. A total of 146 pregnant women were studied (1) to investigate the association between prenatal NP exposure and maternal oxidative/nitrative stress biomarkers of DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-nitroguanine (8-NO2Gua)) and lipid peroxidation (8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-isoPF2α), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid (HNE-MA)) and (2) to explore the associations among oxidative stress biomarkers, NP exposure, and neonatal birth outcomes, including gestational age, birth weight, length, Ponderal index, and head and chest circumferences. NP significantly increased the 8-OHdG and 8-NO2Gua levels. All infants born to mothers with urinary 8-OHdG levels above the median exhibited a significantly shorter gestational duration (Badjusted = −4.72 days; 95% CI: −8.08 to −1.36 days). No clear association was found between NP levels and birth outcomes.

However, insufficient agitation leads to a significant reduction in reactor performance. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the organic degradation reactions that are limited or accelerated by agitation to ensure proper agitation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different agitation frequencies on solubilization, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis. Food waste, which is a relatively easily degradable and common substrate for anaerobic digestion, was treated in a mesophilic batch operation under continuous, intermittent (15 min every 6, 12, and 24 h), or no agitation conditions. The highest cumulative CH₄ yield of 339 NmL g-COD⁻¹ was obtained under intermittent agitation once every 12 h, followed by 306 and 304 NmL g-COD⁻¹ under continuous agitation and once per 6 h agitation, respectively. However, lower agitation conditions (once per 24 h and no agitation) showed lower methane yields. Based on the mass balance of chemical oxygen demand, the solubilization efficiency tended to be high under high agitation frequency. Furthermore, the highest acidogenesis and methanogenesis efficiencies were obtained under once per 12 h agitation. The number of microbial cells and the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens that work with H₂ producing bacteria decreased, likely due to agitation stress. A once per 12 h agitation was sufficient to promote solubilization and avoid agitation stress on microorganisms in the food waste treatment. Moderate intermittent agitation is a promising method for maximizing CH₄ recovery and minimizing energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagitation 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenergy 3afood waste 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3asolubilization 3awaste treatment 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aDifferent mixing frequency 0aFood waste 0aCOD mass Balance 0aMicrobial community structure1 aMizuno, Naoki1 aFujiwara, Masaaki1 aKodera, Toshimitsu1 aToda, Tatsuki0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2022 Sept., v. 164 p.106551-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.1065513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245015000169506010400319506007600423520170300499592002802202506003702230650001402267650001202281650001402293650002302307650001102330650001902341650001202360650001602372650001702388650001302405650001302418653002602431653002602457653001902483653001802502700001802520700001702538700001202555700001702567700001602584700001902600700001702619700001302636700001902649700001702668700005502685773010702740856008702847852000902934655001202943IND60788696620221207133818.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078869662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.1065522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Hengyu10aCs exchanged 12-tungstophosphoric acid supported on high-silica mesoporous Y zeolites for synthesis of ethyl lactate via catalytic esterification  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEthyl lactate is a promising green solvent, which can be produced via esterification of biomass derived lactic acid and ethanol. Herein, we report the development of highly active and stable polyoxometalates (POMs) supported on zeolite catalysts for synthesis of ethyl lactate. Repetitive stability tests were performed using the developed catalysts, and comparative characterization of the fresh and used catalysts was performed to understand the changes in the physicochemical properties of the catalysts. It was found that low-silica Y zeolites (silicon-to-aluminum ratio, SAR, of 2 and 5) are prone to be dealuminated (by lactic acid) under the reaction conditions, and thus being not suitable to be used as the catalyst support. Direct support of 12-tungstophosphoric acid (by impregnation) on high-silica Y zeolite (SAR40) led to deactivation during catalysis due to 12-tungstophosphoric acid leaching. This issue was solved by surface modification of the high-silica Y zeolite using cesium (Cs) ions before impregnation of 12-tungstophosphoric acid because the formed cesium phosphotungstate is insoluble in the reaction. As a result, a stable composite catalyst of Cs exchanged 12-tungstophosphoric acid supported on high-silica mesoporous Y was developed, which showed good reusability. In detail, after seven cyclic tests, the physiochemical properties of the catalyst and the catalytic performance remained relatively stable, e.g., the yield of ethyl lactate remained at around 29.6%. Findings of the study show that the stability of the zeolitic support and the support heteropolyacid are equally important for obtaining a stable catalyst for ethyl lactate synthesis via esterification.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acesium 3aesterification 3aethanol 3alactic acid 3aporous media 3asolvents 3azeolites 0aHigh-silica Y zeolite 0aPolyoxometalate (POM) 0aEsterification 0aEthyl lactate1 aZhou, Yangtao1 aWen, Guodong1 aXu, Lei1 aDing, Qiuyan1 aGuan, Yanan1 aYang, Zhenyuan1 aSun, Yanzhao1 aGao, Xin1 aZhang, Jinsong1 aFan, Xiaolei1 aJiao, Yilai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0498-81860 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2022 Oct., v. 165 p.106552-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.1065523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245012200166300001800288520039100306592002800697650002300725650001100748650001200759650002900771650001300800650001500813650001100828700002200839700002000861700002500881700002600906773013400932856007401066852000901140655001201149IND60683964320221121010202.0200214e20200213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068396432DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc09525j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKałuża, Adrianna M.10a[Cu(4-phenylpyridine)₄(trifluoromethanesulfonate)₂], a Werner complex that exhibits high selectivity for o-xylene  ap. 1940-1943.  a[Cu(4-phenylpyridine)₄(trifluoromethanesulfonate)₂] is a new Werner complex that exhibits switching behaviour between non-porous (apohost) and porous (guest-loaded) phases upon exposure to o-xylene but not when exposed to other C8 isomers.

A Modeling Approach  ap. 15734-15743.  aIt is generally accepted that intervention strategies to curb antibiotic resistance cannot solely focus on human and veterinary medicine but must also consider environmental settings. While the environment clearly has a role in transmission of resistant bacteria, its role in the emergence of novel antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is less clear. It has been suggested that the environment constitutes an enormous recruitment ground for ARGs to pathogens, but its extent is practically unknown. We have constructed a model framework for resistance emergence and used available quantitative data on relevant processes to identify limiting steps in the appearance of ARGs in human pathogens. We found that in a majority of possible scenarios, the environment would only play a minor role in the emergence of novel ARGs. However, the uncertainty is enormous, highlighting an urgent need for more quantitative data. Specifically, more data is most needed on the fitness costs of ARG carriage, the degree of dispersal of resistant bacteria from the environment to humans, and the rates of mobilization and horizontal transfer of ARGs. This type of data is instrumental to determine which processes should be targeted for interventions to curb development and transmission of ARGs in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aenvironmental science 3ahumans 3atechnology 3auncertainty 3aveterinary medicine 0ahuman and animal health 0amobile genetic elements 0amobilization 0aorigin of antibiotic resistance genes 0apathogenic bacteria1 aJonsson, Viktor1 aHeß, Stefanie0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Nov. 18, v. 55, no. 23 p.15734-15743dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c029773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010500164300001200269500001900281520180600300592002802106596005902134596008202193650001002275650002202285650002202307650001302329651001002342700002002352700001602372700001602388700001602404700001502420773013502435856008302570852000902653655001202662IND60697200320221121055728.0200608e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069720032DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-09011-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Bingli10aStability analysis of Cavern No. 5 with the largest span in Heidong large ancient underground quarry  ap. 273.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Heidong Cavern Group of China includes 21 large-scale caverns that have remained stable for 1400 years. Cavern No. 5 of the Heidong Cavern Group is characterized by an unsupported span of up to 92 m, which is considered to be the largest span in a single underground artificial rock cavern. Cavern No. 5 may have gone through a period during which it was the only cavern and a period during which it had adjacent caverns; recent investigations have proved that Cavern No. 5 is suffering from considerably serious partial damage. The factors affecting the stability of Cavern No. 5, including waste rock accumulations, rock mass structures, surrounding rock quality, and cavern structures, were analyzed to prevent further damage and analyze the influence of the existence of adjacent caverns on the stability of Cavern No. 5. The numerical analysis software MIDAS GTS (Geotechnical and tunnel analysis system) was used to simulate and compare the stability of Cavern No. 5 under the single-cavern and adjacent-cavern cases. Research proves that when this cavern is independently considered and the remaining caverns are excluded, the arched roof structure is considerably favorable to ensure the cavern’s stability and the horizontal compressive stress of the roof becomes approximately equivalent to the vertical tensile stress. The horizontal forces generated by the cavern’s inclined roof contribute to the cavern’s stability. The horizontal compressive stress area of the roof and the effect of the arched structure decrease when adjacent caverns are present, causing the roof to become prone to tensile failure. These results provide a reference for modern underground engineering construction and a theoretical basis for long-term protection of the large and ancient Heidong Caverns.  aPublisher supplied data  a41672321cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a16JK1489cSpecial research project of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department 3acaves 3acomputer software 3amechanical stress 3aquarries 3aChina1 aZhang, Haixiang1 aHe, Wantong1 aYang, Zhifa1 aCai, Zhiyun1 aZhang, Qun0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2020 June, v. 79, no. 11 p.273-273dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09011-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012700165300001800292500001900310520191700329592002802246650001502274650002302289650001302312650001002325650001902335650001702354650001802371650000902389650000702398650002202405650002702427650001702454700002502471700006602496773011402562856008402676852000902760655001202769IND60706951120221119093356.0200811e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070695112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c010952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Emma10aProbing the Molecular Structure of Coadsorbed Polyethylenimine and Charged Surfactants at the Nanoemulsion Droplet Surface  ap. 9081-9089.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanoemulsions, nanoscale oil droplets dispersed in an aqueous medium, can be stabilized by polymer–surfactant (PS) mixtures, making them ubiquitous in commercial, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications. It is well-known that the presence of PS layers coadsorbed at the droplet surface plays a significant role in droplet stability and functionality; however, little is understood about the molecular nature of this coadsorption. Such insights are especially important for application in drug delivery where physiological conditions can vary the environmental pH and significantly impact stabilization. Hence, the focus of this study examines the surface properties of ∼300 nm nanoemulsions stabilized by the coadsorption of polyethylenimine (PEI) and charged alkyl surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB). PEI is a common charge-tunable polymer used in nanocarrier templates. This study employs vibrational sum frequency scattering spectroscopy, coupled with ζ-potential and surface pressure measurements performed as a function of varying concentrations and pH. The surface specific spectroscopic results reported herein reveal that PEI adsorption and molecular ordering is influenced by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. While the degree of PEI adsorption is stronger in the presence of anionic SDS than cationic DTAB, for both surfactants, PEI is molecularly disordered in acidic conditions and adopts a persistent net ordering as the solution pH becomes more basic. Both surfactants also display degrees of interfacial conformational ordering that is altered by the presence of the coadsorbed polymer. These results demonstrate the molecular-level diversity in PEI behavior at the droplet interface and provide insight into how such behavior can be controlled to yield nanocarrier technology with specific functions and enhanced efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical structure 3adroplets 3adrugs 3ahydrophobicity 3ananocarriers 3ananoemulsions 3aoils 3apH 3apolyethyleneimine 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aspectroscopy1 aCarpenter, Andrew P.1 aRichmond, Geraldine L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0876-52620 tLangmuir.g2020 July 15, v. 36, no. 31 p.9081-9089dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c010953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245015000165300002000315520162600335592002801961650001101989650002102000650001402021650001902035650003702054653001102091653004102102653003902143700002002182700002202202700002002224700002302244700002102267700001602288700001802304773012602322856008002448852000902528655001202537IND60528798220221120180258.0160717e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052879822DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b097782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Ting-Hsun10aHigh Stability Electron Field Emitters Synthesized via the Combination of Carbon Nanotubes and N2-Plasma Grown Ultrananocrystalline Diamond Films  ap. 27526-27538.  aAn electron field emitter with superior electron field emission (EFE) properties and improved lifetime stability is being demonstrated via the combination of carbon nanotubes and the CH₄/N₂ plasma grown ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) films. The resistance of the carbon nanotubes to plasma ion bombardment is improved by the formation of carbon nanocones on the side walls of the carbon nanotubes, thus forming strengthened carbon nanotubes (s-CNTs). The N-UNCD films can thus be grown on s-CNTs, forming N-UNCD/s-CNTs carbon nanocomposite materials. The N-UNCD/s-CNTs films possess good conductivity of σ = 237 S/cm and marvelous EFE properties, such as low turn-on field of (E₀) = 3.58 V/μm with large EFE current density of (Jₑ) = 1.86 mA/cm² at an applied field of 6.0 V/μm. Moreover, the EFE emitters can be operated under 0.19 mA/cm² for more than 350 min without showing any sign of degradation. Such a superior EFE property along with high robustness characteristic of these combination of materials are not attainable with neither N-UNCD films nor s-CNTs films alone. Transmission electron microscopic investigations indicated that the N-UNCD films contain needle-like diamond grains encased in a few layers of nanographitic phase, which enhanced markedly the transport of electrons in the N-UNCD films. Moreover, the needle-like diamond grains were nucleated from the s-CNTs without the necessity of forming the interlayer that facilitate the transport of electrons crossing the diamond-to-Si interface. Both these factors contributed to the enhanced EFE behavior of the N-UNCD/s-CNTs films.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrons 3ananocomposites 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aN-UNCD 0astrengthen carbon nanotubes (s-CNTs) 0aelectron field emission properties1 aHsieh, Ping-Yen1 aKunuku, Srinivasu1 aLou, Shiu-Cheng1 aManoharan, Divinah1 aLeou, Keh-Chyang1 aLin, Yinan,1 aTai, Nyan-Hwa0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 7, no. 49 p.27526-27538dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b097783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003200152245016200184520171700346592002802063650001802091650001302109650001302122650001202135650001602147650001902163650001502182650001602197650001902213650001102232650001502243650001402258653002102272653001402293653001502307653001102322653002802333653001802361700002602379700002502405700002302430700001702453700002302470700002502493700001902518700002302537700002302560700002402583700002002607700001902627773010702646856008702753852000902840655001202849IND60788696820221122183458.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078869682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.1065552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Villarreal, Sergio10aDrop-in biofuels production from microalgae to hydrocarbons: Microalgal cultivation and harvesting, conversion pathways, economics and prospects for aviation  aIn the last few years, governments all around the world have agreed upon migrating towards carbon-neutral economies as a strategy for restraining the effects of climate change. A major obstacle limiting this achievement is greenhouse gases emissions, for which the aviation sector is a key contributor because of its dependence on fossil fuels. As an alternative, biofuels with similar characteristics to current fossil-fuels and fully compatible with the existing petroleum infrastructure (i.e., drop-in biofuels) are being developed. In this regard, microalgae are a promising feedstock thanks to, among other aspects, their potential for lipid accumulation. This review outlines the development status, opportunities, and challenges of different technologies that are capable of or applicable to transform microalgae into aviation fuels. To this effect, a baseline of the existing jet fuels and the requirements for potential aviation biofuels is initially presented. Then, microalgae production and valorization techniques are discussed with an emphasis on the thermochemical pathways. Finally, an assessment of the present techno-economic feasibility of microalgae-derived aviation fuels is discussed, along with the authors’ point of view on the suitability of these techniques. Further developments are needed to reduce the costs of cultivation and harvesting of microalgae, and a biorefinery approach might improve the economics of the overall process. In addition, while each of the conversion routes described has its advantages and drawbacks, they converge upon the need of optimizing the deoxygenation techniques and the proportion of the suitable type of hydrocarbons that match fuel requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae culture 3aaviation 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3aclimate change 3afeedstocks 3agreenhouses 3ainfrastructure 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3apetroleum 0aDrop-in biofuels 0aJet fuels 0aMicroalgae 0aLipids 0aThermochemical pathways 0aDeoxygenation1 aBreitenstein, Antoine1 aNimmegeers, Philippe1 aPerez Saura, Pablo1 aHai, Bingxin1 aAsomaning, Justice1 aEslami, Ali Alizadeh1 aBillen, Pieter1 aVan Passel, Steven1 aBressler, David C.1 aDebecker, Damien P.1 aRemacle, Claire1 aRichel, Aurore0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2022 Oct., v. 165 p.106555-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.1065553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245012700173300001600300506011700316506007600433520107700509592002801586506003701614650001301651650001101664650002401675650002201699650001601721650001701737650001401754651001501768653001301783653001501796653000901811653001301820653001801833700002301851700002201874773011501896856008302011852000902094655001202103IND60758862720221207092210.0220529e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075886272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.11.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontero-Muñoz, Iris10aFour new species of Acalypha L.

These new species are quite well characterized morphologically and ecologically and are easily differentiated from morphologically similar ones. A. ankaranensis and A. levinii are most similar to A. paxii Aug.DC., a common species in northern Magdagascar, A. cardielii is close to A. leptomyura Baill, and A. magistri is close to A. chibomboa Baill. According to our preliminary conservation assessments, A. ankaranensis and A. cardielii are Critically Endangered, A. levinii is Endangered, and A. magistri is Vulnerable.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcalypha 3abotany 3aconservation status 3adeciduous forests 3anew species 3arain forests 3awoodlands 3aMadagascar 0aAcalypha 0aMadagascar 0aIUCN 0aTaxonomy 0aEuphorbiaceae1 aLevin, Geoffrey A.1 aCardiel, José M.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 May, v. 146 p.634-642dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.11.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005500145245008700200300002000287520104700307592002801354650002301382650002301405650001301428650001901441650001201460650002601472650002101498650001301519650001101532653001301543653002401556653003001580653001301610653001501623773014201638856008001780852000901860655001201869IND60759240920221119114646.0211207e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075924092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c034222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWynes, Seth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3931-316510aCOVID-19 Disruption Demonstrates Win-Win Climate Solutions for Major League Sports  ap. 15609-15615.  aUnlike other greenhouse gas sources associated with professional sports, team air travel is highly visible, under direct league control, and extremely difficult to decarbonize with technological advancement alone. In an analysis of air travel emissions from the four largest North American sports leagues, I estimate that teams traveled a combined 7.5 million kilometers in 2018, generating nearly 122 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. But the 2020 season saw major declines in travel as teams and leagues adjusted for the pandemic. Scheduling changes with cobenefits for player health and performance were central to this strategy including increased sorting of schedules by region and more consecutive repeated games (“baseball-style” series). If the scheduling changes implemented in 2020 were maintained in future years, air travel emissions reductions of 22% each year could be expected. Additional reductions in air travel emissions could also be achieved by using more fuel-efficient aircraft and shortened regular seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aair transportation 3aaircraft 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aenvironmental science 3agreenhouse gases 3apandemic 3atravel 0aaviation 0amajor league sports 0aclimate change mitigation 0aCOVID-19 0aair travel0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 55, no. 23 p.15609-15615dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c034223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012500163300001600288520162100304592002801925650001701953650002701970650001601997650001302013650002002026650002202046650001102068650002602079650001802105650001602123650002302139650002202162650001002184651001102194653001202205653001502217653001502232653001902247653001602266653002302282653002602305700001802331773009602349856008302445852000902528655001202537IND60479931120221120131035.0160124e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047993112DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.13.2012.2.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasi, B.

Quadrats of 400 cm<sup>2</sup> were superposed along four vertical profiles and sampled by a photoquadrat method. A seasonal difference was identified in the degree of air exposure, which was higher in October 2005 and February 2006. Air temperature and wave height and periodicity differed significantly among the four studied periods. Some species occurred only in one period as <i>Fissurella clenchi</i> in July 2005 and October 2005, <i>Gracilaria domingensis</i> in July 2005, <i>Grateloupia</i> sp. in October 2005) and <i>Porphyra acanthophora</i> in October 2005 and February 2006. Species richness and diversity values were higher in the intermediary quadrats in all the studied periods. The intermediate benthic strip occupied a narrower zone, changing its spatial location according to the season of the year: in May 2005 it was closer to the lower zone, in July and October 2005 it occupied an intermediate position, and in February 2006 it was nearest to the upper quadrats. The hypothesis of intra-annual variation of the benthic community distribution according to the seasonal variability of tides, air temperatures, wave height and periodicity was accepted for the intermediate strip of the intertidal zone, related to taxonomic differences and on the abundance of dominant species considering the four studied seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthophora 3aGracilaria domingensis 3aGrateloupia 3aPorphyra 3aair temperature 3abenthic organisms 3acoasts 3aenvironmental factors 3alittoral zone 3aperiodicity 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3atides 3aBrazil 0aBoulder 0aEpibenthic 0aIntertidal 0aRio de Janeiro 0aRocky shore 0aSeasonal variation 0aVertical distribution1 aZalmon, I.

Using a potted experiment in a grassland, we measured PSFs with and without aboveground insect herbivory for 20 plant species. We then compared PSF values to plant landscape abundance. Aboveground herbivory had a large negative effect on PSF values. For 15 of 20 species, PSFs were more negative with herbivory than without. This occurred because plant biomass on “home” soils was smaller with herbivory than without. PSF values with herbivory were correlated with plant landscape abundance, whereas PSF values without herbivory were not. Shoot nitrogen concentrations suggested that plants create soils that increase nitrogen uptake, but that greater shoot nitrogen values increase herbivory and that the net effect of positive PSF and greater aboveground herbivory is less aboveground biomass. Results provided clear evidence that PSFs alone have limited power in explaining species abundances and that herbivory has stronger effects on plant biomass and growth on the landscape. Our results provide a potential explanation for observed differences between greenhouse and field PSF experiments and suggest that PSF experiments need to consider important biotic interactions, like aboveground herbivory, particularly when the goal of PSF research is to understand plant growth in field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3agrasslands 3agreenhouses 3aherbivores 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3anitrogen 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3asoil-plant interactions 3aspecies abundance1 aWacker, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9687-64771 aKulmatiski, Andrew0 tEcology.g2020 June, v. 101, no. 6 p.e03023-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.30233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010300172300001600275520206800291592002802359650002202387650001402409650001202423650002002435650002302455650001102478650001902489650003102508650001802539650002502557650002002582650000902602650003302611650001102644653001702655653003302672653001902705653001802724653001602742653002102758700001602779700001802795773008902813856008502902852000902987655001202996IND60607803620221119213919.0180830e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060780362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtmanli, Alpaslan10aOptimization of diesel–butanol–vegetable oil blend ratios based on engine operating parameters  ap. 569-580.  aThe rule of thumb in literature is that 20% of biodiesel is the most acceptable blend ratio in alternative fuel blends. This work focuses on in-depth mathematical optimization analyses of ternary blends of diesel–butanol–vegetable oil (cotton oil), based on engine operating parameters using RSM (response surface methodology). It is critical to achieve the maximum power and torque for customers while keeping the emissions low enough due to government regulations and certifications. Thus, three optimization studies were conducted at 2200 rpm, which corresponds to the maximum brake torque, and engine emissions were fixed at a maximum possible value based on emission standards, for all three studies. In order to understand the impact of other engine parameters on the blend ratio, as well, various combinations of BTE (brake thermal efficiency), maximum brake power, maximum brake torque, BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) and BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) were fixed, which correspond to Opt-1 (optimization 1) (BTE and exhaust emissions), optimization 2 (BTE, brake power and exhaust emissions), and optimization 3 (BTE, brake power, brake torque, BSFC, BMEP and exhaust emissions). Optimization studies used experimentally determined emissions and performance data of a diesel engine based on 7 different concentrations of diesel–butanol–cotton oil blends. Optimum values of the blends corresponding to the optimization studies were mathematically determined as Opt-1 (optimization 1) (61.7 vol.% diesel, 34.75 vol.% butanol, 3.55 vol.% cotton oil), Opt-2 (optimization 2) (64.5 vol.% diesel, 28.7 vol.% butanol, 6.8 vol.% cotton oil), and Opt-3 (optimization 3) (65.5 vol.% diesel, 23.1 vol.% butanol, 11.4 vol.% cotton oil). When compared to diesel, BSFCs of Opt-1, Opt-2 and Opt-3 blends at 2200 rpm increased 41.57, 33.87 and 24.53%, respectively. In terms of basic exhaust gas emissions, optimum fuel blends decreased NOx (oxides of nitrogen), CO (carbon monoxide) and HC (hydrocarbon) emissions as compared to diesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3abiodiesel 3abutanol 3acarbon monoxide 3aconsumers (people) 3acotton 3adiesel engines 3aenergy use and consumption 3agas emissions 3alaws and regulations 3anitrogen oxides 3aoils 3aresponse surface methodology 3atorque 0aOptimization 0aResponse surface methodology 0aTernary blends 0aDiesel engine 0aPerformance 0aExhaust emission1 aIleri, Erol1 aYilmaz, Nadir0 tEnergy.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 96 p.569-580dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245008900162300002000251520166700271592002801938650001501966650001601981650002401997650001502021650002202036650002002058650002102078650001802099650001702117650001502134650002102149650001102170650002002181653001502201653002702216653001902243653002702262653002102289700002002310700001702330700002202347773012602369856008002495852000902575655001202584IND60528798420170718000000.0160717e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052879842DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b098182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aİncel, Anıl10aNull Extinction of Ceria@silica Hybrid Particles: Transparent Polystyrene Composites  ap. 27539-27546.  aScattering of light in optical materials, particularly in composites based on transparent polymer and inorganic pigment nanoparticles, is a chronic problem. It might originate mainly from light scattering because of a refractive index mismatch between the particles and transparent polymer matrix. Thus, the intensity of light is rapidly diminished and optical transparency is reduced. Refractive index matching between the pigment core and the surrounding transparent matrix using a secondary component at the interface (shell) has recently appeared as a promising approach to alter light scattering. Here, CeO₂ (ceria) nanoparticles with a diameter of 25 nm are coated with a SiO₂ (silica) shell with various thicknesses in a range of 6.5–67.5 nm using the Stöber method. When the hybrid core–shell particles are dispersed into transparent polystyrene (PS), the transmission of the freestanding PS composite films increases over both the ultraviolet (UV) and visible region as the shell thickness increases particularly at 37.5 nm. The increase of transmission can be attributed to the reduction in the scattering coefficient of the hybrid particles. On the other hand, the particles in tetrahydrofuran (THF) absorb over UV and the intensity of absorption shows a systematic decrease as the shell thickness increases. Thus, the silica shell suppresses not only the scattering coefficient but also the molar absorptivity of the core ceria particles. The experimental results regarding the target shell thickness to develop low extinction (scattering + absorption) composites show a qualitative agreement with the predictions of Effective Medium Theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aceric oxide 3acomposite materials 3aextinction 3afilms (materials) 3alight intensity 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles 3apolystyrenes 3aprediction 3arefractive index 3asilica 3atetrahydrofuran 0aabsorption 0acore−shell particles 0aindex matching 0apolymer nanocomposites 0alight scattering1 aGüner, Tuğrul1 aParlak, Onur1 aDemir, Mustafa M.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 7, no. 49 p.27539-27546dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b098183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012900163500002200292520156500314592002801879650000801907650002001915650002501935650002501960650002501985650001302010650002102023650001502044650002002059650002302079650001102102650003202113650002302145650002902168653003002197653001002227653000902237653001702246700001602263700001502279700001702294700001602311773006802327856008102395852000902476655001202485IND60576225120221120105210.0170731s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057622512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jinlong10aAssay of DNA methyltransferase 1 activity based on uracil-specific excision reagent digestion induced G-quadruplex formation  aPre-press version  aDNA methylation catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase plays an important role in many biological processes including gene transcription, genomic imprinting and cellular differentiation. Herein, a novel and effective electrochemical method for the assay of DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1) activity has been successfully developed by using uracil-specific excision reagent (USER) induced G-quadruplex formation. Briefly, double stranded DNA containing the recognition sequence of DNMT1 is immobilized on the electrode. Among them, one strand (DNA S1) contains G-rich sequence and a cytosine base, while the supplement strand (DNA S2) cotains C-rich sequence and a methylated cytosine. Through the activity of DNMT1, the hemimethylated CG recognition sequence of the double stranded DNA are methylated and DNA S2 strand is cleaved and removed after the subsequently treatment with EpiTect fast bisulfite conversion kits and USER, leaving the DNA S1 to form the G-quadruplex-hemin DNAzyme for signal amplification. Under optimal-conditions, the method shows wide linear range of 0.1–40 U mL−1 with a detection limit of 0.06 U mL−1. Furthermore, the inhibition assay study demonstrates that SGI-1027 can inhibit the DNMT 1 activity with the IC50 values of 6 μM in the presence of 160 μM S-adenosylmethionine. Since this method can detect human DNMT1 activity effectively and has successfully been applied in complex biological samples, it may have great potential in the applications in DNA methylation related clinical practices and biochemical researches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3aanalytical chemistry 3acell differentiation 3acytosine 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenzyme activity 3agenomic imprinting 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amethyltransferases 3atranscription (genetics) 0aElectrochemical biosensor 0aDNMT1 0aUSER 0aG-quadruplex1 aHe, Guangwu1 aMu, Chaoli1 aWang, Keming1 aXiang, Yang0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009900172300001600271520096600287592002801253650002601281650001101307650001301318650001601331650002401347650001601371650001201387650001301399653003001412653001301442653002001455653001901475653001201494700001701506700001801523700001801541700001901559700001901578773010501597856008701702852000901789655001201798IND60536426020221118202528.0190409e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053642602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurgapal, Meetu10aProduction of 1,3-propanediol from glycerol using the newly isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae J2B  ap. 223-231.  aRecently, novel Klebsiella pneumoniae J2B, which grows rapidly on glycerol as the carbon source without forming pathogenic and sticky lipopolysaccharides, was isolated. Current study examined the ability of K. pneumoniae J2B to produce 1,3-propanediol (PDO) from glycerol. To this end, a deletion mutant for lactate formation was constructed. The ldhA mutant strain produced negligible lactate but more 2,3-butanediol (BDO). When K. pneumoniae ΔldhA was cultivated in glycerol fed-batch mode, the PDO titer of 58.0g/L with a yield of 0.35g/g and an overall volumetric productivity of 1.3g/L/h were obtained. BDO was the main byproduct (26.6g/L). Less than 10g/L of the other metabolites was produced. As PDO and other metabolites accumulated, the rate of PDO production decreased significantly due mainly to the toxic effects of these metabolites. This study highlights the potential of newly isolated K. pneumoniae J2B for the production of PDO from glycerol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3acarbon 3aglycerol 3alactic acid 3alipopolysaccharides 3ametabolites 3amutants 3atoxicity 0aKlebsiella pneumoniae J2B 0aGlycerol 0a1,3-Propanediol 0a2,3-Butanediol 0aLactate1 aKumar, Vinod1 aYang, Taek Ho1 aLee, Hee Jong1 aSeung, Doyoung1 aPark, Sunghoon0 tBioresource technology.g2014 May, v. 159 p.223-231dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100002100186245024500207300001200452506007600464520198800540592002802528506003702556650002202593650003002615650001502645650001402660650001902674650001702693650001202710650002702722650001102749650001202760650002202772650001402794650001302808650003002821650001002851650001502861650001502876651001002891700001802901700002302919700001702942700002002959700002402979700001703003700002503020700002203045773011203067856008003179852000903259655001203268IND50066887620221207124600.0191003e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006688762DNAL7 aPMC36690352pmcid7 a236882332pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-6-1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAïzoun, Nazaire10aComparison of the standard WHO susceptibility tests and the CDC bottle bioassay for the determination of insecticide susceptibility in malaria vectors and their correlation with biochemical and molecular biology assays in Benin, West Africa  ap. 147.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The detection of insecticide resistance in natural populations of Anopheles vectors is absolutely necessary for malaria control. In the African region, the WHO insecticide susceptibility test is the most common method for assessing resistance status. In order to search for a simple, rapid and more reliable technique in the assessment of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors, we compared the WHO tests with the CDC bottle bioassay in the Ouemé province of southern Benin where insecticide resistance has been widely reported. METHODS: Larvae and pupae of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes were collected from the breeding sites in Ouemé. WHO and CDC susceptibility tests were conducted simultaneously on unfed female mosquitoes aged 2–5 days old. WHO bioassays were performed with impregnated papers of deltamethrin (0.05%) and bendiocarb (0.1%), whereas CDC bioassays were performed with stock solutions of deltamethrin (12.5 μg per bottle) and bendiocarb (12.5 μg per bottle). PCR techniques were used to detect species, Kdr and Ace-1 mutations. CDC biochemical assays using synergists were also conducted to assess the metabolic resistance. RESULTS: A slight decrease in mortality rates was observed with 97.95% and 98.33% obtained from CDC and WHO bioassays respectively in populations of mosquitoes from Adjara and Dangbo. PCR revealed that all specimens tested were Anopheles gambiae s.s. The Kdr mutation was found at high frequency in all populations and both the Kdr mutation and mono-oxygenase enzymes were implicated as mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance in An. gambiae from Misserete. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes that both WHO and CDC bioassays give similar results with regards to the susceptibility of mosquitoes to insecticides in southern Benin. There were complementarities between both methods, however, some specificity was noted for each of the two methods used. Both Kdr and metabolic mechanisms were implicated in the resistance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aWorld Health Organization 3abendiocarb 3abioassays 3abreeding sites 3adeltamethrin 3aenzymes 3ainsecticide resistance 3alarvae 3amalaria 3amolecular biology 3amortality 3amutation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apupae 3apyrethrins 3asynergists 3aBenin1 aOssè, Razaki1 aAzondekon, Roseric1 aAlia, Roland1 aOussou, Olivier1 aGnanguenon, Virgile1 aAikpon, Rock1 aPadonou, Gil Germain1 aAkogbéto, Martin0 tParasites & vectors.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.147-147dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-1473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245013400156300002000290520159600310592002801906650001301934650002301947650001501970650001601985650001702001650002402018650001902042650001102061650000702072650001402079650001602093653001702109653001802126653001802144653001802162653001102180653001902191700001602210700001202226700002502238700001802263700001702281773012602298856008002424852000902504655001202513IND60528798520221120170411.0160717e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052879852DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b098742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Han10aTemperature- and pH-Responsive Benzoboroxole-Based Polymers for Flocculation and Enhanced Dewatering of Fine Particle Suspensions  ap. 27176-27187.  aRandom copolymers based on N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) containing 2-aminoethyl methacrylamide hydrochloride (AEMA) and 5-methacrylamido-1,2-benzoboroxole (MAAmBo) were synthesized and subsequently evaluated for their performance in solid–liquid separation at various pH and temperatures. The strong interactions between benzoboroxole residues and kaolin hydroxyl groups were evaluated for the first time in the flocculation of fine particle suspensions. The lower critical solution temperatures (LCSTs) of PAMN decreases because of the hydrophobic nature of the benzoboroxole moieties, resulting in strong hydrophobic interaction at temperatures higher than the LCSTs. Temperature and pH responsive polymer, P(AEMA₅₁-st-MAAmBo₇₆-st-NIPAM₃₈₁) (denoted as PAMN) shows the ability to induce fastest settling at a low dosage of 25 ppm and under the condition of pH 9 and 50 °C. The accelerated settling rate is considered to be due to the strong adhesion of benzoboroxole residues to the kaolin hydroxyl groups, the electrical double layer force, and the hydrophobic force. During condensation phase, increasing the pH of sediment to pH 11 could attain the most compact structure. Random copolymers containing benzoboroxole groups act as dispersants (due to pH-responsive character) rather than flocculants at pH 11, providing repulsive force that enables particles to rearrange their position and consolidate well. Through a two-step solid–liquid separation including settling phase and consolidation phase, rapid settling and compact sediment are feasible simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acomposite polymers 3adewatering 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3akaolin 3apH 3asediments 3atemperature 0aflocculation 0aconsolidation 0abenzoboroxole 0apH responsive 0aNIPAAm 0apolymerization1 aWang, Yinan1 aLi, Lin1 aKotsuchibashi, Yohei1 aNarain, Ravin1 aZeng, Hongbo0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 7, no. 49 p.27176-27187dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b098743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245013100202300001600333500001900349500002000368520204400388592002802432596007802460650001102538650002602549650002202575650001302597650001702610650000902627650002102636650001102657650001602668650002102684651001202705651002902717700003102746700002502777700002902802700001902831700002202850700001502872773012802887856007303015852000903088655001203097IND60691308620221120200750.0200429e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069130862DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.128632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, Line Holm1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4001-004610aTurnover and change in plant species composition in a shielded salt marsh following variation in precipitation and temperature  ap. 465-475.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQUESTIONS: Temperature and precipitation variation between years may affect plant species composition directly or indirectly. We wish to investigate whether salt marsh edaphic conditions and plant species composition change as a result of climatic variation. Further, whether areas with the largest edaphic variations also experience the largest change in species composition and turnover. Finally, do temperature and precipitation variations change the way the plant community is able to respond to natural edaphic gradients? LOCATION: Bygholmengen, a shielded salt marsh in Vejlerne, Denmark, Northern Europe. METHODS: Botanical surveys were conducted and soil samples collected from 40 plots during a wet and dry summer to register changes in vegetation cover, species richness composition and edaphic factors (moisture, nutrients, salinity). These data were used to calculate dissimilarities in species composition, temporal turnover and environmental dissimilarity between years. A linear mixed‐effects model was used to link species richness with the measured edaphic factors. RESULTS: We found that the precipitation and temperature variations altered the edaphic conditions; furthermore, the vegetation cover and species richness decreased when conditions were dry whereas the number of salt marsh species increased. Further, species composition changed significantly between years, and sampling plots that experienced the least edaphic change also retained more species between years. Species richness responded more to changes in nutrient availability during wet than dry conditions. CONCLUSION: Our results pointed toward the climatic variations, and subsequent change in edaphic conditions, being responsible for the significant change in species composition as areas with the least change in edaphic factors retained most species between years. Dry conditions favored salt marsh‐adapted species and the extent to which increased nutrient levels led to a higher species richness decreased in dry compared to wet conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aUdvikling af en forvaltningsstrategi, der tilgodescAage V.

ORF1 (rep gene) encodes replication-related proteins, ORF2 (cap gene) encodes the capsid protein and ORF3 encodes a protein putatively involved in virus-induced apoptosis.Based on cap gene sequences, PCV2 strains are classified into two main genotypes, PCV2a with five clusters (2A–2E) and PCV2b with three clusters (1A–1C).According to previous theorical studies, PCV2 strains can eventually undergo intra and inter-genotype recombination, mainly within the rep gene. Ever since, several evidences of recombination in the field have been reported and confirmed this hypothesis.In South America, data regarding molecular characterization of PCV2 strains is still scant. Genotyping studies in the region have concluded that PCV2b is the predominant circulating genotype in the region and till now, no recombinant strains have ever been reported.In this work we thoroughly characterized at the molecular level Uruguayan PCV2 strains by extensive sequence data analysis. Moreover, recombination software tools were applied to explore and characterize eventual occurrence of natural recombination events.Two recombinant PCV2 strains were detected in this study, as a consequence of an inter-genotype recombination event between PCV2b-1A and PCV2a-2D, as the major and minor parent, respectively. According to recombination software analysis, in both cases the event occurred within the ORF1.Herein, extensive viral sequence dataset is provided, including the characterization of the first PCV2 recombinant strains ever reported in South America. Additionally, our results suggested a multi-centered source of PCV2 infection in Uruguay, which probably involved Brazilian and European origins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aapoptosis 3acoat proteins 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3agenes 3agenetic recombination 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aopen reading frames 3apathogens 3aswine 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aCircoviridae Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aCircovirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Viralxanalysisxgenetics. 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aRecombination, Geneticxgenetics 2aSwine 2aVirologyxmethods 3aUruguay 0aUruguay 0aPorcine Circovirus Type 2 0aMolecular analysis 0aInter-genotypic recombination 0aUruguay1 aMirazo, Santiago1 aCastro, Gustavo1 aArbiza, Juan0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2013 Oct., v. 19 p.23-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011300166300001600279520128600295592002801581650001501609650002301624650002201647650002001669650001101689650001501700650001301715650000901728650001301737650002601750650002001776650001301796653001501809653002201824653002101846653003101867700001601898700001401914700001401928700001801942700001201960700001401972700001601986700001702002773011102019856008302130852000902213655001202222IND60553512020221119065849.0180831e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055351202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuanfu10aLabel-free, sensitivity detection of fibrillar fibrin using gold nanoparticle-based chemiluminescence system  ap. 111-115.  aA novel, label-free, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-based chemiluminescence assay has been developed for the detection of fibrillar fibrin. The method relied on the interaction of fibrinogen (Fib) with AuNPs and the aggregated AuNPs induce a strong luminol–H2O2 chemiluminesecence (CL) signal. We prepared the 12-nm-diameter AuNPs which well dispersed in the solution. Fib was absorbed on the surface of AuNPs against the aggregation of AuNPs in 1.0M NaCl. Otherwise, Fib was catalyzed to form fibrillar fibrin in the presence of thrombin. The fibrin induced AuNPs aggregated in the presence of NaCl solution. The catalytic activity of aggregated AuNPs on the luminol–H2O2 CL reaction is greatly enhanced. This allows us to utilize the luminol–H2O2 CL system for quantitative analysis of thrombin, which was used to denote fibrosis degree of Fib. The assay showed a linear toward fibrillar fibrin concentration in the range of 2.7×10⁻¹⁵–2.7×10⁻¹³M with a correlation of 0.9920. The limit of detection for fibrin was experimentally determined to be 1fM, based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3. Relative to conventional methods, this method offers the advantages of higher sensitivity and selectivity and lower cost, showing great potential for medical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3achemiluminescence 3adetection limit 3afibrin 3afibrinogen 3afibrosis 3agold 3ananogold 3aquantitative analysis 3asodium chloride 3athrombin 0aLabel-free 0aChemiluminescence 0aFibrillar fibrin 0aGold nanoparticles (AuNPs)1 aLiu, Jifeng1 aLiu, Ting1 aLi, Haibo1 aXue, Qingwang1 aLi, Rui1 aWang, Lei1 aYue, Qiaoli1 aWang, Shuhao0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 77 p.111-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245009300169300002000262520095200282592002801234650001401262650001701276650001301293650001101306653002501317653002501342653002401367653002401391653001201415700002201427773012601449856008001575852000901655655001201664IND60528798620221120170520.0160717e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052879862DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b098752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiang Matthew10aVersatile Method for Coating Surfaces with Functional and Responsive Polymer-Based Films  ap. 27547-27553.  aA versatile surface modification technique was developed to yield poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) microgel-based thin films on a variety of substrates, e.g., metals, nonmetals, and polymers. Because the chemistry, and hence functionality and responsivity, of the pNIPAm-based microgels is easily tuned, multifunctional and responsive thin films could be generated on many different surfaces without varying the coating conditions. In one case, we showed that fluorescent/light emitting thin films could be generated using crystal violet-modified microgels. Antibacterial films could be obtained using silver nanoparticle-modified pNIPAm-based microgels. Finally, we show that thin films fabricated via the methods here could be used as a component in optical sensors. Although we show only a few examples of the utility of this approach, we feel that the apparent universality of the technique can be extended to countless other applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3afluorescence 3apolymers 3asilver 0asurface modification 0aresponsive microgels 0aresponsive polymers 0afunctional coatings 0asensing1 aSerpe, Michael J.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 7, no. 49 p.27547-27553dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b098753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245014300158300002000301520151400321592002801835650001401863650001501877650001901892650001701911650001601928650003001944650000901974650001301983650001601996650001102012650001402023650001502037653002902052653002302081653002302104653002402127653002802151700001902179700001602198700001202214700001802226700001702244700001602261700005902277700005702336700005202393773014202445856008002587852000902667655001202676IND60759241320221119114729.0211207e20211117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075924132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c037842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Li10aCoincorporation of N and S into Zero-Valent Iron to Enhance TCE Dechlorination: Kinetics, Electron Efficiency, and Dechlorination Capacity  ap. 16088-16098.  aSulfidated zero-valent iron (S-ZVI) enhances the degradation of chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) in contaminated groundwater. Despite numerous studies of S-ZVI, a versatile strategy to improve its dechlorination kinetics, electron efficiency (εₑ), and dechlorination capacity is still needed. Here, we used heteroatom incorporation of N(C) and S by ball-milling of microscale ZVI with melamine and sulfur via nitridation and sulfidation to synthesize S-N(C)-mZVIᵇᵐ particles that contain reactive Fe-NX(C) and FeS species. Sulfidation and nitridation synergistically increased the trichloroethene (TCE) dechlorination rate, with reaction constants kSA of 2.98 × 10–² L·h–¹·m–² by S-N(C)-mZVIᵇᵐ, compared to 1.77 × 10–³ and 8.15 × 10–⁵ L·h–¹·m–² by S-mZVIᵇᵐ and N(C)-mZVIᵇᵐ, respectively. Data show that sulfidation suppressed the reductive dissociation of N(C) from S-N(C)-mZVIᵇᵐ, which stabilized the reactive Fe-NX(C) and reserved electrons for TCE dechlorination. In addition to lowering H₂ production, S-N(C)-mZVIᵇᵐ dechlorinated TCE to less reduced products (e.g., acetylene), contributing to the material’s higher εₑ and dechlorination capacity. This synergistic effect on TCE degradation can be extended to other recalcitrant CHCs (e.g., chloroform) in both deionized and groundwater. This multiheteroatom incorporation approach to optimize ZVI for groundwater remediation provides a basis for further advances in reactive material synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3achloroform 3adechlorination 3adissociation 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3airon 3amelamine 3aremediation 3asulfur 3asynergism 3atechnology 0aN and S-incorporated ZVI 0asynergistic effect 0aTCE dechlorination 0aelectron efficiency 0adechlorination capacity1 aQiu, Xiaojiang1 aCheng, Dong1 aHu, Yao1 aZhang, Zaizhi1 aYuan, Qunsen1 aYang, Dezhi1 aLiu, Chengshuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0133-01191 aLiang, Liyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1338-03241 aHe, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5702-45110 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Nov. 17, v. 55, no. 23 p.16088-16098dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c037843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009000163300001600253520135800269592002801627650002201655650001001677650002401687650001701711650001201728650001301740650002201753650001801775650002201793650002501815650001401840651002801854653001401882653002601896653001701922653001601939653002101955700002901976700001602005700001902021700001802040773009602058856008302154852000902237655001202246IND60479931620221120131318.0160124e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047993162DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.13.2012.2.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatáry, P.10aContrasting effect of isolation of hedges from forests on farmland vs. woodland birds  ap. 155-161.  aHedges and forest edges play a major role in providing nesting sites, food resources and shelter for birds in agricultural landscapes of western and central Europe. We investigated the response of farmland vs. woodland birds at two degrees of isolation of hedges from forest and to vegetation structure. We surveyed 200 m long sections of six forest edges, six hedges connected to forests and six isolated hedges. Species richness and abundance of farmland birds were higher in hedges than in forest edges, species richness and abundance of woodland birds were lower in hedges than in the forest edges. Species richness and abundance of both groups did not differ between connected and isolated hedges. Width and height of hedges and edges did not affect the species richness and abundance of either farmland or woodland birds. Furthermore, bird community composition differed between habitat types (hedge vs. forest edge) and also between hedge isolation levels (hedges connected to forest vs. isolated hedges). Based on our results, we emphasize the importance of hedges in conserving farmland birds and encourage policy makers to support hedge creation and maintenance with landscape-wide management strategies supporting a diverse hedge structure. Both connected and isolated hedges play an important role as they harbour different bird communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abirds 3acommunity structure 3aedge effects 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3anesting sites 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation structure 3awoodlands 3aCentral European region 0aAbundance 0aCommunity composition 0aConnectivity 0aForest edge 0aSpecies richness1 aKovács-Hostyánszki, A.1 aFischer, C.1 aTscharntke, T.1 aHolzschuh, A.0 tCommunity ecology.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 13, no. 2 p.155-161dAkadémiai Kiadóx1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FComEc.13.2012.2.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245008400201500002200285520135900307592002801666650001501694650001001709650002501719650002101744650002601765650001701791650001701808650001301825650001901838650001901857650001301876650001801889650001701907650001901924650001401943650002801957650002401985650002502009653000902034653001902043653001602062653001202078653002302090700001602113700001502129700001502144700005402159700001502213700001702228773006802245856008102313852000902394655001202403IND60576225520221121045541.0170731s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057622552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9847-465510aMultiple-targeted graphene-based nanocarrier for intracellular imaging of mRNAs  aPre-press version  aSimultaneous detection and imaging of multiple intracellular messenger RNA (mRNAs) hold great significant for early cancer diagnostics and preventive medicine development. Herein, we propose a multiple-targeted graphene oxide (GO) nanocarrier that can simultaneously detect and image different type mRNAs in living cells. First of all, in vitro detection of multiple targets have been realized successfully based on the multiple-targeted GO nanocarrier with linear relationship ranging from 3 nM to 200 nM, as well as sensitive detection limit of 1.84 nM for manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) mRNA and 2.45 nM for β-actin mRNA. Additionally, this nanosensing platform composed of fluorescent labelled single strand DNA probes and GO nanocarrier can identify Mn-SOD mRNA and endogenous mRNA of β-actin in living cancer cells, showing rapid response, high specificity, nuclease stability, and good biocompatibility during the cell imaging. Thirdly, changes of the expression levels of mRNA in living cells before or after the drug treatment can be monitored successfully. By using multiple ssDNA as probes and GO nanocarrier as the cellular delivery cargo, the proposed simultaneous multiple-targeted sensing platform will be of great potential as a powerful tool for intracellular trafficking process from basic research to clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA probes 3aactin 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiocompatibility 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrug therapy 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aimage analysis 3amedicine 3amessenger RNA 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphysiological transport 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asuperoxide dismutase 0amRNA 0aGraphene oxide 0aLiving cell 0aImaging 0aMultiple detection1 aLi, Zhaohui1 aLiu, Misha1 aXu, Jinjin1 aHu, Dehong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3974-29631 aLin, Yuehe1 aLi, Jinghong0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245005800170520108100228592002801309650001601337650001201353650002201365650002801387650002501415650001801440650001701458650000701475650002801482650002601510650001101536650001101547653001701558653002501575653000801600653001101608653002301619700001601642700002001658700002201678700002101700700001801721700002201739700001701761773010701778856008701885852000901972655001201981IND60788697620221122235004.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078869762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.1065672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Hyeonji10aEffect of ash in paper sludge on enzymatic hydrolysis  aThe valorization of paper sludge is a high-potential process to develop renewable fuels and chemicals, which can be integrated with pulp and paper mills. Calcium carbonate is the main ash component in sludge, which plays a role in buffering pH and potentially lowering the conversion during enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, it is important to investigate the effect of ash on sugar yields and examine pH change to introduce efficient and economical enzymatic hydrolysis of sludge. Carbohydrate conversion was enhanced when the ash was removed by fractionation. On the other hand, the highest sugar recovery was obtained when the sludge contained 20% ash content. The pH change during enzymatic hydrolysis was influenced by ash and explained why sludge-derived hydrolysate showed lower carbohydrate conversion. Therefore, a high shear process with the increased acid amount is suggested to prohibit the negative effect of ash and enhance the accessibility of cellulase to fibers. This study highlights the feasibility of using wet waste streams generated by the paper industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3abiomass 3acalcium carbonate 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afractionation 3ahydrolysates 3apH 3apulp and paper industry 3apulp and paper sludge 3asludge 3asugars 0aPaper sludge 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aAsh 0aSugars 0aWaste valorization1 aCruz, David1 aTiller, Phoenix1 aJohnson, David K.1 aMittal, Ashutosh1 aJameel, Hasan1 aVenditti, Richard1 aPark, Sunkyu0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2022 Oct., v. 165 p.106567-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.1065673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245012200178300001600300520248600316592002802802650001902830650001502849650000902864650001402873773009302887856008802980852000903068655001203077IND60132302020221123022412.0150505e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013230202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2014.12171.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoudrieau, Randy J.10aInitial Experience With rhBMP‐2 Delivered in a Compressive Resistant Matrix for Mandibular Reconstruction in 5 Dogs  ap. 443-458.  aOBJECTIVE: To document cumulative initial experience and long‐term follow‐up of the use of rhBMP‐2/CRM for reconstruction of large mandibular defects (≥5 cm) in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: Dogs (n = 5). METHODS: Medical records (October 1999–April 2011) of dogs that had mandibular reconstruction for defects/resections of ≥5 cm using rhBMP‐2/CRM were reviewed. Signalment, preoperative assessment/rationale for mandibular reconstruction, surgical methods, postoperative assessment of the reconstruction (evaluation of occlusion), and complications were recorded. A definitive histologic diagnosis was obtained in dogs that had mandibular resection for mass removal. Long‐term complications were determined. A minimum time frame of 2‐year in‐hospital follow‐up was required for case inclusion. RESULTS: Mandibular reconstruction was successfully performed in all dogs' defects where gaps of 5–9 cm were bridged. Surgical reconstruction rapidly restored cosmetic appearance and function. All dogs healed with new bone formation across the gap. New bone formation was present within the defects as early as 2 weeks after surgery based on palpation, and new bone formation bridging the gap was documented radiographically by 16 weeks. Minor complications occurred in all dogs in the early postoperative period, and included early firm swelling and gingival dehiscence in 1 dog; late plate exposure in 3 dogs; and exuberant/cystic bone formation in 2 dogs (related to concentration/formulation of rhBMP‐2/CRM). Two dogs had minor long‐term complications of late plate exposure and a non‐vital canine tooth; the plates and the affected canine tooth were removed. Long‐term in‐hospital follow‐up was 5.3 years (range, 2–12.5 years); further long‐term telephone follow‐up was 6.3 years (range, 2–12.5 years). All owners were pleased with the outcome and would repeat the surgery again under similar circumstances. CONCLUSION: The efficacy and success of this mandibular reconstruction technique, using rhBMP‐2/CRM with plate fixation, was demonstrated with bridging of large mandibular defects regardless of the underlying cause, and with excellent cosmetic and functional results. Complications were common, but considered minor and easily treated. The complications encountered revealed the importance of tailoring the use of BMPs and fixation methods to this specific anatomic location and indication.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3adehiscence 3adogs 3aresection0 tVeterinary surgery.g2015 May, v. 44, no. 4 p.443-458dBlackwell [etc.]x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2014.12171.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010900167300001400276520093800290592002801228650002701256650002101283650000901304650002001313650001601333650002801349650002501377653002001402653002901422653003301451653002801484653002401512700001801536700001901554700001601573700001501589700001101604773010301615856008701718852000901805655001201814IND60536426520221118202955.0190409e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053642652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Chuan10aEnhancement of activated sludge activity by 10–50mT static magnetic field intensity at low temperature  ap. 48-54.  aEffects of different static magnetic field (MF) intensities (10–50mT) on the activity of activated sludge were compared at low temperature (5°C). The TTC dehydrogenase activity (TTC-DHA) achieved the maximum of 8.12mgTF/gSS at the MF intensity of 40mT. MF intensity enhanced from 20mT to 40mT could promote microorganisms to produce more unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) to stimulate the TTC-DHA and adapt to low temperature. At 30mT, the Gram-negative bacteria with better cold adaptability were greatly enriched, which ensured the cold resistance of low-temperature reactor. The PLFA diversity strengthened by MF was higher than that of control when MF intensities changed from 20mT to 50mT and reached the maximum of 1.31 at 20mT. Optimal MF intensity is supposed to be a potential pathway to strengthen the activity and cold resistance of activated sludge microorganisms in biological wastewater treatment under low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aactivated sludge 3acold 3amagnetic fields 3atemperature 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3awastewater treatment 0aLow temperature 0aMagnetic field intensity 0aActivated sludge enhancement 0aPhospholipid fatty acid 0aMicrobial diversity1 aLiang, Weihao1 aRen, Hongqiang1 aGeng, Jinju1 aDing, Lili1 aXu, Ke0 tBioresource technology.g2014 May, v. 159 p.48-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009200163300001600255520173600271592002802007650002202035650001002057650002102067650000902088650000902097650003802106650001002144650001002154650001502164650001302179650000902192650001402201650000902215650001402224650001802238650000902256650001002265650001202275651001002287651002102297700001302318700001802331700001802349700001902367700002102386700001602407700001602423700001802439700001602457700002002473700001702493773011502510856008502625852000902710655001202719IND60099529320221118031109.0190412e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009952932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2013.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Shuo10aAvian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus circulating in farmed dogs in Guangdong, China  ap. 251-256.  aSince 2006, more and more cases of the infectious H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) in pet dogs have been reported in Southern China. However, little is known about the prevalence situation of H3N2 CIV infections in farmed dogs in China. This is the first systematic epidemiological surveillance of CIV in different dog populations in Southern China. Two virus strains A/Canine/Guangdong/1/2011(H3N2) and A/canine/Guangdong/5/2011(H3N2) were isolated from canine nasal swabs collected at one dog farm in Guangzhou and the other farm in Shenzhen. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of eight gene segments of these viruses revealed that they were most similar to the newly isolated canine H3N2 viruses in dogs and cats from Korea and China, which originated from avian strain. This indicates that H3N2 CIV may be a common pathogen for pet and farmed dog populations in Southern China at present. Serological surveillance has shown that the infection rate of this avian-origin canine influenza in farmed dogs and in pet dogs were 12.22% and 5.3%, respectively; as determined by the ELISA. The data also suggested that transmission occurred, most probably by close contact, between H3N2 CIV infected dogs in different dog populations in recently years. As H3N2 outbreaks among dogs continue in the Guangdong Province (located very close to Hong Kong), the areas where is densely populated and with frequent animal trade, there is a continued risk for pet H3N2 CIV infections and for mutations or genetic reassortment leading to new virus strains with increased transmissibility among dogs. Further in-depth study is required as the H3N2 CIV has been established in different dog populations and posed potential threat to public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3abirds 3acanine influenza 3acats 3adogs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3agenes 3amonitoring 3amutation 3anose 3apathogens 3apets 3aphylogeny 3apublic health 3arisk 3atrade 3aviruses 3aChina 3aKorean Peninsula1 aChen, Ye1 aZhao, Fu-Rong1 aChen, Ji-Dang1 aXie, Jie-Xiong1 aChen, Zhong-Ming1 aHuang, Zhen1 aHu, Yi-Ming1 aZhang, Min-Ze1 aTan, Li-Kai1 aZhang, Gui-Hong1 aLi, Shou-Jun0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2013 Oct., v. 19 p.251-256dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016800159300001800327520177400345592002802119650003502147650001802182650001802200650002102218650001202239650001802251650001302269650001302282650002702295650001102322650003702333700002202370700002702392773012302419856007402542852000902616655001202625IND60683965220221120092226.0200214e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068396522DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07120b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaknun, Luluil10aUse of flow field-flow fractionation and single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for size determination of selenium nanoparticles in a mixture  ap. 6423-6435.  aVarious analytical techniques have been used for size analysis of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). These include flow field-flow fractionation (FlFFF), single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For hydrodynamic diameter estimation, the FlFFF technique was used and the results were compared with those analyzed by DLS. For core diameter estimation, the results obtained from SP-ICP-MS were compared with those from TEM. Two types of FlFFF channel were employed, i.e., symmetrical FlFFF (Sy-FlFFF) and asymmetrical FlFFF (Asy-FlFFF). Considering the use of FlFFF, optimization was performed on a Sy-FlFFF channel to select the most appropriate carrier liquid and membrane in order to minimize problems due to particle membrane interaction. The use of FL-70 and 10 kDa RC provided an acceptable compromise peak quality and size accuracy for all samples of SeNPs which were coated by proteins (positively charged SeNPs) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (negatively charged SeNPs). FlFFF always yielded the lower estimate of the hydrodynamic size than DLS as a reference method. The results obtained by SP-ICP-MS were consistent with the TEM method for the core diameter estimation. The results from FlFFF and the DLS reference method were significantly different as confirmed by paired t-test analysis, while the results provided by SP-ICP-MS and the TEM reference method were not significantly different. Furthermore, consecutive size analysis by SP-ICP-MS for the fractions collected from FlFFF was proposed for sizing of SeNP mixtures. The combined technique helps to improve the size analysis in the complex samples and shows more advantages than using only SP-ICP-MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3afractionation 3ahydrodynamics 3alight scattering 3aliquids 3ananoparticles 3aproteins 3aselenium 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3at-test 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSumranjit, Jitapa1 aSiripinyanond, Atitaya0 tRSC advances.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 10, no. 11 p.6423-6435dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07120b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008700163300001600250520128100266592002801547650001201575650001701587650002201604650002501626650001401651650001101665650001401676650002501690653001301715653001501728653002101743700001401764700001601778700001601794773009601810856008401906852000901990655001201999IND60479931920221120131123.0160124e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047993192DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.13.2012.2.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScotti, M.10aDynamical effects of weak trophic interactions in a stochastic food web simulation  ap. 230-237.  aNetwork models are traditional in community ecology. For example, they provide a rich analytical toolkit to put higher predators into a multispecies context. Better understanding their top-down effects and the potential bottom-up control on them would be of key importance for predictive ecosystem management. Food web architecture may be used to predict community dynamics, but it is an old question how reliable are the studies considering only static information. A general and intuitive assumption is that stronger links (with larger weights) mediate stronger effects. We study this statement and use an illustrative case study. We investigate the trophic structure of the Prince William Sound food web in terms of biomass flows, and study its simulated dynamics in a stochastic modelling framework. We aim to understand bottom-up effects of preys on consumers: we focus on the fluctuations of top predator populations, following disturbance on their prey. Several disturbance regimes are studied and compared. Food web structure and link weight generally predict well the average impacts of preys on top-predators, with larger flows mediating stronger effects. Most exceptions appear for weak links: these are less predictable, some of them can be surprisingly important.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acase studies 3acommunity ecology 3aecosystem management 3afood webs 3amodels 3apredators 3astochastic processes 0aFood web 0aSimulation 0aNetwork analysis1 aGjata, N.1 aLivi, C.

The viscous-thickening due to the electrostatic interactions within the electric double layer and the reverse ionic transport due to the streaming potential are developed. The influence of the Navier slip boundary condition is described under both electroviscous and viscoelectric effects with a surface charge regulation (CR) model while the observed behavior is compared and validated with molecular dynamic (MD) calculations from multiple studies. Results show that electroviscous and viscoelectric effects decrease transport. Earlier studies at the no slip boundary presented an increase of ionic current by increasing salt concentration and decreasing channel length. In contrast, our study found that the ionic current occurred almost independent of both salt concentration and channel length, except for very short channels and very low salt concentrations, when electroviscous and viscoelectric effects were considered. In the case of the constant slip length condition, ionic conduction was enhanced, but velocity slip developing on surfaces showed significant variation based on the salt concentration and channel length. This is due to the natural CR behavior enhancing the surface charge and consequential near surface electrohydrodynamics as a result of increase in salt concentration and/or decrease of channel length. Considering that the electroviscous effect alone creates up to 70% lower velocity slips than Poiseuille flow predictions, while further including the viscoelectric effect, results in an almost no-slip condition at high salt concentrations and/or short channels. As a result, the ionic current of a viscoelectric electroviscous slip flow is found to be equal to 1/3 of an electroviscous slip flow and to decrease with a decrease in the channel length.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroviscosity 3asalt concentration1 aBarisik, Murat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2413-19910 tLangmuir.g2020 July 07, v. 36, no. 31 p.9191-9203dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c014573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012800170300001300298520101100311592002801322650002601350650001301376650001201389650001601401650001801417650001501435650001101450650001101461650001601472653003701488653001001525653003301535653002201568653002701590700001801617700001501635700001201650700001401662700001701676700001401693700001701707700001201724700001701736700001901753773010201772856008701874852000901961655001201970IND60536426820221118202924.0190409e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053642682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jianke10aNovel flat-plate photobioreactors for microalgae cultivation with special mixers to promote mixing along the light gradient  ap. 8-16.  aNovel flat-plate photobioreactors (PBRs) with special mixers (type-a, type-b, and type-c) were designed based on increased mixing degree along the light gradient. The hydrodynamic and light regime characteristic of the novel PBRs were investigated through computational fluid dynamics. Compared with the control reactor without mixer, the novel reactors can effectively increase liquid velocity along the light gradient, the frequency of light/dark (L/D) cycles, and the algal growth rates of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. The maximum biomass concentrations in type-a, type-b, and type-c reactors were 42.9% (1.3gL−1), 31.9% (1.2gL−1), and 20.9% (1.1gL−1) higher than that in the control reactor (0.91gL−1), respectively, at an aeration rate of 1.0vvm. Correlation analysis of algal growth rate with the characteristics of mixing and light regime shows the key factors affecting algal photoautotrophic growth are liquid velocity along the light gradient and L/D cycles rather than the macro-mixing degree.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella pyrenoidosa 3aaeration 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3ahydrodynamics 3amicroalgae 3amixers 3amixing 3aphotoperiod 0aNovel flat-plate photobioreactor 0aMixer 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aLight/dark cycles 0aMicroalgae cultivation1 aLi, Yuanguang1 aWan, Minxi1 aYan, Yi1 aFeng, Fei1 aQu, Xiaoxing1 aWang, Jun1 aShen, Guomin1 aLi, Wei1 aFan, Jianhua1 aWang, Weiliang0 tBioresource technology.g2014 May, v. 159 p.8-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011900173300001800292500001900310520173200329592002802061650002402089650002202113650001602135650001102151650002202162650001502184650001902199650003302218700002302251700001602274700002202290700006202312700002202374700002102396700006102417773011402478856008402592852000902676655001202685IND60706952220210903000000.0200811e20200713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070695222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c014632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzkan, Elifkübra10aPeering into the Formation of Cerium Oxide Colloidal Particles in Solution by In Situ Small-Angle X-ray Scattering  ap. 9175-9190.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe formation of CeO₂ colloidal particles upon heating an aqueous solution of (NH₄)₂Ce(NO₃)₆ to 100 °C was investigated by time-resolved in situ SAXS analysis using synchrotron radiation, providing absolute intensity data. In particular, the experiments were performed by applying different temperatures between room temperature and 100 °C as well as under variation of the ionic strength and concentration. Using validated SAXS evaluation tools (SASfit and McSAS software), the analyses revealed the presence of two types of particle populations possessing average dimensions of ca. 2 nm and 5–15 nm, with the latter being agglomerates of the 2 nm particles rather than single crystallites. The analysis revealed not only the changes in the size, but also the relative volume fractions of these two CeO₂ particle populations as a function of the aforementioned parameters. Increasing the temperature increases the number of the 5−15 nm agglomerates on one hand by the enhanced nucleation rate of the primary particles. On the other hand, especially at high temperatures (90 and 100 °C) the larger agglomerate particles precipitate, resulting in interesting trends in the fractions of the two populations as a function of time, temperature, ionic strength, and precursor concentration. The experimental studies are complemented by calculating colloidal interaction energies based on classical DLVO theory. Thereby, this study provides detailed insight into the nucleation, growth, and agglomeration of CeO₂ nanoparticles. The primary objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the nucleation and growth of particles by the hydrolysis of the tetravalent cerium ion in aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3aceric oxide 3acerium 3acomputer software 3ahydrolysis 3aionic strength 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering1 aBadaczewski, Felix1 aCop, Pascal1 aWerner, Sebastian1 aHofmann, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9872-21561 aVotsmeier, Martin1 aAmenitsch, Heinz1 aSmarsly, Bernd M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8452-26630 tLangmuir.g2020 July 13, v. 36, no. 31 p.9175-9190dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c014633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008900165300001800254520079300272592002801065650001401093650002001107650002301127650002701150650001301177650001801190650001101208650001501219650000901234650001301243650000901256650001201265653002101277653001301298653003501311653003001346653002501376700001901401700001601420700001901436773014501455856008601600852000901686655001201695IND60760150020221120154548.0211218e20211002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076015002DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2020.17638042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Qihui10aEfficiently Backtesting Conditional Value-at-Risk and Conditional Expected Shortfall  ap. 2041-2052.  a–Given the importance of backtesting risk models and forecasts for financial institutions and regulators, we develop an efficient empirical likelihood backtest for either conditional value-at-risk or conditional expected shortfall when the given risk variable is modeled by an ARMA-GARCH process. Using a two-step procedure, the proposed backtests require less finite moments than existing backtests, allowing for robustness to heavier tails. Furthermore, we add a constraint on the goodness of fit of the error distribution to provide more accurate risk forecasts and improved test power. A simulation study confirms the good finite sample performance of the new backtests, and empirical analyses demonstrate the usefulness of these efficient backtests for monitoring financial crises.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3aeconomic crises 3aempirical research 3afinancial institutions 3ajournals 3amine tailings 3amodels 3amonitoring 3arisk 3asampling 3atail 3atesting 0aARMA-GARCH model 0aBacktest 0aConditional expected shortfall 0aConditional value-at-risk 0aEmpirical likelihood1 aQin, Zhongling1 aPeng, Liang1 aQin, Gengsheng0 tJournal of the American Statistical Association.g2021 Oct. 2, v. 116, no. 536 p.2041-2052dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19699x1537-274X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2020.17638043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013200169520182000301592002802121650002902149650001402178650001102192650002002203650001202223650002302235650001602258650002802274650001102302650001402313650002102327650001202348650001602360650001602376650001302392653002102405653001702426653002302443653002602466653002202492653001602514700002102530700006702551773009902618856008502717852000902802655001202811IND60758863720221119161638.0211227e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075886372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2021.1058842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGad, Hassan A.10aEfficacy of combined treatments of abamectin with three inert dusts for the control of Callosobruchus chinensis on cowpea seeds  aThe insecticidal efficacy of abamectin (AB) and three inert dusts, diatomaceous earth (DE), zeolite (ZE) and kaolin (KA), was evaluated alone and in binary mixtures as stored cowpea protectants against Callosobruchus chinensis. Inert dusts (DE, ZE and KA) were tested at 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg (ppm), and abamectin was applied at 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg (ppm). Adult mortality of C. chinensis was evaluated after 3 and 7 days of treatment, while progeny production and cowpea seed weight loss were recorded for all tested treatments after 60 days. The mortality of adults in the binary treatments was higher than the individual treatments of inert dusts or AB. Combined treatments of AB at 0.5 mg/kg with DE, ZE or KA at 500 and 1000 mg/kg led to 100% mortality after 7 days of treatment. Moreover, combined treatments of AB (0.25 mg/kg) with KA (1000 mg/kg), AB (0.25 mg/kg) with ZE (1000 mg/kg) and AB (0.5 mg/kg) with KA (100 mg/kg) caused 100% mortality of adults after 7 days of treatment. After 3 days, the binary mixture of AB (0.5 mg/kg) with KA (1000 mg/kg) was the only treatment inducing 100% adult mortality. All treatments with inert dusts, AB, and their binary mixtures caused significant decrease in progeny production of C. chinensis after 60 days of exposure. In particular, treatments with high concentrations induced strong progeny reduction and led to complete protection of cowpea seeds against weight loss and damage caused by C. chinensis after 60 days. Furthermore, no adverse effect on germination was observed in cowpea seeds treated with the highest application rates of inert dusts, AB, and their mixtures. Our findings demonstrated that binary mixtures of inert dusts with abamectin could be successfully used as potential protectants for cowpea seeds against C. chinensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallosobruchus chinensis 3aabamectin 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3acowpeas 3adiatomaceous earth 3agermination 3ainsecticidal properties 3akaolin 3amortality 3aplant protection 3aprogeny 3aseed weight 3aweight loss 3azeolites 0aNatural products 0aAlternatives 0aAdzuki bean beetle 0aInsecticidal activity 0aProgeny reduction 0aSeed damage1 aAtta, Ayman A.M.1 aAbdelgaleil, Samir A.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8819-88100 tCrop protection.g2022 Mar., v. 153 p.105884-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2021.1058843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006400138245010300202500001900305500002000324520159800344592002801942596004801970650001102018650001402029650001202043650001602055650001202071650001502083650001102098650001202109650001302121650001202134650001902146650001502165650001602180700002402196700002202220700002502242773010802267856007202375852000902447655001202456IND60697201620221121073934.0200602e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069720162DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.30062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuigley, Kathleen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9528-073210aSoil nutrients and precipitation are major drivers of global patterns of grass leaf silicification  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrasses accumulate high concentrations of silicon (Si) in their tissues, with potential benefits including herbivore defense, improved water balance, and reduced leaf construction costs. Although Si is one of the most widely varying leaf constituents among individuals, species, and ecosystems, the environmental forces driving this variation remain elusive and understudied. To understand relationships between environmental factors and grass Si accumulation better, we analyzed foliar chemistry of grasses from 17 globally distributed sites where nutrient inputs and grazing were manipulated. These sites span natural gradients in temperature, precipitation, and underlying soil properties, which allowed us to assess the relative importance of soil moisture and nutrients across variation in climate. Foliar Si concentration did not respond to large mammalian grazer exclusion, but significant variation in herbivore abundance among sites may have precluded the observation of defoliation effects at these sites. However, nutrient addition consistently reduced leaf Si, especially at sites with low soil nitrogen prior to nutrient addition. Additionally, a leaf‐level trade‐off between Si and carbon (C) existed that was stronger at arid sites than mesic sites. Our results suggest soil nutrient limitation favors investment in Si over C‐based leaf construction, and that fixing C is especially costly relative to assimilating Si when water is limiting. Our results demonstrate the importance of soil nutrients and precipitation as key drivers of global grass silicification patterns.  aPublisher supplied data  cWake Forest University Pilot Research Grant 3acarbon 3achemistry 3aclimate 3adefoliation 3agrasses 3aherbivores 3aleaves 3amammals 3anitrogen 3asilicon 3asoil nutrients 3asoil water 3atemperature1 aGriffith, Daniel M.1 aDonati, George L.1 aAnderson, T.

HCV contains a positive-stranded RNA of ∼9600nt and is surrounded by the 5′ and 3′untranslated regions (UTR). The only successful treatment regimen includes interferon (IFN) and ribavirin. Like many other viruses, HCV has also evolved various mechanisms to circumvent the IFN response by blocking (1) downstream signaling actions via STAT1, STAT2, IRF9 and JAK-STAT pathways and (2) repertoire of IFN Stimulatory Genes (ISGs). Several studies have identified complex host demographic and genetic factors as well as viral genetic heterogeneity associated with outcomes of IFN therapy. The genetic predispositions of over 2000 ISGS may render the patients to become resistant, thus identification of such parameters within a subset of population are necessary for management corollary. The ability of various HCV genotypes to diminish IFN antiviral responses plays critical role in the establishment of chronic infection at the acute stage of infection, thus highlighting importance of the resistance in HCV treated groups. The recently defined role of viral protein such as C, E2, NS3/NS4 and NS5A proteins in inducing the IFN resistance are discussed in this article. How the viral and host genetic composition and epistatic connectivity among polymorphic genomic sites synchronizes the evolutionary IFN resistance trend remains under investigation. However, these signals may have the potential to be employed for accurate prediction of therapeutic outcomes. In this review article, we accentuate the significance of host and viral components in IFN resistance with the aim to determine the successful outcome in patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aRNA 3aepistasis 3agenes 3agenetic heterogeneity 3agenotype 3ainterferons 3aliver 3apatients 3aprediction 3aproteins 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 2aAntiviral Agentsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aDrug Resistance, Viralxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenotype 2aHepacivirusxdrug effectsxgeneticsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aHepatitis Cxvirology 2aHost-Pathogen Interactionsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aInterferonsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aViral Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aHCV 0aUTR 0aIFN 0aISG 0aIRES 0aIFNAR 0aSTAT 0aTLR3 0aDsRNA 0aIRF3 0aNF-κb 0aIL 0aREST 0aRE-1 0aISRE 0aGAS 0aGT 0aSOCS 0aTh 0aCD 0aSVR 0aPI 0aBOC 0aTVR 0aIR 0aISDR 0aIRRDR 0aPKR 0aeIF2α 0aPePHD 0aER 0aUPR 0aSNP 0aHepatitis C virus (HCV) 0aInterferon (IFN) 0aProtein kinase R (PKR) 0aInterferon stimulatory genes (ISGs) 0aSuppressor of cell signaling (SOCS) 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)1 aAl-Mars, Amany1 aChaudhary, Adeel1 aAbuzenadah, Adel1 aDamanhouri, Ghazi1 aAlqahtani, Mohammed1 aMahmoud, Maged1 aEl Sayed Zaki, Maysaa1 aFatima, Kaneez1 aQadri, Ishtiaq0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2013 Oct., v. 19 p.113-119dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009500175300001400270520099800284592002801282650001201310650000901322650001601331650001501347650001001362650004101372650001401413650001101427650001801438653001601456653001501472653001401487653001801501653001201519700001901531700002301550773010401573856008701677852000901764655001201773IND60536427020221118202900.0190409e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053642702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsomaning, Justice10aTwo-stage thermal conversion of inedible lipid feedstocks to renewable chemicals and fuels  ap. 55-62.  aThe aim of this work was to study the conversion of inedible, low cost lipid feedstocks to renewable hydrocarbons using a two stage thermal hydrolysis–pyrolysis method. Beef tallow, yellow grease, brown grease and cold pressed camelina oil were first hydrolyzed and the fatty acids produced were recovered and pyrolyzed in batch reactors. The pyrolysis products were identified and quantified using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The pyrolysis product yields were similar for all the feedstock used with the organic liquid fraction (OLF) accounting for 76–80% of the product. The OLF consisted predominantly of n-alkanes. Approximately 30% OLF constituted a gasoline-equivalent fraction and 50% a diesel fraction. Other fuel property test showed that the OLF met the specifications set out by the Canadian general standards board. This research demonstrated a novel two-stage thermal hydrolysis–pyrolysis conversion method for producing OLF from inedible and low-value lipids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3acold 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3apyrolysis 3atallow 3ayellow grease 0aFatty acids 0aHydrolysis 0aPyrolysis 0aInedible oils 0aBiofuel1 aMussone, Paolo1 aBressler, David C.0 tBioresource technology.g2014 Apr., v. 158 p.55-62dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001800173245005700191300001600248500002000264520133000284592002801614650000901642650001901651650001401670650002001684650001101704650001301715650002401728650001601752650001201768650001601780650002901796650001901825650001501844650001601859650002401875650002201899650006101921651001401982651002901996700001402025700001802039773013502057852000902192856009102201655001202292IND2203548320221118021024.0211130e199909  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220354832DNAL7 a105169492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.1999.tb03117.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSicard, G.

Calculated injury rates were analysed to predict the probability that a given competitor would have an injury based on track design, temperature, bodyweight, grade of race, race distance, race number, injury location on track and type of trauma. One track had a significantly higher injury rate than the others, and this track was constructed with a decreased initial straightaway, a decreased turning radius in the second turn and an increased turn bank. Increased injury rates were also seen with successively higher grades of race, suggesting a possible correlation with speed. Race distance had a significant effect on racing greyhound injury rates as well. Races measuring 3/16 mile and 7/16 mile resulted in a higher incidence of injury as compared with races with lengths of 5/16 mile and 3/8 mile. Injuries were most likely to occur at the first turn of a race. Temperature, bodyweight, race number and type of trauma had no significant effect on injury rate. Speed, race distance and track design were significant factors that were found to influence the injury rate of the racing greyhound and should be areas to focus on for the prevention of injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aracing animals 3aGreyhound 3aanimal injuries 3adesign 3avelocity 3aambient temperature 3abody weight 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aBone and Bonesxinjuries 2aDogsxinjuries 2aPrevalence 2aProbability 2aRegression Analysis 2aRunningxinjuries 2aWounds and Injuriesxepidemiologyxetiologyxveterinary. 3aWisconsin 0aWisconsinxepidemiology.1 aShort, K.1 aManley, P.

Results showed that the copy numbers of nirS, nirK and nosZ in wetland microcosms were ranged between 108–109, 106–107 and 107–108 copies g−1, respectively. The presence of T. latifolia encouraged the growth of nirK containing bacteria. Addition of cattail litter could greatly stimulate the growth of bacteria containing nirS and nosZ gene. Path analysis illustrated that the presence of plants and litters had no significant direct impact on denitrifying genes, while it affected the denitrifying genes via alteration of dissolved oxygen and carbon sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTypha latifolia 3abacteria 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3agenes 3asubsurface flow 0aSubsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSF CWs) 0aDenitrifying genes 0aNitrate removal 0aCattail litter 0aTypha latifolia1 aWen, Yue1 aZhou, Qi1 aVymazal, Jan0 tBioresource technology.g2014 Apr., v. 157 p.341-345dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245008500183300001600268520134600284592002801630650002301658650002201681650003701703650001201740650001701752650001101769650001801780650002101798650001901819650001801838650002101856650001401877650001101891650003301902650001301935650001301948650001601961650002101977650001401998650003702012650001102049700002902060700003102089773008702120856008502207852000902292655001202301IND60597015220221120191559.0200419e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059701522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.04.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortés-López, Alejandro J.10aEfficient carbon nanotube sponges production boosted by acetone in CVD-Synthesis  ap. 145-156.  aA high production of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube sponges (N-CNS) was obtained at 1020 °C with 4 h of growth in an aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) experiment modified with two independent sprayers feeding the reactor. Sprayer-1 contained a solution made of benzylamine, ferrocene, and thiophene; sprayer-2 contained a solution made of ethanol-acetone, ferrocene, and thiophene. N-CNS were produced with three different acetone concentrations and collected along the reactor. The N-CNS were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. The main trends that were found when adding acetone as a precursor are: (1) an increase of the carbon fiber diameters; (2) favored the formation of Fe₃C nanoparticles that were encrusted into the outermost layers of the carbon fibers; (3) a reduction of the oxidation temperature; and (4) a decrease in the oxygen content. The nitrogen concentration in N-CNS was approximately 3% w/w and is exhibited in mainly pyrrolic, pyridinic, and quaternary fashions. The N-CNS showed super hydrophobic and oleophilic properties. The absorption capacities were tested for various organic solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetone 3abenzylamines 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen content 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asprayers 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3athiophene 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors1 aMuñoz Sandoval, Emilio,1 aLópez Urías, Florentino,0 tCarbon.g2018 Aug., v. 135 p.145-156dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.04.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005200167300001200219520135000231592002801581650001501609650001701624650001301641650003101654650001101685653001701696653003001713653001801743653002401761653002401785700001501809700001601824773009201840856008301932852000902015655001202024IND60479932520221120115346.0160124e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047993252DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.14.2013.1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanberry, B. B.10aEvaluating functions to describe point patterns  ap. 1-7.  aThree functions that analyze point patterns are the <i>L</i> (a transformation of Ripley’s <i>K</i> function), pair correlation, and K2 functions. We tested these functions with Genton’s spatial index, which measures the distance between observed and random theoretical lines for a function over all lag distances. We simulated points from random, moderately regular, extremely regular, and clustered distributions at different density levels and a fixed plot size and for regular distributions at varying plot sizes. The spatial index clearly was able to identify clustered patterns. However, there was overlap in spatial index values between random and moderately regular distributions at lower densities. The spatial index for the <i>L</i> function also became more negative as plot size increased, indicating edge effects, whereas the pair correlation and K2 function values fluctuated with plot size. Using confidence envelopes rather than a spatial index, we also identified distributions other than the known distribution at low densities. These results indicate that ecologists should be cautious about 1) assigning random or regular distribution, particularly for the <i>L</i> function and the K2 function, 2) comparing point patterns of different densities and plot sizes, and 3) interpreting the pair correlation and K2 functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecologists 3aedge effects 3ahabitats 3amathematics and statistics 3amodels 0aK2 functions 0aPair correlation function 0aPoint pattern 0aRipley’s <i>K</i> 0aSimulation envelope1 aYang, Jian1 aHe, Hong S.0 tCommunity ecology.g2013 June 1, v. 14, no. 1 p.1-7dAkadémiai Kiadóx1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FComEc.14.2013.1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006600140245030400206500001900510500002000529520145500549592002802004650002802032650002102060650002302081650002502104650001202129650003802141650001702179650002202196650001602218650000902234650002102243650001102264650001302275650003102288650002102319650001602340700006502356700001402421773012702435856007402562852000902636655001202645IND60732317120221121041651.0210326e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073231712DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.134012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyeniran, Olubukola H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5262-748710aComparative study of the phenolic profile, antioxidant properties, and inhibitory effects of Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.) and Almond (Terminalia catappa Linn.) leaves on acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase activities in the head region of Fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster Meigen) in vitro  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMoringa and Almond are medicinal plants used traditionally as food and medicine to prevent and/or treat a wide array of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, however, Almond leaf is underutilized. Therefore, this study investigated and compared the polyphenol constituents, antioxidant capacities, and neurochemical indices of the aqueous extracts of Moringa and Almond leaves in fruitfly head tissue homogenate in vitro. The polyphenols were evaluated by characterization using HPLC‐DAD, antioxidant properties were assessed through extracts ability to inhibit ABTS, DPPH, OH, and NO radicals, reduce Fe³⁺ and MDA, and chelate Fe²⁺. The neurochemical indices were evaluated through AChE and MAO inhibitory activities. Almond leaf had significant (p < .05) higher polyphenols and antioxidant properties. However, Moringa leaf had significant (p < .05) higher AChE inhibition and no significant (p < .05) difference was obtained in MAO inhibitory activities. Thus, Almond leaf might be more effective in managing diseases related with oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This present study has shown that Almond leaf might offer better health promotion due to its higher phenolic constituents and antioxidant activities when compared with Moringa leaf, however, both Moringa and Almond leaves could be taken as functional foods to alleviate the symptoms of oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aMoringa oleifera 3aTerminalia catappa 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aalmonds 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3aantioxidants 3acomparative study 3afruit flies 3ahead 3ahealth promotion 3aleaves 3amedicine 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols1 aAdemiluyi, Adedayo O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8325-13041 aOboh, G.,0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.e13401-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.134013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03934naa a2201033 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245018800207300001600395520163800411592002802049650002402077650001502101650001002116650001702126650002502143650001402168650001702182653000802199653000802207653000602215653000602221653000902227653000902236653000702245653000602252653000602258653000802264653000902272653001002281653000902291653000602300653000802306653000602314653000602320653000602326653000602332653000602338653000602344653000602350653000702356653000702363653000602370653000702376653000602383653000602389653000702395653000802402653000802410653000802418653000802426653000902434653000802443653000802451653000602459653000802465653000802473653000602481653000602487653000602493653000902499653000702508653000702515653000602522653000602528653000902534653000902543653000602552653000602558653000602564653000602570653001402576653001502590653001802605653001402623653001802637653000902655700002102664700001902685700001902704773007402723856008202797852000902879655001202888IND60552375320221119170947.0161021e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055237532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.12.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEaston, Erin E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4853-602614aThe mitochondrial genomes of Amphiascoides atopus and Schizopera knabeni (Harpacticoida: Miraciidae) reveal similarities between the copepod orders Harpacticoida and Poecilostomatoida  ap. 123-137.  aMembers of subclass Copepoda are abundant, diverse, and—as a result of their variety of ecological roles in marine and freshwater environments—important, but their phylogenetic interrelationships are unclear. Recent studies of arthropods have used gene arrangements in the mitochondrial (mt) genome to infer phylogenies, but for copepods, only seven complete mt genomes have been published. These data revealed several within-order and few among-order similarities. To increase the data available for comparisons, we sequenced the complete mt genome (13,831base pairs) of Amphiascoides atopus and 10,649base pairs of the mt genome of Schizopera knabeni (both in the family Miraciidae of the order Harpacticoida). Comparison of our data to those for Tigriopus japonicus (family Harpacticidae, order Harpacticoida) revealed similarities in gene arrangement among these three species that were consistent with those found within and among families of other copepod orders. Comparison of the mt genomes of our species with those known from other copepod orders revealed the arrangement of mt genes of our Harpacticoida species to be more similar to that of Sinergasilus polycolpus (order Poecilostomatoida) than to that of T. japonicus. The similarities between S. polycolpus and our species are the first to be noted across the boundaries of copepod orders and support the possibility that mt-gene arrangement might be used to infer copepod phylogenies. We also found that our two species had extremely truncated transfer RNAs and that gene overlaps occurred much more frequently than has been reported for other copepod mt genomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTigriopus japonicus 3aarthropods 3agenes 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3aphylogeny 3atransfer RNA 0a12S 0a16S 0aA 0aA 0aATP6 0aATP8 0abp 0aC 0aC 0aCOI 0aCOII 0aCOIII 0acytb 0aD 0aDHU 0aE 0aF 0aG 0aG 0aH 0aI 0aK 0aL1 0aL2 0aM 0amt 0aN 0aN 0aNC 0aND1 0aND2 0aND3 0aND4 0aND4L 0aND5 0aND6 0aP 0aPCG 0aPCR 0aQ 0aR 0aR 0arRNA 0aS1 0aS2 0aT 0aT 0atRNA 0aTΨC 0aU 0aV 0aW 0aY 0aEvolution 0aGene order 0aMitochondrion 0aPhylogeny 0aRearrangement 0atRNA1 aDarrow, Emily M.1 aSpears, Trisha1 aThistle, David0 tGene.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 538 p.123-137dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.12.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007500166300001600241520118200257536023601439592002801675596001501703650001601718650001401734650002301748650002601771650002401797650001401821650001601835650002401851650001101875650001301886650001001899653001601909653001201925653002901937653001101966700001501977773012901992856008602121852000902207655001202216IND60760494620221116145501.0211223e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076049462DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2021.19494842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Ping10aDesign and application of agricultural ecological building engineering  ap. 783-793.  aEcological architecture pursues the harmonious coexistence of natural ecology and built environment. Meanwhile, architectural planning theory, architectural technology, ecological theory, etc. are usually used in this process. The integration of multiple disciplines and the application of modern architectural technology will eventually organically combine ecology and architecture. This paper carries on the design analysis and application analysis of the construction project with the support of the agricultural ecological concept. From the actual situation, agro-ecological buildings need to combine the residential needs of residents with ecological agriculture. In the planning and construction of ecological farms, attention should be paid to maintaining the original natural ecology and integrating the local human environment. In addition, this paper studies the design requirements and design methods of agricultural ecological construction projects, and conducts design analysis of agricultural ecological construction projects through cases. The research results show that the design method of agro-ecological building engineering in this paper has certain effect.  aThis work was supported by Jiaozuo Municipal Government Decision Making Research Bidding Project in 2020, Research on Micro Transformation Path and Countermeasures of Old Residential Area in Jiaozuo City: [Grant Number JZZ2020050].  aPublisher supplied data  aJZZ2020050 3aagroecology 3abuildings 3aecological farming 3aecosystem engineering 3aecosystem engineers 3aengineers 3aexhibitions 3aexperimental design 3ahumans 3aplanning 3awills 0aAgriculture 0aecology 0aconstruction engineering 0adesign1 aWang, Dong0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 71, no. 9 p.783-793dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4441738x1651-19137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2021.19494843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100002000159245011700179300001800296500000900314520168000323592002802003650001402031650001602045650003802061650001402099650002302113650002402136650001902160650001902179650001802198650002002216650001902236650002902255650003502284650002702319650004702346650002202393650002302415650003202438650004102470700001802511700001802529700001702547773019302564852000902757856007702766655001202843IND4406089120221118082240.0191028e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440608912DNAL7 a184534412pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2007.03942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolliver, Holly10aApplication of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Analysis for Determination of Monensin in Environmental Samples  ap. 1220-1226.  aepub  aThere is growing concern that antibiotic use in livestock production is contributing to contamination of soil and aquatic environments. Monensin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic, accounts for approximately 13% of total subtherapeutic livestock antibiotic usage in the USA and has been widely detected in aquatic environments. Due to insufficient ultraviolet absorbance, liquid chromatography analysis of monensin in environmental samples is limited to equipment with mass spectrometry (e.g., liquid chomatography–mass spectrometry [LC-MS]). However, LC-MS equipment is costly, and extensive sample preparation and clean-up is often required. Rapid, low-cost analytical techniques are needed to monitor for monensin residues in the environment. In this study, a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting monensin in animal feed extracts was evaluated for determination of monensin in water, soil, and manure. The monensin ELISA was highly sensitive, with limits of detection and quantification at 1.5 and 3.0 μg L⁻¹, respectively. Recovery of monensin in spiked water samples was approximately 100%. Cross-reactivity was not observed with similar polyether ionophores, tetracyclines, macrolides, or sulfonamides. Concentrations of monensin using ELISA were greater than concentrations measured with LC-MS. This is attributed to cross-reactivity of the monensin ELISA toward structurally similar monensin compounds, such as factors (slight naturally produced structural variants) and metabolites. Results from this study showed that ELISA can be a reliable, rapid, and low-cost alternative to LC-MS analysis of environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3alivestock 3aantibiotics 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3adetection 3achemical structure 3aagricultural runoff 3aanimal manures 3asoil pollution 3asoil analysis 3awater pollution 3awater analysis 3aenvironmental monitoring 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMonensinxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis1 aKumar, Kuldip1 aGupta, Satish1 aSingh, Ashok0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2008 May, v. 37, no. 3 p.1220-1226dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2007.03943Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01276naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245005200161300001800213520040300231592002800634650001200662650002000674650002300694650001700717650001200734700002300746773013400769856007400903852000900977655001200986IND60684738920221119204711.0200221e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068473892DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc08172k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Anthony F.12aA heterobimetallic cumulenic μ-carbido complex  ap. 2356-2359.  aThe reaction [W(CSe)(CO)₂(Tp*)]NEt₄ (Tp* = hydrotris(dimethylpyrazolyl)borate) with N-methyl-N-nitroso-4-toluenesulfonamide affords the nitrosyl complex [W(CSe)(CO)(NO)(Tp*)] which on treatment with excess [Re(THF)(CO)₂(η-C₅H₅)] affords the cumuenic μ-carbido complex [WRe(μ-C)(CO)₃(NO)(Tp*)(η-C₅H₅)] in addition to the μ-selenido complex [Re₂(μ-Se)(CO)₄(η-C₅H₅)₂].  aPublisher supplied data 3aborates 3acarbon monoxide 3achemical reactions 3anitric oxide 3arhenium1 aWatson, Lachlan J.0 tChemical communications.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 56, no. 15 p.2356-2359dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc08172k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013200167300001600299500001400315520154100329592002801870650001001898650001601908650001101924650001601935650000901951650000901960650001101969650001401980650001201994650001102006650001502017650001802032700001902050773015302069856008202222852000902304655001202313IND60716622720221119180142.0201107e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071662272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-005-2230-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamada, Kazuaki10aIntra-specific variations of egg size, clutch size and larval survival relatedto maternal size in amphidromous Rhinogobius goby  ap. 379-389.  aNAL-light  aSYNOPSIS: Newly hatched amphidromous Rhinogobius sp. CB (cross band type) larvae drift downstream to the sea to grow and develop before returning upstream as juveniles. Since larger and older individuals usually inhabit the upper reaches of rivers, larvae from larger females are more likely to suffer higher risks of starvation or predation during their longer migration to the sea. We examined the relationship between reproductive parameters (egg volume and clutch size) and maternal length. We collected adult Rhinogobius sp. CB along the course of the Aizu River (Wakayama Prefecture, Japan) and spawned them under laboratory conditions. We measured egg volumes and clutch sizes, as well as larval starvation tolerance. Both egg volume and clutch size increased with standard length or age of the maternal fish, while egg density in these clusters did not correlate with standard length. Gonad-somatic index (GSI) also tended to increase with maternal standard length. There was a significant positive correlation between egg size and the 72-h survival rate of unfed hatchlings. Intra-specific variation of egg volumes and clutch sizes in this species seems to be an adaptation for enhancing offspring survivorship during migration to the sea. Some females spawned a second time. Second spawned egg sizes were smaller than first spawned egg sizes, although there was no difference in clutch size between the two. Egg size variation between subsequent spawns may be an adjustment to the changes in seasonal environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aRhinogobius 3aadults 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3afish 3alarvae 3apredation 3aprogeny 3arivers 3astarvation 3asurvival rate1 aIwata, Katsuya0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2005 Aug., v. 73, no. 4 p.379-389dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-005-2230-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002600192245010100218300001600319506007600335520078900411592002801200506003701228650001801265650001901283650001801302650001201320650003301332650001101365653001401376653001801390653002801408653001101436653001001447653000901457653002801466653002101494653001001515653001001525700002001535700002001555773010401575856008501679852000901764655001201773IND60691194320221207075302.0200428e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069119432DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2015.10172172doi7 aPMC46156422pmcid7 a258266562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdelmann, Franziska T10aASH1 mRNP-core factors form stable complexes in absence of cargo RNA at physiological conditions  ap. 233-237.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAsymmetric ASH1 mRNA transport during mitosis of budding yeast constitutes one of the best-studied examples of mRNA localization. Recently, 2 studies used in vitro motility assays to prove that motile ASH1 mRNA-transport complexes can be reconstituted entirely from recombinant factors. Both studies, however, differed in their conclusions on whether cargo RNA itself is required for particle assembly and thus activation of directional transport. Here we provide direct evidence that stable complexes do assemble in absence of RNA at physiologic conditions and even at ionic strengths above cellular levels. These results directly confirm the previous notion that the ASH1 transport machinery is not activated by the cargo RNA itself, but rather through protein-protein interactions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA transport 3aionic strength 3amessenger RNA 3amitosis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3ayeasts 0aASH1 mRNA 0abudding yeast 0ain vitro reconstitution 0amyosin 0aMyo4p 0amRNP 0amacromolecular assembly 0aRNA localization 0aShe3p 0aShe2p1 aNiedner, Annika1 aNiessing, Dierk0 tRNA biology.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 12, no. 3 p.233-237dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2015.10172173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001700159245009900176300001600275500000900291500001500300520161700315592002801932650002201960650001901982650003002001650001602031650002002047650002402067650002102091650001902112650002602131650002202157650001602179650002402195650000902219650003002228650004202258651001602300653002002316653002102336653002902357700002002386700001902406700002302425700002102448700002102469773019102490852000902681856007702690655001202767IND4406088020221118082306.0191028e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440608802DNAL7 a184533992pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2007.04322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsbo, Mats10aSimulating Sulfadimidine Transport in Surface Runoff and Soil at the Microplot and Field Scale  ap. 788-797.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aTo prevent residues of veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) from contaminating surface waters and ground water, an environmental impact assessment is required before a new product is allowed on the market. Physically based simulation models are advocated for the calculation of predicted environmental concentrations at higher tiers of the assessment process. However, the validation status of potentially useful models is poor for VMP transport. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dual-permeability model MACRO for simulation of transport of sulfonamide antibiotics in surface runoff and soil. Special focus was on effects of solute application in liquid manure, which may alter the hydraulic properties at the soil surface. To this end we used data from a microplot runoff experiment and a field experiment, both conducted on the same clay loam soil prone to preferential flow. Results showed that the model could accurately simulate concentrations of sulfadimidine and the nonreactive tracer bromide in runoff and in soil from the microplot experiments. The use of posterior parameter distributions from calibrations using the microplot data resulted in poor simulations for the field data of total sulfadimidine losses. The poor results may be due to surface runoff being instantly transferred off the field in the model, whereas in reality re-infiltration may occur. The effects of the manure application were reflected in smaller total and micropore hydraulic conductivities compared with the application in aqueous solution. These effects could easily be accounted for in regulatory modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3asoil pollution 3agroundwater contamination 3aantibiotics 3aclay loam soils 3aagricultural runoff 3amodel validation 3asulfamethazine 3afield experimentation 3apreferential flow 2aCalibration 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSoil 2aSulfamethazinexchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 3aSwitzerland 0awater pollution 0asulfadimethazine 0asoil transport processes1 aFenner, Kathrin1 aStoob, Krispin1 aBurkhardt, Michael1 aAbbaspour, Karim1 aStamm, Christian0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2008 May, v. 37, no. 3 p.788-797dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2007.04323Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03215naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245012100206300001200327520178300339592002802122596003302150650002402183650002402207650001902231650001302250650001402263650002002277650001102297650004202308650001102350650001302361650001702374650002502391650001402416650002202430700002602452700001802478700002102496700002402517700002202541773010302563856008202666852000902748655001202757IND60712716120221121045714.0220929e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071271612DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-019-1819-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGihawi, Abraham1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3676-556110aSEPATH: benchmarking the search for pathogens in human tissue whole genome sequence data leads to template pipelines  ap. 208.  aBACKGROUND: Human tissue is increasingly being whole genome sequenced as we transition into an era of genomic medicine. With this arises the potential to detect sequences originating from microorganisms, including pathogens amid the plethora of human sequencing reads. In cancer research, the tumorigenic ability of pathogens is being recognized, for example, Helicobacter pylori and human papillomavirus in the cases of gastric non-cardia and cervical carcinomas, respectively. As of yet, no benchmark has been carried out on the performance of computational approaches for bacterial and viral detection within host-dominated sequence data. RESULTS: We present the results of benchmarking over 70 distinct combinations of tools and parameters on 100 simulated cancer datasets spiked with realistic proportions of bacteria. mOTUs2 and Kraken are the highest performing individual tools achieving median genus-level F1 scores of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. mOTUs2 demonstrates a high performance in estimating bacterial proportions. Employing Kraken on unassembled sequencing reads produces a good but variable performance depending on post-classification filtering parameters. These approaches are investigated on a selection of cervical and gastric cancer whole genome sequences where Alphapapillomavirus and Helicobacter are detected in addition to a variety of other interesting genera. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the top-performing pipelines from this benchmark in a unifying tool called SEPATH, which is amenable to high throughput sequencing studies across a range of high-performance computing clusters. SEPATH provides a benchmarked and convenient approach to detect pathogens in tissue sequence data helping to determine the relationship between metagenomics and disease.  aPublisher supplied data  a16-09RcBig C Cancer Charity 3aAlphapapillomavirus 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aanimal viruses 3abacteria 3acarcinoma 3adata collection 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3amedicine 3ametagenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3apipelines 3astomach neoplasms1 aRallapalli, Ghanasyam1 aHurst, Rachel1 aCooper, Colin S.1 aLeggett, Richard M.1 aBrewer, Daniel S.0 tGenome biology.g2019 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.208-208dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1819-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245016700174300001200341520129300353592002801646650001101674650002501685650002301710650001501733650001301748650001701761650002301778651001901801700002401820700002301844700002101867773010601888856008701994852000902081655001202090IND60593749420221120133421.0180508e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059374942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOakley, Jenny W.10aDefining ecologically, geographically, and politically coherent boundaries for the Northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region: Facilitating ecosystem-based management  ap. 1-7.  aEcosystem-based management (EBM) is an integrated approach that recognizes the complex interactions within an ecosystem. Proper facilitation of EBM techniques require explicitly defined spatial boundaries, but biophysical processes, human activities, and the ecosystems that they influence operate at various scales. Careful thought to combine ecological, physical, and regulatory boundaries to define spatial scales of coastal regions can be a tedious yet significant early step towards the meaningful application of ecosystem-based management. We recommend nine coastal regions for the Northern Gulf of Mexico by creating both regulatory and biophysically meaningful spatial boundaries. A basic framework illustrating the utility of publicly available spatial datasets for defining the seaward, landward, and lateral boundaries of coastal regions is provided. These nine coastal regions will be key in creating spatial criteria for the Northern Gulf of Mexico, within which differences in ecosystem services can be measured, and temporal changes in ecosystem services can be tracked. The framework developed here is meant to build capacity for EBM and serve as a starting point for the continued discussion and modification of sensible ecological, geographical and political boundaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3apolitics 3aspatial data 3atemporal variation 3aGulf of Mexico1 aLawing, A.

Five species from the GOG assemblage (C. albus, C. analis, C. phoxocephalus, C. squamipinnis, and Isopisthus remifer) are compared to four species from a relatively well-studied assemblage in the western Atlantic (C. arenarius, C. nebulosus, C. nothus, and C. regalis). The two regional species assemblages broadly overlap in morphology, but sympatric species segregate relatively well within each assemblage. The GOG species segregate primarily along the major axis of shape variation in the study, which is associated with variation in the anal, second dorsal, and caudal fins. The western Atlantic species segregate primarily along the second major axis of shape variation, which is most strongly associated with variation in gill raker length, and less strongly with pectoral fin length, eye diameter, and length of the third dorsal spine. Patterns of morphological divergence among the western Atlantic species support the hypothesis that morphological divergence is associated with ecological divergence. Comparisons across assemblages indicate that morphological divergence among species in the GOG is substantial. Consequently, Cynoscion species in the GOG may be highly divergent in ecological habits, which would have important management implications, but further ecological research is needed. This study provides a first glimpse into the major patterns of morphological diversification in the Cynoscion group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsopisthus 3aeyes 3afins 3amorphometry 3aspecies diversity 3asympatry 3aEcuador1 aShervette, Virginia R.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2005 Aug., v. 73, no. 4 p.403-413dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-005-2227-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013100164300001600295520180200311592002802113650002402141650001202165650001302177650002002190650001302210650001602223650001802239650002902257650001802286650001402304650001502318650001102333650002002344650002402364650001202388650001402400653002402414653003302438653002902471700001902500700002102519700001602540700001802556773015202574856007902726852000902805655001202814IND60628914820221117041250.0210105e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062891482DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-152392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandalaneni, K.10aInfluence of milk protein concentrates with modified calcium content on enteral dairy beverage formulations: Storage stability  ap. 155-163.  aControl of calcium-mediated storage defects, such as age gelation and sedimentation, were evaluated in enteral high-protein dairy beverages during storage. To investigate the effects of reduced-calcium ingredients on storage stability, 2 batches each of milk protein concentrates (MPC) with 3 levels of calcium content were acquired [control, 20% calcium-reduced (MPC-20), and 30% calcium-reduced (MPC-30)]. Control and calcium-reduced MPC were used to formulate 8% (wt/wt) protein enteral dairy beverages. The formulation also consisted of other ingredients, such as gums, maltodextrin, potassium citrate, and sucrose. The pH-adjusted formulation was divided into 2 parts, one with 0.15% sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) and the other with 0% SHMP. The formulations were homogenized and retort sterilized at 121°C for 15 min. The retort-sterilized beverages were stored at room temperature for up to 90 d and particle size and apparent viscosity were measured on d 0, 7, 30, 60, and 90. Beverages formulated using control MPC with 0 and 0.15% SHMP exhibited sedimentation, causing a decrease in apparent viscosity by approximately 10 cP and clear phase separation by d 90. The MPC-20 beverages with 0% SHMP exhibited stable particle size and apparent viscosities during storage. In the presence of 0.15% SHMP, particle size increased rapidly by 40 nm on d 90, implying the start of progressive gelation. On the other hand, highest apparent viscosities leading to gelation were observed in MPC-30 beverages at both concentrations of SHMP studied. These results suggested that beverages formulated with MPC-20 and 0% SHMP would have better storage stability by maintaining lower apparent viscosities. Further reduction of calcium using MPC-30 resulted in rapid gelation of beverages during storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acalcium 3acitrates 3adairy beverages 3agelation 3aingredients 3amaltodextrins 3amilk protein concentrate 3aparticle size 3apotassium 3aseparation 3asodium 3astorage quality 3astorage temperature 3asucrose 3aviscosity 0acalcium-reduced MPC 0ahigh-protein dairy beverages 0asodium hexametaphosphate1 aBhanduriya, K.1 aAmamcharla, J.K.1 aMarella, C.1 aMetzger, L.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.155-163dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-152393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007800167300001800245520194800263592002802211650000802239650001702247650002002264650001702284650002002301650002602321650002402347650002202371650002002393650001402413650001902427650001702446650002002463650001202483650001002495650001102505650001502516650001202531653002302543653002202566653001602588653001602604653002002620653002302640700001802663700001702681700001902698700001702717700001902734700002002753700002602773700002002799700002502819700002202844700001802866700002502884700002202909700002102931700002202952700002202974700001802996700002703014700001903041773011003060856008603170852000903256655001203265IND60114129220221118155029.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011412922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKautz, Timo10aNutrient acquisition from arable subsoils in temperate climates: A review  ap. 1003-1022.  aIn arable farming systems, the term ‘subsoil’ refers to the soil beneath the tilled or formerly tilled soil horizon whereas the latter one is denoted as ‘topsoil’. To date, most agronomic and plant nutrition studies have widely neglected subsoil processes involved in nutrient acquisition by crop roots. Based on our current knowledge it can be assumed that subsoil properties such as comparatively high bulk density, low air permeability, and poverty of organic matter, nutrients and microbial biomass are obviously adverse for nutrient acquisition, and sometimes subsoils provide as little as less than 10% of annual nutrient uptake in fertilised arable fields. Nevertheless, there is also strong evidence indicating that subsoil can contribute to more than two-thirds of the plant nutrition of N, P and K, especially when the topsoil is dry or nutrient-depleted. Based on the existing literature, nutrient acquisition from arable subsoils may be conceptualised into three major process components: (I) mobilisation from the subsoil, (II) translocation to the shoot and long-term accumulation in the Ap horizon and (III) re-allocation to the subsoil. The quantitative estimation of nutrient acquisition from the subsoil requires the linking of field experiments with mathematical modelling approaches on different spatial scales including Process Based Models for the field scale and Functional–Structural Plant Models for the plant scale. Possibilities to modify subsoil properties by means of agronomic management are limited, but ‘subsoiling’ – i.e. deep mechanical loosening – as well as the promotion of biopore formation are two potential strategies for increasing access to subsoil resources for crop roots in arable soils. The quantitative role of biopores in the nutrient acquisition from the subsoil is still unclear, and more research is needed to determine the bioaccessibility of nutrients in subsoil horizons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aarable soils 3abioavailability 3abulk density 3afarming systems 3afield experimentation 3amathematical models 3amicrobial biomass 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apermeability 3aplant nutrition 3apoverty 3aroots 3ashoots 3asubsoiling 3atopsoil 0aStructure dynamics 0aBiopore formation 0aRoot growth 0aDrilosphere 0aRhizodeposition 0aMicrobial activity1 aAmelung, Wulf1 aEwert, Frank1 aGaiser, Thomas1 aHorn, Rainer1 aJahn, Reinhold1 aJavaux, Mathieu1 aKemna, A.q(Andreas),1 aKuzyakov, Yakov1 aMunch, Jean Charles,1 aPätzold, Stefan,1 aPeth, Stephan1 aScherer, Heinrich W.1 aSchloter, Michael1 aSchneider, Heike1 aVanderborght, Jan1 aVetterlein, Doris1 aWalter, Achim1 aWiesenberg, Guido L.B.1 aKöpke, Ulrich0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 57 p.1003-1022dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013700168300001600305520195500321592002802276650002302304650002702327650002502354650001802379650001302397650002202410650002402432650001302456650001202469650002102481650001302502650000702515650001502522650001802537650001902555650002402574650002002598650001202618650001002630651001002640653003402650653001802684653002402702653003202726700001502758700001402773700001602787700001602803700001402819700001602833773011602849856008502965852000903050655001203059IND60598531120221118051210.0190705e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059853112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinliang10aEffects of tree species and soil properties on the composition and diversity of the soil bacterial community following afforestation  ap. 342-349.  aAfforestation with single and mixed tree species on cropland alters soil properties and the composition and diversity of soil bacterial community. We investigated changes in soil properties and the soil bacterial community composition in the topsoil (0–20 cm) following afforestation on cropland on the Loess Plateau. Forests of six types ranging from 23 to 25 years in age were chosen in this study: Robinia pseudoacacia (RP), Platycladus orientalis (PO), Pinus tabuliformis (PT), Robinia pseudoacacia + Platycladus orientalis (RPPO), Robinia pseudoacacia + Pinus tabuliformis (RPPT), and Platycladus orientalis + Pinus tabuliformis (POPT). Afforestation with different tree species altered the soil nutrient contents, with total nitrogen (TN) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+) contents increased by 18.28–87.10% and 13.97–141.34%, respectively, and available phosphorus (AP) content decreased by 56.09–82.13% compared to cropland sites. Cropland afforestation reduced the soil bacterial richness and core bacterial genera abundance (relative abundance ≥ 0.1%), and significantly altered the bacterial diversity. Soil properties explained 73.41% of the total variation in the core soil bacterial community composition at the genus level, and soil organic carbon (SOC), TN, nitrate nitrogen (NO3−), NH4+, AP, pH and the carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratio were significantly correlated with first two RDA (redundancy analysis) axes. The results of hierarchical clustering indicated that the soil bacterial community composition in the RPPO, RPPT and POPT sites was largely affected by Platycladus, Pinus tabuliformis and Platycladus, respectively. Our observations suggest that soil bacterial community composition and diversity following afforestation were mainly affected by tree species, followed by soil parameters. The effect of afforestation on the soil bacterial diversity was larger than its effect on bacterial richness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aPlatycladus orientalis 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aafforestation 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3acommunity structure 3acropland 3aforests 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphorus 3asoil bacteria 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil properties 3atopsoil 3atrees 3aChina 0aSingle and mixed tree species 0aLoess Plateau 0a16S rRNA sequencing 0aCore bacterial genera group1 aDang, Peng1 aGao, Yang1 aZhu, Hailan1 aZhu, Huinan1 aZhao, Fei1 aZhao, Zhong0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 427 p.342-349dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013000164300001600294520148200310592002801792650001501820650002101835650002901856650001401885650001501899650001401914650002101928650001401949650001801963650002601981650001102007650001802018650002302036650001702059650002702076650002102103650002402124650002102148650001802169650001802187650001802205650001502223650002602238653001702264653001602281653001402297653001802311653001402329700001902343700001702362700002402379700002102403700001702424700002102441773011202462856008202574852000902656655001202665IND60581090420221120115143.0190401e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058109042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2017.07.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, Divya10aPhotosensitized methyl paraben induces apoptosis via caspase dependent pathway under ambient UVB exposure in human skin cells  ap. 171-185.  aMethyl paraben (MP), is a widely used preservative in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic products. Its molecular mechanism under ambient ultraviolet radiation is not well understood. We investigated photosensitizing mechanism of MP under ambient UVB (0.6 mW/cm2) intensity. MP showed dose dependent decrease in cell viability of human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) by MTT and NRU assays. Study showed 40% reduction in antimicrobial activity of UVB irradiated MP through E. coli culture. Photosensitized MP (25 μg/ml) significantly enhanced lipid peroxidation, intracellular ROS generation and disrupted mitochondrial membrane integrity. MP induced loss of lysosomal membrane integrity and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mediated stress evident from Ca+2 release. Phototoxicity of MP showed nuclear fragmentation, phosphatidylserine translocation, 30% tail DNA and micronuclei formation. Study showed mitochondria mediated apoptosis via upregulation of Bax, Apaf-1, Cytochrome C and Caspase-3. Upregulation of Caspase-12 (2 folds) specifically showed role of ER in apoptosis. Specific caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK showed involvement of caspase cascade pathway in apoptosis. Results indicate that photosensitive MP leads to oxidative stress mediated DNA damage and apoptosis through mitochondria and ER. MP causes deleterious effects and its long term exposure to human skin may promote skin diseases. Therefore, MP should be replaced by other photosafe preservatives for humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aEscherichia coli 3aantimicrobial properties 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-12 3acaspase-3 3achronic exposure 3acosmetics 3adose response 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahumans 3akeratinocytes 3alipid peroxidation 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphatidylserines 3aphotosensitivity 3aphototoxicity 3apreservatives 3askin diseases 3atoxicology 3aultraviolet radiation 0aCytochrome C 0aHaCaT cells 0aApoptosis 0aPhototoxicity 0aCaspase-31 aChopra, Deepti1 aSingh, Jyoti1 aSrivastav, Ajeet K.1 aSmitā Kumārī,1 aVerma, Ankit1 aRay, Ratan Singh0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 Oct., v. 108 p.171-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.07.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010500166300001400271500001500285520033500300592002800635650001300663650002300676650001200699650001500711650000900726650002200735650001000757650001300767650001200780650001600792650001700808651001200825653001300837653001300850653001500863653001700878653001000895653001800905700001700923700001800940773011500958856008201073852000901155655001201164IND60516785420221118090208.0190727e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051678542DNAL7 a10.1017/S00242829120005402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtayo, Javier,10aNiesslia echinoides (Niessliaceae, Ascomycota), a new lichenicolous fungus on Erioderma from Bolivia  ap. 21-24.  a2019-12-06  aNiesslia echinoides Etayo, Flakus & Kukwa sp. nov. is described from Bolivia from the corticolous thallus of Erioderma barbellatum.

Pathophysiology remains unclear. In the present study iopromide was administered to New Zealand white rabbits without any prior intervention. Oxidative stress was assessed in blood and tissue level at three anatomical kidney areas (medullary, cortical, juxtamedullary). Histopathological evaluation was also performed. Serum creatinine and urea increased in the CIN groups over 25% at two hours after administration and returned to baseline at 48 h. In kidney tissues, a significant reduction (40%) of catalase in renal cortexes of the CIN groups was observed. Necrosis and tubular vacuolization was also noted that correlated with urea and creatinine levels. Lipid peroxidation decreased at 10 h after administration (>45%) and remained low even at 48 h. Plasma protein carbonyls were significantly increased (67%) in 2 h and dropped later. Serum levels of creatinine and urea at 24 and 48 h significantly correlated with the Total Antioxidant Activity and lipid peroxidation, respectively. Oxidative stress is shown to be involved in CIN development in the rabbit, with more pronounced effects to be confined to the cortex and outer stripe of the outer medulla.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3acortex 3acreatinine 3ahistopathology 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3amodels 3anecrosis 3anephrotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apathophysiology 3arabbits 3atoxicology 3aurea 0aContrast media 0aNephrotoxicity 0aOxidative stress 0aRabbit 0aCAT 0aCIN 0aCM 0aDNPH 0aDPPH 0aDTNB 0aEDTA 0aGLC 0aGST 0aH&E 0aHO-1 0aIV 0aLLC-PK1 0aMDA 0aMDCK 0aNAD(P)H 0aNQO1 0aNrf2 0aPAS 0aPC 0aROS 0aSOD 0aTAC 0aTBARS 0a24hCIN group 0a48hCIN group1 aRapti, Maria1 aKouka, Paraskevi1 aNepka, Charitini1 aTsarouhas, Konstantinos1 aSoumelidis, Anestis1 aKoukoulis, George1 aTsatsakis, Aristides1 aKouretas, Demetrios1 aTsitsimpikou, Christina0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 Oct., v. 108 p.186-193dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012100165300001600286520194800302592002802250650002502278650002102303650001802324650002202342650001102364650002002375650001602395650001502411650002002426650002202446650002602468650001302494650002102507650001502528650000902543650001902552650001802571650001802589653001902607653003602626653003402662653001402696653002502710700001402735700001402749700001502763700001302778700001602791773011602807856008502923852000903008655001203017IND60598531320221118051315.0190705e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059853132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, F.Z.10aChanges of soil microbial and enzyme activities are linked to soil C, N and P stoichiometry in afforested ecosystems  ap. 289-295.  aAfforestation has been shown to strongly affect substrate stoichiometry and profoundly influence the microbial community. However, the degree to which microbial and activity are linked to soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry in afforested ecosystems remains unclear. In this study, soil samples were collected from Robinia pseudoacacia L. (RP42, RP27, and RP17) and farmland (FL) sites with a chronosequence of 42, 27, and 17 years. We determined the microbial biomass C (Cmic), N (Nmic), Cmic to organic C (Csoil) ratio (Cmic:Csoil), Nmic to total nitrogen (Nsoil) ratio (Nmic:Nsoil), and metabolic quotient (Rmic:Cmic) to investigate microbial. We also measured soil b-glucosidase (BG), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), acid phosphatase (AP), as well as Csoil, Nsoil, and total phosphorus (Psoil). The results showed that, compared with FL, Csoil:Psoil and Nsoil:Psoil were increased during aggradation, whereas Csoil:Nsoil increased in RP27 and RP17 but decreased in RP42. Cmic:Csoil and Nmic:Nsoil were 94% and 182% higher in RP42 than FL, respectively. However, Rmic:Cmic was lower in RP42, RP27, and RP17 than FL by 64%, 36% and 25%, respectively. Moreover, we found that BG, NAG, AP, BG:NAG, and BG:AP in RP42, RP27, and RP17 were higher than in FL. Compared with global soil (0.62 and 0.13), the lower BG:AP (0.42) and BG:NAG (0.03) ratios in present study indicated that Psoil may be limited. Additionally, redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the Csoil: Nsoil was positively correlated with Rmic: Cmic but negatively with Cmic: Csoil and Nmic: Nsoil, while Csoil:Psoil and Nsoil:Psoil were also significantly and negatively correlated with BG:AP, BG:NAG, and NAG. Therefore, our results indicated that afforested ecosystem are highly susceptible to changes in soil microbial and enzyme stoichiometry during aggradation and may become P-limited. Such changes were modulated by soil nutrient stoichiometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aacid phosphatase 3aafforestation 3aagricultural land 3acarbon 3achronosequences 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3asoil sampling 3astoichiometry 0aSoil microbial 0aExtracellular enzyme activities 0aSoil C, N and P stoichiometry 0aP-limited 0aAfforested ecosystem1 aRen, C.J.1 aHan, X.H.1 aYang, G.H.1 aWang, J.1 aDoughty, R.0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 427 p.289-295dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245009200166300001800258520124900276592002801525650002201553650003701575650001501612650001501627650001901642650001301661650001501674650003801689650001001727650001301737650001801750650003301768650001101801650002001812650001301832650001701845650001401862650002101876700001201897700001701909700001901926700001801945773010401963856008902067852000902156655001202165IND60571075420221120221348.0170710e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057107542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b034532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ke10aHigh-Capacity Li4SiO4-Based CO2 Sorbents via a Facile Hydration–NaCl Doping Technique  ap. 6257-6265.  aA sodium chloride (NaCl) doping–hydration technique was used to modify the structure of Li₄SiO₄ to improve its sorption properties at a low CO₂ concentration. X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analyses were conducted to characterize the compositions, textural characteristics, morphologies, chemical valence states, molten phases, and adsorption properties of the synthesized samples. Hydration and NaCl doping produced synergistic effects. On one hand, a small particle size and large specific surface area were obtained, significantly facilitating chemisorption processes. On the other hand, co-doped sodium and chlorine induced molten phases when absorbing CO₂, noticeably decreasing CO₂ diffusion resistance. Thus, the CO₂ absorption rate and uptake were remarkably improved. Different amounts of NaCl also greatly affected the morphology and chemisorption properties of the sorbents. At the optimized NaCl concentration, the sorbent only required 3 wt % doping to attain a maximum sorption capacity of up to 34.2 wt %. Moreover, the high capacity was maintained after 10 sorption/desorption cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorine 3adesorption 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afuels 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asorbents 3asurface area 3asynergism 3athermogravimetry1 aLi, Wei1 aYin, Zeguang1 aZhou, Zhongyun1 aZhao, Pengfei0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 June 15, v. 31, no. 6 p.6257-6265dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b034533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009600170300001800266520142600284592002801710650002801738650001901766650002001785650000901805650001501814650002001829650001701849650001901866650001501885653002101900653000801921653002101929653002301950653002401973653002701997700002502024700001902049773014202068856008502210852000902295655001202304IND60595377620221116234920.0180602e20171229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059537762DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2017.13685532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSengar, Namita10aComputer vision based technique for identification of fish quality after pesticide exposure  ap. 2192-2206.  aDifferent factors like treating, handling, storage, exposure to contaminants and climatic change are responsible for the quality of fish. There is a difference in quality between fishes nurtured in fresh water and in polluted or pesticide affected water. Among different impurities, pesticide is one of the major threats to fish quality and human health. Identification and detection of pesticide contamination in fish is a challenging task and conventional methods need number of costly devices and expert manpower. This paper intends to provide a non-destructive computer-aided method for identification of quality differences between pesticide exposed fish and fresh water fish. In the proposed image processing method, the fish eye tissue was selected as the main region for extraction of different features in spatial domain. Statistical features were selected in spatial domain and then these features were analysed for discriminatory variation using strategic image processing techniques. These analysed features were correlated to pesticide treated and fresh water fish using machine learning methods. Different classifiers were used for automatic classification on the extracted features. The experimental results illustrate the efficiency of proposed method and the accuracy of identification is 96.87%. The computational time is less, making it practically well-suited for fish quality assessment in real time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aclimate change 3acomputer vision 3aeyes 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3ahuman health 3aimage analysis 3apesticides 0aImage Processing 0aEye 0aPupil of the eye 0aFeature Extraction 0aTissue Segmentation 0aCypermethrine Exposure1 aDutta, Malay Kishore1 aSarkar, Biplab0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2017 Dec. 29, v. 20, no. sup2 p.2192-2206dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2017.13685533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04273naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168300001600303520243000319592002802749650002102777650001202798650001302810650002002823650002102843650001302864650001202877650002202889650003702911650001902948650002302967650002302990650002303013650001103036650002603047650001503073650001803088650001603106650001003122651001103132651001003143651001203153651002503165651001003190653002303200653001603223653004003239653002603279653001703305653002303322700002703345700002303372700002403395700001703419773011703436856008503553852000903638655001203647IND60598531420221118051145.0190705e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059853142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.04.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoltas, Jordi10aEcotypic variation and stability in growth performance of the thermophilic conifer Pinus halepensis across the Mediterranean basin  ap. 205-215.  aThe combined effects of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity influencing plant performance are relevant to understand the capacity for genetic responses to climate change. Pinus halepensis is a native species of low- to mid-elevation Mediterranean forests with a high ecological value in drought-prone areas. Thus, it is of utmost importance to determine its adaptive structure for key traits such as growth or survival. Here, we analyse a highly unbalanced dataset collated from different common-garden networks that cover the distribution range of the species. A total of 82 range-wide populations were evaluated in nine Mediterranean trials located in Israel, Italy and Spain. A climate classification of populations allowed for the definition of six different groups, or ecotypes, which showed contrasting performances for tree height and survival at age 15. The effects of ecotypic differentiation and among-ecotypes genetic variation in plasticity were disentangled by fitting stability models accounting for interaction and heteroscedasticity in genotype-by-environment tables. For growth, a Finlay–Wilkinson model suggested high predictability of ecotypic plastic responses in P. halepensis, as described by different linear reaction norms. However, differences in mean height of ca. 15% among ecotypes dominated intra-specific patterns of tree growth across trials, pointing to preponderance of genotypic adaptation over differential ecotypic plasticity in this species. For survival, ecotypic differences were approximately constant across trials, suggesting lack of genotype-by-environment effects. Sub-humid cool climate populations from the eastern Mediterranean (e.g., Greek populations) showed general adaptation and high sensitivity to improved growing conditions, as opposed to populations from the driest ecological extreme of the species (e.g., south Spain and Maghreb populations), which exhibited specific adaptation to harsh environments. Altogether, our results indicate a general adaptive syndrome by which less reactive ecotypes to ameliorated conditions (e.g., non-water-limited) would be associated with high survival rates and low growth. The reported ecotypic differentiation constitutes the basis for tailoring intra-specific responses to climate and disentangling the relationship between adaptive variation and resilience towards climatic warming for this exemplary Mediterranean pine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus halepensis 3aclimate 3aconifers 3adata collection 3aecological value 3aecotypes 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aglobal warming 3agrowth performance 3aheteroskedasticity 3aindigenous species 3amodels 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aplasticity 3asurvival rate 3atree growth 3atrees 3aIsrael 3aItaly 3aMaghreb 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 0aAdaptive responses 0aAleppo pine 0aGenotype-by-environment interaction 0aPhenotypic plasticity 0aMixed models 0aStability analysis1 aShestakova, Tatiana A.1 aPatsiou, Theofania1 adi Matteo, Giovanni1 aKlein, Tamir0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 424 p.205-215dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.04.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245010200174500001900276520196000295592002802255650002102283650001302304650001302317650002202330650003102352650001702383650002602400650001902426650002902445653000902474653000802483653000802491653000802499653000902507653001202516653001302528653001202541653000802553653000802561653000802569653000802577653000702585653000902592653001502601653000802616653000802624653000802632653001202640653000902652653002202661653002002683653002602703653002702729700002102756700002602777700002402803700001802827700001802845700003102863700006102894773011102955856008803066852000903154655001203163IND60713912720221119162349.0210201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071391272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1105182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosebach, Amadea10aImpaired diagnostic accuracy of hair ethyl glucuronide testing in patients with renal dysfunction  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe impact of renal impairment and hemodialysis on ethyl glucuronide concentrations in hair (hEtG) is not well known. Here, hEtG levels were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) in patients presenting to the transplant outpatient clinic and compared with the self-reported alcohol consumption in an anonymous validated questionnaire. Estimated daily alcohol intake (EDI) was calculated. A total of 94 patients with varying renal function (Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 mL/min: group 1 (n = 47); GFR 30–60 ml/min: group 2 (n = 29); GFR < 30 mL/min: group 3 (n = 18)) were included in the study. Fifteen of 18 (83.3%) patients in group 3 were on dialysis. Altogether, hEtG tested positive (> 5 pg/mg) in 25.5% (n = 24) of patients, while 36.2% (n = 34) and 14.9% (n = 14) of patients reported any or regular (> 10 g/d) alcohol consumption, respectively. The median hEtG concentration of positive samples was much higher in patients in group 3 with advanced renal dysfunction or on dialysis than in patients in group 1 or 2 (group 1, 2, 3 dialysis patients: 74, 52, 145 and 155 pg/mg, respectively), although they consumed on average much less alcohol per day (median EDI group 1, 2, 3, dialysis patients: 16, 17, 3 and 3 g/d, respectively). Also, there was a significant correlation between the hEtG concentration and EDI for patients in group 1 (ρ = 0.84; p = 0.01), but not for patients in group 2 (ρ = −0.35, p = 0.39) or 3 (ρ = 0.02, p = 0.96). Furthermore, the ability of hEtG to correctly identify abstainers as such was lower for patients with advanced renal dysfunction than for the remaining patients (specificity for group 1, 2, 3: 92%, 87%, 82%, respectively). So, monitoring hEtG concentration was less reliable in patients with advanced renal dysfunction or on hemodialysis and by far overestimated the amount of alcohol consumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol drinking 3aalcohols 3adialysis 3aforensic sciences 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahemodialysis 3aliquid chromatography 3aquestionnaires 3atandem mass spectrometry 0ahEtG 0aEtG 0aEDI 0aGFR 0aMDRD 0apre LTx 0apost LTx 0apre KTx 0aALD 0aBMI 0aGGT 0aMCV 0aCI 0aSoHT 0aLC–MS/MS 0aPPV 0aNPV 0aLOD 0aAlcohol 0aHair 0aEthyl glucuronide 0aKidney function 0aLiver transplantation 0aKidney transplantation1 aAboutara, Nadine1 aLago, Maria Rodriguez1 aMüller, Alexander,1 aLang, Melanie1 aFischer, Lutz1 aIwersen-Bergmann, Stefanie1 aSterneck, Martina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1593-27460 tForensic science international.g2020 Dec., v. 317 p.110518-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1105183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01128naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245002200137300002000159520038800179592002800567650001800595650002000613650002000633650001500653650001300668650001100681651001800692651001200710773010700722852000900829655001200838IND60612063920221121235624.0180904e197307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061206392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScrimshaw, Nevin S.,10aReport From Hanoi  ap. 16-17,30,31.  aThis spring four American physicians and one member of the U.

Of these, the T315I “gatekeeper” mutation is resistant to all currently registered Bcr-Abl TK inhibitors (TKIs) with the notable exception of ponatinib (Iclusig™), which was very recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Besides ponatinib, numerous strategies have been developed to circumvent this problem. These include the protein synthesis inhibitor omacetaxine (Synribo®), and “switch-control” inhibitors. Dual Bcr-Abl and aurora kinase inhibitors represent another promising strategy. Finally, several promising synergistic combinations, such as TKIs with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), warrant attention.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGatekeeper mutations 0aT315I 0aBcr-Abl 0aTyrosine kinase inhibitors 0aHDAC inhibitors1 aPark, Haeseong1 aAl-Khafaji, Jawad1 aGrant, Steven0 tLeukemia Research Reports.g2013, v. 2 p.18-20dElsevier Ltdx2213-04897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lrr.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005800168300001400226520170900240592002801949650001901977650001201996650002102008650001102029650001202040650001202052650001902064650001302083650001302096650001402109650000902123651001302132700001802145700002002163773011502183856008502298852000902383655001202392IND60598531820221118050944.0190705e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059853182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, Joana10aXylogenesis in the early life stages of maritime pine  ap. 71-77.  aTrees change throughout their life stages, and although age-dependent changes are reported in the literature, the early life stages of trees are often excluded from these studies. The sapling/pole life stage corresponds to the establishment phase of a tree in the forest. To understand how wood formation changes in the early growing stages we compared xylogenesis in saplings/pole (10–15 years old) and young trees (50–55 years old). Trees were selected from two adjacent areas in different regeneration phases from a maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) plantation located on the west coast of Portugal. The cambial and differentiating xylem cells were monitored from March 2015 to March 2017. The climatic conditions in these years were contrasting: 2015 was hot and dry and 2016 wet. Xylogenesis started around the same time in both age-classes but ended later in young trees in both years. Despite the shorter duration, sapling/pole trees formed more tracheids than young trees in both years, presenting an intensive growth strategy. Tracheids in young trees did not present differences between years, but sapling/pole trees presented fewer tracheids with a higher latewood proportion and smaller lumen area in the driest year (2015). Our results show that sapling/pole trees have an intensive growth strategy, whereas older trees (50–55 years) present a conservative growth strategy with a longer growing season. If the frequency and intensity of droughts increases, sapling/pole trees will reduce growth immediately, whereas older trees will reduce productivity in the following years. Thus, it is expected that forest productivity will decrease under a scenario of increasing drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinaster 3acambium 3aclimatic factors 3acoasts 3adrought 3aforests 3agrowing season 3alatewood 3asaplings 3atracheids 3awood 3aPortugal1 aCarvalho, Ana1 aCampelo, Filipe0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 424 p.71-77dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01554naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001600287520066800303592002800971650002200999650000901021650002701030651001201057651001601069700001701085773010501102856004801207852000901255655001201264IND50070291220221119073634.0131031e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007029122DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-013-9941-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGemmer, Isabelle10aCharacterization of the first twelve microsatellite loci for the amphipod Gammarus roeselii (Crustacea: Amphipoda)  ap. 955-957.  aWe characterised the first twelve microsatellites for the freshwater amphipod Gammarus roeselii.

In the last three decades, STR-based DNA identification has actively evolved along with traditional biometric methods. Nonetheless, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are now of great interest and a number of relevant SNP panels have been proposed for DNA identification. Here, a simple approach to SNP data digitization that can provide assigning a unique genetic identification number (GIN) to each person is proposed. The key points of this approach are as follows: 1) SNP data are digitized as whole 4-bit boxes in the most convenient binary format, where character “1” (YES) is assigned to revealed nucleotides, and character “0” (NO) to missing nucleotides after SNP-typing; 2) all SNPs should be considered tetra-allelic. Calculations showed that a 72-plex SNP panel is enough to provide the population with unique GINs, which can be represented in digital (binary or hexadecimal) or graphic (linear or two-dimensional) formats. Simple software for SNP data processing and GINs creation in any format was written. It is likely that the national and global GIN databases will facilitate the solution of problems related to identification of individuals or human biological materials. The proposed approach may be extended to other living organisms as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fingerprinting 3abiometry 3acomputer software 3aforensic sciences 3agenetic testing 3ahumans 3anucleotides 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 0aDigitization 0aBinary format 0aGenetic Identification number (GIN) 0aGraphics 0a72-Plex SNP panel1 aSakhabutdinova, Assol R.1 aSlominsky, Petr A.1 aAminev, Farit G.1 aChemeris, Alexey V.0 tForensic science international.g2020 Dec., v. 317 p.110520-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1105203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011100156300001800267520114800285592002801433650001901461650002101480650002801501650003601529650002301565650001701588650002601605650002001631650000901651650001701660650001801677650000701695650001301702650002401715700001501739700001401754700001301768700001601781773014301797856007401940852000902014655001202023IND60670656320221119142823.0191002e20130911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067065632DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb20500b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiujun10aProtein-loaded comb-shape copolymer-based pH-responsive nanoparticles to improve the stability of proteins  ap. 4992-5002.  aExtensive studies have shown that poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and its derivatives are excellent biomaterials for drug delivery systems. However, their use in protein delivery is limited due to their harsh internal pH environment. In this study, we designed an amphiphilic comb-shaped copolymer, lactobionic acid-poly(ethylene oxide)-ε-polylysine-g-PLGA (LPEP), for protein delivery. Depending on the ratio of PLGA contents, the internal pH of LPEP nanoparticles (NPs) was adjustable, which was verified by a quantitative ratiometric method. The protein delivery system was able to meet the needs of the appropriate pH microclimate for the integrity of proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the protein released from LPEP NPs was more stable than that released from PLGA NPs. In addition, cytotoxicity studies involving HL-7702 cells and acute toxicity experiments in Kunming mice showed that the NPs had good biocompatibility. In vivo experiments showed the circulation time and tissue distribution of LPEP NPs. Taken together, our results suggest that the LPEP NP system is a promising candidate for protein delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3ain vivo studies 3amice 3amicroclimate 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aproteins 3atissue distribution1 aZhou, Ping1 aYang, Rui1 aYang, De1 aZhang, Ning0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2013 Sept. 11, v. 1, no. 38 p.4992-5002dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb20500b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00837naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245003600136300001400172520015200186592002800338650001400366650002300380650003200403650001700435650002100452773010100473852000900574655001200583IND60612064020221122041821.0180904e197307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061206402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGOLDSMITH, GRACE A.10aFor A National Nutrition Policy  ap. 32-35.  aWith severe malnutrition prevalent among various segments of the American population, it is necessary to implement a national program of nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3adisease prevalence 3afood and nutrition programs 3amalnutrition 3anutrition policy0 tNutrition today.g1973 , v. 8, no. 4 p.32-35dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:13904x1538-98397nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245006400215300001600279520188400295592002802179650002202207650002002229650001202249650001102261650001702272650002002289650002002309650001502329650001102344650001702355650001002372650000902382650001402391650001102405650001402416650001902430650002002449650002702469650001402496650001202510650001802522650001902540650000902559651001002568653002602578653002702604653001702631653001402648653001202662653001902674700002502693773011902718856008802837852000902925655001202934IND60613114120221121065825.0190628e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061311412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpagnoli, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9735-533910aBiogeochemistry and sedimentology of Lago di Lesina (Italy)  ap. 868-883.  aThe Lago di Lesina (Lesina Lake, southeastern Italy) is a coastal pond located on an alluvial plain to the north of Gargano Promontory. The aim of this work was to study the depositional and hydrological processes, the benthic environment and the heavy metal sediments pollution of Lesina Lake. The study was carried out by Redox potential, water content, grain-size, mineralogical and biogeochemical analyses in surface sediments collected from 100 sampling stations in the coastal pond bottom. The results showed a predominance of three types of bottom pelitic sediments of different origins and compositions: siliciclastic, carbonatic, and organic. Siliciclastic sediments, which were found especially in the western basin and in the northwestern sector of the central basin, are due to inputs from Acquarotta Canal, some intermittent western streams, and deflation by northerly winds of the sandy barrier that separates the lake from the sea. Carbonate sediments are carried by streams and canals draining the carbonate rocks of the Gargano Mountains and entering the lake from its eastern and southeastern border, these sediments are predominant in the eastern basin and in the southeastern sector of the central basin. Organic matter is abundant throughout the whole lake; it is due to the high productivity of the Lago di Lesina waters that are rich of nutrients for inputs of waters draining the surrounding intensively cultivated agricultural areas. The finer bottom sediments of the lake tend to be removed from the shallower bottoms between the central and eastern sub-basins and near the borders to be deposited in the central portion of the central and western sub-basins. Heavy metal sediment pollution due to anthropic inputs is limited and consists of As, Pb, Cu, and Ni in the western basin, Cu, Zn, and Ni in the eastern basin, and Pb along the northern border.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aalluvial plains 3aarsenic 3abasins 3abenthic zone 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbonate rocks 3acarbonates 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alakes 3alead 3amountains 3anickel 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aredox potential 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3astreams 3awater content 3awind direction 3azinc 3aItaly 0aBiogeochemical facies 0aDepositional processes 0aHydrodynamic 0aPollution 0aWetland 0aLago di Lesina1 aAndresini, Annamaria0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 643 p.868-883dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024003100128040001800159100002400177245008900201300001600290520147700306592002801783596009901811650003301910650002101943650002601964650002701990650002402017650001802041650001002059650001102069650001802080650002202098650001402120651001802134653003002152653001102182653002202193653001402215700002102229773012102250856007802371852000902449655001202458IND60673717720221118012922.0191019e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067371772DNAL7 a10.1093/nutrit/nux0672chorus7 a10.1093/nutrit/nux0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanard, Katherine M10aEffects of dietary RRR α-tocopherol vs all-racemic α-tocopherol on health outcomes  ap. 141-153.  aOf the 8 vitamin E analogues, RRR α-tocopherol likely has the greatest effect on health outcomes. Two sources of α-tocopherol, naturally sourced RRR α-tocopherol and synthetic all-racemic α-tocopherol, are commonly consumed from foods and dietary supplements in the United States. A 2016 US Food and Drug Administration ruling substantially changed the RRR to all-racemic α-tocopherol ratio of biopotency from 1.36:1 to 2:1 for food-labeling purposes, but the correct ratio is still under debate in the literature. Few studies have directly compared the 2 α-tocopherol sources, and existing studies do not compare the efficacy of either source for preventing or treating disease in humans. To help close this gap, this review evaluates studies that investigated the effects of either RRR α-tocopherol or all-racemic α-tocopherol on health outcomes, and compares the overall findings. α-Tocopherol has been used to prevent and/or treat cancer and diseases of the central nervous system, the immune system, and the cardiovascular system, so these diseases are the focus of the review. No firm conclusions about the relative effects of the α-tocopherol sources on health outcomes can be made. Changes to α-tocopherol–relevant policies have proceeded without adequate scientific support. Additional research is needed to assemble the pieces of the α-tocopherol puzzle and to determine the RRR to all-racemic α-tocopherol ratio of biopotency for health outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data  aILLU-698–915cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aalpha-tocopherol 3acardiovascular system 3acentral nervous system 3adietary supplements 3afood labeling 3afoods 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3aissues and policy 3aneoplasms 3aUnited States 0aall-racemic α-tocopherol 0ahealth 0aRRR α-tocopherol 0avitamin E1 aErdman, John W.,0 tNutrition reviews.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 76, no. 3 p.141-153dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44763x1753-48877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nux0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245016400182300001400346520181800360592002802178650001002206650001902216650001602235650002202251650001502273650001402288650001402302650001002316650001702326650002802343650001002371653002102381653002002402653001502422653002302437653001802460653002802478700002102506700005602527700001802583773020402601856008702805852000902892655001202901IND60600646020221118094114.0180703e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060064602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Rahman, Elfatih M.10aDetecting Sirex noctilio grey-attacked and lightning-struck pine trees using airborne hyperspectral data, random forest and support vector machines classifiers  ap. 48-59.  aThe visual progression of sirex (Sirex noctilio) infestation symptoms has been categorized into three distinct infestation phases, namely the green, red and grey stages. The grey stage is the final stage which leads to almost complete defoliation resulting in dead standing trees or snags. Dead standing pine trees however, could also be due to the lightning damage. Hence, the objective of the present study was to distinguish amongst healthy, sirex grey-attacked and lightning-damaged pine trees using AISA Eagle hyperspectral data, random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers. Our study also presents an opportunity to look at the possibility of separating amongst the previously mentioned pine trees damage classes and other landscape classes on the study area. The results of the present study revealed the robustness of the two machine learning classifiers with an overall accuracy of 74.50% (total disagreement=26%) for RF and 73.50% (total disagreement=27%) for SVM using all the remaining AISA Eagle spectral bands after removing the noisy ones. When the most useful spectral bands as measured by RF were exploited, the overall accuracy was considerably improved; 78% (total disagreement=22%) for RF and 76.50% (total disagreement=24%) for SVM. There was no significant difference between the performances of the two classifiers as demonstrated by the results of McNemar’s test (chi-squared; χ²=0.14, and 0.03 when all the remaining ASIA Eagle wavebands, after removing the noisy ones and the most important wavebands were used, respectively). This study concludes that AISA Eagle data classified using RF and SVM algorithms provide relatively accurate information that is important to the forest industry for making informed decision regarding pine plantations health protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aSirex noctilio 3adefoliation 3aforest industries 3alandscapes 3alightning 3aprotocols 3asnags 3astorm damage 3asupport vector machines 3atrees 0aSirex grey stage 0aLighting damage 0aPinus spp. 0aHyperspectral data 0aRandom forest 0aSupport vector machines1 aMutanga, Onisimo1 aAdam, Elhadi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7165-64861 aIsmail, Riyad0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2014 Feb., v. 88 p.48-59dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The rheological behavior is taken into account by combining the regularized Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou model with the model of He et al. [1]. The partial differential equations governing fluid flow and heat transfer are discretized using the Finite Volume Method. The numerical experiments are carried out for a range of parameter values, namely, Rayleigh number 10³–10⁶, Herschel-Bulkley number 0–20, Prandtl number 10–1000, power law index 0.4–1.0 and nanoparticle solid volume fraction 0.0–0.09. The numerical results are presented in terms of streamlines, isotherms, unyielded plugs, velocity profiles and average Nusselt number. It is found that, all the problem parameters, except for the Prandtl number, have a significant effect on both the hydrodynamic and the thermal fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3adifferential equation 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3apowders 3arheological properties 0aCarbopol 0aHerschel-Bulkley 0aNanofluid 0aHeat transfer 0aUnyielded plug1 aBenkahla, Youb Khaled1 aBerabou, Welid1 aBoudiaf, Ahlem0 tPowder technology.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 311 p.101-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245006400167300001400231520105700245592002801302650001901330650002601349650001101375650001301386650001901399653002101418653002901439653003301468653001801501700002001519700002201539700001801561700002201579700002401601700002101625700001501646773011901661856007701780852000901857655001201866IND60673717820221118013054.0191019e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067371782DNAL7 a10.1093/nutrit/nux0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBascuñán, Karla A14aThe 5 Ws of a gluten challenge for gluten-related disorders  ap. 79-87.  aGluten-related disorders (GRDs) are gradually emerging as epidemiologically relevant diseases, with a global prevalence estimated to be approximately 5% in the population. Conditions related to gluten ingestion include celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA), and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Although mediated by different pathogenic pathways, these 3 conditions share similar clinical manifestations and can present a difficult differential diagnosis. The gluten challenge (GC) is an important diagnostic tool for GRDs, but there is great variability in regards to deciding which patients should be challenged, what amount of gluten should be used, what the GC duration should be, when and where the GC should occur, and, sometimes, why to conduct a GC. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the desirable characteristics of GCs in the 3 main GRDs following a 5 Ws approach—that is, the 5 main journalistic questions: who, what, when, where, why. The answers will help to determine the correct use of the GC in diagnosing GRDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceliac disease 3adiagnostic techniques 3agluten 3apatients 3aprotein intake 0agluten challenge 0agluten-related disorders 0anonceliac gluten sensitivity 0awheat allergy1 aRoncoroni, Leda1 aBranchi, Federica1 aDoneda, Luisa1 aScricciolo, Alice1 aFerretti, Francesca1 aAraya, Magdalena1 aElli, Luca0 tNutrition reviews.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 76, no. 2 p.79-87dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44763x1753-48877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nux0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245019600159300001800355520131200373592002801685650002501713650001501738650001601753650002601769650000901795650001301804650002201817650001101839650000901850650001401859650001301873700002601886700002401912700002201936700002601958700002401984700002102008700002802029700002202057700002202079700002202101700002102123773011902144856007502263852000902338655001202347IND60534160120221117021824.0160802e20140417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053416012DNAL7 a10.1021/ef50024522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKenna, Amy M.10aUnprecedented Ultrahigh Resolution FT-ICR Mass Spectrometry and Parts-Per-Billion Mass Accuracy Enable Direct Characterization of Nickel and Vanadyl Porphyrins in Petroleum from Natural Seeps  ap. 2454-2464.  aThe most abundant and problematic metal compounds in crude oil exist as organic complexes of vanadium and nickel in porphyrin structures derived from biological molecules (chlorophyll and heme), the first petroleum biomarkers discovered by Alfred Treibs in the early 1930s.1 Detailed characterization of the type and structure of porphyrins is critical for development of petroleum upgrading processes, but also to link crude oil to source rock conditions. Because petroporphyrins concentrate in heavy oils, direct characterization challenges routine analytical techniques due to the increased complexity associated with heavy crudes. Atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) provides ultrahigh resolving power (m/Δm₅₀% > 1 000 000 at m/z 500) and subppm mass error (<50 ppb) to identify nickel porphyrin isotopes for unambiguous elemental composition assignment. We also report the first simultaneous identification and categorization of both vanadyl and nickel porphyrins in the same sample, without prior sample preparation. More than 85 000 mass spectral peaks are resolved and identified in a single mass spectrum, and represent the most extensive molecular deconvolution of an organic mixture characterized to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiomarkers 3achlorophyll 3aelemental composition 3aheme 3aisotopes 3amass spectrometry 3anickel 3aoils 3apetroleum 3avanadium1 aWilliams, Jeffrey T.,1 aPutman, Jonathan

Here we note that strong electric fields are able to disrupt the surface boundary layer of inert air on the surface of materials, promoting higher rates of heat transport. We also note that most biological tissues contain ferromagnetic materials, both biologically precipitated magnetite (Fe3O4) as well as environmental contaminants that get accidentally incorporated into living systems. Although present at trace levels, the number density of these particulates is high, and they have extraordinarily strong interactions with weak, low-frequency magnetic fields of the sort involved in claims of electromagnetic cryopreservation. Magnetically-induced mechanical oscillation of these particles provides a plausible mechanism for the disruption of ice-crystal nucleation in supercooled water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acryopreservation 3aelectric field 3afrequency 3aheat transfer 3aice 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetite 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollution 3atissues1 aKirschvink, Joseph L.0 tCryobiology.g2014 Apr., v. 68, no. 2 p.163-165dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245015200162300001600314500002400330520172400354650001802078650002902096650002602125650002402151650002702175650002402202650002402226650001402250650002402264653001102288700001402299773011702313852000902430856007602439856008602515930003302601945001302634946001302647655001202660IND2207843920221116150326.0001117e200008  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220784392DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-29.4.6712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkemoto, T.12aA new linearized formula for the law of total effective temperature and the evaluation of line-fitting methods with both variables subject to error  ap. 671-682.  aIncludes references  aIn the quantitative analysis of experimental data regarding temperature-dependent development, the so-called law of total effective temperature is sometimes expressed in the linearized equation 1:1/D = -(t/k) + (1/k)T.D indicates the duration of development; T, temperature; t, the estimated developmental zero temperature; and k, the effective cumulative temperature. The method of fitting usually involves the regression of y = 1/D on x = T. Although the degree of fitting of equation 1 to data within optimum temperature ranges is fairly satisfactory, we have in the current study addressed three problems regarding the use of equation 1 and methods of fitting involving the regression of y on x. First, we found that the detection of optimum temperature ranges is frequently difficult with equation 1. Second, in applying the method of regression of y on x with equation 1, the weights of the data points are disproportionate between those in the upper and lower parts of the line and they are not homogeneous along the temperature axis. The lower the temperature, the more disproportionate weight is burdened and the less weight is loaded. Third, in most of the data, errors in the x-variable are ignored. The second and third problems would in most cases result in a reduction in the slope of the line, a smaller t, and a larger k. Therefore, we proposed a new linearized formula: (DT) = k + tD. We further propose the use of the reduced major axis, obtained as the solution of the functional model among bivariate errors-in-variables models, in the method of fitting to data. We demonstrated that the majority of the problems raised above could be unraveled under this new approach based on statistical analysis. 3aAedes aegypti 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3abiological development 3aambient temperature 3amathematical models 3aequations 3aregression analysis 0aerrors1 aTakai, K.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2000 Aug., v. 29, no. 4 p.671-682dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-29.4.6713Available from publisher's Web site  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02464naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245002400173300001200197520140700209592002801616650001501644650001301659650002401672650000901696650001601705650001101721650000901732650002401741650001101765650001401776650001701790650000901807650001601816650002301832651001401855773010201869856008601971852000902057655001202066IND60630888520221122041907.0190214e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063088852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBischof, John C.10aA01 Plenary Lecture  ap. 184.  aCryosurgery is evolving from a focal therapy for cancer to one that can also treat cardiovascular and neural targets. For example, new focal therapeutic targets include the pulmonary vein (atrial fibrillation), arteries (renal denervation) and nerves (pain and plantar fasciitis). For cryosurgery to successfully compete with heat or other ablative technologies in these new targets, it will be necessary to carefully assess thermal response in these targets and adjacent tissues that can sustain collateral injury. Further, it will be necessary to understand the mechanism of action of each of the ablative technologies. This presents new challenges as the measurement and modeling of temperature in these thin anisotropic biological structures during thermal excursions is not well understood. Further, it begs the question of whether heat, cold, or other energy based technology is best suited to each of these targets to achieve localized destruction without collateral injury. In this talk, I will describe ongoing work in our lab and with our collaborators at UC Berkeley and Minnesota to measure thermal properties at mm and sub mm length scales. Further, I will highlight some preliminary data that hints at differences in mechanisms of action between cryo, heat and other energy based technologies that may lead to a better understanding and therefore application in each of these new targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aarteries 3aatrial fibrillation 3acold 3acryosurgery 3aenergy 3aheat 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3anerve tissue 3apain 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3aMinnesota0 tCryobiology.g2014 Aug., v. 69, no. 1 p.184-184dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013600159300001600295500001900311520176100330592002802091650002202119650001602141650002402157650001302181650001702194650001302211650001202224650001302236650000902249700002302258700001802281700002002299700002202319700002402341700002202365700002202387700002302409773015802432856007302590852000902663655001202672IND60741378220221122051424.0210612e20210611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074137822DNAL7 a10.1638/2020-01332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Jayne S.12aA comparison of a single-dart versus staged two-dart anesthesia induction protocol in przewalski's horses (equus ferus przewalskii)  ap. 453-459.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrzewalski's horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) are an endangered equid species. Anesthesia administered by remote delivery is often needed to provide medical care. Behavioral and physiologic parameters were prospectively compared in 14 horses (8 females and 6 males, 3–18 yr) after a single-dart or staged two-dart anesthesia induction protocol with intramuscular medetomidine (0.06 mg/kg), butorphanol (0.05 mg/kg), thiafentanil (0.02 mg/kg), and ketamine (1 mg/kg). Seven horses were randomly assigned to receive all drugs in a single dart, and the other seven to receive medetomidine and butorphanol 10 min prior to thiafentanil and ketamine in a second dart. Induction and recovery quality were scored on a scale from 1 to 5 (worst to best), and video recordings were assessed for frequency of specific behaviors. Need for supplemental propofol was recorded. Median induction score was significantly better (P = 0.01) after two darts (4/5) compared to a single dart (3/5). Degree of muscle fasciculation (undesirable) during induction was significantly lower (P= 0.006) with the two-dart protocol. During the transition to recumbency, 71% versus 14% of horses transitioned headfirst (undesirable) after a single dart versus two darts, respectively (P= 0.07). Supplemental propofol administration was necessary in 43% of horses after two darts and in 100% of horses after a single dart (P= 0.10) to facilitate intubation and reach a working depth of anesthesia. Physiologic and recovery parameters were not significantly different between groups. Improved induction quality was observed clinically using a staged two-dart versus a single-dart protocol and should be considered when anesthetizing captive Przewalski's horses using this drug combination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquus przewalskii 3abutorphanol 3adepth of anesthesia 3aketamine 3amedetomidine 3amedicine 3amuscles 3awildlife 3azoos1 aMama, Khursheed R.1 aRao, Sangeeta1 aSadler, Ryan A.1 aMarinkovich, Matt1 aClancy, Meredith M.1 aHoward, Lauren L.1 aLamberski, Nadine1 aKinney, Matthew E.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2021 June 11, v. 52, no. 2 p.453-459dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2020-01333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008000172300001600252520119100268592002801459650002901487650001301516650001901529650001801548650002001566650001501586650001101601650001401612653002001626653002301646653002601669653001801695653001801713700001101731773011901742856008801861852000901949655001201958IND60613114620221120151259.0190628e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061311462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiaodong10aNumerical and experimental study on noise reduction of concrete LRT bridges  ap. 208-224.  aRolling noise and structure-borne noise radiating from the bridge are two major sources of noise in light rapid transit (LRT) bridges. To control the noise radiation from LRT bridges, an efficient numerical method for noise prediction is needed. In this study, a combined three-dimensional dynamic model and 2.5-dimensional acoustic model were used to investigate noise reduction in a rail and in a U-shaped girder bridge. The effects of three noise mitigation measures on noise control were then compared: installation of a noise barrier, use of a rail pad with a lower stiffness, and use of a floating ladder track. The corresponding noise reduction was investigated using the numerical method. A field test was conducted to validate the noise reduction effects. It was found that the noise barrier was more effective in reducing the rail noise, and the soft rail pad is more effective to control the bridge noise. The floating ladder track can significantly reduce bridge vibration, but the excessive vibration of the ladder track itself became another major noise source. The findings should guide the selection of appropriate mitigation measures for noise reduction in LRT bridges.  aPublisher supplied data 3abridges (infrastructure) 3aconcrete 3adynamic models 3anoise control 3anoise pollution 3aprediction 3asounds 3avibration 0aNoise reduction 0aExperimental study 0aFloating ladder track 0aNoise barrier 0aSoft rail pad1 aLi, Qi0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 643 p.208-224dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.1793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015500172520158400327592002801911650001401939650001001953650002201963650002201985650000902007650002002016650001302036653001202049653001402061653003302075653001502108653002102123700001902144700005502163700001802218773009102236856009002327852000902417655001202426IND60770020320221121060353.0220509e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077002032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1342402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Huiwang10aOxalate regulate the redox cycle of iron in heterogeneous UV-Fenton system with Fe3O4 nanoparticles as catalyst: Critical role of homogeneous reaction  aThe redox cycle of iron is a well-known rate-determining step for hydroxyl radical generation in photo-Fenton system. In this study, oxalate was employed as regulator to enhance the degradation of Orange II in Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles (NPs)-catalyzed heterogeneous UV-Fenton system. Results showed that the oxalate could interact with the surface ≡Feᴵᴵᴵ species of catalyst, which weakened the bond of ≡Feᴵᴵᴵ–O and promoted the leaching of iron ions. Then the redox cycle of iron and generation of HO· would be accelerated via the homogeneous UV-Fenton reaction. The degradation rate constant of Orange II reached 0.220 min⁻¹ when additional oxalate concentration was 0.4 mM, which was 2.5 times as high as that without oxalate in heterogeneous UV-Fenton system. In this case, the removal efficiencies of color and TOC were 99.3% and 92.0% after 30 and 120 min treatment, respectively. In addition, based on the results of XRD and XPS characterization, it could be deduced that the crystal structure and elemental configuration of Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles could be maintained after reaction. Besides, the results of FTIR and magnetization characterization indicated that the C₂O₄²⁻ on surface of catalyst could be degraded and the catalyst could be easily separated from aqueous by applying an external magnetic field. The Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles showed high catalytic stability and reusability under the regulation of oxalate due to the fact that the leached iron ions could be re-adsorbed on the catalyst after treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acolor 3acrystal structure 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3amagnetic fields 3aoxalates 0aOxalate 0aUV-Fenton 0aFe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles 0aIron redox 0aHydroxyl radical1 aMiao, Xiaozeng1 aZhu, Jianxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9002-44571 aChen, Jianxin0 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 298 p.134240-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1342403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245012200161300001800283520151600301592002801817596019501845596008302040596012702123650001102250650001602261650001502277650001202292653002502304653002502329653002302354653002302377653001902400700001602419700001702435700002202452700001802474773011502492856008002607852000902687655001202696IND60750354020221118051509.0210913e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075035402DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X209194082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei10aDesign of total water networks of multiple properties based on operator potential concepts and an iterative procedure  ap. 1130-1146.  aThe design of property-based total water networks by using the concepts of operator potential is investigated with an iterative approach. The precedence order of demands is identified with the operator potential values of demands. The internal sources to be regenerated are selected based on the values of operator potential of sources. A linear programming approach is used to determine the allocation of sources to demands. With the proposed method, the networks which meet both the requirements of demands and environmental regulations can be obtained. Two examples are studied to illustrate the proposed method. It is shown that the results obtained by this work are comparable to that obtained by mathematical programming method in the literature. For Example 1, flowrate of regenerated stream is reduced 28.5% compared to that in the literature results with almost the same freshwater consumption. In addition, the number of interconnections for this work is smaller than that of literature, which means that the design structure of this work is simpler. For Example 2, freshwater consumption is reduced by 4.29% with almost the same regeneration flowrate. However, the number of interconnections for this work is 24, which is higher than 23, that is the value of the literature result. Compared to graphical methods, the method proposed in this paper can handle the networks with more than three properties. Compared to mathematical programming methods, the proposed method has clear engineering meaning.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000456cCzech Republic Operational Programme Research and Development, Education, Priority 1: Strengthening capacity for quality research has been acknowledged  aGrant No. ZD2019028cScience Research Foundation of Hebei Education Department  aGrant No. B2017202073cNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Provincedhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003787 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3afreshwater 3astreams 0aTotal water networks 0aproperty integration 0aoperator potential 0alinear programming 0aprocess design1 aLi, Ai-Hong1 aJia, Xue-Xiu1 aKlemeš, Jiří J1 aLiu, Zhi-Yong0 tEnergy & environment.g2021 Sept., v. 32, no. 6 p.1130-1146dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X209194083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011200163300001600275520152800291592002801819650001301847650003101860650001301891650001001904650001701914650001901931650001201950650001101962653001901973653003301992653003502025653002302060700002002083773010202103856008402205852000902289655001202298IND60609654820221118004158.0180823e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060965482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2017.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Di10aMechanism of particle build-up on gas-solid fluidization column wall due to electrostatic charge generation  ap. 166-170.  aParticle build-up on gas-solid fluidization column wall due to electrostatic charging causes significant operational challenges including reactor shutdown in industrial processes such as gas-phase ethylene polymerization to produce polyethylene. It is well acknowledged that in fluidization process electrostatic charges are generated as a result of continuous particle-particle and particle-vessel wall contacts. However, the mechanism of charged particle attraction towards the fluidization column wall and their adhesion has received minimal attention. This work proposes a mechanism for particle build-up on the column wall by experimentally investigating the fouled particles charge distribution using a charged particle separator apparatus. The experiments were carried with two types of linear low-density polyethylene resins in a pressurized pilot-scale gas-solid fluidization system. Experimental results showed that the polyethylene layer built-up on the column wall contained both positively and negatively charged particles. A mechanism was proposed indicating that charged particle migration towards the metallic column wall was due to the image and electrostatic forces. The image forces were attributed to the particle-wall contacts while the electrostatic forces were between the charged particles fouled on the column wall and those oppositely charged within the bulk of the bed.

These methods included a participatory urban appraisal, focus group discussions with eight butchers’ associations, in depth discussions with six key informants, a questionnaire study of 269 meat sellers and a cross-sectional survey of meat quality (200 samples from ten associations). We found that slaughter, processing and sale of beef meat take place under unhygienic conditions. The activities involve both men and women, with some task differentiation by gender. Meat sold by association members is of unacceptable quality. However, some groups have consistently better quality meat and this is positively correlated with the proportion of women members. Women also have significantly better food safety practice than men, though there was no significant difference in their knowledge of and attitude towards food safety. Most meat sellers (85 %) reported being ill in the last 2 weeks and 47 % reported experiencing gastrointestinal illness. Eating beef, eating chicken, eating offal, consuming one’s own products and belonging to a group with poor quality of meat were all strong and significant predictors of self-reported gastrointestinal illness. We include that gender and group membership influence meat quality and self-reported gastrointestinal illness and that butchers’ associations are promising entry points for interventions to improve food safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abeef 3abutchering 3achickens 3acorrelation 3afocus groups 3afood safety 3agender 3aingestion 3amarkets 3ameat quality 3amen 3aquestionnaires 3asales 3aslaughter 3asocioeconomic factors 3asurveys 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFocus Groups 2aFood Handlingxstandards 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Safety 2aGastrointestinal Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMeatxmicrobiologyxstandards. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSelf Report 2aSex Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aUrban Health 3aNigeria 0aNigeriaxepidemiology.1 aOlowoye, Janice1 aDipeolu, Morenike1 aOdebode, Stella1 aRandolph, Thomas0 tTropical animal health and production.g2012 Sept., v. 44, no.

The urban European cities Rome, Madrid, Paris, London, Berlin, Warsaw, Stockholm, and Oslo were selected. Using the EEA AirBase air quality database, time series data for the major atmospheric pollutants (CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, PM₁₀, and PM₂.₅) were recovered for each city, for most recent years available. Daily averages, maximum hourly values and maximum 8-h averages were calculated for each pollutant. The air quality indices selected were BelAQI, DAQx, DAQI, AtmoIndex, AQIH, and CAQI. The daily value of each air quality indices and the corresponding dominant atmospheric pollutant were determined for each city. A two-stage normalization procedure was applied on air quality indices in a 0–1 range, to allow their direct comparison without altering their structure. All air quality indices exhibited air quality rates over 64% for all cities, thus below the European Union air quality standard. The dominant pollutant was NO₂ for both BelAQI and DAQx; O₃ for both DAQI and AQIH (with an exception for Warsaw where SO₂ was the dominant pollutant). For CAQI, NO₂ prevails in Berlin, London, Warsaw, Stockholm, and Oslo, while O₃ prevails in Rome, Madrid, and Paris. The dominant pollutant for AtmoIndex was NO₂ in Berlin, Warsaw, and Stockholm; O₃ in Madrid, Paris, London, and Oslo; PM₁₀ in Rome. A very strong positive statistical correlation (p < 0.01) was found for all cities between BelAQI and CAQI, and also between CAQI and DAQx. A strong positive statistical correlation (p < 0.01) was found for all cities between BelAQI and DAQx. A moderate positive correlation was shown between the following pairs of indices: AtmoIndex-DAQI, AtmoIndex-AQIH, DAQI-AQIH, BelAQI-AQIH, and AQIH-CAQI. On the contrary, a weak positive correlation was noticed between the following pairs of indices: BelAQI-DAQI, BelAQI-AtmoIndex, DAQX-DAQI, DAQx-AQIH, DAQI-CAQI, and CAQI-AtmoIndex. After the normalization process that enables the direct comparison of the air quality indices, the main results are the BelAQI presents the largest normalized median (range 0.33–0.5) implying the worst air quality compared to the other air quality indices. The CAQI has a median value of 0.33, the DAQx of 0.25, while the AtmoIndex a median value range of 0.125–0.375, and the DAQI and AQIH of 0.165–0.33. Concluding, the AQIH can be proposed as a common European Union air quality index because: firstly, its calculation comprises all significant atmospheric pollutants including PM₂.₅, thereby being harmonized with the Directive 2008/50/EC, and, secondly, AQIH does not display extremely low or high (normalized) values compared to the other air quality indices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aair quality 3acomparative study 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3apollutants 3atime series analysis 0aair pollution 0aair quality indices 0asustainable environment1 aKarayannis, Vayos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7713-597X1 aMoustakas, Konstantinos0 tEnergy & environment.g2021 Sept., v. 32, no. 6 p.959-980dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X209218463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01323naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008000154300001800234520035400252592002800606650001800634650002400652650001800676650001700694650002100711650000900732650002400741700001200765700001500777773012200792856007400914852000900988655001200997IND60667097220221120141413.0190919e20150106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066709722DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra13576h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Jun10aCarbon dots as fluorescent off–on nanosensors for ascorbic acid detection  ap. 8533-8536.  aAn “off–on” approach for the detection of ascorbic acid using carbon dots as a fluorescent probe is presented, which is based on the fluorescence recovery of the quenched C-dots/Fe³⁺ complex when ascorbic acid is introduced.

Increased research focus has been placed on the improved allelochemical extraction methods of submerged plants because of their cost-utility relationships. In this study, the growth inhibition effect of Vallisneria extract on Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) cells through the combination of enzyme and ultrasonic-assisted extraction method was analyzed. By establishing a co-cultivation experiment, the growth indicators, photosynthetic system, and oxidative stress system of M. aeruginosa were determined. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, as well as the catalase (CAT) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of algal cells were found to have increased significantly after co-cultivation, which indicated that the Vallisneria ultrasonic-cellulase extract could induce oxidative stress in Microcystis aeruginosa cells. The Vallisneria extract could promote at low concentrations and inhibit at high concentrations on the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa. The effective suppression of growth of algae cells with the extract was observed at 5 g/L (fresh weight). The results showed that the Vallisneria ultrasonic-cellulase extract had a significant inhibitory effect on M. aeruginosa, making the effective ingredients a useful reference for algae inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aVallisneria 3aallelopathy 3acatalase 3acoculture 3agrowth retardation 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3apoisonous algae 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asustainable technology 0aAllelochemicals 0aM.aeruginosa 0aSubmerged plants 0aVallisneria 0aUltrasonic-cellulase extraction 0aOxidative stress1 aZhao, Wenjing1 aChen, Jiaqi1 aZhou, Yuhang0 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 298 p.134245-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1342453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245019000163300001400353520209900367592002802466650000802494650001302502650001702515650001202532650001002544650002302554650001202577650000902589650001102598650001402609650001902623650002502642650001202667650001802679650001302697700002002710700002202730700002102752700002402773700002402797700002202821700001802843773011502861856007302976852000903049655001203058IND60132599320221121005907.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013259932DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.124012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJustiniano, Rebecca10aTesting diversification models of endemic Philippine forest mice (Apomys) with nuclear phylogenies across elevational gradients reveals repeated colonization of isolated mountain ranges  ap. 51-64.  aAIM: Our aims were to document the extent of diversification in an endemic clade of small mammals (Apomys, subgenus Megapomys) on a large oceanic island and to test whether speciation occurred primarily (1) along isolated elevational gradients or (2) among montane areas, as would be expected if diversification were driven by glacial cycles. LOCATION: The Philippine archipelago, particularly Luzon Island and two smaller adjacent islands (Mindoro and Lubang). METHODS: We analysed newly generated nuclear DNA sequences from five unlinked genes and mitochondrial cytochrome b using concatenation (likelihood and Bayesian) and coalescent‐based methods to estimate the species tree for all 13 species. We tested a priori models of speciation using both topological constraints and reconstructed elevational ranges of ancestors. RESULTS: All individual gene trees recovered at least four of the morphologically defined Megapomys species as monophyletic, while the concatenated approaches recovered all 13 species as monophyletic. Each species was confined to a single mountain range or off‐shore island. Most mountain ranges had two species, but these species pairs usually were not sisters. Megapomys originated at medium to high elevation followed by three transitions into lower elevations and possibly one to high elevation. Both a priori models of speciation (elevational gradient and glacial cycle) were rejected by topology tests. The speciation rate was approximately constant through time. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear sequence data strongly corroborated the species status of recently described taxa. A well‐supported phylogeny showed that Megapomys diversified by splitting into a predominantly high‐elevation clade and an entirely low‐elevation clade. Neither adaptation along elevational gradients on single mountain ranges nor vicariance of high‐elevation species following glacial cycle‐induced dispersals fitted the data. Rather, the most likely process explaining species distributions is repeated colonization of isolated mountain ranges by distantly related species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aancestry 3acytochrome b 3aforests 3agenes 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3amice 3amodels 3amonophyly 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3asisters 3asmall mammals 3atopology1 aSchenk, John J.1 aBalete, Danilo S.1 aRickart, Eric A.1 aEsselstyn, Jacob A.1 aHeaney, Lawrence R.1 aSteppan, Scott J.1 aRiddle, Brett0 tJournal of biogeography.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.51-64dBlackwell Scientific Publications.x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.124013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245015100205300001600356506007600372520125000448592002801698596008101726506003701807650001501844650001001859650002601869650001801895650001401913650002401927650002401951650001401975650001501989650001202004650002802016650001502044653001902059653002902078653002102107700002802128700001902156700002402175773012002199856007702319852000902396655001202405IND60673718520221207120737.0191019e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067371852DNAL7 a10.1093/nutrit/nux0762doi7 aPMC58928622pmcid7 a295623682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristensen, A J10aUse of computational modeling combined with advanced visualization to develop strategies for the design of crop ideotypes to address food security  ap. 332-347.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSustainable crop production is a contributing factor to current and future food security. Innovative technologies are needed to design strategies that will achieve higher crop yields on less land and with fewer resources. Computational modeling coupled with advanced scientific visualization enables researchers to explore and interact with complex agriculture, nutrition, and climate data to predict how crops will respond to untested environments. These virtual observations and predictions can direct the development of crop ideotypes designed to meet future yield and nutritional demands. This review surveys modeling strategies for the development of crop ideotypes and scientific visualization technologies that have led to discoveries in “big data” analysis. Combined modeling and visualization approaches have been used to realistically simulate crops and to guide selection that immediately enhances crop quantity and quality under challenging environmental conditions. This survey of current and developing technologies indicates that integrative modeling and advanced scientific visualization may help overcome challenges in agriculture and nutrition data as large-scale and multidimensional data become available in these fields.  aPublisher supplied data  aACI-1445176cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000010 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3afood security 3aideotypes 3amathematical models 3ameteorological data 3anutrition 3aprediction 3asurveys 3asustainable agriculture 3atechnology 0aclimate change 0ascientific visualization 0a3D crop modeling1 aSrinivasan, Venkatraman1 aHart, John C.,1 aMarshall-Colon, Amy0 tNutrition reviews.g2018 May 01, v. 76, no. 5 p.332-347dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44763x1753-48877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nux0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003200139245012600171300001800297520129800315592002801613650001201641650001201653650001301665650001001678650001701688650002101705650001301726650001701739650001001756650002201766650001301788700002601801773010401827856007501931852000902006655001202015IND60534160720221117022330.0160802e20140417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053416072DNAL7 a10.1021/ef500317a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza-Santos, Marcio L. de,10aNew Strategy of Fuel-Slurry Integrated Gasifier/Gas Turbine (FSIG/GT) Alternative for Power Generation Applied to Biomass  ap. 2697-2707.  aThe new strategy of the fuel-slurry integrated gasifier/gas turbine (FSIG/GT) concept for thermoelectric power generation is applied to the case of sugar cane bagasse (SCB). The FSIG/GT process allows fuel feeding to a power unit based on gasification using commercially available slurry pumps, thus avoiding the usual sequential lock-hoppers, also known as cascade feeding systems. It also dispenses with the need of pure oxygensometimes combined with hydrocarbonsto promote ignition of particles in the injected slurry. The fuel slurry is prepared to high dry-solid content and pumped into a dryer, from which the solid particles are fed into the gasifier. Because both units operate under similar pressures, simple rotary valves and Archimedes’ screws might carry the secondary feeding. The gas is cleaned to bring the particle content and size as well alkaline concentration within the acceptable limits for injections into standard gas turbines. The work shows that no steam is needed as gasification agent, thus simplifying the process and decreasing the capital costs. Moreover, the strategy leads to higher efficiency when compared with power generation based on high-pressure steam turbines, BIG/GT process consuming SCB, and combined cycles using pressurized-chamber boilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aboilers 3acleaning 3afuels 3agasification 3apower generation 3aslurries 3aslurry pumps 3asteam 3asugarcane bagasse 3aturbines1 aBeninca, Wilson de A.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2014 Apr. 17, v. 28, no. 4 p.2697-2707dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef500317a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245012500178300001300303520142800316592002801744650002501772650002201797650002501819650002501844650002301869650001601892650003801908650001901946650001901965650002001984650001802004650002602022650002402048650002402072650001602096650001302112653001402125653002302139653001202162653002102174653000802195700002002203700001502223700001402238700001802252700001602270700002502286700002102311700001602332700001702348700002002365700001602385700002102401700002002422773008802442856009002530852000902620655001202629IND60623012720221121013045.0190131e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062301272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2018.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajam, Gowrisankar10aDevelopment and validation of a robust multiplex serological assay to quantify antibodies specific to pertussis antigens  ap. 9-20.  aDespite wide spread vaccination, the public health burden of pertussis remains substantial. Current acellular pertussis vaccines comprise upto five Bordetella pertussis (Bp) antigens. Performing an ELISA to quantify antibody for each antigen is laborious and challenging to apply to pediatric samples where serum volume may be limited. We developed a microsphere based multiplex antibody capture assay (MMACA) to quantify antibodies to five pertussis antigens; pertussis toxin, pertactin, filamentous hemagglutinin and fimbrial antigens 2/3, and adenylate cyclase toxin in a single reaction (5-plex) with a calibrated reference standard, QC reagents and SAS® based data analysis program. The goodness of fit (R2) of the standard curves for five analytes was ≥0.99, LLOQ 0.04–0.15 IU or AU/mL, accuracy 1.9%–23.8% (%E), dilutional linearity slopes 0.93–1.02 and regression coefficients r2 = 0.91–0.99. MMACA had acceptable precision within a median CV of 16.0%-22.8%. Critical reagents, antigen conjugated microsphere and reporter antibody exhibited acceptable (<12.3%) lot-lot variation. MMACA can be completed in <3 h, requires low serum volume (5μL/multiplex assay) and has fast data turnaround time (<1 min). MMACA has been successfully developed and validated as a sensitive, specific, robust and rugged method suitable for simultaneous quantification of anti-Bp antibodies in serum, plasma and DBS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBordetella pertussis 3aadenylate cyclase 3aantibody specificity 3abacterial antibodies 3abacterial antigens 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahemagglutinins 3amicroparticles 3apertussis toxin 3apublic health 3aquantitative analysis 3areference standards 3aregression analysis 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aPertussis 0aMultiplex serology 0aLuminex 0aAssay validation 0aSAS1 aCarlone, George1 aKim, Ellie1 aChoi, Jin1 aPaulos, Simon1 aPark, SoHee1 aJeyachandran, Amilia1 aGorantla, Yamini1 aWong, Emily1 aSabnis, Amit1 aBrowning, Peter1 aDesai, Rita1 aQuinn, Conrad P.1 aSchiffer, Jarad0 tBiologicals.g2019 Jan., v. 57 p.9-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2018.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01244naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008200157300001800239520025100257592002800508650001200536650001400548650002300562650002700585650002300612650001100635650001100646700002200657700002100679773013400700856007500834852000900909655001200918IND60659228820221122034709.0190827e20120326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065922882DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc30350g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarma, Rupam10aIndium(iii) catalysed substrate selective hydrothiolation of terminal alkynes  ap. 4014-4016.  aIn(OTf)₃ is reported as the first catalyst having the ability to selectively catalyse both Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov hydrothiolation of terminal alkynes under identical reaction conditions depending upon the nature of the thiol employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aindium 3athiols1 aRajesh, Nimmakuri1 aPrajapati, Dipak0 tChemical communications.g2012 Mar. 26, v. 48, no. 33 p.4014-4016dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc30350g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245014400161300001600305520177900321592002802100650001302128650001402141650001602155650001002171650000902181650001102190650001902201650001202220650001302232650001802245650001002263650001202273650002202285650001102307650001102318650001102329651001402340651001202354653001902366653003002385653000902415653001602424653002202440653002202462653001902484653002202503653001402525773009902539856008102638852000902719655001202728IND60125056120221120094524.0151102e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012505612DNAL7 a10.5253/arde.v102i2.a112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDann, Peter10aPrey Availability, and not Energy Content, Explains Diet and Prey Choice of Eastern Curlews Numenius madagascariensis in Southern Australia  ap. 213-224.  aEastern Curlews breed in Siberia in the boreal spring and summer and migrate to Australia in the austral spring and summer. The Eastern Curlew is notable for its very long, decurved bill; this sexually dimorphic characteristic represents approximately 25–30% of total body length. Female curlews have the longest bill of any wader. Diet and prey choice in relation to availability and profitability were examined over two non-breeding periods in Western Port in southern Australia. Diet was determined from direct feeding observations, examination of pellets collected at high-tide roosts (during daytime and night-time) and by following tracks of foraging curlews. Male and female curlews used the intertidal feeding areas differently: females used more sandy areas and males more muddy areas. This difference may be related to sexual dimorphism in bill length and could reflect substantial dietary differences. Tasselled Crab Pilumnus fissifrons was the most common prey, followed by Australian Ghost Shrimp Trypaea australiensis, Two-spined Crab Litocheira bispinosa and Sentinel Crab Tasmanoplax latifrons. The availability of prey was examined in aquaria through examination of burrowing behaviour and other activity patterns in relation to tidal movements and levels of daylight. Prey behaviour explained the greater consumption of male Ghost Shrimps and the differences in diet between day and night. More Ghost Shrimps and Sentinel Crabs and fewer Two-spined Crabs were taken during the day than during night. Prey choice was examined by measuring the calorific values of prey and potential prey species. Generally, curlews took the more energy valuable prey, but prey behaviour and prey availability mostly determined prey choice, not the energetic value of prey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNumenius 3aaquariums 3abody length 3acrabs 3adiet 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3afemales 3aforaging 3alittoral zone 3amales 3apellets 3asexual dimorphism 3ashrimp 3aspring 3asummer 3aAustralia 3aSiberia 0aEastern Curlew 0aNumenius madagascariensis 0adiet 0aprey choice 0aprey availability 0asexual dimorphism 0aprey behaviour 0aprey energy value 0aAustralia0 tArdea.g2014 July, v. 102, no. 2 p.213-224dNetherlands Ornithologists' Unionx0373-22667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5253%2Farde.v102i2.a113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245010000211300001600311500001900327520173000346592002802076650000902104650002602113650001902139650001602158650001402174650001702188650000902205653001402214653002102228653001902249653001902268653002602287653001802313700002002331700001902351700003002370700002502400773010402425856008102529852000902610655001202619IND60683776120221119164124.0200211e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068377612DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053170018432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBannister, Hannah L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1784-521610aSupportive release techniques provide no reintroduction benefit when efficacy and uptake is low  ap. 206-214.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRelease methods can influence the outcome of reintroductions. We tested the effect of delayed, immediate and supplementary food/shelter release treatments on the reintroduction of brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula to an environment in which introduced predators, particularly foxes, were subject to control. Monitoring of 48 radio-collared possums over 3 months revealed that immediate release possums settled into a stable range significantly faster than other groups, but there were no differences in survival, dispersal distance, reproduction or body condition. Ten days after release possums from all treatment groups had lost body mass, but by day 60 most were heavier than at the time of translocation. After release, possums sometimes used shelter sites easily accessible to predators, but within 3 weeks they regularly selected safer shelter. Risky shelter selection and loss of condition immediately after release suggests that supplementary food and shelter could be beneficial, but supportive measures were rarely used or did not have the desired effect. In an environment with higher predator densities, risky shelter selection could lead to high post-release predation, and mass loss could encourage animals to forage in riskier ways, further increasing vulnerability. In these environments effective uptake of supplementary food and shelter could reduce predation risk, but supplementary measures would need to be presented in a way that maximises uptake. In contrast, if post-release predation risk is low then supportive measures may not be required. Innovative methods for providing post-release support should continue to be developed for reintroductions to areas where supportive measures are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryx 3aTrichosurus vulpecula 3abody condition 3abody weight 3apredation 3areproduction 3arisk 0aAustralia 0abrushtail possum 0areintroduction 0arelease method 0asupplementary feeding 0atranslocation1 aBrandle, Robert1 aDelean, Steven1 aPaton, D.

The southern Appalachians are a biodiversity hotspot for salamanders, and several montane endemics occur in the region. Here, we present the first DNA sequence data for Plethodon sherando, a terrestrial salamander recently discovered in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. We sequenced two mitochondrial regions (cyt-b and CO1) from salamanders at reference sites near the center of P. sherandoâs range and from two contact zones where P. sherando populations are replaced by Plethodon cinereus, the Northern Red-Backed salamander. We then used these sequence data to examine divergence and hybridization between the two taxa. We found P. sherando and P. cinereus morphotypes from contact zones to be reciprocally monophyletic and highly divergent (~17%). P. sherando exhibited very low sequence diversity (ÏÂ =Â 0.0010) as compared to P. cinereus from the same locations (ÏÂ =Â 0.0096). Salamander morphology in the contact zone was as distinct as morphology at reference sites, and discriminant function analysis based on morphology successfully classified 98% of salamanders to their mitochondrial lineage. Phylogenetic analysis of cyt-b sequences showed P. sherando to be sister to Plethodon serratus (the Southern Red-Backed salamander) rather than P. cinereus or any nearby mountaintop endemics. Our results suggest that P. sherando is a distinct lineage that is not subject to substantial introgression from P. cinereus and that may have a history of geographic isolation. Given its limited range (<80Â km2), we believe P. sherando should merit a conservation status similar to that of other mountaintop salamanders in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlethodon cinereus 3aallopatric speciation 3aintrogression 3amountains 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3asalamanders and newts 3aBlue Ridge Mountain region 3aVirginia1 aSackman, Andrew M.1 aBezold, Kelly1 aCabe, Paul R.1 aMarsh, David M.0 tConservation genetics.g2012 Apr., v. 13, no. 2 p.443-454dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-011-0297-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245017100155300001800326520152400344592002801868650001301896650001901909650001901928650001701947650002201964650001101986650001201997650001302009700001502022700001702037700001302054700001902067700001702086700001502103773012102118856007402239852000902313655001202322IND60667097620221120120147.0190919e20141218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066709762DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra13582b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aEnhanced water retention and proton conductivity of proton exchange membranes by incorporating hollow polymer microspheres grafted with sulfonated polystyrene brushes  ap. 5343-5356.  aHollow polymer microspheres grafted with sulfonated polystyrene brushes (HPSS) were synthesized via a combination of surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) of styrene from SiO₂@P(MAA-co-DVB-co-CMSt) core–shell microspheres, sulfonation of the polystyrene brushes, and final removal of the silica core. These HPSSs were then incorporated into a sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) matrix to fabricate hybrid membranes. As a comparison, SPEEK/HPS hybrid membranes were prepared by incorporation of sulfonated hollow polymer microspheres (HPS) into a SPEEK matrix. Water retention, methanol resistance and proton conductivity were increased by doping with both kinds of hollow polymer microspheres. The SPEEK/HPSS hybrid membranes exhibited much higher proton conductivity than did the SPEEK/HPS hybrid membranes with the same filler contents ranging from 2.5 to 15 wt%. The highest conductivity was obtained at 0.33 S cm⁻¹ for SPEEK/HPSS under 75 °C and 100% relative humidity (RH), which was 83.3% higher than that (0.18 S cm⁻¹) for a SPEEK control membrane under the same conditions. The increment in proton conductivity was mainly attributed to the large cavities of HPSS acting as water reservoirs, and the excellent flexibility and high accessibility of the sulfate groups (–SO₃H) on the surface grafted polymer brushes, which provide proton hopping sites for proton-conducting pathways. Moreover, the hybrid membranes exhibited good thermal and mechanical stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3amethanol 3amicroparticles 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3arelative humidity 3asilica 3astyrene 3asulfates1 aZhang, Bei1 aHe, Guangwei1 aLiu, Bin1 aJiang, Zhongyi1 aYang, Xinlin1 aLi, Chenxi0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 18, v. 5, no. 7 p.5343-5356dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra13582b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245014600206300001600352520160000368592002801968650005801996650001902054650001702073650001902090650002902109650002102138650001602159650001402175650002302189650001102212650001602223650002902239650002102268650001502289651001202304653002802316653002102344653001702365653001302382700006402395700002502459700002002484700002202504700002402526700002002550700001602570700002602586700002202612773009802634856008502732852000902817655001202826IND60645011220221120052032.0190606e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064501122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Grant1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6308-600614aThe development and trial of an unmanned aerial system for the measurement of methane flux from landfill and greenhouse gas emission hotspots  ap. 883-892.  aThis paper describes the development of a new sampling and measurement method to infer methane flux using proxy measurements of CO2 concentration and wind data recorded by Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The flux method described and trialed here is appropriate to the spatial scale of landfill sites and analogous greenhouse gas emission hotspots, making it an important new method for low-cost and rapid case study quantification of fluxes from currently uncertain (but highly important) greenhouse gas sources.We present a case study using these UAS-based measurements to derive instantaneous methane fluxes from a test landfill site in the north of England using a mass balance model tailored for UAS sampling and co-emitted CO2 concentration as a methane-emission proxy. Methane flux (and flux uncertainty) during two trials on 27 November 2014 and 5 March 2015, were found to be 0.140 kg s−1 (±61% at 1σ), and 0.050 kg s−1 (±54% at 1σ), respectively. Uncertainty contributing to the flux was dominated by ambient variability in the background (inflow) concentration (>40%) and wind speed (>10%); with instrumental error contributing only ∼1–2%. The approach described represents an important advance concerning the challenging problem of greenhouse gas hotspot flux calculation, and offers transferability to a wide range of analogous environments. This new measurement solution could add to a toolkit of approaches to better validate source-specific greenhouse emissions inventories – an important new requirement of the UNFCCC COP21 (Paris) climate change agreement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainventories 3alandfills 3amethane production 3amodels 3auncertainty 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awaste management 3awind speed 3aEngland 0aUnmanned Aerial Systems 0aGreenhouse gases 0aMethane flux 0aHotspots1 aHollingsworth, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6803-93531 aKabbabe, Khristopher1 aPitt, Joseph R.1 aMead, Mohammed I.1 aIllingworth, Samuel1 aRoberts, Gareth1 aBourn, Mark1 aShallcross, Dudley E.1 aPercival, Carl J.0 tWaste management.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 87 p.883-892dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008600171300001600257520155200273592002801825650001401853650000901867650002601876650001001902650001401912650001301926650001301939650000701952650001301959650001201972650000901984653001801993653001402011653002702025653002602052653002002078653002302098700002102121700002302142700002002165700002102185700005602206700002302262700002602285773010202311856008402413852000902497655001202506IND60609655320221118004018.0180823e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060965532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2017.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerardi, Alberto10aFormulation, swelling and dissolution kinetics study of zein based matrix tablets  ap. 241-249.  aThis study has investigated the potential use of zein protein from corn as a pharmaceutical excipient for formulation of oral controlled-release matrices. SMCC (silicified microcrystalline cellulose)-Prosolv® 90, SMCC HD-Prosolv® 90 HD, Avicel® PH 102 and Mannitol 60 were evaluated as co-excipients to improve the processability of zein powder. Zein/SMCC-Prosolv® 90 blend had the best flowability and tabletability. Tablets with tramadol hydrochloride, zein and SMCCProsolv® 90 were prepared by direct compression. Drug release from the tablets was measured by dissolution testing. The dissolution profiles obtained were compared using the dissolution efficiency (DE) and were fitted to the Korsmeyer–Peppas equation. Controlled drug release, governed by anomalous (non-Fickian) drug transport, was obtained over the test duration. Drug release rate and mechanism were dependent on formulation parameters, such as tablet hardness, zein/SMCC ratio and drug loading, as well as medium pH. Dynamics of tablets swelling correlated well with drug release rate and mechanism, with faster drug release and greater contribution of polymer relaxation being obtained at increased swelling. In conclusion, the present work has shown that zein/SMCC based matrix formulation can be used as a new platform for oral-controlled drug delivery which can be easily customized by adjusting formulation parameters. The use of this formulation could be attractive for customers and manufacturers who prefer to avoid synthetic or chemically modified excipients.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acorn 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aequations 3ahardness 3amannitol 3apH 3apolymers 3apowders 3azein 0aMaize protein 0aProsolv® 0aTramadol hydrochloride 0aDrug release kinetics 0aMatrix swelling 0aControlled release1 aBisharat, Lorina1 aBonacucina, Giulia1 aCasettari, Luca1 aLogrippo, Serena1 aCespi, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6916-79151 aAlKhatib, Hatim S.1 aPalmieri, Giovanni F.0 tPowder technology.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 310 p.241-249dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014500171300001600316520196100332592002802293650002502321650001402346650002602360650001402386650001202400650002302412650001102435650001402446650000902460650001602469650002102485650000902506651001902515653001702534653002602551653003002577653002402607653001502631700001702646700001702663700001602680773009802696856008502794852000902879655001202888IND60645011720221123044031.0190606e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064501172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2018.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRees-White, T.C.10aMeasuring methane emissions from a UK landfill using the tracer dispersion method and the influence of operational and environmental factors  ap. 870-882.  aThe methane emissions from a landfill in south-east, UK were successfully quantified during a six-day measurement campaign using the tracer dispersion method. The fair weather conditions made it necessary to perform measurements in the late afternoon and in the evening when the lower solar flux resulted in a more stable troposphere with a lower inversion layer. This caused a slower mixing of the gasses, but allowed plume measurements up to 6700 m downwind from the landfill. The average methane emission varied between 217 ± 14 and 410 ± 18 kg h−1 within the individual measurement days, but the measured emission rates were higher on the first three days (333 ± 27, 371 ± 42 and 410 ± 18 kg h−1) compared to the last three days (217 ± 14, 249 ± 20 and 263 ± 22 kg h−1). It was not possible to completely isolate the extent to which these variations were a consequence of measuring artefacts, such as wind/measurement direction and measurement distance, or from an actual change in the fugitive emission. Such emission change is known to occur with changes in the atmospheric pressure. The higher emissions measured during the first three days of the campaign were measured during a period with an overall decrease in atmospheric pressure (from approximately 1014 mbar on day 1 to 987 mbar on day 6). The lower emissions measured during the last three days of the campaign were carried out during a period with an initial pressure increase followed by a period of slowly reducing pressure. The average daily methane recovery flow varied between 633 and 679 kg h−1 at STP (1 atm, 0 °C). The methane emitted to the atmosphere accounted for approximately 31% of the total methane generated, assuming that the methane generated is the sum of the methane recovered and the methane emitted to the atmosphere, thus not including a potential methane oxidation in the landfill cover soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3aemissions 3aenvironmental factors 3alandfills 3amethane 3amethane production 3amixing 3aoxidation 3asoil 3atroposphere 3awaste management 3awind 3aUnited Kingdom 0aLandfill gas 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aGas collection efficiency 0aBarometric pressure 0aWind speed1 aMønster, J.1 aBeaven, R.P.1 aScheutz, C.0 tWaste management.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 87 p.870-882dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002400167245006100191300001400252520104800266592002801314650002101342650001201363650002601375650002701401650001301428650001801441650002001459650001601479650001501495650002101510650001701531650001501548650001201563650001501575650002001590650001401610650003501624650005901659650004601718650005301764650004201817650002701859650001201886650002701898650001401925700003001939700002401969700002201993700002302015700001802038773010002056856008402156852000902240655001202249IND4470622120221118153511.0141111e20111121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447062212DNAL7 a217004032pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.05.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrépin, Sébastien14aThe Pho regulon and the pathogenesis of Escherichia coli  ap. 82-88.  aDuring the course of infection, bacteria must coordinately regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. The phosphate (Pho) regulon is controlled by the two component-regulatory system PhoBR. PhoBR is activated during starvation and regulates genes involved in phosphate homeostasis. Several studies have highlighted the importance of the Pho regulon in bacterial pathogenesis, showing how induction of PhoBR, in addition to regulating genes participating in phosphate metabolism, leads to modulation of many cellular processes. The pleiotropic effects of Pho regulon activation include attenuated virulence and alteration of many virulence traits, including adhesion to host cells and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides, acidity and oxidative stresses. This review provides an overview of the relationship between the Pho regulon and virulence in Escherichia coli and illustrates that, in addition to regulating phosphate homeostasis, the Pho regulon plays a key role in regulating stress responses and virulence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacidity 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteria 3acell adhesion 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aphosphates 3aregulon 3astarvation 3astress response 3avirulence 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aRegulon 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aVirulence1 aChekabab, Samuel-Mohammed1 aLe Bihan, Guillaume1 aBertrand, Nicolas1 aDozois, Charles M.1 aHarel, Josée0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2011 Nov. 21, v. 153, no. 1-2 p.82-88dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245011100171520198300282592002802265650001102293650001302304650001502317650001402332650001502346650001902361650001402380650001702394653002402411653001902435653002202454653002502476700001402501700001302515700001802528773009102546856009002637852000902727655001202736IND60770021220221121074331.0220509e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077002122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1342542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yaxin10aCharacteristics of overflow pollution from combined sewer sediment: Formation, contribution and regulation  aSewer sediments contain high concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus pollutants, which can be the main source of overflow pollution due to high-velocity scouring. To elucidate the scouring overflow pollution characteristics and regulation mechanism of sewer sediment under different precipitation intensities, a sewer-storage tank linkage control experimental device was established to simulate the practical sewer overflow under different precipitation intensities and the control process of storage tank overflow pollutants. Based on the division of flow from small to large, the pollution characteristics of overflow pollutants and the contribution rate of sewer sediments to overflow pollutants were analysed. The results showed that the total load of overflow pollutants increased with an increase in rainfall intensity and were 7.58 kg, 16.54 kg, 27.42 kg, respectively. The concentration of particulate pollutants increased sharply in a short time, and the concentration of dissolved pollutants decreased at a certain dilution. Sewer sediment was the main source of overflow pollutants, contributing up to 70%. After the overflow pollutants entered the regulation and storage tank, a certain stratification phenomenon was discovered at different sedimentation times. The concentration of large particle pollutants gradually increased from top to bottom in the regulation and storage tank, and the concentration of dissolved pollutants showed no obvious difference between the layers. With an increase in rainfall intensity, the recommended regulation and storage times of overflow pollutants were within 15 min, 45–60 min, and 60 min, respectively. Finally, based on the relationship among rainfall intensity, sediment scouring thickness, regulation and storage time, a prediction formula for the regulation and storage time of overflow pollutants was obtained, which provided a basis for the regulation and treatment of subsequent overflow pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3aprediction 3arain intensity 3asediments 3astorage time 0aOverflow pollutants 0aSewer sediment 0aContribution rate 0aRegulation mechanism1 aShi, Xuan1 aJin, Xin1 aJin, Pengkang0 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 298 p.134254-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1342543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005000155245013500205520180800340592002802148650001202176650002402188650001502212650001202227650001302239650001502252650001602267650001502283650002602298650001402324650003102338650002702369650001702396650001202413650001502425650001402440650002202454650001302476650001502489650002802504650001202532650002502544650001302569650002602582650001802608650002002626650001902646650001702665653002202682653002702704653001702731653002102748653002902769653001302798700001502811700001802826700001402844700001902858773009102877856009002968852000903058655001203067IND60770021320221121074238.0220606e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077002132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1342552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2744-730X10aIntegrated transcriptomics and proteomics provide new insights into the cadmium-induced ovarian toxicity on Pardosa pseudoannulata  aCadmium (Cd) pollution is intractable heavy metal pollution in the farmland ecosystem, posing a life-threatening challenge to the paddy field organisms. Spiders are riveting animal biomarkers for evaluating Cd-induced toxicity, yet the effects of long-term Cd toxicity on spider reproductive function and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, we found that Cd exposure impaired the antioxidant enzyme system in the wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata and decreased the concentration of four antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase) (p < 0.05). The content of vitellogenin and the number of hatched spiderlings were also dramatically reduced under Cd stress (p < 0.05), indicating that Cd stress could vitiate the fecundity of P. pseudoannulata. Moreover, a total of 10,511 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 391 proteins (DEPs) were yielded from the ovarian transcriptome and proteome, and a mass of genes and proteins involved in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were significantly down-regulated. DEGs and DEPs directly encoding the antioxidant enzyme system and/or vitellogenesis were also distinctively down-regulated. In addition, we illustrated that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway might play a crucial role in regulating protein synthesis, cell cycle, growth, differentiation and survival in P. pseudoannulata. The effects of protein processing in ER and PI3K-AKT pathways could further trigger transcriptional factor Forkhead shackling the protein synthesis and cell growth process. Collectively, this integrated analysis identified the Cd-induced reproductive toxicity on P. pseudoannulata and provided multifaceted insights to investigate the molecular mechanisms of spiders to Cd pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPardosa 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3acatalase 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3aecosystems 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afecundity 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheavy metals 3apaddies 3aperoxidase 3apollution 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3areproductive toxicology 3aspiders 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3avitellogenesis 3avitellogenin 0aCadmium pollution 0aPardosa pseudoannulata 0aAntioxidants 0aOvarian function 0aProtein processing in ER 0aPI3K-AKT1 aPeng, Yong1 aPeng, Yuan-de1 aWang, Zhi1 aSong, Qi-sheng0 tChemosphere.g2022 June, v. 297 p.134255-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1342553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008200164300001600246520168100262592002801943650001501971650002101986650001902007650002102026650001402047650001002061650001202071650002302083650001202106650002102118650001102139651001202150653001302162653001202175653001502187653001502202653001602217700001702233700001802250700001602268773009802284856008502382852000902467655001202476IND60645011920221123045032.0190606e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064501192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2018.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourn, M.10aRegulating landfills using measured methane emissions: An English perspective  ap. 860-869.  aMethane emissions from landfills are an important source of greenhouse gases in the UK and worldwide. This paper considers how measurements of methane emissions could be used to regulate landfills in England in order to reduce the contribution of landfilling to climate change. The paper presents the results of a number of UK studies undertaken to quantify methane emissions from landfills. The methods used have included the DIAL (Differential Absorption Lidar) technique and a tracer gas dispersion method. A method based on aerial measurements has been developed. Methane emission rates were measured at 15 biodegradable waste landfills. All of the landfills where measurements took place had an active landfill gas extraction system. A methane collection index (MCI) is calculated for each landfill using the ratio of the methane collection rate to the sum of the collection and emission rates. The values of the index in the campaigns reported here ranged from 0.28 to 0.90. The modern operational landfills surveyed achieved MCI values with a much narrower range of between 0.64 and 0.90 with an average of 0.76. This has demonstrated that it is possible for these landfills to collect a high proportion of the landfill gas. A proposed approach is presented for regulating landfills using the measured MCI. This would involve an annual measurement campaign to quantify the methane emissions and the use of the data provided by these surveys to develop an achievable but challenging MCI limit. A limit value of 0.75 for the MCI is used to illustrate the approach. An MCI that falls below the limit would trigger actions to reduce the methane emissions from the landfill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiodegradability 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gases 3alandfills 3alidar 3amethane 3amethane production 3asurveys 3awaste management 3awastes 3aEngland 0aLandfill 0aMethane 0aRegulation 0aMonitoring 0aMeasurement1 aRobinson, R.1 aInnocenti, F.1 aScheutz, C.0 tWaste management.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 87 p.860-869dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009300168300001600261520200400277592002802281650001502309650001502324650002802339650001102367650001902378650002502397650001702422650001502439650002502454650001802479650001302497650001102510650001502521650001602536650001902552650002602571650001502597651001102612651001002623651001102633651001802644653002602662653002502688653001702713653001802730653002902748700001702777700001802794700001602812700001502828700001302843700001402856700001402870700001202884700001602896700001902912773011902931856008803050852000903138655001203147IND60613115720221120130139.0190628e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061311572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.1962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huiwen10aSpatiotemporal distribution and national measurement of the global carbonate carbon sink  ap. 157-170.  aThe magnitudes, spatial distributions and contributions to global carbon budget of the global carbonate carbon sink (CCS) still remain uncertain, allowing the problem of national measurement of CCS remain unresolved which will directly influence the fairness of global carbon markets and emission trading. Here, based on high spatiotemporal resolution ecological, meteorological raster data and chemical field monitoring data, combining highly reliable machine learning algorithm with the thermodynamic dissolution equilibrium model, we estimated the new CCS of 0.89 ± 0.23 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C yr−1), amounting to 74.50% of global net forest sink and accounting for 28.75% of terrestrial sinks or 46.81% of the missing sink. Our measurement for 142 nations of CCS showed that Russia, Canada, China and the USA contribute over half of the global CCS. We also presented the first global fluxes maps of the CCS with spatial resolution of 0.05°, exhibiting two peaks in equatorial regions (10°S to 10°N) and low latitudes (10°N to 35°N) in Northern Hemisphere. By contrast, there are no peaks in Southern Hemisphere. The greatest average carbon sink flux (CCSF), i.e., 2.12 tC ha−1 yr−1, for 2000 to 2014 was contributed by tropical rainforest climate near the equator, and the smallest average CCSF was presented in tropical arid zones, showing a magnitude of 0.26 tC ha−1 yr−1. This research estimated the magnitudes, spatial distributions, variations and contributions to the global carbon budget of the CCS in a higher spatiotemporal representativeness and expandability way, which, via multiple mechanisms, introduced an important sink in the terrestrial carbon sink system and the global missing sink and that can help us further reveal and support our understanding of global rock weathering carbon sequestration, terrestrial carbon sink system and global carbon cycle dynamics which make our understanding of global change more comprehensive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aarid zones 3aartificial intelligence 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3acarbonates 3aglobal carbon budget 3aglobal change 3alatitude 3amodels 3amonitoring 3araster data 3athermodynamics 3atropical rain forests 3aweathering 3aCanada 3aChina 3aRussia 3aUnited States 0aCarbonate carbon sink 0aNational measurement 0aMissing sink 0aCarbon budget 0aSpatiotemporal evolution1 aWang, Shijie1 aBai, Xiaoyong1 aLuo, Weijun1 aTang, Hong1 aCao, Yue1 aWu, Luhua1 aChen, Fei1 aLi, Qin1 aZeng, Cheng1 aWang, Mingming0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 643 p.157-170dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.1963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01507naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245005000161300001600211520039500227592002800622650001300650650000900663650001300672650001200685650001600697650001900713651001000732653001400742653001700756653002100773653001300794653001100807700001700818700001600835700001900851700001900870773011700889856008201006852000901088655001201097IND60516782620221118090029.0190729e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051678262DNAL7 a10.1017/S002428291200014X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Lei,10aLecanora subjaponica, a new lichen from China  ap. 465-468.  aLecanora subjaponica L.

The dimorphic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is distantly related to S. cerevisiae. Its genome encodes three Ras proteins. Here, we show that the three Ras proteins in Y. lipolytica are critical for dimorphic transition but are dispensable for growth. Among the three Ras proteins, YlRas2 plays a major role in the regulation of dimorphic transition, whereas YlRas1 plays a minor role in this process. The additional Ras protein, YlRas3, which resembles mammalian K‐Ras4B at the C‐terminus, does not seem to have a significant role in dimorphic transition. Thus, the three Ras proteins do not act equally in the regulation of dimorphic transition. We also show that the expression of YlRAS2 was increased dramatically at the transcriptional level during yeast‐to‐hypha transition, consistent with a major role of YlRas2 in the regulation of dimorphic transition. YlRas2's function in dimorphic transition depends on the active GTP‐bound form of YlRas2 and its localization to the plasma membrane. YlRas2 could also partially function on the endomembranes. In addition, we identified the transcription factor Mhy1 as a potential signal transducer downstream of YlRas2 in the control of dimorphic transition. This finding suggests that novel signaling pathway controlled by Ras proteins regulating dimorphic transition may exist in Y. lipolytica.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3agenome 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3ayeasts 3asignal transduction 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3atranscription (genetics) 3amammals 3aplasma membrane 0aproteins1 aLi, Yun‐Qing1 aZhao, Xiao‐Feng1 aGao, Xiang‐Dong0 tFEMS yeast research.g2014 May, v. 14, no. 3 p.451-463dPublished by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx1567-13567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1567-1364.121293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04273naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011200163300002000275520158100295592002801876596009801904596009802002596010202100596010202202596010202304596012602406596016402532596012202696596011702818596005502935650001202990650001103002650001703013650001503030650002203045650003303067650001603100653002903116653004403145653003703189653004103226653003303267700001703300700001403317700001903331700001603350700002003366700001603386700001203402700005203414773014103466856007903607852000903686655001203695IND60776926520221120181426.0220511e20220502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077692652DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c018592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Dongyang10aHighly Emissive Quasi-2D Perovskites Enabled by a Multifunctional Molecule for Bright Light-Emitting Diodes  ap. 21636-21644.  aQuasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite has exhibited great potential to be an ideal luminescent material for perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, the low-order phases (especially n = 1 phase) and the inevitable defects result in massive nonradiative recombination and poor emission efficiency. Herein, a multifunctional molecule of tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (TDP) is introduced to simultaneously suppress the low-n phase, passivate the defects, and increase the exciton binding energy of the quasi-2D perovskite for massive radiative recombination and thus high emission efficiency. The multifunctional roles of TDP are realized by the synergistic effects of tetrabutylammonium cation and dihydrogen phosphate anion, both of which show strong interaction with the lead bromide octahedron of the perovskite. As a result, the TDP-incorporated perovskite films show a great enhancement of the emission efficiency with a remarkable increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 34.6 to 96.9% at the wavelength of 522 nm. The strengthened radiative recombination promotes efficient emission efficiency with over 2.5-fold improvement in external quantum efficiency (EQE) and current efficiency (CE) from 3.27% and 10.83 cd A–¹ to 9.25% and 28.35 cd A–¹, respectively, as well as high brightness with over 37% enhancement from 12713 to 17536 cd m–². Consequently, this work contributes to an efficient approach to employ a multifunctional molecule for highly emissive quasi-2D perovskites and enhanced quasi-2D PeLED performances.  aPublisher supplied data  a61804102cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a62105231cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aBK20180835cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004608  aBK20190098cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004608  aBK20210712cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004608  aNAcPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutionsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100012246  a19KJA550001cMajor Basic Research Project of the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutionsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100013280  aNAcKey Lab of Advanced Optical Manufacturing Technologies of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100019316  aNAcKey Lab of Modern Optical Technologies of Education Ministry of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100019317  aNAcJiangsu Shuang Chuang Plandhttps://doi.org/NA 3acations 3aenergy 3alead bromide 3aphosphates 3aphotoluminescence 3atetrabutylammonium compounds 3awavelengths 0amultifunctional molecule 0atetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate 0aquasi-two-dimensional perovskite 0astrengthened radiative recombination 0abright light-emitting diodes1 aRen, Zhenwei1 aLi, Qinyi1 aLuo, Chengzhao1 aXia, Wenlin1 aZheng, Zhishuai1 aMa, Wenchen1 aLi, Jie1 aChen, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9669-24750 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 May 02, v. 14, no. 18 p.21636-21644dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c018593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006600138245011900204500001900323500002000342520176400362592002802126596002702154596003202181596003202213596000602245596004402251596007902295650001202374650002602386650001802412650001302430650003302443650001002476650001202486650001202498650004302510650001902553650001302572650001602585700002202601700005402623700001802677700001902695700005702714773012302771856007202894961001202966852000902978655001202987IND60729742720221119054404.0210302e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072974272DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.22372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderhoof, Melanie K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0101-553310aTracking rates of postfire conifer regeneration vs. deciduous vegetation recovery across the western United States  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPostfire shifts in vegetation composition will have broad ecological impacts. However, information characterizing postfire recovery patterns and their drivers are lacking over large spatial extents. In this analysis, we used Landsat imagery collected when snow cover (SCS) was present, in combination with growing season (GS) imagery, to distinguish evergreen vegetation from deciduous vegetation. We sought to (1) characterize patterns in the rate of postfire, dual‐season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across the region, (2) relate remotely sensed patterns to field‐measured patterns of re‐vegetation, and (3) identify seasonally specific drivers of postfire rates of NDVI recovery. Rates of postfire NDVI recovery were calculated for both the GS and SCS for more than 12,500 burned points across the western United States. Points were partitioned into faster and slower rates of NDVI recovery using thresholds derived from field plot data (n = 230) and their associated rates of NDVI recovery. We found plots with conifer saplings had significantly higher SCS NDVI recovery rates relative to plots without conifer saplings, while plots with ≥50% grass/forbs/shrubs cover had significantly higher GS NDVI recovery rates relative to plots with <50%. GS rates of NDVI recovery were best predicted by burn severity and anomalies in postfire maximum temperature. SCS NDVI recovery rates were best explained by aridity and growing degree days. This study is the most extensive effort, to date, to track postfire forest recovery across the western United States. Isolating patterns and drivers of evergreen recovery from deciduous recovery will enable improved characterization of forest ecological condition across large spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Geological Survey  cLand Resources Mission Area  cLand Change Science Program  c,  cBiological Carbon Sequestration Program  cDepartment of the Interior North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center 3aLandsat 3abotanical composition 3aburn severity 3aconifers 3adry environmental conditions 3aforbs 3aforests 3agrasses 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asnowpack 3atemperature1 aHawbaker, Todd J.1 aKu, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1341-59881 aMerriam, Kyle1 aBerryman, Erin1 aCattau, Megan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2164-38090 tEcological applications.g2021 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.e02237-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.22373Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245014100195300001800336500002000354520149300374592002801867596005901895596005901954596005902013596008402072650001602156650000802172650002402180650001002204650001602214650001402230650001202244650002002256650002002276650003602296650001902332650003302351700005602384700001802440700001702458700001702475700001702492700001302509700001802522700001502540700001902555773012802574856007402702852000902776655001202785IND60756025220221118045111.0211110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075602522DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.131342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7133-030110aActivation of the BABA‐induced priming defence through redox homeostasis and the modules of TGA1 and MAPKK5 in postharvest peach fruit  ap. 1624-1640.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe priming of defence responses in pathogen‐challenged model plants undergoes a preparation phase and an expression phase for defence function. However, the priming response in postharvest fruits has not been elucidated. Here, we found that 50 mM β‐aminobutyric acid (BABA) treatment could induce two distinct pathways linked with TGA1‐related systemic acquired resistance (SAR), resulting in the alleviation of Rhizopus rot in postharvest peach fruit. The first priming phase was elicited by BABA alone, leading to the enhanced transcription of redox‐regulated genes and posttranslational modification of PpTGA1. The second phase was activated by an H₂O₂ burst via up‐regulation of PpRBOH genes and stimulation of the MAPK cascade on pathogen invasion, resulting in a robust defence. In the MAPK cascade, PpMAPKK5 was identified as a shortcut interacting protein of PpTGA1 and increased the DNA binding activity of PpTGA1 for the activation of salicylic acid (SA)‐responsive PR genes. The overexpression of PpMAPKK5 in Arabidopsis caused the constitutive transcription of SA‐dependent PR genes and as a result conferred resistance against the fungus Rhizopus stolonifer. Hence, we suggest that the BABA‐induced priming defence in peaches is activated by redox homeostasis with an elicitor‐induced reductive signalling and a pathogen‐stimulated H₂O₂ burst, which is accompanied by the possible phosphorylation of PpTGA1 by PpMAPKK5 for signal amplification.  aPublisher supplied data  a31671913cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31672209cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018A610224cNatural Science Foundation of Ningbo City  aCXQT21036cFunds for Innovative Research Groups of University in Chongqing City 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA 3aRhizopus stolonifer 3afungi 3ahomeostasis 3apathogens 3apeaches 3aphosphorylation 3aplant pathology 3apost-translational modification 3asalicylic acid 3asystemic acquired resistance1 aWang, Kaituo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3534-29031 aHuang, Yixiao1 aLei, Changyi1 aCao, Shifeng1 aQiu, Linglan1 aXu, Feng1 aJiang, Yongbo1 aZou, Yanyu1 aZheng, Yonghua0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2021 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.1624-1640dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.131343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013700164500001900301520117700320592002801497650002001525650001201545650001401557650001301571650001401584650001501598650001801613650001701631653001401648653000901662653001701671700001901688700001601707700001801723700001601741773012301757856008301880852000901963655001201972IND60728976020221116162440.0210423e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072897602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1050742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Sirui10aStudy on co-hydrothermal treatment combined with pyrolysis of rice straw/sewage sludge: Biochar properties and heavy metals behavior  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReasonable disposal of sewage sludge (SS) as a resource to avid secondary pollution is the major objective. In this study, co-hydrothermal treatment combined with pyrolysis (co-HTP) of rice straw (RS) and sewage sludge for production of biochar was evaluated. The biochar yield was evaluated, and the basic characteristics of biochar including fuel characteristics, porosity characteristics and crystalline characteristics, as well as the heavy metals behaviors were examined. The results indicated that biochar yield exhibited a decreasing trend with the increase of RS blending ratio, and there was a synergy between RS and SS during co-HTP process for the slightly higher biochar yield than that of the predicted values. The co-HTP process promoted the increase of aromaticity and stability of biochar, along with an obvious increase of specific surface area of 116.81 m²/g for H-7RS/3SS-Char. The results also indicated that co-HTP process decreased the total concentrations of heavy metals in biochar and had the promoting effect on heavy metals immobilization for reducing environmental risks due to the reduced percentage of heavy metals in bioavailable fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3apollution 3aporosity 3apyrolysis 3arice straw 3asewage sludge 3asurface area 0aHydrochar 0aChar 0aHeavy metals1 aZhang, Shuping1 aYin, Haoxin1 aWang, Jiaxing1 aChen, Minzi0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 May, v. 155 p.105074-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1050743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245014400201300001800345500002000363520179300383592002802176596005602204596006002260650001902320650002202339650001802361650002202379650001902401650001302420650001202433650001102445650001502456650001302471650001002484650002102494650001302515650002002528650001202548650001802560650002002578650002202598650001702620650001202637650002202649700001902671700001902690700002102709700002102730700001802751700001802769700005902787700002702846700005902873700007102932773012803003856007403131852000903205655001203214IND60756025320221118045031.0211110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075602532DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.131312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegrave, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5642-323512aA new avirulence gene of Leptosphaeria maculans, AvrLm14, identifies a resistance source in American broccoli (Brassica oleracea) genotypes  ap. 1599-1612.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn many cultivated crops, sources of resistance to diseases are sparse and rely on introgression from wild relatives. Agricultural crops often are allopolyploids resulting from interspecific crosses between related species, which are sources of diversity for resistance genes. This is the case for Brassica napus (oilseed rape, canola), an interspecific hybrid between Brassica rapa (turnip) and Brassica oleracea (cabbage). B. napus has a narrow genetic basis and few effective resistance genes against stem canker (blackleg) disease, caused by the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans, are currently available. B. rapa diversity has proven to be a valuable source of resistance (Rlm, LepR) genes, while B. oleracea genotypes were mostly considered susceptible. Here we identified a new resistance source in B. oleracea genotypes from America, potentially effective against French L. maculans isolates under both controlled and field conditions. Genetic analysis of fungal avirulence and subsequent cloning and validation identified a new avirulence gene termed AvrLm14 and suggested a typical gene‐for‐gene interaction between AvrLm14 and the postulated Rlm14 gene. AvrLm14 shares all the usual characteristics of L. maculans avirulence genes: it is hosted in a genomic region enriched in transposable elements and heterochromatin marks H3K9me3, its expression is repressed during vegetative growth but shows a strong overexpression 5–9 days following cotyledon infection, and it encodes a small secreted protein enriched in cysteine residues with few matches in databases. Similar to the previously cloned AvrLm10‐A, AvrLm14 contributes to reduce lesion size on susceptible cotyledons, pointing to a complex interplay between effectors promoting or reducing lesion development.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR GPLA07‐024CcAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aANR‐17‐EUR‐0007cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica oleracea 3aBrassica rapa 3aPlenodomus lingam 3aallopolyploidy 3abroccoli 3acabbage 3acanola 3acotyledons 3acysteine 3afungi 3agenetic analysis 3agenomics 3aheterochromatin 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3aplant pathology 3aprotein secretion 3astem cankers 3aturnips 3avegetative growth1 aWagner, Marine1 aGeorge, Pierre1 aCoudard, Laurent1 aPinochet, Xavier1 aErmel, Magali1 aGay, Elise J.1 aFudal, Isabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9105-94321 aMoreno‐Rico, Onesimo1 aRouxel, Thierry1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9563-17931 aBalesdent, Marie‐Hélène1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5523-91800 tMolecular plant pathology.g2021 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.1599-1612dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.131313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011300152300001800265500002000283520135800303592002801661596005901689596007501748650002301823650002301846650002101869650002301890650001001913650001301923650003001936650002101966650002001987650002102007650003702028650000902065650003302074650002902107700001702136700001602153700001602169700001802185700001702203700001602220700001802236700005702254700005802311773012802369856007402497852000902571655001202580IND60756025420221122235433.0211110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075602542DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.131322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xin10aRice ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae  ap. 1613-1623.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe functions of ubiquitin‐conjugating enzymes (E2) in plant immunity are not well understood. In this study, OsUBC26, a rice ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme, was characterized in the defence against Magnaporthe oryzae. The expression of OsUBC26 was induced by M. oryzae inoculation and methyl jasmonate treatment. Both RNA interference lines and CRISPR/Cas9 null mutants of OsUBC26 reduced rice resistance to M. oryzae. WRKY45 was down‐regulated in OsUBC26 null mutants. In vitro E2 activity assay indicated that OsUBC26 is an active ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme. Yeast two‐hybrid assays using OsUBC26 as bait identified the RING‐type E3 ligase UCIP2 as an interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction between OsUBC26 and UCIP2. The CRISPR/Cas9 mutants of UCIP2 also showed compromised resistance to M. oryzae. Yeast two‐hybrid screening using UCIP2 as bait revealed that APIP6 is a binding partner of UCIP2. Moreover, OsUBC26 working with APIP6 ubiquitinateds AvrPiz‐t, an avirulence effector of M. oryzae, and OsUBC26 null mutation impaired the proteasome degradation of AvrPiz‐t in rice cells. In summary, OsUBC26 plays important roles in rice disease resistance by regulating WRKY45 expression and working with E3 ligases such as APIP6 to counteract the effector protein AvrPiz‐t from M. oryzae.  aPublisher supplied data  a31972251cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFD0100600cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aRNA interference 3adisease resistance 3afungi 3aimmunity 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amethyl jasmonate 3aplant pathology 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3arice 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aSong, Linlin1 aZhang, Heng1 aLin, Yijuan1 aShen, Xiaolei1 aGuo, Jiayuan1 aSu, Meiling1 aShi, Gaosheng1 aWang, Zonghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0869-96831 aLu, Guo‐Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6325-91650 tMolecular plant pathology.g2021 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.1613-1623dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.131323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016100167300001600328520156600344592002801910650001101938650001701949650001901966650002001985650001702005650001202022650001902034650002402053650001502077650001302092650001702105650002602122650001702148650001002165650001802175650001002193650001502203650001802218650001702236650001802253653001902271653001902290653001802309653002002327653002302347653001702370700003302387700002702420700002302447700003102470773011602501856008502617852000902702655001202711IND60598529620221118220301.0190705e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059852962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Weiwei10aDisentangling effects of key coarse woody debris fuel properties on its combustion, consumption and carbon gas emissions during experimental laboratory fire  ap. 275-288.  aCoarse woody debris is a key terrestrial carbon pool, and its turnover through fire plays a fundamental role in global carbon cycling. Coarse dead wood fuel properties, which vary between tree species and wood decay stages, might affect its combustion, consumption and carbon gas emissions during fire, either directly or indirectly through interacting with moisture or ground-wood contact.Using controlled laboratory burns, we tried to disentangle the effects of multiple biotic and abiotic factors: tree species (one conifer and three hard wood species), wood decay stages, moisture content, and ground-wood contact on coarse wood combustion, consumption, and CO2 and CO emissions during fire. Wood density was measured for all samples.We found that, compared to the other tested factors, wood decay stages acted as a predominant positive driver increasing coarse wood flammability and associated CO2 and CO emissions during fire. Wood moisture content (30 versus 7%) moderately inhibited wood flammability with slight interaction with wood decay effects. Wood decay effects can be mainly attributed to the decreasing wood density as wood becomes more decomposed.Our experimental data provides useful information for how several wood properties, especially moisture content and wood decay stages, with wood density as the key underlying trait, together drive coarse wood carbon turnover through fire to the atmosphere. Our results will help to improve the predictive power of global vegetation climate models on dead wood turnover and its feedback to climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acoarse woody debris 3acombustion 3aconifers 3adecayed wood 3aenvironmental factors 3aflammability 3afuels 3agas emissions 3atrees 3avegetation 3awater content 3awood density 3awood moisture 0aCarbon cycling 0aGreenhouse gas 0aPlant species 0aWood combustion 0aWood decomposition 0aWood density1 avan Logtestijn, Richard S.P.1 avan der Werf, Guido R.1 avan Hal, Jurgen R.1 aCornelissen, Johannes H.C.0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 427 p.275-288dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04049naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100002100191245010400212300001600316506002800332506003600360506007600396506003100472520205500503592002802558596004502586596004502631506003702676650002802713650003402741650001302775650003002788650000902818650001902827650002102846650001202867650001102879650001402890650001402904650000902918650001102927650001602938650001002954650001702964651001202981651002602993653002503019653001903044653002503063653001203088653001203100653001603112700002303128700002603151773011603177856008503293903002403378852000903402655001203411IND60598529820221207111726.0190705e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059852982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.05.0482chorus7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.05.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, L.

In the western US, climate change has resulted in extensive and severe mountain pine beetle outbreaks. These outbreaks have the potential to impact forest function through the selection of certain phenotypes. We investigated the potential for bark beetle-induced selection by way of measuring growth and climate response in mountain pine beetle-killed and surviving lodgepole pine in the Northern Rockies. We had three objectives: (1) investigate differences in growth between beetle-killed and surviving lodgepole pine prior to a recent outbreak, (2) compare the climate-growth relationships for beetle-killed and surviving lodgepole pine and how those relationships explain observed growth differences and predict mortality risk, and (3) investigate growth differences and growth-climate relationships across north- and south-facing aspects and over an elevation range representing local climate gradients. Significantly higher growth rates were observed in beetle-killed trees at low-elevation sites, but not at mid or high elevations. While aspect influenced overall growth, it did not have a significant influence on the difference in growth between beetle-killed and surviving trees. Growth showed significant relationships with several climate variables (i.e., previous-year August temperatures, October temperatures, annual precipitation, and summertime climatic water deficit), with slight differences in those relationships between beetle-killed and surviving trees. Mixed effects models demonstrated that higher growth rates and age increased the probability of mortality during the outbreak at all elevations, and also that climatic water deficit and previous-year August maximum temperatures were related to the magnitude of growth differences between beetle-killed and surviving trees. Overall, mountain pine beetles tended to attack large, fast-growing, lodgepole trees, especially at lower elevations where trees may be more susceptible to seasonal water stress.  aPublisher supplied data  cNASAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000104  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abark 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aforests 3amodels 3amortality 3aphenotype 3arisk 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrees 3awater stress 3aMontana 3aRocky Mountain region 0aMountain pine beetle 0aLodgepole pine 0aBasal area increment 0aMontana 0aClimate 0aDisturbance1 aReed, Charlotte C.1 aBallantyne, Ashley P.0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 427 p.200-207dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.05.0483Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005800138245009100196500001900287500002000306520085800326592002801184650002301212650001301235650001201248650002501260650001201285650001301297650001201310700006301322700005201385773012201437856007201559852000901631655001201640IND60729743120221119003547.0210302e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072974312DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.22652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAubry, Lise M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3318-732910aImpacts of COVID‐19 on ecology and evolutionary biology faculty in the United States  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe surveyed ecologists and evolutionary biologists in American universities to understand how they are coping with the COVID‐19 pandemic. Female respondents, assistant professors, and those who care for at least one child or teenager, were significantly more dissatisfied with their work–life balance during this pandemic than others, and further expected these negative impacts to be long lived. Online teaching support, relaxed expectations on publications, the possibility of pausing the tenure clock, and an acknowledgment of “no business as usual” by administrators were thought to be effective policies in mitigating these negative impacts. This survey serves as a manifesto to what our professional community is currently experiencing, and should be used to inform academic policies directed at improving faculty productivity and welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3achildren 3aecology 3aevolutionary biology 3afemales 3apandemic 3asurveys1 aLaverty, Theresa M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1727-59431 aMa, Zhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9103-39960 tEcological applications.g2021 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.e2265-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.22653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100006000191245010600251300001400357520072800371592002801099653003801127653002201165653001501187653001501202700002201217700001901239700002101258700001901279700002501298700002001323700002101343700002301364700002101387700002101408700001901429700002001448773008401468856008401552852000901636655001201645IND60554989220221122010348.0170209e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055498922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.euprot.2016.01.0032doi7 aPMC59885892pmcid7 a299000982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVergara, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2396-767410aTranslating epithelial mesenchymal transition markers into the clinic: Novel insights from proteomics  ap. 31-41.  aThe growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may represent a potential source of clinical markers.

Four pairs of loci showed evidence of significant linkage disequilibrium and one locus deviated significantly from Hardy–Weinberg expectations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3agenomic libraries 3aheterozygosity 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats1 aArlyza, Irma S.1 aKarl, Stephen A.0 tConservation genetics resources.g2013 Dec., v. 5, no. 4 p.943-945dSpringer-Verlagx1877-72527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-013-9938-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03724naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012700171300001400298520192300312592002802235650001102263650002402274650002602298650001502324650001702339650001502356650001002371650001802381650001502399650001302414650001002427650002302437650001702460650002402477650001702501650002202518650002002540650001002560651002102570653002602591653002102617653003302638653002402671653002802695653002002723653003102743653002802774653001902802700002102821700005802842700002502900773011502925856008503040852000903125655001203134IND60598529920221118220612.0190705e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059852992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffman, Kira M.10aEcological legacies of fire detected using plot-level measurements and LiDAR in an old growth coastal temperate rainforest  ap. 11-20.  aVegetation succession following fire disturbances has long been of interest in ecology, but the evolution of landscape pattern and structure following low-severity ground fires is poorly understood. In coastal temperate rainforest ecosystems historic fire disturbances are not well documented and time since the most recent fire is largely unknown. We sampled 6000 tree cores from 27 forest plots that burned 124 years ago and 11 plots with no recent history of fire (within the last 1000 years) to understand the legacies of fire on forest stand structure in a British Columbia high-latitude coastal temperate rainforest. We assessed the timing and spatial extent of historic fires with a 700 year fire history reconstruction built from fire scars, and applied light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to ground-truth plot-level measurements. We sampled an additional 32 plots with known fire histories to validate the ability of LiDAR to detect and characterize historic fire legacies. In total, we sampled 70 plots for stem density, stand structure, and stand composition. Trees in burned plots were significantly taller, and the mean stem density was less than half that of unburned plots despite 124 years since the most recent fire. LiDAR analyses had similar results and also showed that burned plots had lower canopy cover and greater canopy complexity. Field-based measurements are still required to resolve differences in community structure and composition in our temperate rainforest study area. However, LiDAR may be an important tool to bridge the spatial information offered by plot-level measurements to larger area characterizations in the future. Our comparative analyses provide an improved understanding of fire legacies and temperate rainforest structure, which increases our ability to detect fire disturbances in heterogeneous forests and is important for forest resource management and conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acommunity structure 3aecological succession 3aecosystems 3afire history 3afire scars 3afires 3aforest stands 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3alidar 3aold-growth forests 3arain forests 3aresource management 3aspatial data 3astand composition 3astand structure 3atrees 3aBritish Columbia 0aAnthropogenic burning 0aBritish Columbia 0aCoastal temperate rainforest 0aEcological legacies 0aPlot-level measurements 0aGround-truthing 0aHistoric fire disturbances 0aAirborne laser scanning 0aRemote sensing1 aTrant, Andrew J.1 aNijland, Wiebe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2665-09471 aStarzomski, Brian M.0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 424 p.11-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245013600176300001400312520176600326592002802092650000802120650002202128650001302150650002502163650001402188650001602202650002102218650002002239650003102259650001402290650002302304650002002327650000902347650001802356650001202374650001402386653001002400653001302410653000802423653001002431700002202441700002602463700001902489773010602508856009002614852000902704655001202713IND60646693520221117223741.0190913e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064669352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2019.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElsayed, Doaa H.10aEffect of genistein on semen quality, antioxidant capacity, caspase-3 expression and DNA integrity in cryopreserved ram spermatozoa  ap. 50-55.  aThe present study aimed to assess the impacts of different concentrations of genistein on freezability and functional integrity of ram spermatozoa. Five ejaculates were collected from each ram (n = 6) twice weekly. Different levels of genistein (0, 1, 5, 10 and 100μM) were added to tris-egg yolk based extender (TBE) for extension and cryopreservation of semen. After thawing, samples were assessed for progressive forward motility (PFM), viability index, acrosomal and plasma membrane integrity. Furthermore, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), lipid peroxidation expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA), caspase-3 mRNA expression and comet assay for DNA integrity were estimated. PFM significantly (P < 0.05) lowered in 100 μM genistein at immediate, one and two hours post-thawing. However, post-thawing PFM at three hours significantly elevated (P < 0.05) in 10μM genistein concentration compared to that in control TBE and 100 μM genistein. Addition of 10μM genistein to TBE significantly (P < 0.05) upgraded viability index, acrosome integrity and plasma membrane integrity as compared to those in other treatments. Levels of TAC significantly (P<0.05) promoted in genistein (5, 10 and 100 μM). MDA significantly (P < 0.05) lowered in genistein (10 and 100 μM) than in control and 1 μM genistein. Caspase-3 expression revealed a significant (P < 0.001) fold (0.53 ± 0.09) decrease in semen supplemented by 10 μM genistein as compared to other treatments. DNA% in comet tail significantly promoted in 5 and 10 μM genistein groups. In conclusion, adding 10μM genistein to TBE ameliorated the criteria of cryopreserved ram semen as well as down regulated caspase-3 expression with maximal reduction in DNA fragmentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacrosome 3aantioxidant activity 3acaspase-3 3acomet assay 3acryopreservation 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenistein 3alipid peroxidation 3aplasma membrane 3arams 3asemen quality 3athawing 3aviability 0aComet 0aFreezing 0aRam 0aSemen1 aEl-Shamy, Ayat A.1 aAbdelrazek, Heba M.A.1 aEl-Badry, D.A.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2019 Aug., v. 177 p.50-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2019.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04261naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245011100183300001600294520213800310592002802448650002202476650002302498650002602521650002402547650002502571650001702596650001302613650001902626650002202645650001402667650001802681650001102699650004302710650003202753650002202785650002302807650004402830650001402874650003602888650005002924650001802974650003702992650006803029650002103097650002403118650002603142650002203168650004103190650002003231650002503251650002603276651000903302700001503311700001603326700001703342700001303359700001403372773011103386856008103497852000903578655001203587IND50067598020221118195152.0141111e20120106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006759802DNAL7 a220754542pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2011.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhami, H.R.10aCatechol alkenyls from Semecarpus anacardium: Acetylcholinesterase inhibition and binding mode predictions  ap. 142-148.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The fruits of Semecarpus anacardium L. f. (Anacardiaceae) are used in Ayurvedic medicine and also in Iranian Traditional Medicine for various indications, among those for retarding and treatment of dementia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The severity of Alzheimer's disease obviously correlates with a cholinergic deficit. In a screening for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, an extract from the fruit resin of Semecarpus anacardium was among the most active ones. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate the active compounds and to investigate them in detail. Their binding mode to the active site of AChE was investigated by in silico docking experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a dichloromethane extract in an activity-guided fractionation the active compounds were isolated under use of different chromatographic techniques. Their structures were unambiguously identified by one and two-dimensional ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry and their cholinesterase inhibitory activities were determined by a microplate assay. In order to compare the 3D active sites of AChE from Torpedo californica (TcAChE) and from Electrophorus electricus (EeAChE), three files from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were used and for docking experiments, GOLD 3.1 software was employed. The concentrations of active compounds in the extract and the fruits were determined by HPLC analysis. RESULTS: The active compounds were determined as 1′,2′-dihydroxy-3′-pentadec-8-enylbenzene (A) and 1′,2′-dihydroxy-3′-pentadeca-8,11-dienylbenzene (B). Their IC₅₀ values in an in vitro assay on AChE inhibition were determined as 12 and 34μg/mL, respectively, while they were not active in the inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). In silico docking experiments showed a similar bioactivity for compounds A and B. The concentration of compounds A and B in the fruits was 1.85% and 1.88%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the search for the active principle of the fruit resin of Semecarpus anacardium, compounds A and B were identified as two selective inhibitors for AChE versus BChE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aSemecarpus anacardium 3aTorpedo californica 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive sites 3acatechol 3acholinesterase 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3afractionation 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amass spectrometry 3amethylene chloride 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascreening 2aAcetylcholinesterasexchemistry 2aAlkenesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aBinding Sites 2aButyrylcholinesterasexchemistry 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aFruitxchemistry 2aMedicine, Ayurvedic 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aModels, Molecular 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Conformation 2aSemecarpusxchemistry 0aIran1 aLinder, T.1 aKaehlig, H.1 aSchuster, D.1 aZehl, M.1 aKrenn, L.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 Jan. 6, v. 139, no. 1 p.142-148dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2011.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01950naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245012700157300001300284500002000297520060300317592002800920650002200948650002000970650002500990650001101015650001001026650001001036650001801046650002401064650002301088650001501111651002101126651001801147700002301165700002001188700002101208700001601229700002001245700001901265773014001284856007101424852000901495655001201504IND60679817620221121052045.0200101e197702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067981762DNAL7 a10.2307/12396042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlepper, Robert10aEconomic Performance and Energy Intensiveness on Organic and Conventional Farms in the Corn Belt: A Preliminary Comparison  ap. 1-12.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent energy and environmental problems in U.S. agriculture have stimulated interest in alternative technologies or systems of agricultural production.

HHP improved the conformational stability, reticular deformability and the energy stability of hydrogen bonds in junction zones of the glucomannan matrix for lot A gels. For lot L gels, 600 MPa was needed to increase the energy content of physical bonds enhancing the solid-like character of the glucomannan matrix. Thermal profiles of pressurized lot A gels exhibited thermophobic behaviour and increased the gel-like character up to 90°C as compared with its unpressurized control. For Lot L gels, the rubber-like response was also shown at T > 70°C for the unpressurized sample, and was maintained at 100, 200, and 600 MPa.  aThis work was supported by the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas for Postdoctoral Scholarship JAE-DOC-2011 [grant number AGL2011-24693].

In this study, we identified an ADF6 gene in upland cotton (designated as GhADF6) that is evidently involved in cotton's response to the fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae. GhADF6 binds to actin filaments and possesses actin severing and depolymerizing activities in vitro and in vivo. When cotton root (the site of the fungus invasion) was inoculated with the pathogen, the expression of GhADF6 was markedly down‐regulated in the epidermal cells. By virus‐induced gene silencing analysis, the down‐regulation of GhADF6 expression rendered the cotton plants tolerant to V. dahliae infection. Accordingly, the abundance of actin filaments and bundles in the root cells was significantly higher than that in the control plant, which phenocopied that of the V. dahliae‐challenged wild‐type cotton plant. Altogether, our results provide evidence that an increase in filament actin (F‐actin) abundance as well as dynamic actin remodelling are required for plant defence against the invading pathogen, which are likely to be fulfilled by the coordinated expressional regulation of the actin‐binding proteins, including ADF.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDB11040600cthe Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  aU31671278cNational Basic Research Priorities Program 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aactin 3acotton 3afungi 3agenes 3apathogens 3aplant pathology1 aZhong, Mengmeng1 aLi, Yuanbao1 aZhang, Ruihui1 aSu, Lei1 aXia, Guixian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4426-97841 aWang, Haiyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9071-43460 tMolecular plant pathology.g2021 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.1656-1667dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.131373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03955naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245016100199520212100360592002802481650003402509650001502543650001802558650001902576650001902595650001902614650002802633650002102661650002102682650003202703650001602735650003102751650001002782650001702792650002602809650001402835650001302849650001502862650001702877653002502894653002702919653001302946653002802959653002202987700001203009700001703021700001803038700002003056700001103076700001403087700001303101700001303114700001903127773011603146856008203262852000903344655001203353IND60713910520221119163908.0220103e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071391052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2020.1134602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0683-012310aQuantitative proteomics reveals Shexiang Baoxin Pill exerts cardioprotective effects by preserving energy metabolism in a rat model of myocardial infarction  aShexiang Baoxin Pill (SBP) is a composite formula of traditional Chinese medicine used to treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the clinic. However, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect on CVD has not been clearly elucidated yet.The aim of this study was to investigate the potential cardioprotective mechanism of SBP in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) model rats by applying proteomic approach.The rat model of MI was generated by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Eighteen rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 6 each): the MI group, MI group treated with SBP (SBP), and sham-operated group (SOG). Cardiac function in the experimental groups was assessed by echocardiography analyses after 15 days of treatment. A label-free quantitative proteomic approach was utilized to investigate the whole proteomes of heart tissues from the groups above on the day of the operation (Day 0) and 15 days later (Day 15). The differentially expressed proteins were subsequently analyzed with bioinformatic methods. Additionally, the expression levels of two promising proteins were validated by Western blotting.The echocardiography analyses showed that SBP treatment significantly preserved the cardiac function of MI rats. Additionally, quantitative proteomics identified 389 differentially expressed proteins, and 15 proteins were considered as logical candidates for explaining the cardioprotective effect of SBP. Bioinformatic analysis of these differentially expressed proteins revealed that the proteins involved in cellular mitochondrial energy metabolism processes, such as fatty acid beta-oxidation and aerobic respiration, were significantly regulated under SBP treatment, of which fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) and myoglobin (MB) were significantly downregulated in the MI model group compared with the SOG group and returned to the basal level with SBP treatment, confirmed by Western blotting.The results of our study suggest that the cardioprotective effects of SBP are achieved through the preservation of energy metabolism in the heart tissue of MI rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aaerobiosis 3aanimal models 3abeta oxidation 3abioinformatics 3acardiac output 3acardioprotective effect 3acoronary vessels 3aechocardiography 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3afatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3aheart 3amitochondria 3amyocardial infarction 3amyoglobin 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atherapeutics 0aShexiang baoxin pill 0aCardiovascular disease 0aLC-MS/MS 0aQuantitative proteomics 0aEnergy metabolism1 aYu, Yue1 aTian, Saisai1 aZhou, Yanting1 aChen, Xiangling1 aYe, Ji1 aLiu, Qian1 aXu, Xike1 aZhou, Hu1 aZhang, Weidong0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 266 p.113460-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1134603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011700165300001600282520155200298592002801850650001401878650001801892650001301910650001501923650001401938650001701952650001201969650001101981650001801992650002402010650002602034650001002060650002102070650001402091650002202105650001102127650002502138650001102163650001602174651001902190651001502209700001702224700001702241700001802258773013702276856004802413852000902461655001202470IND50089271720221121024809.0140503e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008927172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-014-3068-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Songyao10aMacrobenthic community structure and species composition in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea in jellyfish bloom  ap. 576-594.  aTo understand the characteristics of macrobenthic structures and the relationship between environment and benthic assemblages in jellyfish bloom, we studied the macrobenthos and related environmental factors in the coastal waters of the Yellow Sea and East China Sea. Data were collected during two seasonal cruises in April and August of 2011, and analyzed with multivariate statistical methods. Up to 306 macrobenthic species were registered from the research areas, including 115 species of Polychaeta, 78 of Crustacea, 61 of Mollusca, 30 of Echinodermata, and 22 of other groups. Nine polychaete species occurred at frequencies higher than 25% from the sampling stations: Lumbrineris longifolia, Notomastus latericeus, Ninöe palmata, Ophelina acuminata, Nephtys oligobranchia, Onuphis geophiliformis, Glycera chirori, Terebellides stroemii, and Aricidea fragilis. Both the average biomass and abundance of macrobenthos are higher in August (23.8 g/m² and 237.7 ind./m²) than those in April (11.3 g/m² and 128 ind./m²); the dissimilarity of macrobenthic structures among stations is as high as 70%. In terms of the dissimilarity values, we divided the stations into four clusters in spring and eight in summer. The ABC curve shows that the macrofauna communities in high jellyfish abundance were not changed. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that depth, temperature, median grain size, total organic carbon of sediment and total nitrogen in sediment were important factors affecting the macrozoobenthic community in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aEchinodermata 3aMollusca 3aPolychaeta 3aScyphozoa 3abenthic zone 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acoastal water 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3anitrogen content 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3astatistical analysis 3asummer 3atemperature 3aEast China Sea 3aYellow Sea1 aLi, Xinzheng1 aWang, Hongfa1 aZhang, Baolin0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2014 May, v. 32, no. 3 p.576-594dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-014-3068-8  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100005800191245008800249300001400337520073200351592002801083653001201111653002301123653001001146653001901156653001801175653002501193700002301218773008401241856008401325852000901409655001201418IND60554989720221122010551.0170209e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055498972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.euprot.2016.01.0082doi7 aPMC59886122pmcid7 a299001022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aP.G., Vathsala1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8334-780814aThe identification of FERM domain protein in serum infected with Plasmodium berghei  ap. 59-62.  aMalaria continues to affect 500 million people worldwide every year.

The extraordinary skeleton structure of MOFs provides many possibilities for incorporation of diverse basic functionalities, which is unachievable for conventional solid bases. The past decade has witnessed remarkable advances in this vibrant research area; however, MOFs for heterogeneous basic catalysis have never been reviewed until now. Therefore, a review summarizing MOFs-derived base catalysts is highly expected. In this review, we present an overview of the recent progress in MOFs-derived solid bases covering preparation, characterization, and catalytic applications. In the preparation section, the solid bases are divided into two categories, namely, MOFs with intrinsic basicity and MOFs with modified basicity. The basicity can originate from either metal sites or organic ligands. Different approaches used for generation of basic sites are included, and each approach is described with representative examples. The fundamental principles for the design and fabrication of MOFs with basic functionalities are featured. In the characterization section, experimental techniques and theoretical calculations employed for characterization of basic MOFs are summarized. Some representive experimental techniques, such as temperature-programmed desorption of CO₂ (CO₂-TPD) and infrared (IR) spectra of different probing molecules, are covered. Following preparation and characterization, the catalytic applications of MOFs-derived solid bases are dealt with. These solid bases have potential to catalyze some well-known “base-catalyzed reactions” like Knoevenagel condensation, aldol condensation, and Michael addition. Meanwhile, in contrast to conventional solid bases, MOFs show some different catalytic properties due to their special structural and surface properties. Remarkably, characteristic features of MOFs-derived solid bases are described by comparing with conventional inorganic counterparts, keeping in mind the current opportunities and challenges in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acondensation reactions 3acoordination polymers 3adesorption 3aligands1 aLiu, Xiao-Qin1 aJiang, Hai-Long1 aSun, Lin-Bing0 tChemical Reviews.g2017 June 28, v. 117, no. 12 p.8129-8176dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.chemrev.7b000913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01574naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008700165300001600252500001500268520036100283592002800644650001300672650001500685650000900700650001200709650001800721650001000739650001600749650001600765650001200781651001500793653001300808653001300821653001100834653001400845653001700859653002400876700003100900773011800931856008201049852000901131655001201140IND60516783920221118090027.0190729e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051678392DNAL7 a10.1017/S00242829120003452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErtz, Damien,10aPlectocarpon dirinariae (Arthoniales), a new lichenicolous species from Cape Verde  ap. 591-593.  a2019-12-06  aPlectocarpon dirinariae Ertz & van den Boom is described from Cape Verde from the thallus of saxicolous Dirinaria applanata.

These loci will be helpful for better understanding of genetic background of miiuy croaker.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3acathepsin D 3agenetic background 3agenetic markers 3aheterozygosity 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymerase chain reaction1 aMa, Hongyu1 aMa, Lingbo1 aLi, Shujuan1 aJiang, Wei0 tConservation genetics resources.g2013 Dec., v. 5, no. 4 p.947-949dSpringer-Verlagx1877-72527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-013-9939-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011900172520142600291592002801717650001501745650002101760650003301781650002501814653003501839653002301874653001301897653003301910653003301943773011101976856008302087852000902170655001202179IND60728977220221116162439.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072897722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2021.1162362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Esteban, A.10aMembrane-protected molecularly imprinted polymers: Towards selectivity improvement of liquid-phase microextraction  aSample preparation is still considered the bottle-neck of the whole analytical process. Nowadays, several sample preparation techniques are available, however all of them suffer from lack of the selectivity. At this regard, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are considered excellent materials able to perform selective extractions. Recently, new objectives in sample preparation have been set, including to use smaller initial sample sizes; to facilitate automation; and, to minimize the amount of glassware and organic solvents needed. MIP incorporation to other microextraction techniques offers a new strategy in order to fulfil current sample preparation requirements. However, even using MIPs, the complexity of the sample can affect recoveries of target analytes, negatively affecting the analytical method precision and accuracy. The use of a porous membrane, as a protective sleeve, is one of the simplest approaches to circumvent the difficulties mentioned above in the analysis of complex and “dirty” samples. Accordingly, the present paper pretends to provide an overview of micro-extraction approaches developed during last years based on the use of membrane-protected MIPs and how such approaches have open new pathways in the development of liquid phase micro-extraction methods with improved analytical characteristics. Advantages, drawbacks and future expected trends are also critically assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3achemical species 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amolecular imprinting 0aMolecularly imprinted polymers 0aSample preparation 0aMembrane 0aMicro-solid-phase extraction 0aLiquid-phase microextraction0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2021 May, v. 138 p.116236-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2021.1162363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245006600178300001600244520057200260592002800832650001500860650001500875650002200890650002300912650001200935650001600947650002800963650002300991651002001014651001601034653001701050653002101067653001201088653002401100653001301124773011701137856008201254852000901336655001201345IND60516784220221118090238.0190729e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051678422DNAL7 a10.1017/S00242829120003572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKantvilas, G.q(Gintaras),10aFurther new species of Menegazzia (Parmeliaceae, Lecanorales)  ap. 795-800.  aThree new species of Menegazzia are described and illustrated, and their relationships and affinities to other species in the genus discussed.

Samples were analyzed for 10 elements (Al, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, Sb, Tl, and Pb) as well as Pb isotopic composition to characterize temporal variations in elemental concentration levels, and to identify the potential source regions of atmospheric pollutants transported over the remote East China Sea. The results showed that the annual average element concentrations were lowest compared to those at different sites in East Asia, suggesting a very clean background area of IORS, with values ranging from 114 ng m⁻³ for Al to 0.045 ng m⁻³ for Tl. Concentrations averaged seasonally for all the elements revealed the highest levels occurring between winter and spring, and the lowest levels in summer. High enrichment factors (EF) of more than 100 for trace elements suggest that these elements originated mostly from anthropogenic sources. Coupling the Pb isotopic composition with a back trajectory analysis identified the potential source regions for each sample. Our approach identified China as a dominant contributor affecting atmospheric composition changes at IORS, the remote area of the East China Sea. As the largest anthropogenic emission source in East Asia, China contributed to almost 100% of the elemental concentration levels in winter and spring, ∼53% in summer and ∼63% in autumn. Because IORS's ambient air is sensitive to even slight changes in pollutant loading due to the significantly low pollution levels, long-term monitoring of air quality at IORS will provide invaluable information on the progress and efforts of atmospheric pollution management linked to emission controls in East Asian countries, especially China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aaluminum 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aautumn 3acadmium 3acopper 3airon 3alead 3amolybdenum 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3apollution load 3aspring 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3azinc 3aChina 3aEast China Sea 0aAtmospheric pollution 0aEast Asia 0aTrace elements 0aPb isotopes 0aAnthropogenic sources1 aHan, Changhee1 aShin, Daechol1 aHur, Soon Do1 aJun, Seong Joon1 aKim, Young-Taeg1 aByun, Do-Seong1 aHong, Sungmin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Dec., v. 231 p.154-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003000134024002200164024001900186040001800205100002400223245008800247506007600335506017300411520027100584506003700855650002800892650001300920650002200933650002500955650001600980650001700996651001301013700002401026700002401050700002301074700002301097700002101120773010001141856007601241956015401317961000901471852000901480655001201489IND60683772820221214230904.0190715e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068377282DNAL7 a10113/68377282hdl7 a3626282aris7 a10.1128/MRA.00436-192doi7 aPMC66069052pmcid7 a312701912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoraichuk, Iryna V.10aFirst Complete Genome Sequences of a Subgenotype Vd Newcastle Disease Virus Isolate  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA Newcastle disease virus was isolated from a chicken from a live birdmarket in the Mbeya region of Tanzania.

Plant seeding of JN17 (a popular winter wheat cultivar) was grown in saltless (âS) and saline (+S, 100 mM NaCl) conditions combined with charcoal-filtered air (CF, < 5 ppb O3) and elevated O3 (+O3, 80 Â± 5 ppb, 8 h dayâ1) for 30 d. O3 significantly reduced net photosynthetic rate (PN), stomatal conductance, chlorophyll contents and plant biomass in -S treatment, but no considerable differences were noted in those parameters between +O3+S and CF+S treatments. O3-induced loss in cellular membrane integrity was significant in -S plants, but not in +S plants evidenced by significant elevations being measured in electrolyte leakage (EL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in -S plants, but not in +S plants. Both O3 and salinity increased proline content and stimulated antioxidant enzymes activities. Soluble protein increased by salinity but decreased by O3. Abscisic acid (ABA) was significantly elevated by O3 in -S plants but not in +S plants. The results of this study suggested that the specificity of different agricultural environments should be considered in order to develop reliable prediction models on O3 damage to wheat plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabscisic acid 3aair 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aenzymes 3agas exchange 3agreenhouses 3amalondialdehyde 3amodels 3aozone 3aphotosynthesis 3aplasma membrane 3apollution 3aprediction 3aproline 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3asowing 3astomatal conductance 3awinter wheat1 aLi, Y.

TRISO coatings consist of four layers of pyrolytic carbon and silicon carbide that are deposited on uranium ceramic fuel kernels (350μm – 500μm diameters) in a concatenated series of batch depositions. Each layer has dedicated functions such that the finished fuel particle has its own integral containment to minimize and control the release of fission products into the fuel body and reactor core. The TRISO coatings are the primary containment structure in the HTGR reactor and must have very high uniformity and integrity.To ensure high quality TRISO coatings, the four layers are deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using high purity precursors and are applied in a concatenated succession of batch operations before the finished product is unloaded from the coating furnace. These depositions take place at temperatures ranging from 1230°C to 1550°C and use three different gas compositions, while the fuel particle diameters double, their density drops from11.1g/cm³ to 3.0g/cm³, and the bed volume increases more than 8-fold. All this is accomplished without the aid of sight ports or internal instrumentation that could cause chemical contamination within the layers or mechanical damage to thin layers in the early stages of each layer deposition.The converging section of the furnace retort was specifically designed to prevent bed stagnation that would lead to unacceptably high defect fractions and facilitate bed circulation to avoid large variability in coating layer dimensions and properties. The gas injection nozzle was designed to protect precursor gases from becoming overheated prior to injection, to induce bed spouting and preclude bed stagnation in the bottom of the retort. Furthermore, the retort and injection nozzle designs minimize buildup of pyrocarbon and silicon carbide on the retort wall and manage nozzle orifice accretions.

As these slugs are ecologically associated with buoyant bull‐kelp (Durvillaea), and are known to raft, we predicted that they would show evidence of recent genetic connectivity among isolated landmasses. LOCATION: Cool‐temperate and subantarctic coasts of the Southern Hemisphere (New Zealand and its subantarctic islands, southern Chile, and the Falkland Islands). METHODS: We employed two commonly used genetic marker types – mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) – to resolve phylogeographical and population genetic structuring of Onchidella populations on a transoceanic scale. RESULTS: Contrary to previous taxonomic views that classify these Southern Ocean Onchidella as at least three separate species, our genetic data suggest that the studied populations belong to a single taxon, whose distribution is widespread. The analyses reveal substantial mtDNA differentiation between several mainland New Zealand populations (e.g. Kaikoura, Purakaunui Bay), apparently consistent with low rates of dispersal. However, subantarctic samples show widely shared mitochondrial haplotypes and AFLP similarity between distant populations. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests recent common ancestry for geographically separated New Zealand subantarctic and South American populations of Onchidella. Their transoceanic similarities are likely to have been driven by passive rafting mediated by circumpolar ocean currents, as previously documented for several epifaunal species strongly associated with buoyant Durvillaea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDurvillaea 3aGastropoda 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aancestry 3acoasts 3agenetic markers 3ahaplotypes 3aislands 3amitochondrial DNA 3aslugs 3awater currents 3aChile 3aFalkland Islands 3aNew Zealand1 aNikula, R.1 aSpencer, H.

The tabulated spectra and chromatograms were interpreted using principal component analysis (PCA). The samples were crude fast pyrolysis oils from different wood feedstock, bio-oils made by liquefaction of lignin (lignin-to-liquid, LtL), hydrodeoxygenated (HDO) and more extensively hydrotreated (HT) fast pyrolysis oils and some petroleum based fuels. The major trend is that the crude pyrolysis oils from different laboratories and feedstock are relatively similar in composition, and different from the LtL, HDO and HT oils and the petroleum based fuels. However, pyrolysis oils made of mixtures of spruce, bark and needles are particularly influenced by the presence of needles, the latter gives relatively more low-molecular weight compounds. The different LtL oils are relatively similar in composition and similar to fast pyrolysis oils stabilized by moderate hydrodeoxygenation, although there are two groups of LtL oils depending on whether ethanol or water was used as a reaction medium. Significant upgrading of the crude pyrolysis oils is required to reach fuel quality. Also, the LtL and HDO oils require further upgrading. It is recommended that further fuel specific analyses are carried out after further upgrading and subsequent fractionation of the upgraded bio-oils into for example gasoline and diesel fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abark 3abiofuels 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3afractionation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agasoline 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3aliquefaction 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyrolysis 3awood1 aNeverdal, Gunhild0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2014 Apr. 17, v. 28, no. 4 p.2617-2623dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef402526a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01260naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245015800152300001800310520021500328592002800543650002300571650002700594650002300621650002900644650001100673700001300684700001300697700001900710773013400729856007400863852000900937655001200946IND60659226320221122024433.0190819e20120220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065922632DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc30242j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Kun10aAmine-catalyzed formal (3 + 3) annulations of 2-(acetoxymethyl)buta-2,3-dienoate with sulfur ylides: synthesis of 4H-pyrans bearing a vinyl sulfide group  ap. 2900-2902.  aA DABCO-catalyzed (3 + 3) annulation between 2-(acetoxymethyl)buta-2,3-dienoate and sulfur ylides has been developed, which provides a facile method for the synthesis of 4H-pyrans bearing a vinyl sulfide group.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3asulfur1 aHu, Jian1 aLiu, Hui1 aTong, Xiaofeng0 tChemical communications.g2012 Feb. 20, v. 48, no. 23 p.2900-2902dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc30242j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245017000161300001600331500001900347520152600366592002801892650002601920650002601946650001901972650002701991650003602018650002402054650001502078650001702093650001402110650001302124650002902137650001402166650001402180650001502194650001002209650001302219650000902232700002402241700002302265700001902288700004302307773015802350856007302508852000902581655001202590IND60741376320221122080735.0210612e20210611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074137632DNAL7 a10.1638/2020-00602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReady, Zachary C.10aTotal ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy (teca-lbo) in atlantic harbor seals (phoca vitulina concolor) for successful surgical management of otitis media  ap. 827-837.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChronic, severe otitis media was diagnosed in four Atlantic harbor seals (Phoca vitulina concolor), three of which were stranded animals undergoing rehabilitation. All seals presented with unilateral purulent aural discharge that would intermittently recur despite prolonged topical and systemic antimicrobial therapy. Aerobic culture from aural discharge isolated multidrug-resistant organisms in all seals, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and/or Enterococcus faecalis. Computed tomography was used in three cases to confirm otitis media and positive contrast ear canalography was used in one case to confirm tympanic membrane rupture. Given the persistent nature of otitis, surgical intervention in the form of a total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy (TECA-LBO) was indicated. Surgery was successful in achieving complete clinical resolution of otitis in all seals. Postoperative complications included temporary unilateral paralysis of the left nare (2/4) and a transient left ptosis (1/4). Partial to complete surgical site dehiscence occurred in all cases; however, complete healing was achieved by second intention in 60 d or less. One rehabilitated seal was fitted with a satellite tag that confirmed normal swimming and diving patterns post release. In harbor seals, TECA-LBO can be performed safely to treat persistent cases of otitis media and should be considered in cases of chronic otitis that are not responsive to medical management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPhoca vitulina 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus pseudintermedius 3acomputed tomography 3adehiscence 3adrug therapy 3aear canal 3amedicine 3amultiple drug resistance 3aosteotomy 3aparalysis 3asatellites 3aseals 3awildlife 3azoos1 aFlower, Jennifer E.1 aCollins, Joshua E.1 aKochin, Edward1 aWilliams, C.

Compared with the traditional hydrocyclone, the novel cyclone reactor consists of two inlets, one for the light phase and one for the heavy phase. The light phase is injected into the reactor through two symmetric tangential slots in the inlet, while the heavy phase inlet is an axial entry with a guide vane. The trajectory and residence time distribution (RTD) of the light phase could influence the reaction process and product quality. In order to study the contact-mixing and separation mechanism of liquid-liquid in the novel cyclone reactor, the trajectory and residence time distribution in the reactor were investigated. Simulations using the species transport equation and experiments were performed on kerosene-water system. The tangential and radial dispersion process of oil was observed in the simulations. The simulation results showed that the mean residence time of the oil is between 0.6s and 1.0s under different operating parameters. The kerosene flow in the reactor is not a smooth flow or a complete mixing flow judging from the dimensionless variance. The separation efficiency in the simulated method was higher than 99%. The volume fraction of water in the overflow mixture was less than 5%. The deviation between the simulated and experimental results was no more than 5%, which indicated that the simulated results are reliable and accurate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3abutanes 3aequations 3aionic liquids 3akerosene 3amixing 3aoils 3apowders 3aproduct quality 3avariance 0aIsobutane alkylation 0aCyclone reactor 0aSpecies transport 0aTrajectory 0aRTD 0aSeparation efficiency1 aZhang, Tianyu1 aWang, Zhenbo1 aZhu, Liyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1674-73151 aJin, Youhai0 tPowder technology.g2017 July 01, v. 316 p.289-295dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01611naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011100165300001800276520059800294592002800892650001200920650001100932650001100943650001400954700002300968700002000991700001301011700005901024773012101083856008401204852000901288655001201297IND60757024020221118180224.0211120e20211105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075702402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c033712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanbang10aIsocyanide-Induced Annulation Leading to Cyclopento-, Methano-, and Cyclopentano-[60]Fullerene Derivatives  ap. 8867-8872.  aThe three-component annulation reactions of C₆₀, alkyl isocyanide, and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) or unsymmetric alkynes are investigated to afford cyclopent-2-en-1-imino- and ketenimine methano-[60]fullerene derivatives, which, upon hydration in the presence of acid, yield the corresponding fullerene amides.

The silica oxides obtained can be used in a number of technological applications. As of yet, these particles cannot be used efficiently because of the lack of research into the relationship between the bioprocess and the shape and size of the particles. The aim of this study is to synthesize silica particles by red wiggler worms using three different grasses: Equisetum hyemale, Zea mays nixtamalized, and Otatea ramirezii and to characterize the obtained particles. However, it is unclear whether the use of diverse systems causes changes in the morphology of the final product. We found that silica particles can be produced by the three studied systems. Furthermore, each system showed a different polymorphism. We demonstrated that the new materials are mesoporous with a low surface area (9–22m²g⁻¹), but each have one specific crystal arrangement. The silicas were characterized by several techniques, namely Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, atomic-force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquisetum hyemale 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aZea mays 3aatomic force microscopy 3abioprocessing 3aearthworms 3agrasses 3alight scattering 3anixtamalization 3aporous media 3apowders 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asurface area 3avermicomposting 0aGrasses 0aSilica particles 0aVermicomposting 0aWarm 0aBiological systems1 aMuñoz, Susana Vargas1 aMartínez, Andrea Ruíz1 aHernández, Valentina Segovia1 aSaucedo, Alejandra Vargas1 aCervantes, Eric Reyes1 aRodríguez Talavera, Rogelio,1 aRivera, Margarita1 adel Pilar Carreón Castro, María0 tPowder technology.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 310 p.205-212dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245006000181300001200241520173700253592002801990650002202018650002102040650002802061650001402089650002402103650002002127650001302147650002102160650001302181650000802194650002802202650002102230650002202251650001602273650001602289650001202305700001902317700002002336773010202356856008602458852000902544655001202553IND60630886820221123011339.0190214e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063088682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.09.1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayer-Giraldi, Maddalena10a142 Ice growth in the presence of an antifreeze protein  ap. 438.  aAntifreeze proteins (AFPs) have evolved in cold-adapted organisms to control ice crystal growth when exposed to sub-zero temperature conditions. It has been suggested that the effect of the proteins results in small ice crystal size, thus avoiding the mechanical damage to frozen tissues and cells caused by large ice grains. The polar diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus, a dominant species within sea-ice assemblages, produces AFPs. We expressed in E. coli a recombinant form of this protein and isolated it by affinity chromatography. We studied its effect on ice grain size after shock-freezing and subsequent annealing, and under slow freezing conditions. Shock-freezing (−40°C) produced small sized crystals, and during annealing at −4°C AFPs successfully inhibited recrystallization already at low concentrations (1.2μM), as observed at light microscopy and using the Otago optical recrystallometer. However, slow ice growth at −5°C, more likely to resemble natural freezing conditions, surprisingly resulted in the formation of larger crystals in the presence of AFPs than in the negative controls. Further characteristic microstructural features, such as gradual c-axis transition within individual grains and sublimation etching patterns, were observed under crossed polarizers and at light microscopy. These features are possibly due to the incorporation of proteins into the ice lattice during growth, causing local defects.Our observations remain to be clarified, but should be taken into account when considering the biological role of AFPs as well as potential industrial applications of the proteins.Source of funding: Public funding by German AiF/IGF.Conflict of interest: None declared.maddalena.bayer@awi.de  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aEscherichia coli 3aaffinity chromatography 3aannealing 3aantifreeze proteins 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adominant species 3afreezing 3aice 3aindustrial applications 3alight microscopy 3amechanical damage 3asublimation 3atemperature 3atissues1 aWeikusat, Ilka1 aIsert, Cornelia0 tCryobiology.g2013 Dec., v. 67, no. 3 p.438-438dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.09.1483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245009000181300001600271520147700287592002801764650001701792650001901809650002501828650002801853653002501881653002701906653002701933700002601960700003901986773020602025856008702231852000902318655001202327IND60600644820221118094108.0180703e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060064482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNegri, Rogério Galante13aAn innovative support vector machine based method for contextual image classification  ap. 241-248.  aSeveral remote sensing studies have adopted the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method for image classification. Although the original formulation of the SVM method does not incorporate contextual information, there are different proposals to incorporate this type of information into it. Usually, these proposals modify the SVM training phase or make an integration of SVM classifications using stochastic models. This study presents a new perspective on the development of contextual SVMs. The main concept of this proposed method is to use the contextual information to displace the separation hyperplane, initially defined by the traditional SVM. This displaced hyperplane could cause a change of the class initially assigned to the pixel. To evaluate the classification effectiveness of the proposed method a case study is presented comparing the results with the standard SVM and the SVM post-processed by the mode (majority) filter. An ALOS/PALSAR image, PLR mode, acquired over an Amazon area was used in the experiment. Considering the inner area of test sites, the accuracy results obtained by the proposed method is better than SVM and similar to SVM post-processed by the mode filter. The proposed method, however, produces better results than mode post-processed SVM when considering the classification near the edges between regions. One drawback of the method is the computational cost of the proposed method is significantly greater than the compared methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aremote sensing 3astochastic processes 3asupport vector machines 0aImage classification 0aContextual information 0aSupport vector machine1 aDutra, Luciano Vieira1 aSant’Anna, Sidnei João Siqueira0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2014 Jan., v. 87 p.241-248dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In 2014, the wetland was irregularly flooded during high flows in the stream, in 2015, the stream bed was cleaned and as a result the water level dropped down by about 0.5 m, thus no flooding occurred. In 2016, the stream was blocked and water was permanently diverted into a wetland dominated by Phalaris arundinacea, Carex nigra and Scirpus sylvaticus. The results clearly revealed a positive role of permanent flooding resulting in the highest removal of all monitored parameters, i.e. nitrogen (38%), phosphorus (40%), BOD5 (42%) and suspended solids (67%). The permanent flooding increased aboveground biomass of P. arundinacea and C. nigra while S. sylvaticus was eliminated by permanent flooding. The repeated harvest yielded higher aboveground biomass for P. australis and S. sylvaticus, while for C. nigra one harvest provided more biomass. In 2016, the removal expressed as the loading averaged 1102 kg TN ha−1 yr−1 and 894 kg NO3-N ha−1 yr−1 and the plant uptake was responsible for removal of 36.1% TN. The average removal of total phosphorus amounted to 164 kg P ha−1 yr−1 with plant uptake being responsible for 18.7%. Average removal of BOD5, COD and TSS amounted to 1108, 5953 and 9220 kg ha−1 yr−1, respectively. While the removal of BOD5 and COD increased exponentially with increasing water temperature, removal of TSS was not affected by water temperature. The results proved that slightly modified natural wetlands with negligible investment costs can be as effective as fully constructed wetlands to treat agricultural drainage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex nigra 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aScirpus sylvaticus 3aaboveground biomass 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3acleaning 3aconstructed wetlands 3adrainage 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3astream channels 3atotal suspended solids 3awater temperature 0aWetland 0aAgricultural drainage 0aPermanent flooding 0aNitrogen 0aPhosphorus1 aDvořáková Březinová, Tereza0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 643 p.52-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.1483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009400167300001800261520051600279592002800795650001400823650001100837650001500848650001600863650001500879650001200894700002000906700001500926700001900941700006100960700005401021700005701075773012101132856008401253852000901337655001201346IND60757024220221118180246.0211120e20211029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075702422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c033832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Ranmaru10aSynthesis of Seven-Membered Cross-Conjugated Cyclic Trienes by 8π Electrocyclic Reaction  ap. 8878-8882.  aA method for the synthesis of 3-methylene-1,4-cycloheptadiene derivatives via an 8π electrocyclization reaction was developed.

In China, this cereal is frequently mentioned in ancient texts as being used in food, medicine, and alcoholic beverages. It also assumed significance in dynastic legends. However, unlike other cereals, Job's tears' dispersal and domestication process remain unclear. The macrofossil remains of this plant have only been found sporadically at about seven sites from the Neolithic to the Han dynasty (ca. 7000-1800 cal BP); but its microfossil remains have been recovered from more than 30 sites across China, ranging from tropical to temperate zones, and dating to as early as 28,000 cal. BP. This discrepancy between macrofossil and microfossil findings poses a challenge to archaeobotanists. This paper presents a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate the depositional processes of Job's tears in archaeological contexts, including ethnographic observation, starch and phytolith analyses, use-wear analysis of stone tools, and experimental charring. We propose methods for identifying its microfossil remains, which may help to explore the possible pathways of its domestication in the future.Based on current archaeological data, Job's tears was already collected as a starchy food source by Upper Paleolithic populations in China by 28,000 cal BP, but it may have largely disappeared during the cold and dry episode of Younger Dryas in a large part of north China. While this plant appears to have been exploited during the early Holocene in the Huai and Yangzi river regions, no evidence indicates its presence in the temperate zones north of the Yellow river until after 8000 cal. BP. The reasons for such changes still need to be investigated. However, it is noted that Job's tears became widespread in the Neolithic period, coinciding in time and space with the development of millet domestication over a broad region in the Yellow River and Liao River valleys. This plant may have been a component of farming practices during the mid-Holocene climatic maximum in China, but more comprehensive analyses need to be done to investigate its domestication process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoix lacryma-jobi 3aHolocene epoch 3aalcoholic beverages 3aanthropology 3acold 3adomestication 3afarming systems 3amicrofossils 3amillets 3aphytoliths 3ariver valleys 3arivers 3astarch 3asubtropics 3atemperate zones 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aCoix lacryma-jobi 0aStarch granules 0aPhytoliths 0aCharred seeds 0aUse-wear analysis 0aExperimental archaeology1 aDuncan, Neil A.1 aChen, Xingcan1 aCui, Jianxin0 tQuaternary international.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 529 p.25-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011200163300002000275520184300295592002802138650001302166650001702179650002202196650002302218650002302241650001302264650001402277650001502291700001402306700001202320700001702332773012902349856008202478852000902560655001202569IND60565971120221122020416.0170330e20151119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056597112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b073492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiangfu10aN-Type Alcohol-Soluble Small Molecules as an Interfacial Layer for Efficient and Stable Polymer Solar Cells  ap. 25887-25897.  aThree novel n-type alcohol-soluble small molecule electrolytes (n-SMEs) based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) backbone functionalized with different polar groups (diethylamino, diethanolamino, quaternary ammonium), called DPPN, DPPNOH, and DPPNBr, respectively, have been designed and synthesized, respectively. Thanks to the chemical interaction with zinc oxide (ZnO), the n-SMEs can be easily deposited on the ZnO surface, and then we modified ZnO defects, fine-tuned the work function of ZnO, and simultaneously improved the compatibility at the ZnO/active layer inorganic/organic interface. Moreover, the n-type feature of the backbone in the n-SMEs also facilitates the electron transfer. Consequently, these n-SME-modified ZnO can serve as an efficient electron-transporting layer (ETL) in inverted polymer solar cells (I-PSCs). Inspiringly, the device based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl-C₆₁ butyric acid methyl ester (PC₆₁BM) with ZnO/DPPNOH as ETL delivers a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.0%, which is a 38% enhancement compared to the control device with pure ZnO as an ETL. The devices based on ZnO/DPPNBr and ZnO/DPPN as ETLs also display the improved PCE of 3.7% and 3.1%, respectively. The enhancement of the PCE at different degrees is mainly caused by the various interactions between ZnO and the diverse polar group in the n-SMEs. Notably, the device based on polythieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl C₇₁-butyric acid methyl ester (PC₇₁BM) with ZnO/DPPNOH as the ETL can further improve the PCE to 8.0%. In addition, ZnO/n-SME ETLs also ensure the devices have long-term stability. These findings indicate that self-assembled ZnO/n-SMEs ETLs provide a promising strategy for fabrication of I-PSCs with high-performance and long-term stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abutyric acid 3aelectron transfer 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3athiophene 3azinc oxide1 aChen, Lie1 aHu, Lin1 aChen, Yiwang0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Nov. 19, v. 119, no. 46 p.25887-25897dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b073493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01571naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245011600195300001800311506007600329520034000405592002800745506003700773650001100810650001300821650003600834650002300870650001100893650002800904650000900932650001400941700002200955700001900977773010500996856007501101852000901176655001201185IND60578698320221207084231.0170813e20140516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057869832DNAL7 a10.1021/ol501073f2doi7 aPMC40336372pmcid7 a247863022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Chang10aDual C–H Functionalization of N-Aryl Amines: Synthesis of Polycyclic Amines via an Oxidative Povarov Approach  ap. 2756-2759.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIminium ions generated in situ via copper(I) bromide catalyzed oxidation of N-aryl amines readily undergo [4 + 2] cycloadditions with a range of dienophiles.

Perspicillata)  ap. 248-257.  aWhite-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca) and Surf Scoters (M. perspicillata) are often assumed to rely on similar marine resources. To evaluate the accuracy of this assumption, we contrast seasonal distributions, foraging effort, and indicators of energy status (body mass and composition, plasma metabolites) in three major foraging sites in Puget Sound, Washington, for these rapidly declining sea duck congeners. For Surf Scoters, distributions and energy status indicated that a mussel-dominated site was relatively important in early winter, but that importance shifted during late winter and spring to seagrass sites that provided either herring spawn or epifaunal invertebrates. As winter progressed, movements among foraging sites and increased foraging effort by Surf Scoters were accompanied by greater variability in their energy status compared with White-winged Scoters; body mass declined over winter by >9% in about one-third of past studies for Surf Scoters, well above the range of losses observed in White-winged Scoters. For White-winged Scoters, lower variability in energy status, foraging effort, and distributions throughout winter suggests that they are better able to regulate energy balance regardless of changing foraging conditions. Greater resistance to seasonal environmental changes in White-winged Scoters may be related to their >50% larger body size, which confers lower mass-specific energy costs and access to a wider size range of bivalve prey. Perhaps because of their greater sensitivity to winter foraging conditions, Surf Scoters appear to rely on a broader range of foraging sites than White-winged Scoters.  aPublisher supplied data 0amarine foraging ecology 0aMelanitta fusca 0aM. perspicillata 0aphysiological condition 0aplasma metabolites 0aSurf Scoter 0aWhite-winged Scoter1 aLovvorn, James R.0 tAuk.g2011 Apr., v. 128, no. 2 p.248-257dUniversity of California Pressx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fauk.2011.100883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002400181245016800205300001800373506007600391520130200467592002801769506003701797650001401834650002001848650002101868650001201889650001701901650002001918650001801938650001701956650002501973650002101998650003002019650005702049650004602106650003802152650002602190650004002216650004202256650001202298650002702310650003602337653001802373653001402391653003202405653002102437653001802458653001102476700002202487700002302509700002802532700001702560700001702577700001902594773014002613856007402753852000902827655001202836IND60118957920221207062503.0141127e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011895792DNAL7 a246831812pmid7 aPMC40364982pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiallo, Amadou Oury10aTranscriptome analysis of an mvp mutant reveals important changes in global gene expression and a role for methyl jasmonate in vernalization and flowering in wheat  ap. 2271-2286.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe einkorn wheat mutant mvp-1 (maintained vegetative phase 1) has a non-flowering phenotype caused by deletions including, but not limited to, the genes CYS, PHYC, and VRN1. However, the impact of these deletions on global gene expression is still unknown. Transcriptome analysis showed that these deletions caused the upregulation of several pathogenesis-related (PR) and jasmonate-responsive genes. These results suggest that jasmonates may be involved in flowering and vernalization in wheat. To test this hypothesis, jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) content in mvp and wild-type plants was measured. The content of JA was comparable in all plants, whereas the content of MeJA was higher by more than 6-fold in mvp plants. The accumulation of MeJA was also observed in vernalization-sensitive hexaploid winter wheat during cold exposure. This accumulation declined rapidly once plants were deacclimated under floral-inductive growth conditions. This suggests that MeJA may have a role in floral transition. To confirm this result, we treated vernalization-insensitive spring wheat with MeJA. The treatment delayed flowering with significant downregulation of both TaVRN1 and TaFT1 genes. These data suggest a role for MeJA in modulating vernalization and flowering time in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflowering 3agene expression 3amethyl jasmonate 3amutants 3aspring wheat 3atranscriptomics 3avernalization 3awinter wheat 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aCold Temperature 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aFlowersxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeasons 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTriticumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aBiotic stress 0aflowering 0amaintained vegetative phase 0amethyl jasmonate 0avernalization 0awheat.1 aAgharbaoui, Zahra1 aBadawi, Mohamed A.1 aAli-Benali, Mohamed Ali1 aMoheb, Amira1 aHoude, Mario1 aSarhan, Fathey0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 June, v. 65, no. 9 p.2271-2286dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245021500164300002000379520148800399592002801887650001101915650002101926650002801947650000901975650001601984650002202000650001402022650002002036650001102056650001802067650002302085650000902108700001302117700001702130700001602147700001602163700001802179700001902197773012902216856008202345852000902427655001202436IND60565971520221122001138.0170330e20151119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056597152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b075802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Zhongyuan10aMagnetic Behaviors of Mg- and Zn-Doped Fe3O4 Nanoparticles Estimated in Terms of Crystal Domain Size, Dielectric Response, and Application of Fe3O4/Carbon Nanotube Composites to Anodes for Lithium Ion Batteries  ap. 26128-26142.  aMagnesium (Mg)-doped Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles represented as MgₓFe₃–ₓO₄ (0 < x ≤ 1) were analyzed in comparison with zinc (Zn)-doped Fe₃O₄, ZnₓFe₃–ₓO₄. Magnetization versus applied magnetic field for MgₓFe₃–ₓO₄ particles provided the maximum saturation magnetization (Mₛ) with 69.37 emu/g at x = 0.1 as superparamagnetism, while the Mₛ by Zn-doping was 80.93 emu/g at x = 0.2. The crystal unit volume (Vc) by Mg doping at x ≤ 0.5 was constant, but the crystal size decreased with increasing x. Doping beyond x = 0.6 provided small amorphous power aggregates which offer universal dielectric response, implying a highly disordered system. In contrast, the Vc by Zn doping expanded up to x = 0.4 as the acceptable limit, which was attributed to the large difference between doping ion radius and replaced Fe³⁺ ion radius. On the other hand, the MgₓFe₃–ₓO₄ (0 ≤ x < 0.6) and ZnₓFe₃–ₓO₄ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) formed by a crystal domain were analyzed by a three-circuit model with one normal parallel circuit and two circuits with resistance and a constant-phase element (CPE). The stability of capacity as the anode of lithium ion batteries was investigated for the composites prepared by adhering Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺, and Fe³⁺ on the sidewalls of as-modified multiwall carbon nanotubes. Among the ferrite composites, Zn₀.₂Fe₂.₈O₄ provided the highest capacity with good stability under discharge and charge cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon nanotubes 3aferrimagnetic materials 3airon 3airon oxides 3alithium batteries 3amagnesium 3amagnetic fields 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aphysical chemistry 3azinc1 aWang, Qi1 aBin, Yuezhen1 aHuang, Ling1 aZhang, Rong1 aZhang, Panpan1 aMatsuo, Masaru0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Nov. 19, v. 119, no. 46 p.26128-26142dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b075803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245013300170520200200303592002802305650001802333650001102351650002102362650001902383650000902402650001702411650001402428650002402442651001302466653002902479653002302508653002902531653003002560700001802590700002802608700002202636700002402658700002302682700001702705700002102722773010102743856008902844852000902933655001202942IND60792366020221117223554.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079236602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2022.1044932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilp, Paul10aRe-arranged hopanes and novel re-arranged tricyclic terpanes in Paleozoic rock extracts and oils in the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma  aAn ongoing study of oils and Paleozoic source rock extracts from the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma, revealed the presence of multiple series of novel tricyclic terpanes in addition to the commonly observed series of 13β(H),14α(H) tricyclic terpanes. The precise structures of these novel tricyclic compounds are not known but several proposed spectral and chromatographic similarities with known compounds suggests the tentatively identified analytes are rearranged and structural isomers of the 13β(H),14α(H) tricyclic terpanes. The occurrences and relative abundances of these compounds are predominantly lower in more carbonate-rich formations, which implies a potential role of clay minerals in their formation. The presence and distributions of these unique tricyclic terpane configurations are seemingly unaffected by thermal maturation, although relative concentrations may increase as a result of preferential thermal degradation of the less thermally-stable hopanes. Many of the samples bearing the novel rearranged tricyclic terpanes also contain varying proportions of four previously reported series of rearranged hopanes, which are formed via rearrangement reactions catalyzed by clay minerals. The rearranged hopanes include the commonly observed Ts and C₃₀ diahopanes in addition to 9,15-dimethyl rearranged hopanes and 21-methyl-28,30-dinorhopanes (28-norspergulanes) that have been previously reported in a number of basins worldwide but not the Anadarko Basin. No apparent relationship was identified between the presence of the rearranged tricyclic terpanes and the rearranged hopanes. Both groups require the presence of clay minerals, as determined from empirical relationships with source rock lithology, and are observed to co-occur in many of the samples studied. Still, the lack of a clear correlation between rearranged tricyclic terpanes and rearranged hopanes suggests additional controls, beyond lithology, on their genesis and preservation in the geologic record.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaleozoic era 3abasins 3achemical species 3achromatography 3aclay 3ageochemistry 3alithology 3athermal degradation 3aOklahoma 0aNovel tricyclic terpanes 0aRearranged hopanes 0aAnadarko Basin, Oklahoma 0aDepositional environments1 aWood, Matthew1 aGorenekli, Yagmur Sumer1 aNguyễn, Thành,1 aConnock, Gregory T.1 aPezzaro, Catherine1 aSymcox, Carl1 aVillalba, Damian0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2022 Nov., v. 173 p.104493-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2022.1044933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014700163300001400310520113200324592002801456650001201484650001401496650002301510650001501533650001301548650001101561653002301572653001301595653000901608653001001617653001001627653000901637700001801646700001301664700001401677700001401691700001601705700001601721700001701737700001901754700001901773773010001792856008301892852000901975655001201984IND60766248120221121073718.0220411e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076624812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2022.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yanlin14aThe role of Nb2O5 in controlling metal-acid sites of CoMoS/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for the enhanced hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol into hydrocarbons  ap. 19-28.  aTransformation of lignin-derived feedstocks into valuable hydrocarbons is of significant importance but still challenging. Herein, we report a novel and highly efficient bifunctional metal/acid CoMoS/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst with doping of Nb₂O₅ for the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol. The dopant Nb₂O₅ significantly improves the HDO activity of CoMoS/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst from 72.4% to 97.5% at 340 °C. Extensive characterizations confirm that the modification of Nb₂O₅ weakens the metal-support interaction, and thus improves the sulfidation degree of Mo species and the dispersion of MoS₂ phases, leading to more MoS₂ edges. Accordingly, the induced formation of more Brønsted acid sites originating from –SH on increased MoS₂ edges greatly promotes the C₍ₛₚ₂₎-O scissions of phenolics, and therefore enhances the yield of hydrocarbons especially benzene. This work focuses on the mechanistic insights into the effect of Nb₂O₅ on sulfided Mo-based catalyst in the HDO of lignin compound and provides a promising approach for facilitation of lignin valorization with extensive applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afeedstocks 3aguaiacol 3alignin 0aHydrodeoxygenation 0aGuaiacol 0aMoS2 0aNb2O5 0aMetal 0aAcid1 aWang, Wenhong1 aLiu, Bin1 aPan, Yuan1 aDong, Bin1 aLi, Yichuan1 aLi, Yanpeng1 aGuo, Hailing1 aChai, Yongming1 aLiu, Chenguang0 tJournal of catalysis.g2022 Mar., v. 407 p.19-28dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2022.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245015700210300001200367520200300379592002802382650001702410650001202427650001002439650001002449650001102459650001502470650001502485650001402500650003002514650001302544650002202557650001702579651000902596700002902605700002902634700002702663700003302690700002702723773011302750856008302863852000902946655001202955IND60704323920221122144424.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070432392DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04225-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadpour, Iraj1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4807-731710aFirst molecular subtyping and phylogeny of Blastocystis sp. isolated from domestic and synanthropic animals (dogs, cats and brown rats) in southern Iran  ap. 365.  aBACKGROUND: Blastocystis sp. is a common intestinal protist that infects humans and many animals globally. Thus far, 22 subtypes (STs) have been identified in mammalian and avian hosts. Since various STs are common to humans and animals, it was suggested that some human infections might arise from zoonotic transmission. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the presence of Blastocystis sp. in domestic (dogs and cats) and synanthropic animals (rats) of Fars Province, Iran, and to genetically characterize the samples. METHODS: A total of 400 fresh faecal samples from 154 dogs, 119 cats, and 127 rats were inspected by direct microscopy, Wheatley’s trichrome staining, in vitro culture, and 18S rRNA gene nested-PCR. Finally, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Out of 400 samples, 47 (11.8%) and 61 (15.3%) samples were detected as positive by direct wet mount and culture, respectively. Molecular analysis detected a larger number of positive samples (n = 70, 17.5%): nested-PCR showed that 29 (18.8%) dogs, 21 (17.7%) cats, and 20 (15.8%) rats were infected by Blastocystis sp. Sequence analysis of positive samples indicated the presence of zoonotic STs in all investigated host species. Specifically, ST2 (allele 9), ST3 (allele 34), ST4 (allele 94), ST7 (allele 99), ST8 (allele 21), and ST10 (allele 152) were detected in dogs; ST1 (allele 2), ST3 (allele 34), ST4 (allele 94), ST10 (allele 152), and ST14 (allele 159) were detected in cats; and ST1 (allele 2), ST3 (allele 34), and ST4 (allele 92) were detected in rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that domestic dogs and cats can serve as possible reservoirs for in-contact humans, especially those who handle shelter-resident and client-owned animals. Moreover, rats as synanthropic animals can function as a potential source of human infections. Conversely, humans can act as a source of infections to animals. These results should be reinforced in future molecular epidemiological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlastocystis 3aalleles 3abirds 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aintestines 3amicroscopy 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotists 3asequence analysis 3asynanthropes 3aIran1 aBozorg-Ghalati, Farzaneh1 aGazzonis, Alessia Libera1 aManfredi, Maria Teresa1 aMotazedian, Mohammad Hossein1 aMohammadpour, Niloofar0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.365-365dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04225-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015700167300001600324520095000340592002801290650001301318650002701331650001701358650001501375650002001390650001201410650001101422650001901433650002201452650002101474650002501495653002901520653003201549653003001581653002601611653002101637700001501658700001501673700001301688700001601701700001701717700001601734700001501750700001401765773011501779856008601894852000901980655001201989IND60605360720221123041509.0190725e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060536072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xuefeng12aA solar responsive photocatalytic fuel cell with the membrane electrode assembly design for simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation  ap. 346-354.  aIn this work, a photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) with membrane electrode assembly (MEA) structure was designed for simultaneous organic compounds degradation and electricity generation.

For the cathode, an air-breathing mode was utilized to enhance the oxygen transport. The performance of the developed PFC was evaluated under different operation conditions, including the light intensity, liquid flow rate, concentrations of electrolyte and organics. Results indicated that the designed PFC could yield good performance. The increase of the light intensity and electrolyte concentration could improve the PFC performance. It is also found that when the flow rate was increased, the PFC performance dropped down in the testing range. Too high organics concentration led to the decrease of the PFC performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3alight intensity 3aliquids 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aspectral analysis 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater treatment 0aPhotocatalytic fuel cell 0aMembrane electrode assembly 0aQuantum-dot sensitization 0aAir breathing cathode 0aCell performance1 aChen, Ming1 aChen, Rong1 aZhu, Xun1 aLiao, Qiang1 aYe, Dingding1 aZhang, Biao1 aZhang, Wei1 aYu, Youxu0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 358 p.346-354dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009200166300001400258520129600272592002801568653002301596653001701619653001101636653002001647653002901667700001801696700001801714700001801732700002401750700002301774773011101797856008301908852000901991655001202000IND60564779120221119153807.0170713e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056477912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jddst.2017.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaza, Kaisar10aAceclofenac polymorphs: Preparation, characterization and intestinal permeation studies  ap. 69-74.  aAceclofenac (ACE) is one of the most popular anti-inflammatory drugs, frequently used for the pain relief in conditions like osteoarthritis, muscular pain, rheumatoid arthritis, periarthritis, spondylitis, sprain and alkylosing arthritis. However, being important non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID), still the polymorphic attributes of ACE are relatively less explored. Therefore, we aimed to study the polymorphic transitions of ACE employing various solvents and also to correlate with the biological transport of ACE.The various polymorphic forms were prepared using rotatory evaporation and solvent drying techniques. The developed polymorphic forms were characterized by melting point, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction and were biologically evaluated in rats vis-à-vis the plain ACE.The developed forms were found to enhance the drug permeability across GIT in comparison to that of the granular plain drug, indicating the significant dependence of bioavailability of ACE on the packing arrangement of the drug molecules.These findings are encouraging and provide an insight of the relationship between the polymorphic forms of drugs and the respective biological outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCrystal phenomenon 0aSPIP studies 0aNSAIDs 0avan't Hoff plot 0aPermeability enhancement1 aRatan, Shanti1 aManish Kumar,1 aKumar, Pramod1 aChaturvedi, Saurabh1 aKatare, Om Prakash0 tJournal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology.g2017 June, v. 39 p.69-74dElsevier B.V.x1773-22477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jddst.2017.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002800172245008600200300001600286520141100302592002801713650001301741650002901754650001901783650001601802650001201818650001801830650000901848650001501857650001401872650002401886650002901910650002501939650002001964650001701984650002702001650001102028650001602039650002602055650002502081650000902106650002002115650001602135650001602151650001202167650008502179650006002264650002902324650002002353650000902373651001302382651001302395653001702408653002702425653002602452653003102478653000902509653003302518700002702551700002302578700001702601773010202618856008702720852000902807655001202816IND50060359420221117043844.0160902e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006035942DNAL7 a231787822pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-García, Sara10aUsing Life Cycle Assessment methodology to assess UHT milk production in Portugal  ap. 225-234.  aMilk and dairy products constitute an important ingredient in the human diet. Ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk is the main dairy product consumed in Portugal and its production entails large inputs of resources which derive on negative environmental effects such as nutrient enrichment of the ecosystem and climate change.In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was considered for the environmental assessment of packaged UHT milk produced in Portugal, including simple (whole, semi-skimmed and skimmed) and cocoa milk from a cradle-to-gate perspective and to identify the environmental hot spots. Results showed that the production of the raw milk in the dairy farm is the main hot spot in almost all the categories under assessment mainly due to the emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management and fertilisers production and application. Furthermore, on-site emissions derived from dairy factory are remarkable together with the packages and energy requirements production. The values reported in this study are in the range of other related papers. However, differences were also identified due to several reasons such as allocation approach, data sources, characterisation factors, farm management regimes and assumptions considered. Therefore, these aspects should be carefully addressed and sensitivity to the assumptions and uncertainty of the results should be evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUHT milk 3aanimal manure management 3aclimate change 3acocoa beans 3adairies 3adairy farming 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aenergy requirements 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3afarm management 3afermentation 3afertilizer application 3ahumans 3aingredients 3alife cycle assessment 3amaterials life cycle 3amilk 3amilk production 3atemperature 3auncertainty 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethodsxstatistics & numerical dataxtrends. 2aDairyingxmethodsxstatistics & numerical dataxtrends. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHot Temperature 2aMilk 3aPortugal 0aPortugal 0aDairy sector 0aEnvironmental analysis 0aLife Cycle Assessment 0aLife Cycle Inventory (LCI) 0aMilk 0aUltra High Temperature (UHT)1 aCastanheira, Érica G.1 aDias, Ana Cláudia1 aArroja, Luis0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Jan. 01, v. 442 p.225-234dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010900165520135900274592002801633650002801661650002101689650001101710650001501721650001001736650001301746650001401759650001101773650001601784653001401800653002101814653002901835653004301864653002001907700001601927700002101943700001401964700001801978700001801996700001702014773009802031856008702129852000902216655001202225IND60790522820221122041644.0221004e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079052282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1198842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Sida10aHydrogen crossover diagnosis for fuel cell stack: An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy based method  aHydrogen crossover rate is a key parameter for characterizing internal gas leakage in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Voltammetric and galvanostatic techniques are most commonly used in measuring hydrogen crossover. However, for the present, the existing methods have the drawbacks of being laborious and time-consuming. In this paper, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is exploited for the first time to characterize hydrogen crossover in fuel cells. An equivalent circuit model is established based on comprehensively analyzing different electrochemical processes occurring on fuel cell electrodes. By comparing the measured impedance characteristics under various experimental conditions, it is found that a unique model parameter monotonically decreases with increasing hydrogen crossover rate. Accordingly, this single parameter is identified as the diagnostic indicator for hydrogen crossover. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on a single cell and a multi-cell stack. Our method allows deployment to each individual cell or multiple groups of cells in a fuel cell stack. Furthermore, one entire measurement by this method takes only 4 min, and the consumed time will not increase with the number of cells in the stack. It will provide a powerful tool for failure diagnosis and lifespan evaluation of fuel cell stack.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3alongevity 3amodels 3avoltammetry 0aFuel cell 0aHydrogen Leakage 0aShort circuit resistance 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy 0aFault diagnosis1 aWei, Xuezhe1 aJiang, Shangfeng1 aYuan, Hao1 aMing, Pingwen1 aWang, Xueyuan1 aDai, Haifeng0 tApplied energy.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 325 p.119884-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1198843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013300155300001800288520151300306592002801819650002801847650002201875650002001897650001601917650002601933650001401959650001801973650004401991650000902035650000902044650003302053650001402086650001102100650001702111650001502128650003702143700001502180700001702195700001602212700001702228700001702245700001502262700001602277700001602293773014302309856007402452852000902526655001202535IND60642433420221119013758.0190507e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064243342DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb00874g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Qiqi10aDHDMIQK(KAP): a novel nano-delivery system of dihydroxyl-tetrahydro-isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid and KPAK towards the thrombus  ap. 5991-6003.  aVascular thrombosis is a major risk of the onset of stroke and so novel therapeutic candidates have been attracting interest. In this context, here docking based computer assisted screening and mesoscale simulation were used to design N-[(S)-6,7-dihydroxy-1,1-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carbonyl]-Lys(Pro-Ala-Lys), DHDMIQK(KAP), for inhibiting P-selectin expression. In vitro, 1 nM of DHDMIQK(KAP) effectively down-regulated P-selectin expression. In water, in rat plasma and in the solid state DHDMIQK(KAP) formed nanoparticles of a size capable of suitable delivery in the blood circulation. FT-MS and NOESY 2D NMR spectra showed DHDMIQK(KAP) formed hexamers, identified the intermolecular interactions of the hexamer, and assigned the hexamer a butterfly like conformation. Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaged DHDMIQK(KAP) forming size-suitable nanoparticles for safe delivery in the blood circulation. In particular, AFM images showed that the nanoparticles effectively adhered onto the surfaces of the platelets. In vivo DHDMIQK(KAP) lysed the thrombus and inhibited thrombosis with a minimal effective dose of 0.01 nmol kg⁻¹. FT-MS spectrum analyses defined a specific distribution of DHDMIQK(KAP) in the thrombus, but not in the blood and vital organs. Therefore, DHDMIQK(KAP) should be a novel nano-delivery system of 6,7-dihydroxyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid and KPAK to target the thrombus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3ablood circulation 3ablood platelets 3abutterflies 3achemical interactions 3acomputers 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arats 3arisk 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ascreening 3astroke 3atherapeutics 3athrombosis 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhao, Ming1 aGan, Taiping1 aZhu, Haimei1 aWang, Yaonan1 aZhao, Shurui1 aWang, Yuji1 aWu, Jianhui1 aPeng, Shiqi0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 Sept. 14, v. 4, no. 36 p.5991-6003dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb00874g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245009600209300001800305520110600323592002801429596009801457596009801555596011001653596011101763650001701874650001101891650001601902650001101918650002401929650001201953650000901965650001501974700005801989700001502047700001902062700005802081700005702139773012002196856008802316852000902404655001202413IND60784351920221122194855.0220726e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078435192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c010172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Guojun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8935-433610aEffect of Methane Solubility on Hydrate Formation and Dissociation: Review and Perspectives  ap. 7269-7283.  aMethane solubility in water is the foundation to make full sense of the mechanism of hydrate formation and dissociation. It is significant for realizing the safe and efficient exploitation of natural gas hydrate (NGH). This review discusses the calculation of methane solubility in gas–water and hydrate–water equilibrium systems, based on the hydrate phase equilibrium model theory, and the parameters used in the calculation process are described in detail. In addition, the influences of bubbles, capillary pressure, and salt on methane solubility are revealed. The difference in fugacity between the water phase and hydrate phase caused by the undersaturation of methane induces hydrate dissolution. Water injecting is a promising auxiliary method for hydrate exploitation, which will flush out the sand and gravel accumulated during the depressurization process. A novel hydrate exploitation method, which combines depressurization and a water injection method using double-split wells, is proposed. This novel method provides a new idea for efficient and sustainable exploitation of hydrate.  aPublisher supplied data  a52076030cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aU19B2005cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aDUT19TD29cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  aDUT21ZD103cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338 3adissociation 3aenergy 3agas hydrate 3agravel 3amathematical theory 3amethane 3asand 3asolubility1 aGong, Guangjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7997-29501 aSun, Huiru1 aChen, Bingbing1 aZheng, Jia-nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4022-30171 aYang, Mingjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6336-76170 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 July 13, v. 36, no. 14 p.7269-7283dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c010173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245024800158300001800406520128100424592002801705650001601733650001001749650001501759650002301774650002301797650002201820650002201842650002401864650001601888700002001904700002001924700001801944700001601962700001901978700002101997773011802018856007502136852000902211655001202220IND60550100620221117211412.0160909e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055010062DNAL7 a10.1021/jo301979p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwado, Tatsuya10aMechanistic and Exploratory Investigations into the Synthesis of 1,3,5-Triaroylbenzenes from 1-Aryl-2-propyn-1-ones and 1,3,5-Triacetylbenzene from 4-Methoxy-3-buten-2-one by Cyclotrimerization in Hot Water in the Absence of Added Acid or Base  ap. 1949-1954.  aNeat 1-phenyl- and 1-(p-tolyl)-2-propyn-1-ones (1 and 1′, respectively) were heated in water without any additive at 150 °C for 2 h to give 1,3,5-tribenzoyl- and 1,3,5-tri-(p-toluoyl)benzenes (2 and 2′, respectively) in 74 and 52% yields, respectively. The crossed reactions of 1 with the enolate of p-toluoylacetaldehyde (3′) and 1′ with the enolate of benzoylacetaldehyde (3) were carried out to give unsymmetrically substituted 1-toluoyl-3,5-dibenzoylbenzene (Ph₂Tol) and 1,3-ditoluoyl-5-benzoylbenzene (PhTol₂), respectively, corroborating the previously proposed reaction mechanism in which 3 and 3′ that are formed by rate-determining nucleophilic attack of HO– on 1 and 1′ or its conjugate acids formed by subsequent protonation would serve as a common intermediate for the formation of 2, 2′ and the acetophenone derivatives as byproducts.

The reaction did not take place in the absence of water. Slow decompositions of 5 in water set in at the temperature of 300 °C for 30 min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aacids 3abyproducts 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3areaction mechanisms 3atemperature1 aHasegawa, Keiya1 aSato, Toshiyuki1 aOkada, Masaki1 aSue, Kiwamu1 aIwamura, Hiizu1 aHiaki, Toshihiko0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 78, no. 5 p.1949-1954dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo301979p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245008800208300002100296506007600317520109900393592002801492506003701520650002101557650001201578650002701590650001601617650002801633650002501661650001701686650002201703650001001725650001001735650002401745650001601769650002301785650001401808650001401822650002201836653002101858653002101879653001601900653001501916653002401931653000801955653002801963653002201991653001302013653002302026700002102049700002002070700002302090700002402113700002202137700002502159700002102184700001502205700002302220700002202243700002202265773010002287856008302387852000902470655001202479IND60645456620221207121408.0190725e20190530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064545662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.0162doi7 aPMC65455702pmcid7 a310800692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jason H.12aA White-Box Machine Learning Approach for Revealing Antibiotic Mechanisms of Action  ap. 1649-1661.e9.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurrent machine learning techniques enable robust association of biological signals with measured phenotypes, but these approaches are incapable of identifying causal relationships. Here, we develop an integrated “white-box” biochemical screening, network modeling, and machine learning approach for revealing causal mechanisms and apply this approach to understanding antibiotic efficacy. We counter-screen diverse metabolites against bactericidal antibiotics in Escherichia coli and simulate their corresponding metabolic states using a genome-scale metabolic network model. Regression of the measured screening data on model simulations reveals that purine biosynthesis participates in antibiotic lethality, which we validate experimentally. We show that antibiotic-induced adenine limitation increases ATP demand, which elevates central carbon metabolism activity and oxygen consumption, enhancing the killing effects of antibiotics. This work demonstrates how prospective network modeling can couple with machine learning to identify complex causal mechanisms underlying drug efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenine 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantibiotics 3aartificial intelligence 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon metabolism 3adeath 3adrugs 3amechanism of action 3ametabolites 3aoxygen consumption 3aphenotype 3ascreening 3asimulation models 0amachine learning 0anetwork modeling 0aantibiotics 0ametabolism 0apurine biosynthesis 0aATP 0aadenylate energy charge 0aNADPH:NADP+ ratio 0aLC-MS/MS 0abiochemical screen1 aWright, Sarah N.1 aHamblin, Meagan1 aMcCloskey, Douglas1 aAlcantar, Miguel A.1 aSchrübbers, Lars1 aLopatkin, Allison J.1 aSatish, Sangeeta1 aNili, Amir1 aPalsson, Bernhard,1 aWalker, Graham C.1 aCollins, James J.0 tCell.g2019 May 30, v. 177, no. 6 p.1649-1661.e9dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245014600186300001600332520174900348592002802097650001502125650002002140650002602160650001202186650001502198650002002213650001602233650001002249650002502259650001102284650001102295650001102306650001102317650001202328650003802340650001402378650002302392650001502415650004002430650001102470650002302481650002202504650002402526650001102550650002302561651001002584651001002594700002202604700001902626700001702645700001602662700002102678773009902699856004802798852000902846655001202855IND4475154020221121050627.0120525e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447515402DNAL7 a223231092pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-012-9813-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellmore, J. Ryan10aAssessing the Potential for Salmon Recovery via Floodplain Restoration: A Multitrophic Level Comparison of Dredge-Mined to Reference Segments  ap. 734-750.  aPre-restoration studies typically focus on physical habitat, rather than the food-base that supports aquatic species. However, both food and habitat are necessary to support the species that habitat restoration is frequently aimed at recovering. Here we evaluate if and how the productivity of the food-base that supports fish production is impaired in a dredge-mined floodplain within the Yankee Fork Salmon River (YFSR), Idaho (USA); a site where past restoration has occurred and where more has been proposed to help recover anadromous salmonids. Utilizing an ecosystem approach, we found that the dredged segment had comparable terrestrial leaf and invertebrate inputs, aquatic primary producer biomass, and production of aquatic invertebrates relative to five reference floodplains. Thus, the food-base in the dredged segment did not necessarily appear impaired. On the other hand, we observed that off-channel aquatic habitats were frequently important to productivity in reference floodplains, and the connection of these habitats in the dredged segment via previous restoration increased invertebrate productivity by 58%. However, using a simple bioenergetic model, we estimated that the invertebrate food-base was at least 4× larger than present demand for food by fish in dredged and reference segments. In the context of salmon recovery efforts, this observation questions whether additional food-base productivity provided by further habitat restoration would be warranted in the YFSR. Together, our findings highlight the importance of studies that assess the aquatic food-base, and emphasize the need for more robust ecosystem models that evaluate factors potentially limiting fish populations that are the target of restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonidae 3aaquatic habitat 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3afish production 3afloodplains 3afoods 3ahabitat conservation 3aleaves 3amodels 3arivers 3asalmon 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aFishesxphysiology 2aFood Chain 2aInvertebratesxgrowth & development 2aMining 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Development 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aRivers 2aSalmonxphysiology 3aIdaho 0aIdaho1 aBaxter, Colden V.1 aRay, Andrew M.1 aDenny, Lytle1 aTardy, Kurt1 aGalloway, Evelyn0 tEnvironmental management.g2012 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.734-750dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-9813-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010600166300001200272520201000284592002802294596005902322596005902381596010402440650002002544650001502564650001002579650000902589650001002598650002602608650002202634650001502656650001302671650001402684651001502698651001002713651001002723700002102733700001202754700001302766700001402779700001802793773011302811856008302924852000903007655001203016IND60704324320221120095312.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070432432DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04232-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wen-Ping10aMolecular detection and genetic characteristics of Babesia gibsoni in dogs in Shaanxi Province, China  ap. 366.  aBACKGROUND: Several members of genus Babesia are important pathogens causing babesiosis in dogs. In China, at least five Babesia species have been described in dogs or ticks. This study sought to determine the prevalence and molecular characteristics of various Babesia spp. in dogs in cities in Shaanxi Province in China, including Xi’an and Hanzhong. METHODS: A total of 371 blood samples were collected from pet dogs presenting to veterinary clinics in the cities of Xi’an and Hanzhong in Shaanxi, China. Babesia spp. DNA was detected via amplification of partial 18S rRNA genes by semi-nested PCR. Almost full-length 18S rRNA, ITS, partial TRAP and complete cytb genes were recovered for analysis of the genetic characteristics and relationships with known isolates. RESULTS: A single species, Babesia gibsoni, was identified in dogs in Xi’an and Hanzhong. Consistently, B. gibsoni was also detected in 14 ticks collected from positive dogs. Sequence similarities and phylogenetic analysis suggested that the isolates identified herein showed a closer genetic relationship with isolates from East Asian countries rather than India, Bangladesh, or the USA. Sequence analysis based on tandem repeat analysis of the TRAP gene further revealed that specific haplotypes were circulating in both Xi’an and Hanzhong, with no specific regionality. In addition, 10.9% of all isolates with atovaquone (ATV)-resistance were identified because of M121I mutation in the deduced cytb protein. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a high prevalence rate of Babesia infection. Babesia gibsoni was the only Babesia species identified in cases of canine babesiosis in the cities of Xi’an and Hanzhong cities in Shaanxi, China. In addition, the TRAP gene presented high genetic diversity across isolates. Such information is useful for elucidating the epidemiological characteristics of canine babesiosis, as well as the overall genetic diversity of Babesia spp. circulating in dog populations in Shaanxi Province.  aPublisher supplied data  a31700159cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81702008cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aJi Jiao Gao No. [2013]4cKey discipline construction of colleges and universities in Hebei Province 3aBabesia gibsoni 3ababesiosis 3ablood 3adogs 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3aBangladesh 3aChina 3aIndia1 aXie, Guang-Cheng1 aLi, Dan1 aSu, Meng1 aJian, Rui1 aDu, Luan-Ying0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.366-366dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04232-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015200171300001600323520157500339592002801914650001201942650002201954650000901976650001701985650002002002650001402022650003502036650001902071650001502090650002102105650001102126650001402137650002402151650001902175650000902194650001802203651002102221651001002242653002802252653000802280653003302288653002202321700001602343700001802359700002302377773010802400856008602508852000902594655001202603IND60617676720221118093957.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061767672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2018.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayak, Ashok K.10aLand suitability modelling for enhancing fishery resource development in Central Himalayas (India) using GIS and multi-criteria evaluation approach  ap. 120-129.  aIn recent years, fish production from open waters in Central Himalayas, especially from riverine system, has declined considerably. Degradation of soil and water quality and poor infrastructure facilities are among the major causes of declined fish production in this region. Keeping this in view, the present investigation was carried out to assess the soil, water and infrastructure facilities by using geographical information system (GIS) and multi criteria evaluation approach which helped in understanding the key elements to develop and improve resource management strategies that are vital to ensure sustainable fish stocks in this region. Various important parameters of soil, water and infrastructure facilities of this mountainous region were thoroughly assessed by analytical hierarchy process (AHP) for development of fish culture. Based on these characteristics, sixteen thematic layers were prepared using the Geomedia Professional software to develop a series of GIS models/ sub-models. In this process, the region was categorized to different suitable locations for the development of highland and lowland fishery. The model output clearly indicates the location and extent for the development of this sector in different suitability scales viz., most suitable (51,112 ha, i.e. 13%) and moderately suitable (61,164 ha i.e. 15%) out of the total land cover area of Nainital district (about 402,000 ha). The study will help planners to design plans to harness maximum fish biomass and to derive social benefits from inland open waters in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acomputer software 3afish 3afish culture 3afish production 3afisheries 3ageographic information systems 3ainfrastructure 3aland cover 3aland suitability 3amodels 3amountains 3aresource management 3asocial benefit 3asoil 3awater quality 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aAquaculture development 0aGIS 0aAnalytical hierarchy process 0aCentral Himalayas1 aKumar, Prem1 aPant, Durgesh1 aMohanty, Rajeeb K.0 tAquacultural engineering.g2018 Nov., v. 83 p.120-129dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2018.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015800168506011700326506007600443520103800519592002801557506003701585650002801622650002201650650001601672650003101688650001601719650001701735650001901752650002101771650001801792650001701810650003001827650000901857650001101866650001501877650001501892650001801907650001701925650001401942653002201956653001701978653002801995653001802023653001902041700001402060700001302074700002702087700002702114700001902141700001602160700001502176700002002191773010002211856008702311852000902398655001202407IND60790523020221207121954.0220929e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079052302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1339932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruoyu10aMulti-omics analysis reveals therapeutic effects of Bacillus subtilis-fermented Astragalus membranaceus in hyperuricemia via modulation of gut microbiota  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAt present, uncovering how to preventandcontrol hyperuricemia has become an important public health issue. Fermented traditionalChinesemedicine has exhibited promising applications in the clinical management of hyperuricemia. In this study, we generated a hyperuricemic mouse model to explore the potent therapeutic ability of Bacillus subtilis-fermented Astragalus membranaceus (BFA) on this condition by multi-omics analysis. We found that the serum uric acid level was decreased in hyperuricemic mice after BFA treatment. BFA effectively attenuated renal inflammation and regulated the expression of urate transporters. Additionally, we found that BFA could increase the abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria, including Butyricimonas synergistica, Odoribacter splanchnicus, and Collinsella tanakaei, and probiotics, including Lactobacillus intestinalis and Bacillus mycoides, in hyperuricemic mice. Therefore, we believe that BFA has the potential to become a novel safe and valid functional food for addressing hyperuricemia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3aBacillus mycoides 3aCollinsella 3aLactobacillus intestinalis 3ablood serum 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3afunctional foods 3ahyperuricemia 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amice 3amodels 3amultiomics 3aprobiotics 3apublic health 3atherapeutics 3auric acid 0aBacillus subtilis 0aFermentation 0aAstragalus membranaceus 0aHyperuricemia 0aGut microbiota1 aLin, Feng1 aYe, Chen1 aAihemaitijiang, Sumiya1 aHalimulati, Mairepaiti1 aHuang, Xiaojie1 aJiang, Zeyu1 aLi, Lutong1 aZhang, Zhaofeng0 tFood chemistry.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 399 p.133993-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1339933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014500168300001600313500001900329520128800348592002801636650001101664650001201675650002501687650001001712650002101722650002601743650001401769650000901783650001701792700002201809700002201831700002001853700001901873700001801892700002001910773012001930856008102050852000902131655001202140IND60734661220221117094343.0210421e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073466122DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293210301572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerekhova, V.

Soils with different organic carbon contents (Cₒᵣg 3.86 and 1.30%) were sampled at two sites (Chashnikovo, Moscow oblast). We determined Cₘᵢc by the substrate-induced respiration method and FD by multisubstrate testing (47 substrates). It was found that HMs application reduced Cₘᵢc on average by 49–57%, BR by 23–52%, and FD by 45%, but, on the contrary, increased the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO₂ = BR/Cₘᵢc) by 9–46%. The changes of these properties were most significant in the soil with low Cₒᵣg content (1.30%). Carbon-containing preparations did not contribute to variations in Cₘᵢc, BR, and qCO₂ in both soils with HMs, but increased their FD. It is concluded that the studied microbiological parameters may be used as indicators for optimal assessment of soil quality: FD and Cₘᵢc are the more sensitive to HMs than BR and qCO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3abiochar 3afunctional diversity 3ahumus 3amicrobial carbon 3amicrobial communities 3apollution 3asoil 3asoil quality1 aPrudnikova, E.

FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy were used to confirm the successful grafting of COP to CMCS. Degree of substitution (DS) of CMCS-COP could be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions. With the increase of concentration, the ability of each sample on scavenging capacity and reducibility tends to increase obviously. The results of anticoagulant experiments showed that the ability of CMCS and CMCS-COP with three different degrees of substitution on activated partial thrombin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) values were all increased to compare with the control group. No relevant cytotoxicity against NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts was found for the copolymers. These results suggested that CMCS-COP would appear to be a promising candidate for wound dressing application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanticoagulants 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalysts 3achitosan 3acollagen 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3afree radicals 3ainflammation 3amice 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aprothrombin 3asulfates 3athrombin 0aCarboxymethyl chitosan sulfate 0aCollagen peptide 0aMicrobial transglutaminase 0aAntioxidant activity 0aAnticoagulant properties1 aLiu, Meng1 aYang, Xiaoshuang1 aZhang, Chang1 aZhou, Heyi1 aXie, Weiguo1 aFan, Lihong1 aNie, Min0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 206 p.468-475dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013300165300001600298506011700314506007600431520102600507592002801533506003701561650001501598650001901613650001401632650002301646650002001669650001201689650001801701650001301719650001901732650001701751650000901768653001201777653000801789653001301797653001101810653001701821653001901838700002801857700001601885700001901901700002301920700002301943700002501966700002601991773010202017856008302119852000902202655001202211IND60766248520221207134851.0220411e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076624852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2022.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCored, Jorge10aCu-Ga3+-doped wurtzite ZnO interface as driving force for enhanced methanol production in co-precipitated Cu/ZnO/Ga2O3 catalysts  ap. 149-161.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA detailed understanding of the interactions among the active components in gallium promoted Cu/ZnO catalysts, depending on the speciation of the gallium, are reported using in situ/operando spectroscopic studies, and their effect in the CO₂ hydrogenation to methanol unraveled.

There is a lack of experimental data on the effect of steam in the combustion gases on the release of alkali and chloride from biomass and black liquor. In this work, the release of K and Cl from three biomass fuels in different gas environments is measured. The gas environments studied were balanced with N₂ and contained 11% CO₂, 1% O₂, and either 8 or 17% steam. The mass loss and particle temperature throughout combustion were measured. Measurements show that the presence of steam slows the release of K and Cl during char oxidation in wood. Temperature measurements during char conversion experiments show that the particle temperature drops in the presence of steam as a result of endothermic gasification reactions on the char surface by steam and CO₂. The decrease in the char temperature results in a lower KCl vapor pressure, lowering the KCl vaporization rate; however, experiments show that this lower temperature alone does not explain the decrease in KCl release. For black liquor, steam and CO₂ did not affect the mass loss or the release of K and Cl, but this appears to be due to the small black liquor droplets fully burning before reaching a high enough temperature for significant K and Cl release.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3acorrosion 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3agasification 3asteam 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 3avolatilization 3awaste liquors 3awood1 aDeMartini, Nikolai0 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 July 01, v. 36, no. 14 p.7733-7743dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c010783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169520137700272592002801649650003001677650001201707650001901719650001201738650001601750650002501766650001701791651001401808653002401822653002301846653002701869653000801896700001901904700001901923773010501942856008602047852000902133655001202142IND60745962620221116163515.0211029e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074596262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1267242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfroz, Rounak14aThe residual mass severity index – A new method to characterize sustained hydroclimatic extremes  aWater supply management for hydroclimatic extremes has commonly been analysed using the cumulative difference between inflow and demand, a concept known as the Residual Mass Curve. This paper extends the residual mass concept to develop a new method to quantify water availability, termed the Residual Mass Severity Index (RMSI). The RMSI improves on the Residual Mass Curve by allowing extreme deficit periods to be easily identified without the need for manual inspection of the Residual Mass Curve. Another advantage of the RMSI is that it does not require a temporal window to be specified to characterise extreme deficit periods, which is needed for many drought indices such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). This paper develops the method for calculating the RMSI using precipitation time series and compares it to the SPI for different drought durations across Australia. Major hydroclimatic extremes during the instrumental period are assessed using RMSI, SPI, and by comparing the RMSI estimates with streamflow data from 467 catchments with varying sizes and climate across Australia. RMSI is a useful index for water managers interested in assessing water availability with potential applicability in summarising the features of historical hydroclimatic extremes as well as future changes in water availability due to anthropogenic climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3astream flow 3atime series analysis 3awater supply 3aAustralia 0aResidual Mass Curve 0aWater availability 0aDrought identification 0aSPI1 aJohnson, Fiona1 aSharma, Ashish0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Nov., v. 602 p.126724-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1267243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012000155500001400275520174700289592002802036650001502064650001402079650001102093650001802104650001502122650001502137650001602152650001402168650001502182650002302197650001802220651001002238700001302248700001702261700001502278773012802293856007402421852000902495655001202504IND60733636920221120123905.0210410e20210406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073363692DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130714022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Chen 10aRetrieving Photometric Properties and Soil Moisture Content of Tidal Flats Using Bidirectional Spectral Reflectance  aNAL-light  aMoisture content in tidal flats changes frequently and spatially on account of tidal fluctuations, which greatly influence the reflectance of the tidal flat surface. Precise prediction of the spatial-temporal variation of tidal flats’ moisture content is an important foundation of surface bio-geophysical information research by remote sensing. In this paper, we first measured the multi-angle reflectance of soil samples obtained from tidal flats in the northeastern Dongtai, Jiangsu Province, China, in the laboratory. Then, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, we retrieved the photometric characteristics of the soil surface by employing the SOILSPECT bidirectional reflectance model. Finally, the soil moisture content was retrieved by introducing the equivalent water thickness of the soil. The results showed that: (i) A significant correlation existed between the retrieved equivalent water thickness and the measured soil moisture content. The SOILSPECT model is capable of estimating soil moisture with high precision by using multi-angle reflectance. (ii) Retrieved values of single scattering albedo (ω) were consistent with the variation of soil moisture content. The roughness parameter (h) and the asymmetry factor (Θ) were consistent with the structure and particle composition of the soil surface in dry soil samples. (iii) When the soil samples were soaked with water, the roughness parameter (h) and the type of scattering on the soil surface both showed irregular changes. These results support the importance of using the measured soil particle size as one of the parameters for the retrieval of soil moisture content, which is a method that should be used cautiously, especially in tidal flats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aasymmetry 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aphotometry 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aroughness 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3awater content 3aChina1 aXu, Min 1 aXu, Hanzeyu 1 aZhou, Wei 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Apr. 06, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130714023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010300168520172700271592002801998650002402026650001202050650001102062650000702073650001402080650000902094650001102103650000902114650002502123651001002148653001002158653001702168653001102185653002002196653001802216700001802234700001902252700001702271773008702288856008502375852000902460655001202469IND60790523220221122051731.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079052322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2022.1065922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin Shen, You10aFine-scale effect of karst rock outcrops on adjacent soil and plant communities in Southwest China  aRock outcrops (ROCs) are common structures in terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in regions characterised by karst-type landscapes. However, their effects on adjacent soil and plant communities have rarely been studied. In this study, soil physical and chemical parameters and plant biomass along distances adjacent to ROCs were investigated and compared to evaluate their effects on the surrounding environment. Thirty isolated ROCs were randomly selected from semi-humid karst grasslands in Southwest China. Rainfall and ROC runoff were collected for chemical analyses. The soil physical and chemical parameters as well as the aboveground and belowground biomass (AGB and BGB, respectively) of plants were determined at 0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 91–190, and 191–290 cm intervals, adjacent to the ROC rock–soil interface. The pH and total organic carbon and Ca contents were higher but P and K contents were lower in ROC runoff than in rainwater. A few of the soil physical and chemical parameters were significantly high in samples at 0–30 cm and corresponded with the contents in runoff. The AGB and BGB in the 0–30 cm and 31–60 cm plots were significantly higher than those located at a greater distance and correlated to the size parameters of ROCs. The maximum effective distance of ROCs was approximately 75 cm. Plant biomass increased sharply in the 0–30 cm and 31–60 cm plots, with an increase in coverage in the range of 0.7 and 1.3 m². Our findings suggest that karst ROCs affect the physical and chemical parameters of soil and adjacent plant biomass significantly on fine scales, and these effects are correlated with the size parameters associated with ROCs, such as coverage area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abelowground biomass 3acatenas 3akarsts 3apH 3aphytomass 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil 3atotal organic carbon 3aChina 0aKarst 0aRock outcrop 0aRunoff 0aSoil parameters 0aPlant biomass1 aWang, Qing He1 aZhao, Zhi Meng1 aYuan, Chuang0 tCatena.g2022 Dec., v. 219 p.106592-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.1065923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03800naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245012900209300001800338520200500356592002802361596009802389596009802487596012002585596008502705650001802790650001402808650001102822650001502833650000902848650001902857650002002876650001602896650001902912650002002931650001602951700001402967700005802981700001703039700001403056700005503070773012003125856008803245852000903333655001203342IND60784352320221122194902.0220726e20220706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078435232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c010962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wuchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6447-252010aSynergistic Effects of Weak Alkaline–Surfactant–Polymer and SiO₂ Nanoparticles Flooding on Enhanced Heavy Oil Recovery  ap. 7402-7413.  aThe alkaline–surfactant–polymer (ASP) enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a promising tertiary oil recovery technique for maximizing oil production. However, strong alkaline (e.g., NaOH) or high concentration of an alkali may cause new problems, such as formation erosion, alkali deposition, and high production costs. In this study, a new EOR method was proposed by combining a traditional weak alkaline (Na₂CO₃) ASP flooding and nanotechnology. We investigated the synergistic effects of weak alkaline ASP chemicals and SiO₂ nanoparticles on the EOR through comprehensive experiments. The efficacy of the mixtures was examined using a framework including interfacial tension and wettability characterizations, flow visualization experiments of emulsion, and oil recovery tests under reservoir temperature conditions. Moreover, the effects of weak alkaline ASP chemicals and SiO₂ nanoparticles on interfacial properties and the EOR were carefully investigated by a comprehensive analysis. The experimental results show that the ASP + SiO₂ nanoparticles mixture has a greater ability to reduce the interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and water as well as their contact angle, compared with a hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM)/ASP-only solution. The ASP + SiO₂ nanoparticles mixture is better than the HPAM/ASP-only solution in profile control and displacement efficiency after water flooding. The SiO₂ NPs/ASP mixture increases the oil recovery by 6.67% of original oil in place (OOIP), compared to the ASP-only solution. In visualization flooding experiments, the ASP + SiO₂ nanoparticles mixture forms strong viscoelastic, thermodynamic, and kinetic stability of the droplets, thereby resulting in a larger sweep efficiency and better displacement efficiency by the stable blocking effects and strong scratch effect. It indicates that this new method can enhance oil recovery, have potential to reduce chemical agent cost, and avoid probable formation erosion and alkali deposition.  aPublisher supplied data  a52004302cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aU20B6003cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2462021YXZZ012cScience Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijingdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010244  aU20B6003cChina Petrochemical Corporationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010824 3acontact angle 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3ahydrolysis 3aoils 3apolyacrylamide 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3aviscoelasticity 3awettability1 aPeng, Yan1 aChen, Zhangxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9107-19251 aLiu, Huiqing1 aFan, Jian1 aLiu, Yishan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6384-99550 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 July 06, v. 36, no. 14 p.7402-7413dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c010963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002000172245009700192300001600289520176100305592002802066650001502094650002502109650001002134650001002144650002702154650002002181650001002201650001202211650001102223650001302234650001402247650001402261650001902275650001502294650002702309650001402336650001902350650000902369650001802378650001002396650005502406650004702461650004502508650001502553700001502568700001602583700001802599773008302617856008902700852000902789655001202798IND4466442920221118234639.0141110e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446644292DNAL7 a213495682pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.01.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchröder, J.J.10aImproved phosphorus use efficiency in agriculture: A key requirement for its sustainable use  ap. 822-831.  aMineral phosphorus (P) fertilizers processed from fossil reserves have enhanced food production over the past 50years and, hence, the welfare of billions of people. Fertilizer P has, however, not only been used to lift the fertility level of formerly poor soils, but also allowed people to neglect the reuse of P that humans ingest in the form of food and excrete again as faeces and urine and also in other organic wastes. Consequently, P mainly moves in a linear direction from mines to distant locations for crop production, processing and consumption, where a large fraction eventually may become either agronomically inactive due to over-application, unsuitable for recycling due to fixation, contamination or dilution, and harmful as a polluting agent of surface water. This type of P use is not sustainable because fossil phosphate rock reserves are finite. Once the high quality phosphate rock reserves become depleted, too little P will be available for the soils of food-producing regions that still require P supplements to facilitate efficient utilization of resources other than P, including other nutrients. The paper shows that the amounts of P applied in agriculture could be considerably smaller by optimizing land use, improvement of fertilizer recommendations and application techniques, modified livestock diets, and adjustment of livestock densities to available land. Such a concerted set of measures is expected to reduce the use of P in agriculture whilst maintaining crop yields and minimizing the environmental impact of P losses. The paper also argues that compensation of the P exported from farms should eventually be fully based on P recovered from ‘wastes’, the recycling of which should be stimulated by policy measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental impact 3afarms 3afeces 3afertilizer application 3afood production 3afoods 3afossils 3ahumans 3aland use 3alivestock 3anutrients 3aorganic wastes 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3arecycling 3arock phosphate 3asoil 3asurface water 3aurine 2aAgriculturexmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aFertilizersxstatistics & numerical data 2aPhosphorus1 aSmit, A.L.1 aCordell, D.1 aRosemarin, A.0 tChemosphere.g2011 Aug., v. 84, no. 6 p.822-831dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.01.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005100165300001600216500001900232520166500251592002801916650001501944650001101959650000801970650001901978650001901997650001502016650001602031650001802047650001202065650001702077650002202094650001802116650001302134650002102147650003302168650001502201700001902216773012002235856008102355852000902436655001202445IND60734661620221117094942.0210421e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073466162DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293210301332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmagin, A. V.10aEffect of Wind on Soil-Atmosphere Gas Exchange  ap. 372-380.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlobal climate change in recent decades is accompanied by rising temperatures and increasing cyclonic activity with strong air flows. How do they affect soil respiration? Is it possible to expect an increase in CO₂ emissions and, consequently, a positive feedback of climate change through the greenhouse effect? These questions cannot be answered without the insight into the effect of wind speed on the gas exchange between soil and atmosphere in different landscapes. The paper summarizes the long-term measurements of CO₂ efflux from forest-steppe chernozems (Kursk oblast, Russia) in natural and anthropogenic landscapes with forest or herbaceous vegetation depending on wind speed; it presents a physically grounded approach to its quantitative first-approximation (linear) description. The approach assumes an impact of wind through increased forced convection and turbulent diffusivity along with a potential reduction in diffusion mass transfer due to a decrease in the gradient of CO₂ concentration between the atmosphere and soil. The constructed inverse parabolic dependence adequately describes the empirical data and assumes a twofold increase in the emission with the wind speed increase to the critical value of 3 m/s and its decreases to the initial level with the further wind speed increase to 6–7 m/s. The intensity of forced convection of soil air turns out to be by five–six orders of magnitude lower than the wind speed in the atmosphere but not inferior to the intensity of conventional isothermal CO₂ diffusion, which suggests that this mechanism is to be taken into account in the models of soil–atmosphere gas exchange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3aRussia 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aconvection 3adiffusivity 3aforest steppe 3aforests 3agas exchange 3agreenhouse effect 3amass transfer 3asoil air 3asoil respiration 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3awind speed1 aKarelin, D.

The site is situated entirely on dredged fill soil, rendering it an intriguing site on which to study natural succession. This floristic inventory provides baseline data on the species composition at the site for use in future studies of the Palm Hammock and other forested dredge and fill sites. A total of 157 vascular species were collected from the 4.6 ha site, including 155 angiosperms. Of these, 99 species are native to North America, and 58 species are not native. Of the nonnative species, 20 are considered invasive. The most frequently represented families included Asteraceae (18), Fabaceae (18), Poaceae (14), and Cyperaceae (11). The Palm Hammock Nature Area, which comprises small patches of cabbage palm/oak hammock, cabbage palm stands, and grasslands similar to coastal savannas, shares characteristic species and composition with both maritime and mesic hammocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aCyperaceae 3aFabaceae 3aPoaceae 3aSabal palmetto 3abotanical composition 3aflora 3agrasslands 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3asavannas 3asoil 3avascular plants 3aFlorida 0aDredge and fill 0aEckerd College 0aFlorida 0afloristic inventory 0apalm hammock 0aPinellas County 0asuccession1 aIonta, Gretchen M.0 tCastanea.g2015 Sept., v. 80, no. 3 p.183-192dthe Southern Appalachian Botanical Societyx0008-74757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2179%2F15-0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008300168300001600251500001900267520177700286592002802063650001502091650001502106650002202121650001502143650001102158650001802169650001602187650001602203650000902219650001802228650002302246700001602269773012002285856008102405852000902486655001202495IND60734661720221117094259.0210421e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073466172DNAL7 a10.1134/S106422932103008X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuleshova, T. E.10aDynamics of Bioelectric Potential in the Root Zone of Plants during Irrigation  ap. 381-388.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe paper concerns influence of water distribution on the bioelectric potential in the soil–plant system. Two methods for measuring bioelectric potentials (BEPs) of plants have been compared, namely an invasive installation of needle electrodes (a) and a noninvasive method of providing contact due to root intergrowth through a metal grid (b). It has been shown that needle electrode installation into plant tissue leads to a decrease in the biopotential difference from 70 mV to a noise level within ~ 30 minutes; in fact, this means measuring the potentials generated by the plant organism due to the stress caused by the damage. On the contrary, noninvasive electrode installation provides long-term measurements for months and even longer. A specific system is suggested for automated electrophytogram based on the noninvasive method. It allows one long-term measurement of the plant electrophysiological signal directly under normal living conditions for the rhizosphere; it indicates the current functional state of a plant. An equivalent BEP measurement scheme has been proposed accounting for both electrical properties of the plant and root–inhabited medium. BEPs have been measured under conditions of varying water content in the root zone and water movement along and against the root growth direction. The biopotential is constant on average and fluctuates stochastically in the range from 245 to 275 mV at 60–70% of the total water capacity of the soil substrate. The bioelectric potential decreases almost twice when the soil dries. It is restored after irrigation and the restoration delay time increases with increasing water-deficit period. A model is proposed describing the effects in the system during a water-deficiency regime and irrigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophysiology 3airrigation 3amodels 3aplant tissues 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3asoil 3awater content 3awater distribution1 aGall, N.

The failure of a plethora of promising anticancer drugs is mostly due to the insurgence of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomena with various factors, both physio-pathological and cellular, being responsible for their development. Over the past 40 years, the impressive progress in the nanotechnology field and its application in medicine (i.e., nanomedicine) enabled the development of novel cancer treatments with improved specificity and efficacy, mainly referring to the possibility to overcome MDR. However, the emergence of many nanomedicines defined in the literature as “overcoming the resistance” has resulted in very few of them eventually being approved for clinical application and reaching the marketplace (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (Myocet®, Caelix®) and paclitaxel nanoparticles (Abraxane®), for instance). The capacity of nanomedicines to overcome physio-pathological-based resistance by enhancing drug accumulation at the tumor site via passive and ligand-mediated targeting has been largely reviewed in the past few years. This review will specifically focus on the cellular mechanisms involved in the MDR, which will be discussed with respect to the cellular site in which their action is exerted (that is, membrane, cytoplasm or nucleus). A complete overview of various nanomedicines designed to bypass or directly inhibit each of these specific resistance mechanisms will be offered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasm 3adoxorubicin 3amarkets 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3apatients 3aremission 3aresistance mechanisms1 aMura, Simona1 aCouvreur, Patrick0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 July 27, v. 4, no. 30 p.5078-5100dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb00900j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111040001800132100002700150245010800177300001300285506017300298520020800471650001600679650001400695651001300709700002300722773011700745856011200862956022000974961000901194852000901203655001201212IND50066361720221214230236.0130514s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006636172DNAL7 a2813092aris7 a10113/564772hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteiner Jr., Warren E.10aFirst Records of the Deer Nasal Bot Fly, Cephenemyia phobifer (Clark) (Diptera: Oestridae), in Maryland  ap. 8-10.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe Deer Nasal Bot, Cephenemyia phobifer (Clark), is recorded for Maryland for the first time, based on rearing and collection records.

Using the seasonal co-occurrence of three tuna species in the eastern Pacific Ocean as a model system, we used cardiac gene expression data (as a proxy for thermal tolerance to low temperatures), archival tag data, and diet analyses to examine the vertical niche expansion hypothesis for endothermy in situ. Yellowfin, albacore, and Pacific bluefin tuna (PBFT) in the California Current system used more surface, mesopelagic, and deep waters, respectively. Expression of cardiac genes for calcium cycling increased in PBFT and coincided with broader vertical and thermal niche utilization. However, the PBFT diet was less diverse and focused on energy-rich forage fishes but did not show the greatest energy gains. Ecosystem-based management strategies for tunas should thus consider species-specific differences in physiology and foraging specialization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aThunnus alalunga 3aThunnus orientalis 3acalcium 3acold tolerance 3adiet 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aforage 3aforaging 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheat tolerance 3aphysiology 3atuna 3aPacific Ocean 0apelagic 0atuna 0aThunnus 0aevolution 0aendothermy1 aCarlisle, Aaron B.1 aGardner, Luke D.1 aJayasundara, Nishad1 aMicheli, Fiorenza1 aSchaefer, Kurt M.1 aFuller, Daniel W.1 aBlock, Barbara A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 July 7, v. 112, no. 27 p.8350-8355dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15005241123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010300162500001400265520166300279592002801942650002201970650003101992650002402023650001202047650001602059700002302075700002302098700002702121700002202148773012802170856007402298852000902372655001202381IND60733637320221120123848.0210410e20210406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073363732DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130714062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDardanelli, Gino 10aNRTK, PPP or Static, That Is the Question. Testing Different Positioning Solutions for GNSS Survey  aNAL-light  aWorldwide, the determination of the coordinates from a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) survey (in Network Real Time Kinematic, Precise Point Positioning, or static mode) has been analysed in several scientific and technical applications. Many of those have been carried out to compare Precise Point Positioning (PPP), Network Real Time Kinematic (NRTK), and static modes’ solutions, usually, using the latter as the true or the most plausible solution. This approach is not always possible as the static mode solution depends on several parameters (baseline length, acquisition time, ionospheric, and tropospheric models, etc.) that must be considered to evaluate the accuracy of the method. This work aims to show the comparison among the GNSS survey methods mentioned above, using some benchmark points. The tests were carried out by comparing the survey methods in pairs to check their solutions congruence. The NRTK and the static solutions refer to a local GNSS CORS network’s analysis. The NRTK positioning has been obtained with different methods (VRS, FKP, NEA) and the PPP solution has been calculated with two different software (RTKLIB and CSRS-PPP). A statistical approach has been performed to check if the distribution frequencies of the coordinate’s residual belong to the normal distribution, for all pairs analysed. The results show that the hypothesis of a normal distribution is confirmed in most of the pairs and, specifically, the Static vs. NRTK pair seems to achieve the best congruence, while involving the PPP approach, pairs obtained with CSRS software achieve better congruence than those involving RTKLIB software.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aglobal positioning systems 3anormal distribution 3asurveys 3atroposphere1 aMaltese, Antonino 1 aPipitone, Claudia 1 aPisciotta, Alessandro 1 aLo Brutto, Mauro 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Apr. 06, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130714063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245019200169500002200361520103700383592002801420653003701448653002401485653001701509653004201526653002701568700001701595700001901612773009301631856008301724852000901807655001201816IND60564780020221121074459.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056478002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jddst.2017.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHattori, Yusuke10aEffect of coexisting atorvastatin calcium on in vitro uremic-like-toxin adsorption in gastrointestinal tract model solution by spherical carbon adsorbent for chronic renal failure therapy  aPre-press version  aThe adsorption kinetics of urine-like-toxin indole-3-acetic acid (IA) by spherical carbonaceous adsorbent (SC) was inhibited by competitive effect of atorvastatin calcium (AT).Competitive effect of AT on the adsorption behavior of IA by SC was investigated by ultraviolet (UV) absorption/chemometrics method.

It helps to provide an inherent way to understand the synergy and trade-offs between human beings and their natural environment. Regulatory ecosystem services (RES) are significantly important to maintaining the world in which people can live, and control the negative effects of flood, disasters, and diseases. It can also provide regulatory services like ecosystem protection, human safety, and the provision of other ES. However, emerging ES decision-making agendas focus on ES that is tangible and has a direct link with human well-being. Thus, the attention given to RES is low due to its less tangible benefits and complexity to measure the benefits. Disregarding and lack of attention from policymakers and scientific community may lead to unintended risks to human well-being and significant influences on the provision of other ES. This study describes the research trends on RES, knowledge generated, and the major limitation. We concluded that though there is an exponential growth of scientific publications on ES, no adequate studies were found on RES. Also, the existed studies varied in their size and types of RES indicators covered, habitats/ecosystems, and geographic extent addressed. There was also a lack of connecting knowledge generated on the benefits of RES with the national policy of natural resource management, inconsistency of ES classification, and methodological diversity. Therefore, scientific communities are promoted to link RES studies with human health. Besides, the researcher should give priority for the least studied ecosystems and its services, developing robust methodology, and proposing management options to enhance the regulatory services of ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adisasters 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3anatural resource management 3asocial welfare1 aSoromessa, Teshome1 aFeyisa, Gudina Legese0 tEcological processes.g2020 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.40-40dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22887x2192-17097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-020-00241-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011400168520196100282592002802243650001102271650001502282650001602297650001102313650001102324650001602335650001902351650001502370650001502385653001902400653001902419653002602438653002602464653002402490700001902514700001802533700001502551700002002566700001402586773010502600856008602705852000902791655001202800IND60745963220221116163450.0211029e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074596322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1267382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yinmao10aFuture precipitation, hydrology and hydropower generation in the Yalong River Basin: Projections and analysis  aIn recent years, the impact of global warming has raised public concern over the precipitation-induced geological hazards, water security and energy security in the Yalong River Basin (YRB). Therefore, it is advisable to identify the variations of future precipitation, hydrology and hydropower generation under the joint impact of global warming and the operation of local hydropower reservoirs. To this end, the ensemble mean of the bias corrected NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) climate projections downscaled from 10 global climate models (GCMs) was applied to seven precipitation indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and the ensemble of two distributed hydrologic models (VIC and CREST) under the global warming of 1.5 °C and 2 °C. Reservoir operation based on actual operation rules and the hydropower optimization model were explicitly included in the routing module to represent the impact of the local hydropower reservoirs, respectively. The future natural runoff is likely to increase under RCP8.5, decrease under RCP4.5, and see a larger daily variability under both. The local hydropower reservoirs can effectively mitigate the negative climate impact on the basin hydrology, and the basin is expected to see increased dry-season runoff, decreased wet-season runoff, and lower daily variability of runoff under all scenarios as compared to the baseline period. The future hydropower generation of the YRB is consistent with the variation of future runoff, and reservoir operation with hydropower optimized rules can produce about 5% electricity more than the current actual operation rules, highlighting the potential need to adapt the current operation rules to future climate conditions. Our framework and findings are expected to provide instructive information for water resources management not only in the YRB but also in different regions worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adry season 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3arunoff 3awater power 3awater security 3awatersheds 3awet season 0aClimate change 0aGlobal warming 0aHydropower generation 0aExtreme precipitation 0aReservoir operation1 aDong, Ningpeng1 aLi, Zhansheng1 aZhang, Wei1 aYang, Mingxiang1 aWang, Hao0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Nov., v. 602 p.126738-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1267383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009900171300001600270520098300286592002801269650002401297650002201321650002201343650002001365650001701385650001301402653002201415653002601437653002101463653002001484700002201504700002001526773010801546856008601654852000901740655001201749IND60617677420221118090052.0190329e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061767742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharvet, Agathe10aMechanical and ultimate properties of injection molded cellulose acetate/plasticizer materials  ap. 182-189.  aThe mechanical properties of injection molded plasticized cellulose acetate polymers processed with two different plasticizers (Triacetine and Diethyl phthalate) and various weight fractions comprised between 15 and 30 wt % have been investigated. Plasticized cellulose acetate exhibit a brittle-to-ductile transition from a low impact strength to a high impact strength of order 40 kJ/m². Obtaining a high impact resistance at room temperature requires plasticizer content larger than 25 wt.%. An important strain hardening is obtained for samples with both plasticizers during tensile experiment. At 15 wt.% plasticizer content, the measured strain hardening modulus is around 148 MPa at 60 °C. Different parameters influencing the strain hardening behavior have been identified: the tensile direction as compared to that of the injection flow, the temperature and the plasticizer, consistent with studies on pre-strained samples of synthetic amorphous polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acellulose acetate 3adiethyl phthalate 3aimpact strength 3aplasticizers 3apolymers 0aCellulose acetate 0aMechanical properties 0aStrain hardening 0aImpact strength1 aVergelati, Caroll1 aLong, Didier R.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 204 p.182-189dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013500166520153400301592002801835650003001863650001501893650001201908650001401920650001201934650001101946650001901957650001201976650001901988650001102007650001702018650000902035650001302044650001302057650001102070650001402081650002102095650001802116653001602134653002202150653002602172653002302198653002702221700001502248700001902263700001802282700001402300700001402314700001402328700001602342773011602358856008702474852000902561655001202570IND60751864220221120175123.0211017e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075186422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1147462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Cheng10aThermodynamic analysis of a novel biomass polygeneration system for ammonia synthesis and power generation using Allam power cycle  aThe massive utilization of fossil energy in power generation section and chemical production industry causes serious environmental pollution and global warming issues. The bioenergy utilization is considered to be a feasible approach in the short term to meet the climate goals. A novel biomass based polygeneration system for power generation and ammonia synthesis was proposed in this study. The negative CO₂ emission is achieved by incorporating Allam power cycle with internal carbon capture. The pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology is adopted to separate the hydrogen for ammonia synthesis, and the remaining syngas is burned with pure oxygen in the Allam cycle to generate electric power, achieving the classified utilization of materials and simple and efficient capture of CO₂. Comparing with the ammonia synthesis and the power generation reference systems, the proposed system omitted the processes with huge exergy destruction for the ammonia synthesis and the exergy destruction of the Allam cycle unit was also reduced through efficient heat integration. The thermodynamic performance is determined by the developed energy analysis models and the process simulation. The root cause of the thermodynamic benefits of this proposed system is revealed by the comprehensive exergy flow analysis. Results showed that the energy saving ratio of the polygeneration system is 7.61% comparing with the reference systems, and the exergy efficiency of the polygeneration system is 3.90% higher than reference systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aelectric power 3aexergy 3afossil fuels 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3aindustry 3aoxygen 3apollution 3apower generation 3asynthesis gas 0aAllam cycle 0aAmmonia synthesis 0aNegative CO2 emission 0aSystem integration 0aThermodynamic analysis1 aLiu, Yuhao1 aZhang, Qingmin1 aXin, Tuantuan1 aZhao, Rui1 aWang, Min1 aSaw, Woei1 aLu, Shijian0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 247 p.114746-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1147463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002300169245011400192300001800306520103000324592002801354650002401382650001101406650001401417650002201431650001201453650002301465650001101488650001901499650002301518650001701541650003401558650002701592650003301619650001501652650001001667650003301677650003201710650002301742650001301765650001101778650002201789650002101811650003201832700002201864700001901886700002201905773009701927856008602024852000902110655001202119IND4448484920221118234611.0141110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444848492DNAL7 a211949342pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhar, Bipro Ranjan10aPretreatment of municipal waste activated sludge for volatile sulfur compounds control in anaerobic digestion  ap. 3776-3782.  aThe effect of combination of mechanical and chemical pretreatment of municipal waste activated sludge (WAS) prior to anaerobic digestion was studied using a laboratory scale system with an objective to decrease volatile sulfur compounds in biogas and digested sludge. Mechanical pretreatment was conducted using depressurization of WAS through a valve from a batch pretreatment reactor pressurized at 75±1psi, while combined pretreatments were conducted using six different dosages of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and ferrous chloride (FeCl₂) along with mechanical pretreatment. About 37–46% removal of H₂S in biogas occurred for different combined pretreatment conditions. Sludge solubilization achieved due to the mechanical pretreatment increased total cumulative methane production by 8–10% after 30days during the biochemical methane potential (BMP) test. The pretreatment also improved dewaterability in terms of time to filter (TTF), and decreased methyl mercaptan generation potential of the digested sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3achlorides 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amethane 3amethane production 3asludge 3asolubilization 3avolatile compounds 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aFerrous Compoundsxchemistry 2aFiltration 2aGases 2aHydrogen Peroxidexchemistry 2aHydrogen Sulfidexchemistry 2aMethanexchemistry 2aPressure 2aSewage 2aSulfurxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aYoussef, Emhemmed1 aNakhla, George1 aRay, Madhumita B.0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Feb., v. 102, no. 4 p.3776-3782dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002100135245008700156300001500243520096900258592002801227650001901255650001901274650002501293650001901318650002401337650001901361650001401380650001201394650001501406700001601421700001801437700002001455773015201475856006901627856010001696990002301796852000901819655001201828IND60704325320221120085727.0200723e20200722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070432532DNAL7 a10.3791/610772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Chun-Chia10aDiscovery of driver genes in colorectal ht29-derived cancer stem-like tumorspheres  ap. e61077.  aCancer stem cells play a vital role against clinical therapies, contributing to tumor relapse. There are many oncogenes involved in tumorigenesis and the initiation of cancer stemness properties. Since gene expression in the formation of colorectal cancer-derived tumorspheres is unclear, it takes time to discover the mechanisms working on one gene at a time. This study demonstrates a method to quickly discover the driver genes involved in the survival of the colorectal cancer stem-like cells in vitro. Colorectal HT29 cancer cells that express the LGR5 when cultured as spheroids and accompany an increase CD133 stemness markers were selected and used in this study. The protocol presented is used to perform RNAseq with available bioinformatics to quickly uncover the overexpressed driver genes in the formation of colorectal HT29-derived stem-like tumorspheres. The methodology can quickly screen and discover potential driver genes in other disease models.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3acarcinogenesis 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adisease models 3agene overexpression 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3arelapse 3astem cells1 aHsu, Po-Jui1 aSie, Zong-Lin1 aChen, Fang-Hsin0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 July 22, , no. 161 p.e61077-e61077dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/610773Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/61077/discovery-driver-genes-colorectal-ht29-derived-cancer-stem-like  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016400168520132200332592002801654650001501682650002301697650001301720653005701733653003201790653001501822653003101837653002501868700001601893700001801909700001501927700001501942700001901957773011401976856008502090852000902175655001202184IND60766249220221120083924.0220726e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076624922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4628642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yanlong10aSimultaneous enrichment of bisphenols and polyfluoroalkyl substances by cyclodextrin-fluorinated covalent organic frameworks membrane in food packaging samples  aEfficient separation and preconcentration of trace harmful substances in food samples is a prerequisite for reliable analysis. Most of harmful substances with different properties coexist in the food samples, which is difficult to achieve simultaneously extraction through traditional adsorbents. In this work, a new adsorbent based on cyclodextrin- fluorinated covalent organic frameworks (CD-F-COF) was prepared. The mechanism of the CD-F-COF recognizing polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and bisphenols (BPs) were validated by molecular simulation. The CD-F-COF showed strong fluorophilic and host-guest interactions for polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and bisphenols (BPs), respectively. The CD-F-COF coated membranes were immobilized on the syringe filter and coupled with multi-channel syringe pump to achieve high-throughput sample pretreatment. After that, a sensitive analytical method for the simultaneous enrichment and determination of trace BPs and PFASs was established followed by HPLC-MS/MS. The results indicated that the limits of detection for the seven BPs and three PFASs were in the range of 0.006–0.050 ng/g and 0.001–0.008 ng/g. This method has great potential for application in sample preparation as it can fulfill fast and high-throughput for enrichment of trace multiple targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3amolecular dynamics 3asyringes 0aCyclodextrin-fluorinated covalent organic frameworks 0aDisk solid-phase extraction 0aBisphenols 0aPolyfluoroalkyl substances 0aMolecular simulation1 aLu, Zicheng1 aHuang, Siming1 aLi, Gongke1 aHu, Yuling1 aZhong, Qisheng0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 1666 p.462864-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4628643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010400153500001400257520106000271592002801331650002001359650002001379650002601399650001901425650002001444700001401464700001501478700001201493773012801505856007401633852000901707655001201716IND60733637720221120123900.0210410e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073363772DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130712482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Hao 10aMultiple Spectral Resolution 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification  aNAL-light  aIn recent years, benefiting from the rapid development of deep learning technology in the field of computer vision, the study of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has also made great progress. However, compared with ordinary RGB images, HSIs are more like 3D cubes; therefore, it is necessary and beneficial to explore classification methods suitable for the very special data structure of HSIs. In this paper, we propose Multiple Spectral Resolution 3D Convolutional Neural Network (MSR-3DCNN) for HSI classification tasks. In MSR-3DCNN, we expand the idea of multi-scale feature fusion and dilated convolution from the spatial dimension to the spectral dimension, and combine 3D convolution and residual connection; therefore, it can better adapt to the 3D cubic form of hyperspectral data and make efficient use of spectral information in different bands. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its superiority as compared with some state-of-the-art (SOTA) HSI classification methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer vision 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3aneural networks1 aYao, Wei 1 aCheng, Li 1 aLi, Bo 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130712483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014100157500001400298520131400312592002801626650004401654650001501698650002001713650001401733650002301747650002401770650001801794700001901812700001601831773012801847856007401975852000902049655001202058IND60733637820221120123952.0210410e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073363782DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130712492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sungho 10aAT2ES: Simultaneous Atmospheric Transmittance-Temperature-Emissivity Separation Using Online Upper Midwave Infrared Hyperspectral Images  aNAL-light  aThis paper presents a novel method for atmospheric transmittance-temperature-emissivity separation (AT2ES) using online midwave infrared hyperspectral images. Conventionally, temperature and emissivity separation (TES) is a well-known problem in the remote sensing domain. However, previous approaches use the atmospheric correction process before TES using MODTRAN in the long wave infrared band. Simultaneous online atmospheric transmittance-temperature-emissivity separation starts with approximation of the radiative transfer equation in the upper midwave infrared band. The highest atmospheric band is used to estimate surface temperature, assuming high emissive materials. The lowest atmospheric band (CO2 absorption band) is used to estimate air temperature. Through onsite hyperspectral data regression, atmospheric transmittance is obtained from the y-intercept, and emissivity is separated using the observed radiance, the separated object temperature, the air temperature, and atmospheric transmittance. The advantage with the proposed method is from being the first attempt at simultaneous AT2ES and online separation without any prior knowledge and pre-processing. Midwave Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)-based outdoor experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed AT2ES method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aair temperature 3aequations 3aradiative transfer 3asurface temperature 3atransmittance1 aShin, Jungsub 1 aKim, Sunho 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130712493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245004800163300001400211520106900225592002801294650001901322650002101341650000801362650001301370650001001383650001701393650001101410650001901421651001301440653001901453653002201472653002101494653002001515653001501535653001201550700002401562700002101586773009601607856007801703961001201781852000901793655001201802IND60477497520221120181157.0160120e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047749752DNAL7 a10.1642/AUK-15-114.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallon, Julie M.10aIn-flight turbulence benefits soaring birds  ap. 79-85.  aBirds use atmospheric updrafts to subsidize soaring flight. We observed highly variable soaring flight by Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus) and Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura) in Virginia, USA, that was inconsistent with published descriptions of terrestrial avian flight. Birds engaging in this behavior regularly deviated vertically and horizontally from linear flight paths. We observed the soaring flight behavior of these 2 species to understand why they soar in this manner and when this behavior occurs. Vultures used this type of soaring mainly at low altitudes (<50 m), along forest edges, and when conditions were poor for thermal development. Because of the tortuous nature of this flight, we describe it as “contorted soaring.” The primary air movement suitable to subsidize flight at this altitude and under these atmospheric conditions is small-scale, shear-induced turbulence, which our results suggest can be an important resource for soaring birds because it permits continuous subsidized flight when other types of updraft are not available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCathartes aura 3aCoragyps atratus 3aair 3aaltitude 3abirds 3aedge effects 3aflight 3aturbulent flow 3aVirginia 0aCathartes aura 0acontorted soaring 0aCoragyps atratus 0aflight behavior 0aturbulence 0aupdraft1 aBildstein, Keith L.1 aKatzner, Todd E.0 tAuk.g2016 Jan., v. 133, no. 1 p.79-85dThe American Ornithologists' Unionx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1642%2FAUK-15-114.13Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008300177300001400260520101300274592002801287650001301315650002701328650001001355650001201365650001101377650001101388650001101399650000901410650001401419650001401433650001401447650003301461650001101494650001701505650001401522650001901536650001001555653001901565653002101584653001001605653000901615653000901624653002201633653001201655700003301667700001701700700002301717700002101740700002201761700002301783773010701806856008601913852000901999655001202008IND60605361920221122191828.0190401e20180714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060536192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.03.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanimirović, Bojana10aImpact of clonal selection on Cabernet Franc Grape and wine elemental profiles  ap. 74-80.  aThree Cabernet Franc (CF) clones (Nos. 02, 010 and 012; not yet commercial) obtained in the last phase of clonal selection were examined within this study.

The relative dependence of the selected elements in all samples were estimated using correlation matrices. While elemental profiles of both CF grape and wine samples were highly variable among the analysed clones, bioaccumulation factors (grape/soil) of Mg, Na and Sr were found to be specific for each single clone. Applying principal component analysis, the grape clones were differentiated among each other according to the content of 10 elements (Al, B, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Sr). Finally, hierarchical cluster analysis of CF grape and wine samples pointed out the similarity of the clones Nos. 010 and 012, since they were grouped within the same subcluster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abioaccumulation factor 3aboron 3acalcium 3aclones 3acopper 3agrapes 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3asodium 3aspectroscopy 3astrontium 3avineyard soils 3awines 0aCabernet Franc 0aClonal selection 0aGrape 0aWine 0aSoil 0aElemental profile 0aICP-OES1 aDjordjević, Jelena Popović1 aPejin, Boris1 aMaletić, Radojka,1 aVujović, Dragan1 aRaičević, Petar1 aTešić, Živoslav0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 July 14, v. 237 p.74-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245012000169300001500289520186200304592002802166650002102194650002302215650001002238650001302248650001902261650002602280650001202306650001402318650002202332650001502354650001002369650002002379650002702399650002302426650001502449650001202464650001402476650001502490650001102505650001102516653001702527653001402544653001402558653004202572653001302614653001702627653002602644653001102670700002202681700002002703700002002723700002002743773009702763856007802860852000902938655001202947IND60477497620221120162400.0160120e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047749762DNAL7 a10.1642/AUK-15-129.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Alexandra M.10aNesting phenology, mate choice, and genetic divergence within a partially migratory population of American Kestrels  ap. 99-109.  aStudies across annual cycles are important for understanding the consequences of carryover effects and predicting species' responses to environmental change. Partially migratory populations, which consist of resident and migratory individuals, are excellent systems for studying how wintering strategies may affect reproduction. We examined whether wintering strategy (residency or nonresidency) created temporal divides in egg-laying date within a local breeding population of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) and thus led to assortative mating and genetic divergence between early- and late-breeding birds. For 3 yr, we trapped and marked kestrels in winter and recaptured mated pairs in nest boxes in the subsequent spring. We then genotyped early- and late-breeding kestrels using 6 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Residents nested earlier than nonresidents, but not after the warmest and driest winter of the study. Resident females were more likely to mate with resident males than nonresident males, providing behavioral evidence of assortative mating. However, we found no genetic differentiation or structure between early- and late-breeding kestrel groups. Lack of genetic differences may be the result of condition-dependent changes in wintering strategy, renesting, recent emergence of assortative mating patterns, or sufficient gene flow from pairs with mixed wintering strategies. Nonetheless, our results show that wintering strategy can have carryover effects on nesting phenology and mate choice in partially migratory populations. Given that wintering strategy affects nesting phenology and that nesting phenology has consequences for local fitness, environmental conditions (i.e. warmer winters) may facilitate kestrels remaining in or near temperate breeding areas and may lead to shifts in migratory behavior and nesting phenology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFalco sparverius 3aassortative mating 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3amales 3amating behavior 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amigratory behavior 3anest boxes 3anesting 3aphenology 3aprediction 3aspring 3awinter 0aannual cycle 0acarryover 0aevolution 0agenetic diversity and differentiation 0agenotype 0anonmigratory 0aphenotypic plasticity 0awinter1 aNovak, Stephen J.1 aSmith, James F.1 aSteenhof, Karen1 aHeath, Julie A.0 tAuk.g2016 Jan., v. 133, no. 1 p.99-109dThe American Ornithologists' Unionx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1642%2FAUK-15-129.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245018000172520121700352592002801569650001601597650001401613650001901627650001101646650003101657650004101688650002901729650001001758653001601768653001601784653001601800653002101816700001901837700002101856700002601877700001801903700002301921773011401944856008502058852000902143655001202152IND60766249420221120084026.0220314e20220329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076624942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4628702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖztürk Er, Elif10aAccurate determination of amino acids by quadruple isotope dilution-reverse phase liquid Chromatography-Tandem mass spectrometry after derivatization with 2-Naphthoyl chloride  aThe determination of amino acids in biological samples is central to the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders and also gives significant information about the metabolisms in the cells and living body. The development of analytical method for reliable quantification of amino acids in biological samples is still challenging because of the polar nature of amino acids and complex nature of biological samples causing a high degree of interferences during analysis. In the present study, a pre-column derivatization method using 2-naphtoyl chloride combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the determination of 17 amino acids in human serum and urine matrices. Low detection limits were obtained in the range of 0.015 – 0.266 µmol kg⁻¹ and acceptable recovery results were obtained in human serum and urine samples. Isotopically labelled (¹⁵N labelled) amino acids were spiked to standards and samples before derivatization to compensate for the analytical errors in the whole procedure. The combination of quadrupole isotope dilution strategy with the derivatization based reversed phase chromatography allowed to improve method accuracy and precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3achlorides 3aderivatization 3ahumans 3aisotope dilution technique 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 0aAmino acids 0aHuman serum 0aHuman urine 0aIsotope dilution1 aErarpat, Sezin1 aBodur, Süleyman1 aGünkara, Ömer Tahir1 aÖzbek, Belma1 aBakırdere, Sezgin0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 Mar. 29, v. 1667 p.462870-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4628703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007600164300001300240500001900253520161400272592002801886596006901914650001301983650001601996650001902012650002202031650001002053650001102063650003402074650001202108650002102120650001902141650001402160650001302174650001302187650002102200650002502221650002002246700001302266700001702279773011002296856008202406852000902488655001202497IND60734662420221117095044.0210421e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073466242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-020-09453-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yingqiu10aGenome-Wide Analysis of the Pectin Methylesterase Gene Family in Potato  ap. 1-19.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPectin methylesterase (PME) is a type of protein encoded by a multi-gene family and participates in seed germination, fruit ripening and stress response. To further study the function of the PME gene family in potato, this paper screened and identified potato PME gene family by bioinformatics methods, and analysed the structure, physicochemical properties, conserved domains and evolutionary relationships of the gene sequences. The results showed that the identified 54 potato PME genes can be divided into Group I (only PME domain) and Group II (both PME domain and PMEI domain). The phylogenetic tree constructed by the maximum likelihood method indicated that potato PME genes consisted of five subfamilies. The protein sequences of potato PME genes were compared with clustalx2.1 software. Most of these sequences were identified to have five conserved structural regions including Gx Yx E (Region I), QAVAxR (Region II), QDTL (Region III), GxxDFIFG (Region IV) and YLGRxWx (Region V). Conserved motifs of potato PME amino acid sequences were analysed by MEME online software. Motif1 contains three of the five conserved structural regions and motif2 and motif8 each contain one, indicating that these sequences are more conservative. The structure of 54 potato PME gene sequences was analysed by the GSDS website. It was found that there were only two parts, exon or coding sequence (CDS) between untranslated regions (UTRs), without intron structures in these sequences, indicating that the structure is relatively simple. It will provide a reference for the study on the function of potato PME gene.  aPublisher supplied data  a31660352, 31660350cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aInternet 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3acomputer software 3aexons 3afruits 3agenome-wide association study 3aintrons 3amultigene family 3apectinesterase 3aphylogeny 3apotatoes 3aresearch 3aseed germination 3astatistical analysis 3astress response1 aHe, Huyi1 aHe, Long-Fei0 tPotato research.g2021 Mar., v. 64, no. 1 p.1-19dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl47412x0014-30657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-020-09453-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245007700169300001800246520155100264592002801815596007401843596009801917596009802015650002202113650000902135650001602144650001302160650001102173650001302184650002302197650002002220650001402240650001302254650000902267650001302276650001602289650001802305700005302323700002202376700001702398700005502415773012002470856008802590852000902678655001202687IND60784353120221122194845.0220726e20220708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078435312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c011892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jingyu10aHydrogen Diffusion in Clay Slit: Implications for the Geological Storage  ap. 7651-7660.  aWe determined the self-diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in clay (montmorillonite) nanopores using molecular dynamics under subsurface conditions. We explored the effects of temperature, pressure, pore size, moisture content, and salinity. Our results show that the self-diffusion coefficient of hydrogen is on the order of magnitude of 10–⁸ m²/s. The diffusivity of confined hydrogen increases moderately with temperature and slit aperture but declines with pressure. The estimated density profile suggests that only one dense layer of hydrogen molecules is adsorbed near the slit surface. The distinct diffusion coefficients in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the basal surfaces confirm the confinement effect of the substrates. As the volume ratio of hydrogen increases, the existing pattern of hydrogen changes from a droplet to a layer sandwiched by the aqueous solution. The water bridge will act as a piston for the hydrogen droplet and impede hydrogen diffusion. However, when the hydrogen and brine form a stratified structure, the self-diffusion coefficient of hydrogen sandwiched by two brine films is similar to that of confined pure gas at the same pressure and temperature conditions. If the brine salinity reaches some extent, part of brine and hydrogen molecules will mix as a new phase, which slightly inhibits the hydrogen diffusion. This work provides a better insight into hydrogen diffusion through the clay nanopores, which is critical for reliably assessing the risk of hydrogen leakage through caprocks.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcUniversity of Texas at Austindhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008562  a51974340cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aU1762213cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aaqueous solutions 3aclay 3adiffusivity 3adroplets 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3amolecular dynamics 3amontmorillonite 3ananopores 3aporosity 3arisk 3asalinity 3atemperature 3awater content1 aWang, Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2472-62041 aJavadpour, Farzam1 aFeng, Qihong1 aCha, Luming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6036-70640 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 July 08, v. 36, no. 14 p.7651-7660dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c011893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245009600206300001600302500001900318500001100337520120700348592002801555650001201583650002301595650001301618650001301631650001301644650001501657650001701672650002001689650001701709700002001726700001701746700002201763700005701785773011301842856008201955852000902037655001202046IND60734662520221117094807.0210421e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073466252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-020-09468-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Baljeet1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7981-662410aPotato Periderm is the First Layer of Defence against Biotic and Abiotic Stresses: a Review  ap. 131-146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThe frequently changing climate has resulted in plants facing more biotic and abiotic stresses than ever before, leading to yield and quality losses. The global population is increasing at an alarming rate and feeding the world has become a huge challenge. Being a staple crop of many countries, potato can help to overcome this challenge. A comprehensive knowledge of physiology, biochemistry and molecular genetics of development and wound healing of potato tuber periderm (skin) is very important as the periderm protects the tubers from skinning injuries, dehydration, bruising and biotic and abiotic stresses. Improvements in tuber periderm are essential to enhance tuber quality and shelf life and reduce financial losses. In this paper, we have reviewed the protective roles of tuber periderm layer in response to stress and injuries. Moreover, molecular regulation of native and wound-induced periderm formation has been discussed. Since suberization is an important aspect of tuber periderm formation and wound healing, we have also reviewed the key genes involved in this process. This review will pave the way for obtaining potato tubers resistant to various abiotic and pathogenic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3amolecular genetics 3aperiderm 3apotatoes 3aresearch 3ashelf life 3astaple crops 3astress response 3asuberization1 aBhardwaj, Vinay1 aKaur, Kuljot1 aKukreja, Sarvjeet1 aGoutam, Umesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8754-79860 tPotato research.g2021 Mar., v. 64, no. 1 p.131-146dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl47412x0014-30657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-020-09468-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245019300179300001800372520152900390592002801919596011001947596009602057596010602153596007602259596011002335596005902445650002902504650001302533650002102546650002202567650002802589650001502617650001502632650001102647650002202658700002602680700005902706700006602765773012002831856008802951852000903039655001203048IND60784353220221122192514.0220726e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078435322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c011912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSebastian, Merin Mary10aSpinel Nickel Ferrite Nanoparticles Supported on a 1T/2H Mixed-Phase MoS₂ Heterostructured Composite as a Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Reactions  ap. 7782-7794.  aA composite electrocatalyst of NiFe₂O₄ supported on a 2H/1T multiphase MoS₂ nanosheet is reported. The as-prepared NiFe₂O₄/MoS₂ heterostructured composite exhibited an excellent bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The composite electrocatalyst exhibited an OER current density of 10 mA cm–² with an overpotential of 330 mV in 1 M KOH comparable to that of IrO₂. On the other hand, the composite electrocatalyst exhibited an ORR onset potential (Eₒₙₛₑₜ) of 0.82 V vs RHE. The K–L plot and rotating ring-disk electrode analysis evidenced that the ORR on the NiFe₂O₄/MoS₂ heterostructure follows closely the 4 e– transfer process similar to Pt/C and delivered notable electrochemical stability after 5000 potential cycles with retention of about 90% diffusion-limiting current density. The H₂–O₂ anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) employing the cathode electrode fabricated with the NiFe₂O₄/MoS₂ composite showed a peak power density of ∼20 mW cm–². In contrast, a peak power density of ∼51 mW cm–² was realized for the AEMFC employing the Pt/C cathode electrode under identical operating conditions. Considering the excellent bifunctional activity, good electrochemical performance and stability, and the low-cost facile synthetic approach, the NiFe₂O₄/MoS₂ heterostructured composite developed in this study can be considered as a potential candidate for energy conversion and storage applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aUGC-DAE-CSR-KC/CRS/19/RC08/0983/1018cUniversity Grants Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001501  aNAcDepartment of Atomic Energy, Government of Indiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001502  aNAcNano Mission Council, Department of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005052  aNAcCouncil for Higher Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005385  aNAcIsrael National Research Center for Electrochemical Propulsiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100013042  aNAcPlanning & Budgeting Committeedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanion-exchange membranes 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3aferrimagnetic materials 3afuel cells 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxygen production1 aVelayudham, Parthiban1 aSchechter, Alex1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3464-19361 aKalarikkal, Nandakumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4595-64660 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 June 29, v. 36, no. 14 p.7782-7794dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c011913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04404naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004000151245016000191300001500351520292600366592002803292650002003320650001403340650002503354650002303379650002403402650002603426650001103452650002603463650001803489650002003507650001703527650001803544653002703562653001403589653002503603653001403628653002303642653001603665700002503681700003703706773010803743856008603851852000903937655001203946IND60605362020221121040330.0190401e20180714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060536202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez Padrón, Richard Alberto10aEstimation of the optimal plot size and number of replications in a field pepper crop experiment with varying irrigation depths and application frequencies  ap. 96-104.  aThe precision of an agronomic field trial, or its ability to detect true treatment effects, can be improved by using both plots of suitable size and an appropriate number of replicates. The objective of this work was to determine the optimal size and number of replications of the experimental plots, by examining differences in plant height, stem diameter and number of fruits per plant, of a bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) crop that was irrigated with different water heights and frequencies of application. Five treatments were compared: T0, control with no irrigation; T1, water depth 50% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and daily frequency; T2, water depth 100% of ETc and daily frequency; T3, water depth 50% of ETc and frequency every two days; and T4, water depth 100% of ETc and frequency every two days. In the experimental plots, 4 m wide × 12 m long (48 m2), a total of 120 bell pepper (cultivar ‘Impacto’) plants were arranged in four rows. Plants in each row were irrigated with a drip irrigation system with drippers placed between them 0.2 m apart and having a flow rate of 0.8 L h−1. The growth rates of the pepper crop and the number of fruits per standing plant were lower in the treatment without irrigation than in the irrigated treatments. Among the irrigated treatments, daily irrigation provided higher growth rates when the lowest depth of water was applied. In the plants irrigated every two days the highest growth rates were observed in those that received the largest water depth. The number of fruits per standing plant was greater in the daily irrigated plants than in those irrigated every two days, regardless of the amount of the water applied. The optimal plot size was determined by the modified maximum curvature method (MMC) and the linear model with plateau effect (LPR). For each of the three variables, the criterion followed to establish the optimal plot size was to choose the largest one, regardless of whether the method used in its determination was MMC or LPR. The size of the experimental plot was always smaller in the case of treatments with irrigation than in the treatment without irrigation, as well as for the crop variables exhibiting lower variability. Therefore, the optimal sizes of the experimental plots for the plant stem height and diameter, and for the number of fruits per plant was estimated at 3.2 m2 (8 plants); 3.6 m2 (9 plants); and 10.8 m2 (27 plants), respectively. Regardless of the experimental design, complete randomized or complete randomized block, the number of replications of the experimental plots was conditioned by the variability of the three variables. Thus, 10 replicates were required to detect between the five irrigation treatments differences of 10% in the mean value of plants height, 5 replicates in the case of the stem diameter of the plants and 15 replicates for the number of fruits per plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3acultivars 3aemitters (equipment) 3aevapotranspiration 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3afruits 3airrigation scheduling 3alinear models 3amicroirrigation 3aplant height 3asweet peppers 0aExperimental precision 0aPlot size 0aNumber of replicates 0aIrrigated 0aWithout irrigation 0aPepper crop1 aLopes, Sidinei José1 aSánchez-Girón Renedo, Víctor,0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 July 14, v. 237 p.96-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012700167300001800294520112300312592002801435650001501463650002701478650001801505650001901523650001401542650002201556650001201578650002001590653003301610653002601643653001601669653001601685653001801701653002201719653002001741700001801761773013001779856008501909852000901994655001202003IND60530902320221118044507.0160723e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053090232DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b011232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Feng10aSelf-assembling of TEMPO Oxidized Cellulose Nanofibrils As Affected by Protonation of Surface Carboxyls and Drying Methods  ap. 1041-1049.  aSelf-assembling of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) as affected by varying extent of protonation on C6 surface carboxyls was investigated under freeze-drying and air-drying processes. Surface carboxyls were protonated from 10.3 to 100%, all on the same TEMPO oxidized and mechanically blended CNFs with identical geometries and level of oxidation. Upon freeze-drying, all CNFs assembled into amphiphilic mass. The mostly charged CNFs assembled into the finest and most uniform fibers (ϕ = 137 nm) that absorbed significantly more nonpolar toluene than water; whereas the fully protonated CNFs assembled extensively into porous and more thermally stable ultrathin filmlike structures that absorbed water and toluene similarly. Ultrafiltration and air-drying induced cyrstallization led to more thermally stable, semitransparent, and hydrophilic films that showed no affinity toward nonpolar toluene. In essence, CNFs could be tuned by varying the degree of surface carboxyl protonation, along with drying processes, to create fibrous to film morphologies, amphiphic to hydrophilic properties, and higher thermal stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3acellulose microfibrils 3afreeze drying 3ahydrophilicity 3aoxidation 3athermal stability 3atoluene 3aultrafiltration 0aSurface carboxyl protonation 0aCellulose nanofibrils 0aAmphiphilic 0aHydrophobic 0aSelf-assembly 0aThermal stability 0aTEMPO oxidation1 aHsieh, You-Lo0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Mar. 07, v. 4, no. 3 p.1041-1049dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b011233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011700174300001800291520171500309592002802024650002202052650003702074650002102111650001502132650001502147650001202162650001302174650000902187650002002196650001302216650001102229650001402240650002302254650002402277650001402301650001802315650002102333650001502354650001702369650001602386650003302402650002302435650001302458650003702471650001102508653001802519653003002537653001502567653001802582653001302600700002002613700002002633700002002653700002702673700002002700700002202720773013002742856008502872852000902957655001202966IND60530902420171220000000.0160723e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053090242DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b011412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCazetta, André
L.10aMagnetic Activated Carbon Derived from Biomass Waste by Concurrent Synthesis: Efficient Adsorbent for Toxic Dyes  ap. 1058-1068.  aThe development of advanced carbon nanomaterials that can efficiently extract pollutants from solutions is of great interest for environmental remediation and human safety. Herein we report the synthesis of magnetic activated carbons via simultaneous activation and magnetization processes using carbonized biomass waste from coconut shells (Cb’s) and FeCl₃·6H₂O as precursor. We also show the ability of the materials to efficiently extract toxic organic dyes from solutions and their ease of separation and recovery from the solutions using a simple bar magnet. Textural characterization shows that the materials are microporous. Further analyses of the deconvoluted XPS spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that the materials possess magnetite, maghemite and hematite. SEM and TEM images show that an increase in the ratio of FeCl₃·6H₂O:Cb leads to an increase in the material’s magnetic properties. The point of zero charge (pHₚzc) indicates that the materials have acidic characteristics. Adsorption kinetic studies carried out onto MAC1 indicates that the Elovich model can satisfactorily describe the experimental data at low initial concentrations and the pseudo-second order model can best fit the data at higher initial concentrations. Moreover, adsorption equilibrium studies reveal that the Langmuir model adequately allows the determination of the materials’ adsorption capacity. Our adsorption and equilibrium fit of the data include nonlinear models and are thus more informative compared with those in other recent, related works, in which only linear fits have been presented. Extensive mechanistic studies for the adsorption processes are also included in the work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3acoconuts 3adyes 3aferric chloride 3ahematite 3ahumans 3amaghemite 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetite 3ananomaterials 3anonlinear models 3apollutants 3aporous media 3aremediation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastes 0aCoconut shell 0aMagnetic activated carbon 0aAdsorption 0aSunset Yellow 0aFood dye1 aPezoti, Osvaldo1 aBedin, Karen C.1 aSilva, Taís L.1 aPaesano Junior, Andrea1 aAsefa, Tewodros1 aAlmeida, Vitor C.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Mar. 07, v. 4, no. 3 p.1058-1068dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b011413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245014900164500001900313520142300332592002801755650000801783650001501791650001701806650001001823650001201833650001801845650001301863650002001876650001201896650002901908700002601937700002401963700002201987700002502009700002302034700002402057700002202081700002002103700002402123773011802147856007702265852000902342655001202351IND60738772120221117212442.0210524e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073877212DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120507792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisachov, Artem 10aAmplified Fragments of an Autosome-Borne Gene Constitute a Significant Component of the W Sex Chromosome of Eremias velox (Reptilia, Lacertidae)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHeteromorphic W and Y sex chromosomes often experience gene loss and heterochromatinization, which is frequently viewed as their “degeneration”. However, the evolutionary trajectories of the heterochromosomes are in fact more complex since they may not only lose but also acquire new sequences. Previously, we found that the heterochromatic W chromosome of a lizard Eremias velox (Lacertidae) is decondensed and thus transcriptionally active during the lampbrush stage. To determine possible sources of this transcription, we sequenced DNA from a microdissected W chromosome sample and a total female DNA sample and analyzed the results of reference-based and de novo assembly. We found a new repetitive sequence, consisting of fragments of an autosomal protein-coding gene ATF7IP2, several SINE elements, and sequences of unknown origin. This repetitive element is distributed across the whole length of the W chromosome, except the centromeric region. Since it retained only 3 out of 10 original ATF7IP2 exons, it remains unclear whether it is able to produce a protein product. Subsequent studies are required to test the presence of this element in other species of Lacertidae and possible functionality. Our results provide further evidence for the view of W and Y chromosomes as not just “degraded” copies of Z and X chromosomes but independent genomic segments in which novel genetic elements may arise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aLacertidae 3aW chromosome 3aexons 3afemales 3agene deletion 3agenomics 3aheterochromatin 3alizards 3atranscription (genetics)1 aAndreyushkova, Daria 1 aDavletshina, Guzel 1 aProkopov, Dmitry 1 aRomanenko, Svetlana 1 aGalkina, Svetlana 1 aSaifitdinova, Alsu 1 aSimonov, Evgeniy 1 aBorodin, Pavel 1 aTrifonov, Vladimir 0 tGenes.g2021 May 20, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120507793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009900169520180500268592002802073650001902101650003602120650002202156650002802178650002602206650000902232650001302241650002302254650002702277651001402304653003502318653002602353653002902379653002202408653002902430700001802459700001802477700001802495773012402513856008802637852000902725655001202734IND60673100620221119130314.0200517e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067310062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.1050272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPryor, S.H.10aPartial protection disallowing trawling has conservation benefits in a subtropical marine park  aMultiple-use Marine Protected Areas are typically predominantly zoned for partial protection, allowing ‘acceptable’ exploitation activities. However, biotic responses to Partially Protected Areas (PPAs) are varied, and the effectiveness of this approach in relation to management objectives can be ambiguous. Few studies have compared different levels of partial protection to provide insight into this issue. Using remote underwater video methods (stereo baited video, drop-camera) we compared fish and invertebrate assemblages between two PPA types with differing levels of protection (Habitat Protection - HP; and General Use - GU) on unconsolidated substrata in the subtropical Solitary Islands Marine Park, Australia. While both Management Types are fished, trawling is only allowed in GU. Despite high levels of spatial variation across the scales of investigation, we found fish and invertebrate assemblages differed significantly between the two Management Types. The abundance of two fish taxa and low-mobility and sessile benthic macro-invertebrates, and the mean size of the commercially targeted bluespotted flathead Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus, were each significantly greater in the un-trawled HP. Contrary to expectations, abundance of a conspicuous habitat former (pennatulacean seapens) and elasmobranchs did not differ significantly between Management Types. While unconsolidated sedimentary habitats are more homogenous than reef, our study revealed high assemblage diversity at a range of scales. Although assemblages and some individual taxa benefitted from a higher level of partial protection, the broader merit of this management approach remains unclear. Globally, PPA benefits likely depend on social, regulatory, environmental, and site-specific ecological factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElasmobranchii 3aPlatycephalus caeruleopunctatus 3abenthic organisms 3acoastal zone management 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3amarine protected areas 3aAustralia 0aBaited remote underwater video 0aMarine protected area 0aPartially protected area 0aDemersal trawling 0aUnconsolidated substrata1 aSchultz, A.L.1 aMalcolm, H.A.1 aSmith, S.D.A.0 tOcean & coastal management.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 183 p.105027-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.1050273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245016500174300001800339520062800357592002800985650002301013650001401036650001401050650002701064650001801091650001101109650001201120653003101132653002301163653002001186653002901206700002301235700002901258700001901287700003101306700002101337773013001358856008501488852000901573655001201582IND60530902520171220000000.0160723e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053090252DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b011472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerde-Sesto, Ester10aPostfunctionalized Porous Polymeric Aromatic Frameworks with an Organocatalyst and a Transition Metal Catalyst for Tandem Condensation–Hydrogenation Reactions  ap. 1078-1084.  aNovel heterogenized bifunctional catalysts were prepared combining a rhodium complex with a pyrrolidine on porous polymeric aromatic frameworks (PAFs) based on tetraphenyladamantane and tetraphenylmethane subunits.

The obtained bifunctional PAFs exhibit high activity and excellent stability in the cascade reactions and can be recycled up to ten times in a productive process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aaldehydes 3acatalysts 3acondensation reactions 3ahydrogenation 3aolefin 3arhodium 0aPorous aromatic frameworks 0aBifunctional solid 0aOrganocatalysis 0aOne-pot tandem reactions1 aMerino, Estíbaliz1 aRangel-Rangel, Elizabeth1 aCorma, Avelino1 aIglesias Meléndez, Marta,1 aSánchez, Félix0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Mar. 07, v. 4, no. 3 p.1078-1084dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b011473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02034naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010100169300002000270520108800290592002801378650002601406650001401432650001801446650002401464700001801488700002301506773012401529856008201653852000901735655001201744IND60560689520170927000000.0170105e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056068952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b051872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Gregorio,10aInteraction Mechanism Insights on the Solvation of Fullerene B80with Choline-based Ionic Liquids  ap. 12455-12463.  aBeyond carbon allotropes, other nanostructures such as fullerene B₈₀ are attracting a growing interest due to their potential applications. The use of new materials based on fullerene B₈₀ is still in a premature stage; however many of these applications would require the use of B₈₀ in solution. This paper reports an unprecedented density functional theory (DFT) analysis on the interaction mechanism between B₈₀ and two choline-based ionic liquids as a first insight for the fullerene B₈₀ solvation by ionic liquids. The analysis of properties such as binding energies, charge distributions or intermolecular interactions shed light on the main features, which should govern interaction between ionic liquids and fullerene B₈₀. In addition, the optimization of systems composed by six ionic pairs around a fullerene B₈₀ has supplied some information about the first solvation shell at the molecular level. As a summary, this paper provides the first insights in the rational design of ionic liquids with suitable properties for the solvation of B₈₀.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical interactions 3afullerene 3aionic liquids 3asystem optimization1 aAtilhan, Mert1 aAparicio, Santiago0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Sept. 24, v. 119, no. 38 p.12455-12463dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b051873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010800172300001600280520111400296592002801410650002701438650001901465650002001484650002301504650002201527650001801549650001901567650001501586650002001601650001601621653003101637653003101668653002901699653002701728653002801755700002101783700002101804700002201825700001701847773010701864856008701971852000902058655001202067IND60611608620221119002430.0190801e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061160862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.05.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLippert, Thomas10aEnergy-positive sewage sludge pre-treatment with a novel ultrasonic flatbed reactor at low energy input  ap. 298-305.  aThe performance of a novel ultrasonic flatbed reactor for sewage sludge pre-treatment was assessed for three different waste activated sludges. The study systematically investigated the impact of specific energy input (200 – 3,000 kJ/kgTS) on the degree of disintegration (DDCOD, i.e. ratio between ultrasonically and maximum chemically solubilized COD) and methane production enhancement. Relationship between DDCOD and energy input was linear, for all sludges tested. Methane yields were significantly increased for both low (200 kJ/kgTS) and high (2,000 – 3,000 kJ/kgTS) energy inputs, while intermediate inputs (400 – 1,000 kJ/kgTS) showed no significant improvement. High inputs additionally accelerated reaction kinetics, but were limited to similar gains as low inputs (max. 12%), despite the considerably higher DDCOD values. Energy balance was only positive for 200 kJ/kgTS-treatments, with a maximum energy recovery of 122%. Results suggest that floc deagglomeration rather than cell lysis (DDCOD=1% – 5% at 200 kJ/kgTS) is the key principle of energy-positive sludge sonication.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenergy balance 3aenergy recovery 3amethane production 3areaction kinetics 3asewage sludge 3asolubilization 3asonication 3aspecific energy 3aultrasonics 0aUltrasonic flatbed reactor 0aLow energy input treatment 0aDegree of disintegration 0aSpecific methane yield 0aEnergy self-sufficiency1 aBandelin, Jochen1 aMusch, Alexandra1 aDrewes, Jörg E.,1 aKoch, Konrad0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Sept., v. 264 p.298-305dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.05.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006700147245017700214506011700391506007600508520115000584592002801734506003701762650001501799650002601814650001901840650001801859650002301877650002201900651001401922653001801936653001801954653002301972653001501995653001702010653001202027700001802039700003002057700002802087700002702115773010902142856008202251852000902333655001202342IND60792165320221207090956.0220929e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079216532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vas.2022.1002682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantini, María Soledad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0797-702010aAbundance of Lutzomyia longipalpis and Nyssomyia whitmani, the Leishmania spp. vectors in northeastern of Argentina: Are spatial and temporal changing patterns consistence?  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLutzomyia longipalpis and Nyssomyia whitmani were incriminated as vectors of Leishmania sp.

The aim of this work was to compare the spatial and seasonal abundance of Lu. longipalpis and Ny. whitmani at a city spatial scale between two periods separated by three years. To study the spatial distribution, we compared the abundance distribution of these species at two warm times, 2011 with 2014. Respect to inter-annual seasonal abundance changes, we compared the four seasons of the year between two periods (2011–2012 vs 2014–2016). The spatial distribution for both species were found to be distributed mainly in the same areas of the city in both periods. We change for: Respect to the seasonal pattern of abundance, we observed that seasonal patterns showed changes between periods.

In this study, we describe the development of a new library of mini‐Tn7‐lux and lux::eyfp reporter constructs that provide a wide range of lux expression levels, and which combine the advantages of both bacterial bioluminescence and fluorescent proteins to bridge the gap between macro‐ and micro‐scale imaging techniques. We demonstrate that a dual bioluminescence‐fluorescence approach using the lux operon and eYFP can be used to monitor bacterial movement in plants both macro‐ and microscopically and demonstrate that Pseudomonas syringae pv phaseolicola can colonize the leaf vascular system and systemically infect leaves of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). We also show that bacterial bioluminescence can be used to study the impact of plant immune responses on bacterial multiplication, viability and spread within plant tissues. The constructs and approach described in this study can be used to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of bacterial colonization and to link population dynamics and cellular interactions in a wide range of biological contexts.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/M011224/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/R009236/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  cErmenegildo Zegna founder's scholarship  cMPLS DTC (Doctoral Training Centre, University of Oxford) 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 3abacterial colonization 3abeans 3abioluminescence 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3aleaves 3aoperon 3apopulation dynamics 3aviability1 aSanguankiattichai, Nattapong1 aBach‐Pages, Marcel1 aBervoets, Indra1 aHuang, Wei E.1 aPreston, Gail M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3882-44380 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.2070-2085dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.152963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002400187245012800211300002000339506007600359520102300435592002801458506003701486650000901523650001401532650002301546650004401569650001401613650001801627650001301645700002201658700002401680773012401704856008201828852000901910655001201919IND60560689620221207105009.0170106e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056068962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b051902doi7 aPMC46347162pmcid7 a263289242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergonzo, Christina10aStem-Loop V of Varkud Satellite RNA Exhibits Characteristics of the Mg2+ Bound Structure in the Presence of Monovalent Ions  ap. 12355-12364.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Varkud Satellite RNA contains a self-cleaving ribozyme that has been shown to function independently of its surroundings. This 160 nucleotide ribozyme adopts a catalytically active tertiary structure that includes a kissing hairpin complex formed by stem-loop I and stem-loop V (SLV). The five-nucleotide 5′-rUGACU loop of the isolated SLV has been shown to adopt a Mg²⁺-dependent U-turn structure by solution NMR. This U-turn hairpin is examined here by molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of monovalent and divalent ions. Simulations confirm on an all-atom level the hypotheses for the role of the Mg²⁺ ions in stabilizing the loop, as well as the role of the solvent exposed U₇₀₀ base. Additionally, these simulations suggest the Mg²⁺-free stem-loop adopts a wide range of structures, including energetically favorable structures similar to the Mg²⁺-bound loop structure. We propose this structure is a “gatekeeper” or precursor to Mg²⁺ binding when those ions are present.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aions 3amagnesium 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aribozymes 3asatellite RNA 3asolvents1 aHall, Kathleen

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) (detection limit of 8.87 μM and liner range of 0–4 mM) and amperometry (detection limit of 0.82 μM and liner range of 0–5 mM) protocols were studied for UA detection, respectively.

The microbiome of mulberry trees planted for ecological restoration in the hydro‐fluctuation belt of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China, exhibited distinct patterns of localization. The endosphere exhibited lower α‐diversity relative to the rhizosphere, but was more closely related to host growth status, especially in stem tissues. Pantoea was the predominant bacterial genus inhabiting the stems of two well‐growing plants, while sequences identified as Pseudomonas and Pantoea were abundant in poorly growing plants. The complexity of the endophytic community was more connected to growth status in well‐growing plants than it was in poorly growing plants. Among 151 endophytes cultured from collected samples of mulberry, 64 exhibited plant growth‐promoting (PGP) potential in vitro and the majority of beneficial taxa were harvested from well‐growing plants. Collectively, the present study indicates that the recruitment of beneficial endophytes may contribute to mulberry fitness under abiotic stress, and it provides a foundation for the development of a new strategy in vegetation restoration.  aPublisher supplied data  a31870518cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  acstc2015jcyjys80001cNatural Science Foundation of Chongqing  acstc2019jcyj‐msxmX0396cNatural Science Foundation of Chongqing  aXDJK2019B047cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aMorus (Moraceae) 3aPantoea 3aPseudomonas 3aabiotic stress 3abacterial communities 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aendophytes 3amicrobiome 3amulberries 3arhizosphere 3astress tolerance 3atree growth 3aChina1 aXu, Weifang1 aZhang, Meng1 aQiu, Changyu1 aLiu, Jia1 aWisniewski, Michael1 aOu, Ting1 aZhou, Zeyang1 aXiang, Zhonghuai0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.1858-1875dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.152303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010400170300001600274520119800290592002801488650001201516650001201528650001101540650002101551650001301572650002201585650002701607650001501634650001501649650002601664650002801690651001001718653001101728653002801739653002401767653001001791700001601801700001901817700001301836773012001849856008801969852000902057655001202066IND60645569520221120064208.0190913e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064556952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Shaohua10aIndium in mainland China: Insights into use, trade, and efficiency from the substance flow analysis  ap. 312-321.  aBased on the general framework of substance flow analysis, this paper quantifies the social economic metabolism of indium in China. The results show that in recent years, the output of indium primary products in China accounts for more than 50% of the worldwide production, but the domestic consumption is less than 20%. For the lack of key technologies for processing into indium tin oxide (ITO), more than 98% of the high quality ITO targets depend on imports. As the indium industry has been affected by policy, great changes have occurred in China's indium import/export trade, which has mainly focused on a few countries. There is a significant excess in indium primary products, which are mainly absorbed by national purchasing and the Pan Asian Nonferrous Metals Exchange. In the short-term this protects the development of China's primary indium industry, but in the long-term the development of indium still needs to rely on downstream industries. The quantitative analysis of indium flow can provide a quantitative scientific basis for adjusting the indium industrial structure, improving the indium industrial policy and realizing the sustainable development of the indium industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexports 3aimports 3aindium 3aindium tin oxide 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3amaterial flow analysis 3ametabolism 3apurchasing 3aquantitative analysis 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aIndium 0aSubstance flow analysis 0aImport/export trade 0aChina1 aMao, Jiansu1 aChen, Weiqiang1 aShi, Lei0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Oct., v. 149 p.312-321dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01733naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245008500161300001800246500001400264520047300278592002800751650001800779650001700797650001300814650000900827650001300836650001900849650001200868650002200880650001300902650002400915650001600939650002200955653001600977653001800993700001401011700001701025773018501042856007501227852000901302655001201311IND60691817620221119220832.0200502e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069181762DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.63.22082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGEKKO, Kunihiko10aCompeting Effect of Polyols on the Thermal Stability and Gelation of Soy Protein  ap. 2208-2211.  aNAL-light  aThe thermal denaturation temperature of a soy protein isolate was increased, but its gel-melting temperature was decreased by the addition of polyols with increasing concentration and number of hydroxyl groups of the polyols.

We provide a first contribution to assess food waste in an AFN in terms of 1) food waste levels, 2) food waste causes, and 3) food waste management practices (i.e. food waste reduction and handling). We use an exploratory case-study to investigate food waste in a Polish AFN. We place the results of this case-study in the context of conventional retail, by reviewing retail food waste literature. Quantitative results show that food waste levels at the AFN are very low compared to conventional retail literature. Qualitative results show that food waste causes at the AFN are partly shared with conventional retail, and partly specific to the AFN. Possible explanations for low food waste are provided by the food waste management strategies, in which food waste prevention is a key component of the AFN practices.Two other possible explanations are the degree of flexibility and the main drivers of the organization. Conventional retail is ruled by top-down policies, focusing on profit-maximization. The AFN we studied is small-scale, independently organized, and non-profit. Its main driver is to balance financial viability, accessibility and ethical guidelines. Looking beyond profit allows for a high concern with food waste, while the autonomy of the organization gives its members flexibility to develop ways to prevent and handle food waste. Future research can build on our approach of combining food waste estimations with qualitative investigation of food waste causes and management practices. Food waste dynamics should be further investigated in other (retail) AFNs, in small-scale conventional and organic food retail, and in small and large-scale cooperative supermarkets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeconomic sustainability 3aethics 3afood retailing 3afood waste 3aissues and policy 3aorganic foods 3aprofit maximization 3asupermarkets 3awaste reduction 0aFood waste 0aAlternative food networks 0aFood waste management 0aFood waste prevention 0aRetail1 aRok, Jakub1 aHarmsen, Robert1 aRosales Carreón, Jesús1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3825-09561 aWorrell, Ernst1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0199-97550 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Oct., v. 149 p.210-219dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04757naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245010100186300001600287520233100303592002802634650001202662650001402674650001902688650002302707650001202730650001202742650001202754650000802766650002202774650002302796650002602819650001202845650002002857650001902877650001702896650001602913650002102929650001002950650001102960650000902971650002202980650002203002650003903024650005503063650002603118650004203144650002303186650001103209650002203220650001103242650001803253650001103271650000903282650005003291650003903341650001503380650002603395650002403421650002003445650003203465650001703497650001603514650002503530700002403555700001403579700002303593700001603616700002503632700001703657700002303674700001703697773011103714856008103825852000903906655001203915IND60119315420221120103718.0150112e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011931542DNAL7 a253899622pmid7 a10.1007/s12603-014-0488-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRouch, Isabelle10aSeven-year predictors of self-rated health and life satisfaction in the elderly: The proof study  ap. 840-847.  aOBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between cognitive performance, affective state, metabolic syndrome and 7-year follow-up self-rated health (SRH) and perceived life satisfaction (PLS). DESIGN: Analysis of a prospective cohort study. SETTING: The PROOF study, including 1011 elderly community residents. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred and fifty seven subjects completed metabolic syndrome (Met S) variables, neuropsychological and affective measurements at baseline, and then returned a 7-year follow-up questionnaire which included SRH and PLS. MEASUREMENTS: The prospective association between cognitive function, Met S and each of its components, and affective disorders and subsequent subjective health and quality of life was examined. Covariates included educational level and use of tobacco. The analyses were made in men and women separately. RESULTS: In multivariate models, the presence of Met S was significantly associated to weaker SRH (OR = 2.78, p = 0.009 in men and OR = 2.0, p = 0.02 in women). Higher triglycerides rate were associated with weaker SRH in men (OR = 2.23, p = 0.002) and higher fasting glucose in women (OR = 2.54, p = 0.006). Global Met S and abdominal obesity was significantly associated to weaker PLS in women only (respectively OR = 2.70, p = 0.0002 and OR = 1.9, p = 0.02). Depressive symptoms were significantly associated to both weaker SRH and PLS in men (OR = 1.30, p = 0.002; OR = 1.44, p < 0.0001 for SRH and PLS respectively) and in woman (OR = 1.09, p = 0.04; OR = 1.26, p < 0.0001 for SRH and PLS respectively). Anxiety was linked to both weaker SRH and PLS in women (OR = 1.17, p = 0.002 and OR = 1.11, p = 0.03 for SRH and PLS respectively). Finally, lower executive function was associated with weaker PLS in men (OR = 0.43, p = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: metabolic syndrome and certain of its components, anxiety and depressive symptoms, are independent predictors of poorer subjective health and quality of life as assessed over a period of 7 years in a population of a non-demented aging community. Moreover, executive performance was linked to subsequent quality of life in men. Many of these factors being treatable, our findings point to the necessity of providing preventive care strategies by the management of cardiovascular risk factors and anxio-depressive symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3acognition 3acohort studies 3aeducational status 3aelderly 3afasting 3aglucose 3amen 3amental depression 3ametabolic syndrome 3amultivariate analysis 3aobesity 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3arisk factors 3atobacco use 3atriacylglycerols 3awomen 2aAffect 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAgingxpsychology 2aAnxietyxepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aCognitionxphysiology 2aDepressionxepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aExecutive Function 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHealth 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aObesityxepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aOdds Ratio 2aPersonal Satisfaction 2aProspective Studies 2aQuality of Life 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSelf Report 2aTriglyceridesxblood1 aAchour-Crawford, E.1 aRoche, F.1 aCastro-Lionard, C.1 aLaurent, B.1 aNtougou Assoumou, G.1 aGonthier, R.1 aBarthelemy, J. -C.1 aTrombert, B.0 tjournal of nutrition, health & aging.g2014 Nov., v. 18, no. 9 p.840-847dSpringer-Verlagx1279-77077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-014-0488-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002400191245011600215300001600331506007600347520161200423592002802035506003702063650002002100650001302120650001702133650001302150650001202163650001502175650001602190650002402206650001102230650001002241650003802251650002102289650005402310650002402364650002402388650001102412650005102423650001102474650000902485650002302494650001902517650001402536650005202550650002202602700002402624700002302648700002302671700002102694700002502715700002102740700002002761700002402781700002202805700002602827773009202853856008402945852000903029655001203038IND50070178120221207082558.0141112e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007017812DNAL7 a241762292pmid7 aPMC38156982pmcid7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2013.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWozniak, Jeffrey R.10aCholine supplementation in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders has high feasibility and tolerability  ap. 897-904.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere are no biological treatments for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), lifelong conditions associated with physical anomalies, brain damage, and neurocognitive abnormalities. In preclinical studies, choline partially ameliorates memory and learning deficits from prenatal alcohol exposure. This phase I pilot study evaluated the feasibility, tolerability, and potential adverse effects of choline supplementation in children with FASD. We hypothesized that choline would be well tolerated with minimal adverse events. The study design was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Participants included 20 children aged 2.5 to 4.9 years with prenatal alcohol exposure and FASD diagnoses. Participants were randomly assigned to 500 mg choline or placebo daily for 9 months (10 active, 10 placebo). Primary outcome measures included feasibility, tolerability, adverse effects, and serum choline levels. Seventeen participants completed the study. Compliance was 82% to 87%, as evidenced by parent-completed log sheets and dose counts. Periodic 24-hour dietary recalls showed no evidence of dietary confounding. Adverse events were minimal and were equivalent in the active and placebo arms with the exception of fishy body odor, which occurred only in the active group. There were no serious adverse events to research participants. This phase I pilot study demonstrates that choline supplementation at 500 mg/d for 9 months in children aged 2 to 5 years is feasible and has high tolerability. Further examination of the efficacy of choline supplementation in FASD is currently underway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aalcohols 3abrain damage 3achildren 3acholine 3acompliance 3adiet recall 3aexperimental design 3amemory 3aodors 2aAlcohol Drinkingxadverse effects 2aChild, Preschool 2aCholinexadverse effectsxbloodxtherapeutic use. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disordersxdrug therapy 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPatient Compliance 2aPilot Projects 2aPregnancy 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effectsxdrug therapy 2aTreatment Outcome1 aFuglestad, Anita J.1 aEckerle, Judith K.1 aKroupina, Maria G.1 aMiller, Neely C.1 aBoys, Christopher J.1 aBrearley, Ann M.1 aFink, Birgit A.1 aHoecker, Heather L.1 aZeisel, Steven H.1 aGeorgieff, Michael K.0 tNutrition research.g2013 Nov., v. 33, no. 11 p.897-904dElsevier Inc.x0271-53177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2013.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003700113040001800150100001800168245008200186300001800268500000900286520140400295592002801699650002201727650001001749650001301759650001501772650002201787650002701809650001801836650002301854650002301877650002301900650001001923650002301933650001501956650001401971650001401985650002401999650002402023650002802047650002102075650002602096650001802122650002002140700001602160700002302176700001602199700001802215700001302233700002002246700001902266700002102285773012302306852000902429856011202438856008402550961001302634655001202647IND4448424620221118032208.0191228e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444842462DNAL7 a10113/487312hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2010.04.02022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wenjun10aGenetic Maps of Stem Rust Resistance Gene Sr35 in Diploid and Hexaploid Wheat  ap. 2464-2474.  aepub  aPuccinia graminis f. sp. tritici is the causal agent of stem rust of wheat. A new race designated TTKSK (also known as Ug99) and its variants (TTKST and TTTSK) are virulent to most of the stem rust resistance genes currently deployed in wheat cultivars worldwide. Therefore, identification, mapping, and deployment of effective resistance genes are critical components of global efforts to mitigate this threat. Multipathotype seedling tests demonstrated that resistance gene Sr35 is effective against the three TTKS variants and another broadly virulent race from Yemen, TRTTF. Two genetic maps of Sr35 are presented in diploid (Triticum monococcum) and two in hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum). The Sr35 resistance to TRTTF and RKQQC races was mapped in diploid wheat within a 2.2 to 3.1 cM interval on the long arm of chromosome 3Aᵐ between markers XBF483299 and XCJ656351 This interval corresponds to a 174-kb region in Brachypodium that includes 16 annotated genes. The Sr35 map location was confirmed in two backcross-derived hexaploid populations segregating for Sr35 Recombination between diploid and hexaploid chromosomes was 10-fold lower than between homologous chromosomes, but was sufficient to reduce the introgressed diploid segment. These maps provide markers closely linked to Sr35 that will be useful to accelerate its deployment and pyramiding with other stem rust resistance genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3adiploidy 3ahexaploidy 3aPuccinia graminis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arust diseases 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3astrain differences 3apathotypes 3avirulence 3aseedlings 3agermplasm screening 3aTriticum monococcum 3aplant genetic resources 3agene segregation 3agenetic recombination 3aintrogression 3agenetic markers1 aOlson, Eric1 aSaintenac, Cyrille1 aRouse, Matt1 aAbate, Zewdie1 aJin, Yue1 aAkhunov, Eduard1 aPumphrey, Mike1 aDubcovsky, Jorge0 tCrop science.g2010 Nov., v. 50, no. 6 p.2464-2474dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/487313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2010.04.02023Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03753naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002900188245008900217300001800306506007600324520177500400592002802175506003702203650001002240650001502250650002502265650001702290650001202307650001702319650001902336650001302355650001002368650001702378650002402395650001702419650001802436650001702454650001302471650001902484650001602503650001102519650001202530650001602542650002202558650002102580650001102601650001202612650002002624650001702644650001202661650001002673650002302683650001602706700003202722700003002754700003002784700002702814700002102841773011502862856008102977852000903058655001203067IND60440701520221207081408.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044070152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-014-1665-32doi7 aPMC45546302pmcid7 a263449732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Gallardo, Alfonso10aEffect of starch-beeswax coatings on quality parameters of blackberries (Rubus spp.)  ap. 5601-5610.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is increased interest in berry fruits due to health benefits, and maintenance of fruit quality for longer periods of time has been a priority. We previously found that starch based coatings applied on raspberries was associated to volatile compounds production due to anoxic conditions. The objective of this work was to design more hydrophobic coatings with reduced thickness. A starch-beeswax dispersion containing 2 % (w/v) modified tapioca starch added with either 0.5 or 1.0 % (w/v) beeswax microparticles was produced, and used for spray coating freshly harvested blackberries (Rubus spp.). Coatings were air dried, packed in plastic trays and stored up to 16 days at 4 °C and 88 % relative humidity. Storage quality parameters such as hardness, respiration rate, anthocyanins content, total phenols, color changes and weight loss were evaluated. We did not find Interactions among coating ingredients, and incorporation of beeswax reduced moisture transfer rate. Coatings did not occlude the stomata and apparently did not over-hydrate the cuticle. This characteristic allowed appropriate gas exchange (O₂ and CO₂), and reduced accumulation of volatile compounds associated to fermentative metabolism. Respiration rates were 4.207 ± 0.157, 4.557 ± 0.220 and 4.780 ± 0.050 mmol CO₂ kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ for control, 0.5 and 1 % of wax content in coatings, respectively. However, ethylene production increased throughout storage time along with beeswax concentration, indicating stressful conditions for the fruit. This trend appears to be related with changes in total phenols and anthocyanins during storage. Edible coatings based on starch and hydrophobic particles should be reformulated to maintain quality of stored berry fruits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRubus 3aair drying 3aanaerobic conditions 3aanthocyanins 3abeeswax 3ablackberries 3acarbon dioxide 3acoatings 3acolor 3aedible films 3aethylene production 3afermentation 3afruit quality 3agas exchange 3ahardness 3ahydrophobicity 3aingredients 3aoxygen 3aphenols 3araspberries 3arelative humidity 3arespiratory rate 3astarch 3astomata 3astorage quality 3astorage time 3atapioca 3atrays 3avolatile compounds 3aweight loss1 aGarcía-Almendárez, Blanca1 aBarbosa-Cánovas, Gustavo1 aPimentel-González, Diana1 aReyes-González, L.

Bacterial strains were identified exhibit certain growth promoting characteristics and were tolerant to site relevant levels of petroleum hydrocarbons, salinity and pH. Five best performing strains including Pseudomonas sp. strain PFS1 and BSS3B2, Serratia proteamaculans strain S1BD1, Alcaligenes sp. strain PKS1 and Bacillus sp. strain PSS2 were selected to establish a plant growth promoting bacterial consortium named PGPBc, which was then tested to determine its effectiveness in facilitating saltgrass seed germination and growth both in vitro and in contaminated soil. The results showed that PGPBc inoculation had no significant effect on the germination of saltgrass seeds, but had significantly positive effect on plant biomass production in contaminated soil covered with a surface layer of potting soil. PGPBc inoculation increased plant biomass in sterilized soil by 4-fold and in unsterilized soil by 6.6-fold. In this study, we reported the phosphate solubilization ability of Serratia proteamaculans, and demonstrated the use of PGPBc for promoting saltgrass growth in hydrocarbon contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenes 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aPseudomonas 3aSerratia proteamaculans 3abiomass production 3ahydrocarbons 3apH 3apetroleum 3aphosphates 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3apolluted soils 3apotting mix 3asalinity 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asoil sterilization 3asolid wastes 3asolubilization 3awaste management 0aPlant growth promoting bacteria 0aPhosphate solubilization 0aSaltgrass [Distichlis spicata (L.) greene] 0aPhytoremediation 0aTotal petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) 0aSWMU 0aPGPB 0aIAA 0aACC 0aAlkB 0aTPH 0aPAHs1 aChakraborty, Romy1 aTerry, Norman1 aSingh, Rajendra Prasad1 aFu, Dafang0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2020 Jan., v. 146 p.104808-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2019.1048083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100007200145245013500217300001800352500001900370500002000389520156700409592002801976596005202004596006902056596005002125596004602175596004802221596005002269650002602319650001702345650002402362650001502386650001002401650001602411650001002427700002202437700002102459700002302480700005902503773013102562856007902693852000902772655001202781IND60735460720221121143200.0210426e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073546072DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.152442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrada‐Salcedo, Luis Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8403-709410aLow root functional dispersion enhances functionality of plant growth by influencing bacterial activities in European forest soils  ap. 1889-1906.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCurrent studies show that multispecies forests are beneficial regarding biodiversity and ecosystem functionality. However, there are only little efforts to understand the ecological mechanisms behind these advantages of multispecies forests. Bacteria are among the key plant growth‐promoting microorganisms that support tree growth and fitness. Thus, we investigated links between bacterial communities, their functionality and root trait dispersion within four major European forest types comprising multispecies and monospecific plots. Bacterial diversity revealed no major changes across the root functional dispersion gradient. In contrast, predicted gene profiles linked to plant growth activities suggest an increasing bacterial functionality from monospecific to multispecies forest. In multispecies forest plots, the bacterial functionality linked to plant growth activities declined with the increasing functional dispersion of the roots. Our findings indicate that enriched abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units are decoupled from bacterial functionality. We also found direct effects of tree species identity on bacterial community composition but no significant relations with root functional dispersion. Additionally, bacterial network analyses indicated that multispecies forests have a higher complexity in their bacterial communities, which points towards more stable forest systems with greater functionality. We identified a potential of root dispersion to facilitate bacterial interactions and consequently, plant growth activities.  aPublisher supplied data  cBelgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO, Belgium)  a2015‐2016 BiodivERsA COFUND call for research propcBiodivERsA  cFrench National Research Agency (ANR, France)  cGerman Research Foundation (DFG, Germany)  cResearch Foundation Flanders (FWO, Belgium)  cThe Swedish Research Council (FORMAS, Sweden) 3abacterial communities 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3agenes 3atree growth 3atrees1 aWambsganss, Janna1 aBauhus, Jürgen,1 aBuscot, François,1 aGoldmann, Kezia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2954-55170 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.1889-1906dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.152443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011100167300001800278520144700296592002801743650001701771650001201788650001301800650001201813650001501825650001401840650002301854650001301877650002001890650001401910650001801924650001201942650001601954650002401970650001101994650001302005653001402018653004802032653002002080653001202100653001302112700001402125700001502139700001602154700001202170773013002182856008502312852000902397655001202406IND60530903220221118044452.0160723e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053090322DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b011782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lujiang10aProducing Pyridines via Thermocatalytic Conversion and Ammonization of Waste Polylactic Acid over Zeolites  ap. 1115-1122.  aIn this study, polylactic acid served as raw material to produce fine chemicals (pyridines) via a thermocatalytic conversion and ammonization (TCC-A) process. Ammonia was employed as not only carrier gas but also a reactant in this process. The thermal decomposition behavior of PLA under N₂ or NH₃ atmosphere was investigated. Different catalysts, including MCM-41, β-zeolite, ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 50) and HZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios (Si/Al = 25, 50, 80) were also screened. Reaction temperature and residence time, which may affect the pyridines production, were investigated systematically. It was verified that all the investigated factors, including catalyst structure, catalyst acid amounts, reaction temperature, and residence time, influenced the PLA conversion and the pyridines production. The highest pyridines yield, 24.8%, was achieved by using HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) at around 500 °C. The catalyst regeneration tests were carried out. It demonstrated that the catalyst was stable after five regenerations and the catalytic activity did not change significantly. A possible reaction pathway from PLA to pyridines was also proposed. PLA initially thermally decomposed to form lactic acid and some byproducts such as acetaldehyde, acetone, etc., and then lactic acid, the mixture of acetaldehyde and acetone, or other byproducts reacted with ammonia to form imines and finally underwent complicated reactions to form pyridines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetone 3aaluminum 3aammonia 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3anitrogen 3apolylactic acid 3apyridines 3araw materials 3asilicon 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3awastes 3azeolites 0aPyridines 0aThermocatalytic conversion and ammonization 0aPolylactic acid 0aAmmonia 0aZeolites1 aYao, Qian1 aHan, Zheng1 aZhang, Ying1 aFu, Yao0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Mar. 07, v. 4, no. 3 p.1115-1122dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b011783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245014700160300001800307500001900325500002000344520142400364592002801788596012601816596007101942650002702013650002602040650002102066650002202087650001602109650002102125650001602146650003102162650001002193650002802203650002602231650001102257650001202268650001802280650003002298650001902328650001502347650001602362650001402378700001602392700001602408700001602424700001402440700001702454700005602471700001702527700001702544700001602561700005402577700001702631773013102648856007902779852000902858655001202867IND60735460920221121145249.0210426e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073546092DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.153592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Zixian10aiTRAQ analysis reveals the effect of gabD and sucA gene knockouts on lysine metabolism and crystal protein formation in Bacillus thuringiensis  ap. 2230-2243.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLysine metabolism plays an important role in the formation of the insecticidal crystal proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The genes lam, gabD and sucA encode three key enzymes of the lysine metabolic pathway in Bt4.0718. The lam gene mainly affects the cell growth at stable period, negligibly affected sporulation and insecticidal crystal protein (ICP) production. While, the deletion mutant strains of the gabD and sucA genes showed that the growth, sporulation and crystal protein formation were inhibited, cells became slender, and insecticidal activity was significantly reduced. iTRAQ proteomics and qRT‐PCR used to analyse the differentially expressed protein (DEP) between the two mutant strains and the wild type strain. The functions of DEPs were visualized and statistically classified, which affect bacterial growth and metabolism by regulating biological metabolism pathways: the major carbon metabolism pathways, amino acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation pathways, nucleic acid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis and peptidoglycan synthesis. The gabD and sucA genes in lysine metabolic pathway are closely related to the sporulation and crystal proteins formation. The effects of DEPs and functional genes on basic cellular metabolic pathways were studied to provide new strategies for the construction of highly virulent insecticidal strains, the targeted transformation of functional genes.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational key Research and Development program of China2017YFD0201201 National Natural Science Foundation of China31370116  a2019NK2192cKey Research and Development Program of Hunan Province 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aamino acid metabolism 3abacterial growth 3acarbon metabolism 3acell growth 3acrystal proteins 3afatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticidal proteins 3alysine 3amutants 3anucleic acids 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3apeptidoglycans 3aproteomics 3asporulation 3avirulence1 aZhang, Tong1 aXie, Junyan1 aZhu, Zirong1 aLuo, Sisi1 aZhou, Kexuan1 aZhou, Pengji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9540-83961 aChen, Wenhui1 aZhao, Xiaoli1 aSun, Yunjun1 aXia, Liqiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8443-29161 aDing, Xuezhi0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.2230-2243dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.153593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015100163300001600314520130600330592002801636653002101664653002501685653001601710653001901726653002801745653001801773653001901791653002301810653002401833700002601857700002401883773009401907856008002001852000902081655001202090IND60130683220221117223036.0151127e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013068322DNAL7 a10.1525/auk.2010.100572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeer, Brian D.10aIntraclutch Variation in Egg Appearance Constrains Rejection of Brown-Headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) Eggs in Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula)  ap. 759-764.  aVariation in the appearance of eggs within a clutch has been hypothesized to decrease the likelihood of rejection of brood-parasite eggs, but tests of the hypothesis have produced mixed results among cuckoo (Cuculus canoras and Clamator glandarius) hosts. The hypothesis has not been tested in cowbird hosts because they typically show little intraspecific variation in responses to cowbird eggs. However, the Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) is unusual among potential hosts of the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) because it shows both acceptance and rejection of cowbird eggs and it demonstrates high intraclutch variation in egg appearance, which makes it one of the few potential cowbird hosts suitable for a test of the intraclutch variation——host rejection hypothesis. We tested whether intraclutch variation in the appearance of Common Grackle eggs influenced the likelihood of egg rejection and found that Common Grackles with greater variation in intraclutch egg appearance were more likely to accept cowbird eggs when these were added prior to clutch completion. These results are the first to indicate that even when a host has eggs that are dramatically different from those of a parasite, variation in its own eggs may increase the threshold required to elicit egg rejection.  aPublisher supplied data 0abrood parasitism 0aBrown-headed Cowbird 0acoevolution 0aCommon Grackle 0aegg rejection threshold 0aegg variation 0aMolothrus ater 0aQuiscalus quiscula 0arecognition systems1 aRothstein, Stephen I.1 aMcCleery, Robert A.0 tAuk.g2010 Oct., v. 127, no. 4 p.759-764dUniversity of California Pressx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fauk.2010.100573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005200155245005000207300001400257520146300271592002801734650001901762650001301781650001101794650001601805650002001821650001001841650001301851650001701864650001201881650001301893650002301906650000901929650002001938650001701958650001301975650001301988650001402001650001002015650001802025650001102043653002302054653002802077653001302105653002002118653001002138653002302148700002102171700001302192773010602205856009002311852000902401655001202410IND60645570120221121025530.0200621e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064557012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2019.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOget, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1832-871X10aGenetic and genomic studies in ovine mastitis  ap. 55-64.  aMastitis is a strong financial and animal welfare concern in both dairy and meat-producing sheep. In this review article, we summarized recent advances in research on genomic of mastitis resistance in sheep. Heritability estimates for mastitis-related traits such as somatic cell scores or milk bacteriological counting have confirmed a genetic basis for mastitis resistance. Recent outputs from genomic-based studies comprising genome-wide associations, the identification of one causal mutation as well as gene expression studies have highlighted regions of the genome, and possible genes and mechanisms underlying the resistance trait. Part of genomic regions was common among breeds and populations, and have testified to the partial sharing of mastitis-related genetic mechanisms between different distant dairy sheep populations. Accumulating genetic data, however, have underlined the polygenic nature of the trait and the complexity of the resistance phenotype. Both quantitative and genomic analyses have further revealed trade-offs and synergies under genetic control between mastitis resistance and other efficiency (milk production) and resilience related traits (udder type traits and metabolic disease). We have also reported how phenotypic, pedigree and genomic information has been used in sheep breeding, the aim being to improve the animals’ health and welfare, the hygienic quality of milk products and overall efficiency and resilience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3abreeding 3abreeds 3adairy sheep 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheritability 3ahygiene 3amastitis 3ametabolic diseases 3amilk 3amilk production 3amilk quality 3amutation 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3asheep 3asomatic cells 3audders 0aGenetic resistance 0aIntramammary infections 0aMastitis 0aAnimal genomics 0aSheep 0aGenetic parameters1 aTosser-Klopp, G.1 aRupp, R.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2019 July, v. 176 p.55-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2019.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245014900158300001800307500001900325500002000344520144600364592002801810596005901838596006201897596008701959596009502046650001402141650002202155650002402177650001002201650001402211650001702225650002602242650001902268650001402287650001402301651001002315651001002325700005402335700001502389700001702404700005502421773013102476856007902607852000902686655001202695IND60735461020221122161834.0210426e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073546102DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.153912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Man10aMicrobiota associated with Mollitrichosiphum aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae: Greenideinae): diversity, host species specificity and phylosymbiosis  ap. 2184-2198.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSymbiotic association is universal in nature, and an array of symbionts play a crucial part in host life history. Aphids and their diverse symbionts have become a good model system to study insect‐symbiont interactions. Previous symbiotic diversity surveys have mainly focused on a few aphid clades, and the relative importance of different factors regulating microbial community structure is not well understood. In this study, we collected 65 colonies representing eight species of the aphid genus Mollitrichosiphum from different regions and plants in southern China and Nepal and characterized their microbial compositions using Illumina sequencing of the V3 − V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. We evaluated how microbiota varied across aphid species, geography and host plants and the correlation between microbial community structure and host aphid phylogeny. Heritable symbionts dominated the microbiota associated with Mollitrichosiphum, and multiple infections of secondary symbionts were prevalent. Ordination analyses and statistical tests highlighted the contribution of aphid species in shaping the structures of bacterial, symbiont and secondary symbiont communities. Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between Mollitrichosiphum aphid phylogeny and microbial community composition, providing evidence for a pattern of phylosymbiosis between natural aphid populations and their microbial associates.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772492cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31620103916cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020087cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2019QZKK05010601cSecond Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program 3aAphididae 3aMollitrichosiphum 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3ageography 3alife history 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3aphylogeny 3asymbionts 3aChina 3aNepal1 aChen, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7584-52491 aXu, Shifen1 aJiang, Liyun1 aQiao, Gexia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7300-68120 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.2184-2198dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.153913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01352naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245011200156300001800268520022500286592002800511650002300539650001300562650002100575650001500596650001500611650001100626650001300637700001400650700001800664700001300682700001500695700001600710700001700726700001300743773012900756856007200885852000900957655001200966IND60657312720221116224351.0190816e20021119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065731272DNAL7 a10.1039/b208222e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yahong10aSynthesis of silver nanoparticles via electrochemical reduction on compact zeolite film modified electrodes  ap. 2814-2815.  aMonodisperse silver nanoparticles with different sizes were synthesized by electrochemical reduction inside or outside zeolite crystals according to the silver exchange degree of compact zeolite film modified electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acrystals 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ananosilver 3asilver 3azeolites1 aChen, Fei1 aZhuang, Jihua1 aTang, Yi1 aWang, Deju1 aWang, Yajun1 aDong, Angang1 aRen, Nan0 tChemical communications.g2002 Nov. 19, , no. 23 p.2814-2815dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b208222e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245011000180300001400290520097300304592002801277650002501305650001401330650001701344650003201361650001901393650001201412650001501424650002901439653001201468653002901480653002701509653002501536700002201561700002501583700003201608700002701640773010401667856008701771852000901858655001201867IND60611609320221119002442.0200509e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061160932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.05.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Ruiz, Antonio10aContinuous ethyl oleate synthesis by lipases produced by solid-state fermentation by Rhizopus microsporus  ap. 52-58.  aLipases produced by solid-state fermentation were used directly as biocatalysts for continuous synthesis of ethyl oleate in a continuously stirred tank reactor.

The catalyst maintained 90% conversion for four batch cycles with a 1:2 molar ratio (oleic acid:ethanol). Mechanical agitation at 200 and 300 rpm during 12 h of continuous reaction did not affect the biocatalytic conversion, allowing substrate conversions greater than 90% that were obtained with 50 mM oleic acid at a molar ratio of 1:2 during 14 h reaction. In contrast, substrate conversion was 70% with 100 mM oleic acid at a flow rate of 2 mL/min during 25 h of reaction. These results are promising and offer a technical alternative for the development of accessible biocatalysts that can be used in continuous operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizopus microsporus 3aagitation 3abiocatalysts 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aesterification 3aethanol 3aoleic acid 3asolid state fermentation 0aLipases 0aSolid-state fermentation 0aFatty acid ethyl ester 0aRhizopus microspores1 aTovar-Castro, Luz1 aGarcía, Hugo Sergio1 aSaucedo-Castañeda, Gerardo1 aFavela-Torres, Ernesto0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Oct., v. 265 p.52-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.05.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245009200212300001200304506007600316520105800392592002801450506003701478650001901515650003501534650002501569650001601594650001101610650001901621650001601640650001401656650001301670650002501683700002101708700002101729773011001750856008201860852000901942655001201951IND60119315920221207101539.0210707e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011931592DNAL7 a254715262pmid7 aPMC42671542pmcid7 a10.1186/s12985-014-0214-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahraoui, Elmostafa10aE5564 inhibits immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 induction promoted by HIV-1 Tat protein  ap. 214.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In HIV-1 infected patients, production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), a highly immunosuppressive cytokine, is associated with progression of infection toward AIDS. HIV-1 Tat protein, by interacting with TLR4-MD2 at the membrane level, induces IL-10 production by primary human monocytes and macrophages. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the TLR4 antagonist Eritoran tetrasodium (E5564) on HIV-1 Tat-induced IL-10 production. FINDINGS: Here, we confirm that the recombinant HIV-1 Tat protein and the GST-Tat 1–45 fusion protein efficiently stimulate IL-10 production by primary monocytes and macrophages and that this stimulation is inhibited by blocking anti-TLR4 mAbs. We show that a similar inhibition is observed by preincubating the cells with the TLR4 antagonist E5564. CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling data showing for the first time that the TLR4 antagonist E5564 inhibits the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 production by primary human monocytes and macrophages incubated in the presence of HIV-1 Tat protein.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aantagonists 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-10 3amacrophages 3amonocytes 3apatients 3aprimary productivity1 aBriant, Laurence1 aChazal, Nathalie0 tVirology journal.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.214-214dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-014-0214-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245010700164500001900271520163300290592002801923650004801951650001101999650001002010650003502020650001002055650001702065650001302082650001302095700002002108700002002128700002202148700002202170700002302192700002502215700002202240700002102262773011902283856007702402852000902479655001202488IND60738773220221117212636.0210524e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073877322DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120506122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassadeh, Salam 10aNovel Autosomal Recessive Splice-Altering Variant in PRKD1 Is Associated with Congenital Heart Disease  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCongenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common types of birth defects, and global incidence of CHDs is on the rise. Despite the prevalence of CHDs, the genetic determinants of the defects are still in the process of being identified. Herein, we report a consanguineous Saudi family with three CHD affected daughters. We used whole exome sequencing (WES) to investigate the genetic cause of CHDs in the affected daughters. We found that all affected individuals were homozygous for a novel splice-altering variant (NM_001330069.1: c.265-1G>T) of PRKD1, which encodes a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in the heart. The homozygous variant was found in the affected patients with Pulmonary Stenosis (PS), Truncus Arteriosis (TA), and Atrial Septal Defect (ASD). Based on the family’s pedigree, the variant acts in an autosomal recessive manner, which makes it the second autosomal recessive variant of PRKD1 to be identified with a link to CHDs, while all other previously described variants act dominantly. Interestingly, the father of the affected daughters was also homozygous for the variant, though he was asymptomatic of CHDs himself. Since both of his sisters had CHDs as well, this raises the possibility that the novel PRKD1 variant may undergo autosomal recessive inheritance mode with gender limitation. This finding confirms that CHD can be associated with both dominant and recessive mutations of the PRKD1 gene, and it provides a new insight to genotype–phenotype association between PRKD1 and CHDs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this specific PRKD1 mutation associated with CHDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3agender 3agenes 3agenotype-phenotype correlation 3aheart 3ahomozygosity 3amutation 3apedigree1 aAlbeladi, Maha 1 aAlbesher, Nour 1 aAlhabshan, Fahad 1 aKampe, Kapil  Dev1 aChaikhouni, Farah 1 aKabbani, Mohamed  S.1 aBeetz, Christian 1 aAlaamery, Manal 0 tGenes.g2021 Apr. 21, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120506123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01783naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245006700170300001800237520081500255592002801070650002401098650002201122650002001144650001101164650002301175700002101198700002001219700001801239773012101257856008201378852000901460655001201469IND60565969520221120084719.0170330e20170330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056596952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b008362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaracciolo, Filippo10aDynamic Nuclear Polarization of β-Cyclodextrin Macromolecules  ap. 2584-2593.  a¹H dynamic nuclear polarization and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates have been studied in amorphous complexes of β-cyclodextrins doped with different concentrations of the TEMPO radical. Nuclear polarization increased up to 10% in the optimal case, with a behavior of the buildup rate (1/TPOL) and of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T₁ₙ) consistent with a thermal mixing regime. The temperature dependence of 1/T₁ₙ and its increase with the radical concentration indicate a relaxation process arising from the modulation of the electron–nucleus coupling by the glassy dynamics. The high-temperature relaxation is driven by molecular motions, and 1/T₁ₙ was studied at room temperature in liquid solutions for dilution levels close to the ones typically used for in vivo studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3ain vivo studies 3amixing 3aphysical chemistry1 aCarretta, Pietro1 aFilibian, Marta1 aMelone, Lucio0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Mar. 30, v. 121, no. 12 p.2584-2593dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b008363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014000170500001900310520126000329536007101589592002801660650001601688650001401704650002301718650001801741650002001759650002601779650000901805650001001814650001701824651001001841653000901851653001901860653002401879653002801903653001601931700001901947700002301966700001801989700001902007700002202026700001802048773010902066856008602175852000902261655001202270IND60560780820221120095918.0210408e20151231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056078082DNAL7 a10.1080/23311932.2015.10991752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasool, Nuzhat12aA correlation study of proximate composition, physical and cooking properties of new high yielding and disease resistant rice varieties  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study was aimed to compare proximate composition, physical, and cooking properties of locally cultivated rice varieties of Kashmir division viz.; SR-1, K-448, and K-39. Various physiochemical properties were studied. The relationship between physical, proximate composition, and cooking properties was determined using Pearson’s correlation. Length–breadth (L/B) ratio showed a significant positive correlation with kernel length and negative correlation with thousand kernel weight, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.893 and −0.855, respectively, (p < 0.01). Protein content was found to be negatively correlated with ash (r = −0.489, p > 0.05). Solid loss in gruel was observed to have a negative correlation with L/B ratio (r = −0.432, p > 0.05), water uptake ratio (r = −0.742, p < 0.05), and cooking time (r = −0.678, p < 0.05). The rice cultivars with higher cooking time showed lower gruel solid loss and vice versa. Water uptake was observed to be positively correlated with L/B ratio (r = 0.768, p < 0.05). Among all the cultivars studied, K-448 variety has potential for consumers’ preference and it could be used for breeding programs for the improvement of valuable grain quality traits.  aFunding.

During the study period, mean CO2 fluxes was 488.63 ± 1,036.17 mg CO2 m−2 h−1. The flux rate was high compared to those of lakes in other regions, and represented a “hotspot” of CO2 evasion. Temporal variation of CO2 flux was significant, with the peak value in the beginning and lowest point in the end of warm season. High concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lake water (WDOC) was found to highly correlated to CO2 flux (R = 0.47, P < 0.01, n = 54). Besides, fluorescence index of WDOC showed its terrestrial origin character. In accordance with lakes in northern and boreal regions, terrestrial DOC concentration in water column was the most important regulator of CO2 flux from this lake. We suggest that large area of peatlands in catchments support high concentration of DOC in this lake, and consequently high CO2 evasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adissolved organic carbon 3afluorescence 3alakes 3apeatlands 3aplateaus 3atemporal variation 3awarm season 3awatersheds1 aChen, Huai1 aZhu, Qiu’an1 aWu, Yan1 aWu, Ning0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2012 June, v. 223, no. 5 p.2563-2569dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-011-1048-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003300145245016300178300001800341500001900359500002000378520120900398592002801607596004601635596004701681596005401728596006001782650002501842650001001867650002801877650001301905650001301918650000901931650002101940650001301961650001801974650001401992700002502006700002102031700002102052700002202073700001602095700002202111700006502133773013102198856007902329852000902408655001202417IND60735461420221122093913.0210426e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073546142DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.152882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavarro‐Carrero, Edgar A.10aComparative genomics reveals the in planta‐secreted Verticillium dahliae Av2 effector protein recognized in tomato plants that carry the V2 resistance locus  ap. 1941-1958.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant pathogens secrete effector molecules during host invasion to promote colonization. However, some of these effectors become recognized by host receptors to mount a defence response and establish immunity. Recently, a novel resistance was identified in wild tomato, mediated by the single dominant V2 locus, to control strains of the soil‐borne vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae that belong to race 2. With comparative genomics of race 2 strains and resistance‐breaking race 3 strains, we identified the avirulence effector that activates V2 resistance, termed Av2. We identified 277 kb of race 2‐specific sequence comprising only two genes encoding predicted secreted proteins that are expressed during tomato colonization. Subsequent functional analysis based on genetic complementation into race 3 isolates and targeted deletion from the race 1 isolate JR2 and race 2 isolate TO22 confirmed that one of the two candidates encodes the avirulence effector Av2 that is recognized in V2 tomato plants. Two Av2 allelic variants were identified that encode Av2 variants that differ by a single acid. Thus far, a role in virulence could not be demonstrated for either of the two variants.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  a390686111cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  cFoundation Topconsortium voor Kennis en Innovatie  cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek 3aVerticillium dahliae 3afungi 3agenetic complementation 3agenomics 3aimmunity 3aloci 3aresistance genes 3atomatoes 3avascular wilt 3avirulence1 aVermeulen, Jasper P.1 aE.

However, due to the large number of lncRNAs and the difficulty in determining their roles, the study of lncRNAs is a considerable challenge in hematopoietic differentiation. Here, through gene co-expression network analysis over RNA-seq data generated from representative types of mouse myeloid cells, we obtained a catalog of potential key lncRNAs in the context of mouse myeloid differentiation. Then, employing a widely used in vitro cell model, we screened a novel lncRNA, named Gdal1 (Granulocytic differentiation associated lncRNA 1), from this list and demonstrated that Gdal1 was required for granulocytic differentiation. Furthermore, knockdown of Cebpe, a principal transcription factor of granulocytic differentiation regulation, led to down-regulation of Gdal1, but not vice versa. In addition, expression of genes involved in myeloid differentiation and its regulation, such as Cebpa, were influenced in Gdal1 knockdown cells with differentiation blockage. We thus systematically identified myeloid differentiation associated lncRNAs and substantiated the identification by investigation of one of these lncRNAs on cellular phenotype and gene regulation levels. This study promotes our understanding of the regulation of myeloid differentiation and the characterization of roles of lncRNAs in hematopoietic system.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3amice 3amodels 3aphenotype 3asequence analysis 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics1 aLi, Meng 1 aMi, Shuangli 0 tGenes.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120506303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245009700210300001600307506007600323520094700399592002801346506003701374650002801411650003201439650002301471650001601494650002001510650003001530650002201560650001501582650001401597650002401611653002601635653001501661653002001676653002501696653002801721653002801749653002901777700002301806773010801829856008201937852000902019655001202028IND60673101820221207100643.0210603e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067310182DNAL7 a316996452pmid7 aPMC69806602pmcid7 a10.1016/j.tim.2019.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatnick, Paula I.10aMicrobial Control of Intestinal Homeostasis via Enteroendocrine Cell Innate Immune Signaling  ap. 141-149.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA community of commensal microbes, known as the intestinal microbiota, resides within the gastrointestinal tract of animals and plays a role in maintenance of host metabolic homeostasis and resistance to pathogen invasion. Enteroendocrine cells, which are relatively rare in the intestinal epithelium, have evolved to sense and respond to these commensal microbes. Specifically, they express G-protein-coupled receptors and functional innate immune signaling pathways that recognize products of microbial metabolism and microbe-associated molecular patterns, respectively. Here we review recent evidence from Drosophila melanogaster that microbial cues recruit antimicrobial, mechanical, and metabolic branches of the enteroendocrine innate immune system and argue that this response may play a role not only in maintaining host metabolic homeostasis but also in intestinal resistance to invasion by bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3adisease resistance 3ahomeostasis 3ainnate immunity 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestinal mucosa 3ametabolism 3apathogens 3asignal transduction 0aintestinal microbiota 0ametabolism 0ainnate immunity 0aenteroendocrine cell 0aenteroendocrine peptide 0acolonization resistance 0aDrosophila melanogaster.1 aJugder, Bat-Erdene0 tTrends in microbiology.g2020 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.141-149dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2019.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245007900164300002000243520131400263592002801577650000801605650001801613650002401631650001501655650001301670700002201683700002701705773012401732856008201856852000901938655001201947IND60560690520221119111723.0170105e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056069052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b073032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLange, Martin10aDynamics of the Protein Search for Targets on DNA in the Presence of Traps  ap. 12410-12416.  aProtein search for specific binding sites on DNA is a fundamental biological phenomenon associated with the beginning of most major biological processes. It is frequently found that proteins find and recognize their specific targets quickly and efficiently despite the complex nature of protein–DNA interactions in living cells. Although significant experimental and theoretical efforts were made in recent years, the mechanisms of these processes remain not well-clarified. We present a theoretical study of the protein target search dynamics in the presence of semispecific binding sites which are viewed as traps. Our theoretical approach employs a discrete-state stochastic method that accounts for the most important physical and chemical processes in the system. It also leads to a full analytical description for all dynamic properties of the protein search. It is found that the presence of traps can significantly modify the protein search dynamics. This effect depends on the spatial positions of the targets and traps, on distances between them, on the average sliding length of the protein along the DNA, and on the total length of DNA. Theoretical predictions are discussed using simple physical–chemical arguments, and they are also validated with extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abinding sites 3acomputer simulation 3aprediction 3aproteins1 aKochugaeva, Maria1 aKolomeisky, Anatoly B.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Sept. 24, v. 119, no. 38 p.12410-12416dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b073033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245008800192300001600280500001500296520138300311592002801694650001601722650002101738650001101759650001701770650001101787650002001798650001201818650001401830650002601844650001001870650002101880650002401901650002101925650001001946650003001956650001301986650002101999650005802020651001202078653001502090700002202105700002202127700001902149700001902168700001602187700002102203773010602224856005502330852000902385655001202394IND4470090520221119052549.0120710e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447009052DNAL7 a221822872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2011.01559.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaulavuori, Kari10aDecreased frost hardiness of Vaccinium vitis‐idaea in reponse to UV‐A radiation  ap. 516-526.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to investigate plant frost hardiness responses to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, since the few results reported are largely contradictory. It was hypothesized that functional adaptation of life forms could explain these contradictions. Dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings, representing both evergreen and deciduous forms, were tested (Vaccinium vitis‐idaea, Vaccinium myrtillus, Pinus sylvestris, Betula pubescens and its red form f. rubra). The research was performed in Sodankylä, Northern Finland (67°N), with enhanced UV‐B‐ and UV‐A‐radiation treatments between 2002 and 2009. Plant frost hardiness was determined using the freeze‐induced electrolyte leakage method in early autumn, during the onset of the frost hardening process. Additional physiological variables (malondialdehyde, glutathione, total phenols, C and N contents) were analyzed in V. vitis‐idaea to explain the possible responses. These variables did not respond significantly to UV‐radiation treatments, but explained the frost hardiness well (r2 = 0.678). The main finding was that frost hardiness decreased in the evergreen shrub V. vitis‐idaea, particularly with enhanced UV‐A radiation. No significant responses were observed with the other plants. Therefore, this study does not support the idea that enhanced UV radiation could increase plant frost hardiness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglutathione 3anitrogen content 3ashrubs 3aelectrolytes 3aautumn 3amalondialdehyde 3aphenols 3aseedlings 3aultraviolet radiation 3atrees 3aBetula pubescens 3aVaccinium myrtillus 3aPinus sylvestris 3afrost 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aFreezing 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aVaccinium vitis-idaeaxphysiologyxradiation effects. 3aFinland 0aadaptation1 aKeränen, Johanna1 aSuokanerva, Hanne1 aLakkala, Kaisa1 aHuttunen, Satu1 aLaine, Kari1 aTaulavuori, Erja0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2012 Aug., v. 145, no. 4 p.516-526dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2011.01559.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245011500187300001600302520174400318592002802062650001902090650001402109650002902123650001302152650001702165650001002182650001302192650001202205650003202217650001102249650001002260650001002270650001402280650001002294650004002304650005202344650003202396650001902428650005602447650004102503650004102544650001602585650001102601650001602612650003202628650004502660650001702705651001302722700002402735700001902759700002302778700002302801773011102824856008102935852000903016655001203025IND50060650320221118051026.0141111e20130307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006065032DNAL7 a232767852pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSufian, Adila S.10aIsolation and identification of antibacterial and cytotoxic compounds from the leaves of Muntingia calabura L.  ap. 198-204.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Muntingia calabura (Elaeocarpaceae) is one of the most common roadside trees in Malaysia. Its leaves, barks, flowers and roots have been used as a folk remedy for the treatment of fever, incipient cold, liver disease, as well as an antiseptic agent in Southeast Asia. The aim of this study is to isolate and identify the antibacterial and cytotoxic compounds from the leaves of Muntingia calabura L. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial and cytotoxic activities were determined by micro-broth dilution and MTT assays, respectively. Seven fractions (F1–F7), three flavones and a chalcone were isolated from the active EtOAc extract using bioassay-guided screening. The structures of four compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and compared with published data. The compounds were further tested for their antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. RESULTS: Three flavones and a chalcone [5,7-dihydroxy-3,8-dimethoxyflavone (1), 2′,4′-dihydroxychalcone (2), 5-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (3) and 3,5,7-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone (4)] were isolated from the active fraction F5 of EtOAc extract. Compounds 1 and 3 were isolated for the first time from Muntingia calabura L. Antibacterial activity indicates that compound 2 exhibited the most significant activity with MIC value of 50μg/mL and 100μg/mL against MSSA and MRSA, respectively. Cytotoxic activity indicates that compounds 2 and 3 exhibited very strong activity against HL60 with IC₅₀ values of 3.43μg/mL and 3.34μg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial activity of the leaves of Muntingia calabura L. is ascribable to the active compound 2 while the cytotoxic activity is ascribable to the active compounds 2 and 3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeocarpaceae 3aMuntingia 3aantibacterial properties 3achalcone 3acytotoxicity 3afever 3aflavones 3aflowers 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3aliver 3aroots 3ascreening 3atrees 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxpharmacology 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aElaeocarpaceae 2aFlavonoidsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aHL-60 Cells 2aHumans 2aMCF-7 Cells 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leaves 3aMalaysia1 aRamasamy, Kalavathy1 aAhmat, Norizan1 aZakaria, Zainul A.1 aYusof, M.

An injectable in situ gelling hydrogel is therefore developed for the local delivery of cannabidiol (CBD) through a novel method based on polyelectrolyte (PEC) interaction of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and chitosan (CS). It can be injected into the spinal cord cavity with a 26-gauge syringe before gelation, and gelled after 110 ± 10 s. Of note, the in-situ forming hydrogel has mechanical properties similar to spinal cord. Moreover, the CBD-loaded hydrogels sustain delivery of CBD for up to 72 h, resulting in reducing apoptosis in SCI by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis. Importantly, the CBD-loaded hydrogels raise neurogenesis more than pure hydrogels both in vivo and in vitro, further achieving significant recovery of motor and urinary function in SCI rats. Thus, it suggested that CMC/CS/CBD hydrogels could be used as promising biomaterials for tissue engineering and SCI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal injuries 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatible materials 3abiogenesis 3acannabidiol 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achitosan 3aelectrolytes 3agelation 3ahydrogels 3amitochondria 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3aspinal cord 3asyringes 0aCannabidiol 0aHydrogel 0aSpinal cord injury 0aMitochondrial biogenesis 0aApoptosis1 aHu, Tian1 aXiong, Mingxin1 aLi, Shanshan1 aLi, Wei-Xiong1 aLiu, Jinwen1 aZhou, Xiang1 aQi, Jian1 aJiang, Gang-Biao0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Nov. 30, v. 221 p.1259-1270dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010200166300001800268520149900286592002801785650003701813650001401850650001301864650001201877650001901889650000901908650001201917650000701929650002201936650002101958653001401979653001601993653002402009653003002033653001802063700001402081700002202095773013002117856008502247852000902332655001202341IND60530903820221118044344.0160723e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053090382DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b012282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Sui10aFacile Preparation of Antifouling Hollow Fiber Membranes for Sustainable Osmotic Power Generation  ap. 1154-1160.  aOrganic fouling in the membrane support is one of the major causes for the flux decline and low efficiency in the pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) process for osmotic power generation, especially when the fouling is complicated by inorganic salt ions. A facile method to fabricate antifouling hollow fiber membranes was demonstrated in this study, which employed the readily available poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as the modification agent. The poly(ether sulfone) (PES) support for the thin film composite (TFC) membranes was first coated by polydopamine (PDA) and then coated with PVA with the aid of glutaraldehyde (GA). PDA was found to detach from the support in the first 2 h and gradually stabilized at pH 2, verifying its applicability for PRO processes. In addition, the existence of a PVA layer was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is important to note that by controlling the reaction conditions, the water flux and salt reverse flux in the PRO process were not sacrificed, proving that the modification can well maintain the porous structure of the support. The modified membranes showed significantly improved fouling resistance to not only alginate but also complex alginate–calcium solutions. The water flux remained ∼80% instead of ∼64% in the latter case. Moreover, much of the fouling was converted from irreversible to reversible, which helped enhance the efficiency of physical cleaning to ∼90%, and hence improved the sustainability of the PRO process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalginates 3acleaning 3afouling 3aglutaraldehyde 3aions 3aosmosis 3apH 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3apower generation 0aMembranes 0aAntifouling 0aPoly(vinyl alcohol) 0aPressure retarded osmosis 0aOsmotic power1 aZhang, Yu1 aChung, Tai-shung,0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Mar. 07, v. 4, no. 3 p.1154-1160dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b012283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012500160300001800285520141200303592002801715650002101743650002501764650002801789650001201817650001601829650001901845650001301864650001401877650001201891650001901903650002201922650002701944650001301971650000901984650000901993700002002002700002402022700001802046700002302064773014102087856007402228852000902302655001202311IND60642431420221119013639.0190507e20160706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064243142DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb00797j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Marta M.10aIn vitro corrosion behaviour and anti-Candida spp. activity of Zn coated with ZnO-nanostructured ‘Anastacia’ flowers  ap. 4754-4761.  aRejection and colonization by microbes are two problematic issues that often require the surgical removal of medical implants with increased risks for patients. In this work it is shown that functionalization of Zn surfaces with ZnO-nanostructured 'Anastacia' flowers (NAF) resulted in improved biomaterials that can potentially overcome these important drawbacks, which can further boost the use of Zn in biomedical implants. The in vitro degradation of NAF-coated Zn under simulated physiological conditions resulted in the formation of a biomimetic corrosion layer rich in a hydroxyapatite analogue that, being an important bone component, may potentially decrease implant rejection. Colonization of the NAF-coated Zn surface by Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans, two of the more relevant microbial species colonizing medical devices, was significantly reduced on the NAF-coated Zn surface. The mechanism by which this colonization inhibition occurred was distinct since for C. parapsilosis cells this was attributed to reduced cell viability, while for C. albicans the reduced colonization was related to impaired biofilm formation. This ZnO-derived coating is an expeditious strategy to improve the resilience of Zn-based resorbable biomaterials towards Candida spp. colonization, paving the way for the design of bioactive ZnO-derived coatings with potential for clinical applications on bone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida parapsilosis 3abiocompatible materials 3abiofilm 3abiomimetics 3acell viability 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3aflowers 3ahydroxyapatite 3amedical equipment 3amicrobial colonization 3apatients 3arisk 3azinc1 aCunha, Diana V.1 aSantos, Catarina F.1 aMira, Nuno P.1 aMontemor, Maria F.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 July 6, v. 4, no. 27 p.4754-4761dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb00797j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010900173300001100282520157800293592002801871650001801899650004301917650001701960650002201977650001501999650002202014650002602036650002302062650002102085650001802106650001402124650001002138650001402148651001702162651001402179700002102193700002002214700002102234700002002255700002402275773011102299856008102410852000902491655001202500IND60477493520221120095928.0160122e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047749352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-015-2030-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarasan, Viswambharan10aApproaches to develop a road map for the long-term conservation of an island endemic genus Cylindrocline  ap. 10.  aHabitat fragmentation and invasive alien species contribute to genetic bottlenecks and the threat of extinction of many endemic species of Mauritius, part of the Madagascan and Indian Ocean biodiversity hotspot. The genus Cylindrocline has two species, C. commersonii (critically endangered) and C. lorencei (extinct in the wild). The last living specimens of C. lorencei disappeared in the wild after the recorded collecting of seeds in 1982 by Conservatoire Botanique National de Brest (CBN Brest). Embryo rescue was used as a method to germinate these seeds and the seedlings raised this way were shared by CBN Brest with Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (RBG Kew) as part of an exchange programme in 2001. Mature plants both at CBN Brest and RBG Kew stopped producing viable seeds and this has made the long-term conservation of C. lorencei even more difficult. Seeds of C. commersonii collected from the wild in 2010 have a very low viability while ex situ grown C. commersonii produce non-viable seeds. Molecular studies conducted in C. lorencei using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) showed no genetic variability among remaining individuals. Two samples of C. commersonii showed a very small amount of genetic variability. The variability between the two species was well within the limits commonly found within species or between closely related species and the long-term conservation of the genus requires a radical (to a degree) approach to avoid its extinction. The importance of novel approaches for restoration and long-term conservation are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCylindrocline 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abiodiversity 3abotanical gardens 3aextinction 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amature plants 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aviability 3aIndian Ocean 3aMauritius1 aBuord, Stéphane1 aPellicer, Jaume1 aSanchez, Michele1 aCowan, Robyn S.1 aLesouëf, Jean-Yves0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2016 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.10-10dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-015-2030-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245005700170300001400227520169100241592002801932650001901960650000901979650002201988650002702010650001502037650001302052650002202065650001402087650001902101650002002120650002002140651001202160700002202172700002002194773009602214856004802310852000902358655001202367IND50071636520221120193247.0140104e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007163652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-013-0982-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrales, Carolina10aPhylogeography and subspecies status of Black Grouse  ap. 13-25.  aThe cold periods of the Pleistocene have had a striking impact on the diversification of most organisms in temperate regions. Phylogeographic patterns and postglacial expansion are poorly understood in the Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix). This species is widely distributed across Eurasia, and has been divided into a number of subspecies on the basis of morphological differences and geographic isolation. To investigate the evolutionary history of the species, 143 samples from different regions were examined for a mtDNA control region fragment. Overall, analyses of mtDNA gave support for the divergence between Tetrao tetrix tetrix, T. t. ussuriensis and T. t. mongolicus. The analyses reveal the effects of colonisation out of glacial refugia on the genetic diversity and genetic structure of Black Grouse. The phylogeographical results are consistent with a demographic population expansion following a bell-shaped mismatch distribution, a star-shaped phylogeny and low nucleotide diversity. Patterns of postglacial dispersal imply that Black Grouse from southern Europe have been restricted to this area, and did not contribute to the genetic diversity of northern Europe. Instead, Black Grouse spread out to northern Europe from a refugium in the east and a possible one in western Europe, following the retreat of glacial ice sheets, although both refugia remain unidentified. We suggest that T. t. britannicus and T. t. viridanus correspond to northern T. t. tetrix, and that this lineage has diverged from the other subspecies. This division is tentative due to limited sampling, but it will facilitate the management of different evolutionary significant units of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLyrurus tetrix 3acold 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3arefuge habitats 3atemperate zones 3aEurasia1 aPavlovska, Mariia1 aHöglund, Jacob0 tJournal of ornithology.g2014 Jan., v. 155, no. 1 p.13-25dSpringer-Verlagx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-013-0982-z  aDNAL 7aarticle04213naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245010900168300001300277500001500290520244400305592002802749650002002777650002102797650002502818650002202843650001002865650001102875650002502886650001702911650001702928650002602945650002102971650001202992650001903004650001303023650002203036650002003058650001903078650002003097650001203117650001903129650002103148650002603169650004003195650002703235650002303262650002103285653001503306700001403321700001403335700001503349700002003364700001803384773010103402856008703503852000903590655001203599IND4469218820221118231840.0150810e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446921882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaunders, M.10aThinning effects on the net ecosystem carbon exchange of a Sitka spruce forest are temperature-dependent  ap. 1-10.  a2019-12-06  aCommercial forest plantations need to be actively managed, through tree removal, in order to improve wood quality, maintain productivity and provide an economic return, although this could compromise an important role for forests in carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas mitigation. The impact of forest thinning on net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was assessed using a combination of biometric and eddy covariance (EC) techniques. Two thinning operations were performed in close succession, which reduced the basal area of the stand by 17% and 11% and removed a timber volume of 48m³ha⁻¹ and 50m³ha⁻¹, respectively. Annual rates of NPP ranged from 13.24 (±3.96) to 18.94 (±4.88)tCha⁻¹ and 13.22 (±3.72) to 17.77 (±5.30)tCha⁻¹ for the pre- and post-thinning periods, respectively. Estimates of NEE varied between 8.44 (±1.34) to 8.87 (±1.48)tCha⁻¹ and 6.75 (±1.19) to 10.33 (±1.41)tCha⁻¹ in the pre- and post-thinning periods. Forest thinning did not have a significant impact on carbon stocks or fluxes when pre-thinning (2002–2006) and post-thinning (2007–2009) estimates of NPP and NEE were compared, however the range of inter-annual variability in NEE increased after thinning. The partitioning of annual NEE carbon budgets into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Rₑcₒ) together with an analysis of key physiological parameters suggested that the impacts of forest thinning are largely dependent on temperature. An expected decrease in GPP after the initial thinning in 2007 was not observed due, in part, to the higher mean annual air temperatures and incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and a compensatory increase in photosynthesis by the remaining trees. A continual decline in Rₑcₒ, was observed in the years subsequent to the first thinning and was attributed to both biomass removal and climatic factors. Inter-annual variations in climate had a significant impact on NEE, GPP and Rₑcₒ. Annual mean air temperature, total precipitation and total incident PAR were all shown to influence the processes driving CO₂ exchange. Overall, these results suggest that the impacts of the thinning practices, as implemented in this study, are dependent on climate and under similar conditions are unlikely, in the short-term, to compromise a role for forest ecosystems in carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeddy covariance 3agreenhouse gases 3aprimary productivity 3acosts and returns 3atrees 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3awood quality 3aecosystem respiration 3aPicea sitchensis 3aforests 3acarbon dioxide 3abiometry 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest thinning 3aphotosynthesis 3aair temperature 3abiomass 3arisk reduction 3aclimatic factors 3aeconomic productivity 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aforest plantations 3astand basal area 0abasal area1 aTobin, B.1 aBlack, K.1 aGioria, M.1 aNieuwenhuis, M.1 aOsborne, B.A.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2012 May 15, v. 157 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007800165300001800243520084900261592002801110650001501138650001501153650002201168650001201190650001501202650001101217650002601228650000701254650002301261650001601284650001901300653001601319653002101335700001701356700002301373700001901396700002501415700002301440773009601463856008101559852000901640655001201649IND60724973020221120193640.0210124e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072497302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.08.1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQasemi, Mehdi10aData on cadmium removal from synthetic aqueous solution using garbage ash  ap. 1115-1123.  aThis data article investigates cadmium removal efficiency using garbage ash as a cheap and effective adsorbent.

An efficient and reliable micropropagation protocol is reported in this paper, which can be utilized for multiplication of elite genotypes of black pepper. Shoot regeneration was induced on Murashige and Skoog (MS) and Woody Plant Media (WPM) media in 24 combinations with plant growth regulators. Explants cultured in MS media supplemented with 0.5 mg L⁻¹ BAP formed 6.5 nodes per plant with longest shoots (10.42 cm) after 12 wks. Regenerated shoots were rooted on MS media supplemented with 2.0 mg L⁻¹ IBA, yielding about 15 roots per plant with an average root length of 3.40 cm within 4 wks. The hardening of the shoots under a mist chamber conditions (25±2 °C, 70-80% RH) yielded 100% survival after acclimatization. Genetic stability analysis of the micropropagated and mother plants was done using 48 ISSR markers. The plants found to be genetically stable when compared with mother plants. A ratio of 1:6.5 numbers of nodes is obtained on the MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mgL⁻¹ of BAP within 3 months. This research presents an improved and efficient micropropagation protocol with good rate of multiplication of the genetically stable plants that are easily acclimatized to the field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPiper nigrum 3aacclimation 3ablack pepper 3agenetic markers 3agenetic stability 3amicropropagation 3amists 3aplant growth 3awoody plants 3aIndia 0aIn vitro clonal propagation 0aMolecular markers 0aField acclimatization1 aMalhotra, Era Vaidya1 aShankar, M1 aAgrawal, Anuradha0 tIndian journal of plant genetic resources.g2022 Aug. 26, v. 35, no. 2 p.264-274dIndian Society Of Plant Genetic ResourceswJournal:2090x0976-19267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-1926.2022.00030.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001800190245012000208300001600328506007600344520134300420592002801763506003701791650001001828650001201838650001601850650001601866650002401882650001401906650001901920650001401939650002601953650001401979650002301993650002002016650002402036650001702060650001402077650002502091653002302116653001802139653001702157653002402174653001902198700001502217700002002232700001802252700001702270700001602287773016702303856008302470852000902553655001202562IND60571189020221207092209.0190426e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057118902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aninu.2017.05.0022doi7 aPMC59411952pmcid7 a297671482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Yangchun10aEffect of dietary supplementation with sugar cane extract on meat quality and oxidative stability in finishing pigs  ap. 295-299.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with sugar cane extract (SCE) on meat quality and oxidative stability of Longissimus dorsi muscle in finishing pigs. Eighteen barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Jiaxing Black), with an average initial body weight of 62.1 ± 5.0 kg, were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets with 6 replicates per treatment for 42 days. The diets comprised a normal diet and the normal diets supplemented with 5 and 25 g/kg SCE. The results showed that SCE supplementation did not affect final body weight of finishing pigs. Dietary SCE supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) Longissimus dorsi muscle pH24 h, and tended to reduce (P < 0.1) and significantly decreased (P < 0.05) shear force, drip loss, myofiber cross sectional area and lactate dehydrogenase activity at 5 and 25 g/kg, respectively. Meanwhile, dietary SCE treatments significantly decreased (P < 0.05) malonaldehyde content and total superoxide dismutase activity in Longissimus dorsi muscle, and tended to reduce (P < 0.1) malonaldehyde content in serum. Altogether, these data indicate that SCE is an effective feed additive to improve pork meat quality, and the underlying mechanism may be partly due to the improved oxidative stability induced by dietary SCE supplementation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDuroc 3abarrows 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3adietary supplements 3adrip loss 3afeed additives 3afinishing 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alandraces 3alongissimus muscle 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stability 3apork quality 3asugarcane 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aSugar cane extract 0aFeed additive 0aMeat quality 0aOxidative stability 0aFinishing pigs1 aLi, Yansen1 aShen, Xiangxing1 aMizu, Massami1 aFuruta, Toma1 aLi, Chunmei0 tAnimal nutrition.g2017 Sept., v. 3, no. 3 p.295-299dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-63837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007800168300001600246520103800262592002801300650001501328650001601343650001301359650000901372650001201381650001801393700002301411700003301434700002301467700002101490700002301511700002101534773009401555856008101649852000901730655001201739IND60724973220221120173019.0210124e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072497322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.08.1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelter, Marciane10aData for serum 1,5 anhydroglucitol concentration in different populations  ap. 753-760.  a1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), is a nonmetabolized 1-deoxy form of glucose, originate mainly from the diet. 1,5-AG is a biomarker to detect and magnify hyperglycemic excursions (postprandial hyperglycemia) in diabetic patients. Concentrations of 1,5-AG has been applied as supporting biomarker to diagnosis of the major forms of diabetes (type 1, type 2, and gestational). The serum 1,5-AG reference interval is relevant to the appropriate clinical application of this biomarker. This article contains data regards to serum concentration of the biomarker primarily for healthy subjects, capture from the literature, in different populations. Correlation analysis between 1,5-AG and markers associated with diabetes and its complication were presented. The data was complementary to the study “Reference intervals for serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol in children, adolescents, adults, and pregnant women” (Welter et al., 2018). The data present in this article improve the comparisons for 1,5-AG in different conditions and methodologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adiabetes 3adiet 3aglucose 3ahyperglycemia1 aBoritza, Kátia C.1 aAnghebem-Oliveira, Mauren I.1 aHenneberg, Railson1 aHauser, Aline B.1 aRego, Fabiane G.M.1 aPicheth, Geraldo0 tData in Brief.g2018 Oct., v. 20 p.753-760dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.08.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245011300167300001600280520150100296592002801797650001401825650002001839650002401859650001201883650001101895650003001906650001301936650001401949650002201963650001501985651001102000700002002011700001902031773011202050856007602162852000902238655001202247IND60750649420221119005118.0210916e20210908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075064942DNAL7 a10.3897/abs.7.e724092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrygadyrenko, Viktor10aEffect of global climate change on the distribution of Anchomenus dorsalis (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in Europe  ap. 237-260.  aShifts in the bioclimatic range of Anchomenus dorsalis – specialized entomophage – were modeled in the MaxEntsoftware package and are presented on habitat maps. For the prediction, we used two climatic scenarios – mild (RCP2.6) and extreme (RCP8.5). Under the considered scenarios, the further warming would lead to shift and extension of the range to the north, northeast and east and decrease in the number of populations in the southern regions of Europe. The most important bioclimatic indicators which describe the geographic distribution of A. dorsalis are mean annual air temperature, mean daily amplitude of temperature for each month, overall amount of precipitations in the coldest quarter of the year, minimum temperature of the coldest month, mean temperature of the warmest quarter of the year, and annual amount of precipitations. Global warming causes the bioclimatic range of A. dorsalis to shift northeast and east in intracontinental territories, and west and northwest on islands. This species of ground beetle is an important object in monitoring of the condition of natural and agrarian ecosystems, sensitive to the growing global climate changes. Poikilothermic animals may suffer from overheating, and even if they live far in the northern hemisphere, the ability of their organism to withstand increase in the environmental temperature is limited. Mild winters (with higher temperatures) may increase the mortality of A. dorsalis by exhausting their energy reserves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarabidae 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3aclimate 3aenergy 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3amortality 3apredatory insects 3aprediction 3aEurope1 aAvtaeva, Tamara1 aMatsyura, Alex0 tActa biologica Sibirica.g2021 Sept. 08, v. 7 p.237-260dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27344x2412-19087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/abs.7.e724093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010500168300001600273520129500289592002801584650000901612650001201621650001701633650001401650650001601664650001801680650003001698650001201728650001001740650002101750650002901771650001701800650001601817650001901833650003001852650001101882653002901893653001701922653001701939653001501956653001901971653002001990700005502010700001802065700001702083773009602100856008402196852000902280655001202289IND60605033120221120191152.0180720e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060503312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDate, Abhijit10aPerformance review of a novel combined thermoelectric power generation and water desalination system  ap. 256-269.  aA novel combined thermoelectric power generation and water desalination system is described with a system schematic. The proposed system utilises low grade thermal energy to heat thermoelectric generators for power generation and water desalination. A theoretical analysis presents the governing equations to estimate the systems performance characteristics combined with experimental validation. Experimental set-up consists of an electric heat source, thermoelectric modules, heat pipes, a heat sink and an evaporator vessel. Four heat pipes are embedded in a heat spreader block to passively cool the bottom side of the thermoelectric cells. The condenser of these four heat pipes is immersed in a pool of saline water stored in an evaporation vessel which is maintained at sub-atmospheric pressure. The liquid to vapour phase change cooling method achieve low saturation temperature and offers a high heat transfer coefficient for the cooling of the thermoelectric generators. At the same time this method utilises the low temperature heat extracted from the cold side of the thermoelectric generator for water desalination. It was observed that at low saturation temperatures greater heat flux could be supplied to the thermoelectric generators with less heat losses to the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acooling 3adesalination 3aequations 3aevaporation 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3aliquids 3apipes 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 3asaline water 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3athermoelectric generators 3avapors 0aThermoelectric generator 0aPhase change 0aDesalination 0aHeat pipes 0aLow grade heat 0aPassive cooling1 aGauci, Luke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6074-37841 aChan, Raymond1 aDate, Ashwin0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Nov., v. 83 p.256-269dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015500170300001800325500001900343520183000362592002802192650002502220650001502245650001502260650001502275650002002290650002202310650002102332650002102353650001502374650001502389650001802404650002002422650002102442650001902463650001302482650001402495650002402509650001102533700001402544700001302558700001502571700001902586700005602605773012902661856008402790852000902874655001202883IND60736168520221120104936.0210504e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073616852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c007462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qingqing10aSensitive Dual-Mode Biosensors for CYFRA21-1 Assay Based on the Dual-Signaling Electrochemical Ratiometric Strategy and “On–Off–On” PEC Method  ap. 6801-6807.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, an electrochemical (EC)–photoelectrochemical (PEC) dual-mode biosensor was constructed for cytokeratin 19 fragment 21-1 (CYFRA21-1) assay based on the dual-signaling electrochemical ratiometric strategy and “on–off–on” PEC method. The indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode was modified by 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA)@C₆₀ and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), and the double-stranded DNA composed of thiol/methylene blue (MB)-labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (S0-MB) and antibody/ferrocene (Fc)-labeled ssDNA (Ab1-S1-Fc) was immobilized on the Au NPs/PTCDA@C₆₀/ITO electrode via the Au–S bond between Au NPs and thiol of S0-MB. With the help of another antibody-labeled ssDNA (Ab2-S2), the presence of CYFRA21-1 triggered a typical antigen–antibody sandwich immune reaction (Ab1, CYFRA21-1, and Ab2) and proximity hybridization between Ab1-S1-Fc and Ab2-S2. This caused the release of Ab1-S1-Fc from the modified electrode and the change of S0-MB to a hairpin structure, resulting in a decrease (an increase) of the oxidation peak current of Fc (MB) and an increase of the photocurrent due to the enhancing (inhibiting) effect of MB (Fc) on the photoelectric performance of the Au NPs/PTCDA@C₆₀/ITO electrode. Thus, CYFRA21-1 was detected by the developed EC–PEC dual-mode sensing platform sensitively, and the linear response ranges of 0.001–40 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.3 pg/mL for the EC technique and 0.0001–4 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.03 pg/mL for the PEC method were obtained. Furthermore, by changing the specific antibodies of disease-related biomarkers, the developed dual-mode biosensing platform could be readily extended to detect other antigens, implying its great potential applications in biological analysis and early disease diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantibodies 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adisease diagnosis 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aferrocenes 3ahybridization 3aimmune response 3aindium tin oxide 3amethylene blue 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3asingle-stranded DNA 3athiols1 aFu, Yamin1 aXiao, Ke1 aDu, Cuicui1 aZhang, Xiaohua1 aChen, Jinhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5089-09270 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Apr. 21, v. 93, no. 17 p.6801-6807dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c007463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245018400168300001800352500001900370500002000389520181900409592002802228596006902256596006902325596006902394596003802463650002702501650001402528650001702542650002302559650002002582650002702602650001202629650001302641700002002654700002302674700002302697700002102720700006202741773011802803856007402921852000902995655001203004IND60720992920221117175026.0201222e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072099292DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.153172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerringer, Mackenzie E.10aPressure tolerance of deep‐sea enzymes can be evolved through increasing volume changes in protein transitions: a study with lactate dehydrogenases from abyssal and hadal fishes  ap. 5394-5410.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe explore the principles of pressure tolerance in enzymes of deep‐sea fishes using lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) as a case study. We compared the effects of pressure on the activities of LDH from hadal snailfishes Notoliparis kermadecensis and Pseudoliparis swirei with those from a shallow‐adapted Liparis florae and an abyssal grenadier Coryphaenoides armatus. We then quantified the LDH content in muscle homogenates using mass‐spectrometric determination of the LDH‐specific conserved peptide LNLVQR. Existing theory suggests that adaptation to high pressure requires a decrease in volume changes in enzymatic catalysis. Accordingly, evolved pressure tolerance must be accompanied with an important reduction in the volume change associated with pressure‐promoted alteration of enzymatic activity (ΔVPP∘). Our results suggest an important revision to this paradigm. Here, we describe an opposite effect of pressure adaptation—a substantial increase in the absolute value of ΔVPP∘ in deep‐living species compared to shallow‐water counterparts. With this change, the enzyme activities in abyssal and hadal species do not substantially decrease their activity with pressure increasing up to 1–2 kbar, well beyond full‐ocean depth pressures. In contrast, the activity of the enzyme from the tidepool snailfish, L. florae, decreases nearly linearly from 1 to 2500 bar. The increased tolerance of LDH activity to pressure comes at the expense of decreased catalytic efficiency, which is compensated with increased enzyme contents in high‐pressure‐adapted species. The newly discovered strategy is presumably used when the enzyme mechanism involves the formation of potentially unstable excited transient states associated with substantial changes in enzyme–solvent interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  a1130494cNational Science Foundation, Division of Ocean Sciences  a1130712cNational Science Foundation, Division of Ocean Sciences  a1508760cNational Science Foundation, Division of Ocean Sciences  aFK141109cSchmidt Ocean Institute 3aCoryphaenoides armatus 3aLiparidae 3acase studies 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme activity 3alactate dehydrogenases 3amuscles 3apeptides1 aYancey, Paul H.1 aTikhonova, Olga V.1 aVavilov, Nikita E.1 aZgoda, Victor G.1 aDavydov, Dmitri R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8520-00330 tFEBS journal.g2020 Dec., v. 287, no. 24 p.5394-5410dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.153173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006800165300001400233520127900247592002801526650003001554650001301584650001901597650001001616650001301626650001901639650001601658700001701674773010701691856008101798852000901879655001201888IND60575947920221119220218.0170728e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057594792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-016-0511-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinter, C.

Displacement experiments, polarized light manipulations, and view manipulations tested the use of path integration, polarized light patterns, and visual guidance in the ability of Pogonomyrmex ants to orient homeward during foraging. In the displacement experiments, worker ants that were displaced from their original locations to new locations equidistant from the nest initially walked in the direction of the home vector that would be determined by a path integrator (PI). Sham treatments showed that handling and returning ants to their original location had no effect on homeward navigation. Neither a polarizing filter nor changing nearby landmarks affected orientation. However, placement of a wall behind the nest while an ant was navigating homeward caused it to become disoriented. Ants viewing the wall walked in random directions and took more time to find their nest. These results suggest that P. occidentalis workers rely on PI to navigate homeward after foraging, but do not follow the home vector indicated by the PI if the panorama has been significantly altered and, therefore, conflicts with the available PI information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPogonomyrmex occidentalis 3aforaging 3aharvester ants 3anests 3aplacebos 3asocial insects 3aworker ants1 aBreed, M.

We prepared polyureas (PUas) from CO₂ and diamines via an isocyanate-free route. PUas synthesized by the copolymerization of CO₂ with 1,6-hexamethylene diamine (HMDA) and 1,12-diaminododecane (DAD) presented superior mechanical properties compared to the ones from CO₂ with either DAD or HMDA alone. The PUas contained DAD and HMDA segments in the main polymer chains, and hydrogen bonds were formed between DAD and HMDA segments, in which the hydrogen bonds were distributed at regular and irregular intervals depending on the relative amounts of the two segments. For PUas synthesized from either DAD (x = 0) or HMDA (x = 100), hydrogen bonds were mostly present at regular distances, forming a regular hydrogen bond network and contributing to high crystallinity. For PUas of DAD₁₀₀–ₓHMDAₓ (37 ≤ x ≤ 63), in contrast, irregular hydrogen bonds coexist with regular ones, so the crystallinity was lower compared to DAD₁₀₀ and HMDA₁₀₀. It is to note that the PUas synthesized are advantageous for postprocessing as their initial decomposition temperatures (Td,₅% > 295 °C) are about 85 °C higher than the melting temperatures (Tₘ, 116–207 °C). Furthermore, mechanical properties were optimized by varying the chain length of aliphatic diamine used. The PUas (DAD₅₀HMDA₅₀ and DAD₃₇HMDA₆₃) obtained show mechanical properties superior to those of the previously reported polymeric materials, such as CO₂-based PUas, isocyanate-free polyhydroxyurethanes, CO₂-sourced polycarbonates, polyamide 6, and traditional PUas from diisocyanates. Hence, the present CO₂-sourced PUas will find industrial applications in different fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acopolymerization 3acrystal structure 3adiamines 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3apolyamides 3asustainable development 3athermoplastics 0aCO2 transformation 0apolyurea 0aisocyanate-free 0ahydrogen bonding interaction1 aJiang, Shan1 aCheng, Haiyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0287-054X1 aWu, Peixuan1 aZhang, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6669-14201 aArai, Masahiko1 aZhao, Fengyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6798-52870 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 11, v. 8, no. 50 p.18626-18635dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c069113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245012300165520168900288592002801977650000902005650000902014650002702023650001102050650001602061650000902077650002002086700002602106700001602132700003202148700002002180700002902200700002702229700002202256700002502278700001902303700002102322773012102343856007602464852000902540655001202549IND60757623020221121000828.0211125e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075762302DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111133342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMota-Rojas, Daniel 10aCurrent Advances in Assessment of Dog’s Emotions, Facial Expressions, and Their Use for Clinical Recognition of Pain  aAnimals’ facial expressions are involuntary responses that serve to communicate the emotions that individuals feel. Due to their close co-existence with humans, broad attention has been given to identifying these expressions in certain species, especially dogs. This review aims to analyze and discuss the advances in identifying the facial expressions of domestic dogs and their clinical utility in recognizing pain as a method to improve daily practice and, in an accessible and effective way, assess the health outcome of dogs. This study focuses on aspects related to the anatomy and physiology of facial expressions in dogs, their emotions, and evaluations of their eyebrows, eyes, lips, and ear positions as changes that reflect pain or nociception. In this regard, research has found that dogs have anatomical configurations that allow them to generate changes in their expressions that similar canids—wolves, for example—cannot produce. Additionally, dogs can perceive emotions similar to those of their human tutors due to close human-animal interaction. This phenomenon—called “emotional contagion”—is triggered precisely by the dog’s capacity to identify their owners’ gestures and then react by emitting responses with either similar or opposed expressions that correspond to positive or negative stimuli, respectively. In conclusion, facial expressions are essential to maintaining social interaction between dogs and other species, as in their bond with humans. Moreover, this provides valuable information on emotions and the perception of pain, so in dogs, they can serve as valuable elements for recognizing and evaluating pain in clinical settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aears 3ahuman-animal relations 3ahumans 3anociception 3apain 3asocial behavior1 aMarcet-Rius, Míriam 1 aOgi, Asahi 1 aHernández-Ávalos, Ismael 1 aMariti, Chiara 1 aMartínez Burnes, Julio,1 aMora-Medina, Patricia 1 aCasas, Alejandro 1 aDomínguez, Adriana,1 aReyes, Brenda 1 aGazzano, Angelo 0 tAnimals.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111133343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245022100166300002000387520123300407592002801640650004401668650001601712650001501728650001301743650001301756650002101769650002101790650001401811650001801825650001901843650001501862650003701877650001301914650002801927650001901955650001801974650001401992650000702006650002802013650003302041650002302074650003802097650003702135700001802172700003002190700003102220700001702251700001702268700001802285773014902303856008102452852000902533655001202542IND60547764120221117040440.0170725e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054776412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6721-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Jiangnan10aEffective degradation of rhodamine B by electro-Fenton process, using ferromagnetic nanoparticles loaded on modified graphite felt electrode as reusable catalyst: in neutral pH condition and without external aeration  ap. 15471-15482.  aPolytetrafluoroethylene/ferromagnetic nanoparticle/carbon black (PTFE/MNP/CB)-modified graphite felt (GF) was successfully applied as cathode for the mineralization of rhodamine B (RhB) in electro-Fenton (EF) process. The modified cathode showed high decolorization efficiency for RhB solution even in neutral pH condition and without external aeration, achieving nearly complete decolorization and 89.52 % total organic carbon (TOC) removal after 270-min oxidation with the MNP load 1.2 g at 50 A/m². Moreover, the operational parameters (current density, MNP load, initial pH, and airflow rate) were optimized. After that, adsorption isotherm was also conducted to compare the absorption quantity of CB and carbon nanotube (CNT). Then, the surface morphologies of MNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray detector (EDX), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); and the modified cathode was characterized by SEM and contact angle. Finally, the stability and reusability of modified cathode were tested. Result uncovered that the PTFE/MNP/CB-modified cathode has the potential for industrial application and the solution after treatment was easily biodegradable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3aaeration 3aair flow 3abiodegradability 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acontact angle 3adecolorization 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene 3aindustrial applications 3amineralization 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhao, Jixiang1 aOlajuyin, Ayobami Matthew1 aSharshar, Moustafa Mohamed1 aMu, Tingzhen1 aYang, Maohua1 aXing, Jianmin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Aug., v. 23, no. 15 p.15471-15482dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6721-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245011200175300001600287520121600303592002801519650001601547650001301563650002301576650001601599650001001615650001601625650001701641650001601658650002301674650002101697650000701718650001701725653001001742653003301752653001601785653001601801653001701817700002201834700002201856700002101878700001801899773012001917856008102037852000902118655001202127IND60524973220221120024543.0190318e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052497322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEyamo Evina, Victor Jos10aInfluence of acetic and lactic acids on cocoa flavan-3-ol degradation through fermentation-like incubations  ap. 514-522.  aThe biochemical reactions occurring inside cocoa beans during fermentation are mostly due to penetration of lactic and acetic acids issued from microbial activities. In the present study, fresh, ripe cocoa beans were subjected to three fermentation-like incubation schemes: incubation for 2 days at pH 4 in a solution of acetic acid, lactic acid, or both, followed by a 3-days incubation at pH 5 in acetic acid solution. After each treatment applied, the fermentation index was above 1 and a cut test revealed a brown color, characteristic of well-fermented beans. As shown by RP-HPLC-ESI(−)-MS/MS analysis, the main flavan-3-ols found in German Cocoa (Amelonado group) and ICS 40 (Trinitario group) ranked as follows: epicatechin > C1 > B2 > catechin > B5 > dehydrodiepicatechin A. In both natural fermentations and fermentation-like incubations, these compounds showed a sharp decrease, this effect being strongest when acetic acid was present from the start. Lactic acid exhibited a somewhat polyphenol-protective effect.

With the evolution into real useful energy storage cells, the bottleneck factors of the corrosion and dendrite growth problems must be properly resolved for largely boosting their cycling life and energy efficiency. Herein, a natural polysaccharide strengthened hydrogel electrolyte (denoted as PAAm/agar/Zn(CF₃SO₃)₂) was engineered by designing an asymmetric dual network of covalently cross-linked polyacrylamide (denoted as PAAm) and physically cross-linked loose polysaccharide (e.g., agar) followed by intense uptake of Zn(CF₃SO₃)₂ aqueous electrolyte. In this polymeric matrix, the PAAm chains are responsible for constructing the soft domains to immobilize the water molecules, and the agar component boosts the mechanical performance (by using its inherent reversible sacrificial bonds) and favors the electrolyte ion transport. Due to these reasons, the as-designed hydrogel electrolyte effectively inhibits the zinc dendrite growth, realizes the uniform Zn deposition, and affords a satisfactory ionic conductivity of 1.55 S m–¹, excellent tensile strength (78.9 kPa at 507.7% stretchable), and high compression strength (118.0 kPa at 60.0% strain). Additionally, a biopolymer-derived N-doped carbon microsphere cathode material with a highly interconnected porous carbonaceous network (denoted as NC) was also synthesized, which delivers a high capacity of 92.8 mAh g–¹, along with superb rate capability and long duration cycling lifespan (95.4% retention for 10000 cycles) in the aqueous Zn//NC ZHSC. More notably, with integrated merits of the PAAm/agar/Zn(CF₃SO₃)₂ hydrogel electrolyte and NC, the as-built quasi-solid-state ZHSC achieves a high specific capacity of 73.4 mAh g–¹ and superior energy density of 61.3 Wh kg–¹ together with excellent cycling stability for 10000 cycles. This work demonstrated favorable practicability in the structural design of the hydrogel electrolytes and electrode materials for advanced ZHSC applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3abiopolymers 3acarbon 3acathodes 3achemical bonding 3acompression strength 3acorrosion 3acrosslinking 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3aenergy efficiency 3ahydrogels 3alongevity 3amicroparticles 3apolyacrylamide 3atensile strength 3azinc 0ahydrogel electrolyte 0apolysaccharide 0aN-doped carbon microsphere 0azinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor 0adendrite suppression1 aWu, Dandan1 aLiu, Zhibo1 aMi, Hongyu1 aLiao, Yinnian1 aWu, Mingzai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1938-77301 aCui, Haonan1 aLi, Xixian1 aWu, Tianlong1 aBai, Zhengyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8611-30030 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 May 12, v. 14, no. 20 p.23452-23464dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c033233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245013600207300001600343500001900359520210600378592002802484596008202512650002502594650002402619650002402643650002702667650001002694650002202704650001402726650001502740650002002755651001002775700002302785700002502808700002302833700002002856700001602876700002302892700001602915773014402931856008203075852000903157655001203166IND60731675820221121031908.0210322e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073167582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03120-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEid, Ebrahem M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2452-446910aTemporal Potential of Phragmites australis as a Phytoremediator to Remove Ni and Pb from Water and Sediment in Lake Burullus, Egypt  ap. 516-527.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the current work, we investigated the concentration of Ni and Pb in different organs of Phragmites australis to evaluate its potential application as a phytoremediator to remove these two metals from contaminated water and sediment in Lake Burullus (a Ramsar site in Egypt). Above- and below-ground biomass of P. australis, water and sediment were sampled monthly for 1 year at six sites of Lake Burullus (three sites represent each of the northern and southern parts of the lake) using six randomly distributed quadrats (each of 0.5 × 0.5 m) at each sampling site. Significant variation was detected for Ni and Pb concentrations in the sediments and waters between the northern and southern sites of the lake. The biomass of P. australis in the southern sites was greater than that in the northern sites; in addition, the above-ground biomass was higher than the below-ground biomass. The above-ground organs accumulated higher concentrations of Ni and Pb than the below-ground organs. The Ni and Pb standing stocks data indicated that the organs of P. australis extracted higher amounts of Ni and Pb per its area from the southern rather than the northern sites. In the current study, the Ni and Pb above-ground standing stocks increased from the early growing season (February) and reached its peak during August and then decreased. The highest monthly Ni and Pb standing stock (18.2 and 18.4 g m⁻ ², respectively) was recorded in the above-ground organs of plants in the southern sites in August. The bioaccumulation factor of Ni was 157.6 and 153.4 in the northern and southern sites, respectively, whereas that of Pb was 175.3 and 158.3. The translocation factor of Ni and Pb from the below- to above-ground organs was generally > 1. Thus, this reed species is a potential candidate for Ni and Pb phytoextraction. Based on our results, P. australis could be used for the extraction of Ni and Pb to reduce the pollution in Lake Burullus, if the above-ground biomass is harvested at its maximum value in August, as was the case regarding the maximum standing stock of Ni and Pb.  aPublisher supplied data  aR.G.P. 2/56/40cthe Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University 3aPhragmites australis 3aaboveground biomass 3abelowground biomass 3abioaccumulation factor 3alakes 3aphytoaccumulation 3asediments 3atoxicology 3awater pollution 3aEgypt1 aShaltout, Kamal H.1 aAl-Sodany, Yassin M.1 aHaroun, Soliman A.1 aGalal, Tarek M.1 aAyed, Hamdi1 aKhedher, Khaled M.1 aJensen, Kai0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2021 Mar., v. 106, no. 3 p.516-527dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03120-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007200140245011100212500001400323500001100337520116900348592002801517596004901545596008701594650003001681650001201711650002301723650001601746650001201762650000901774650002201783650002301805650001301828650002401841650002101865650001101886651001001897700001701907700006601924700002201990700002902012700006102041700006202102700006202164773012202226856007402348852000902422655001202431IND60720993120221120054148.0201222e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072099312DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.127552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmallhorn‐West, Patrick F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6782-370410aCommunity management yields positive impacts for coastal fisheries resources and biodiversity conservation  aNAL-light  aLETTER  aCombining no‐take marine reserves with exclusive access by communities to unreserved waters could provide the required incentives for community management to achieve positive impacts. However, few protected areas have been critically evaluated for their impact, which involves applying counterfactual thinking to predict conditions within protected areas if management had never occurred. Here, we use statistical matching to conduct a rigorous impact evaluation of dual management systems on coral reef fishes in Tonga, with communities having both full no‐take areas and areas of exclusive fishing rights. No‐take areas generally had positive impacts on the species richness, biomass, density, and size of target reef fish, while exclusive access areas were similar to predicted counterfactual conditions. The latter is likely because overall fishing pressure in exclusive access areas might not actually change, although more fish could be exploited by communities with access rights. Our findings suggest that dual management is effective at incentivizing effective community‐based no‐take areas for biodiversity conservation and resource management.  aPublisher supplied data  aCP‐137ER‐17cNational Geographic Society  cAustralian Research Council Centre for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies: CE0561435 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiomass 3aconservation areas 3acoral reefs 3adensity 3afish 3afishery resources 3amanagement systems 3apressure 3aresource management 3aspecies richness 3ayields 3aTonga1 aStone, Karen1 aCeccarelli, Daniela M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8067-87161 aMalimali, Siola'a1 aHalafihi, Tu'ikolongahau1 aBridge, Tom C.

In this study, two AMFs (Rhizophagus intraradices and Funneliformis mosseae) substantially increased the biomass of bashfulgrass in Zn-contaminated soil, even at Zn levels of up to 600 mg kg⁻¹. Zn uptake in R. intraradices- and F. mosseae-mycorrhizal bashfulgrass was increased by 40-fold and 7-fold, respectively, when plants grown in Zn-contaminated (400 mg kg⁻¹) soil. Elemental analysis showed that neither AMF had an effect on Zn concentration in plant tissues, including the roots and shoots. However, a significant increase of phosphorus (P) concentration was observed, suggesting the increased is from the improved use efficiency of soil nutrients by AMFs. Comparing the two AMFs, better growth performance with more biomass occurred with R. intraradices-inoculated bashfulgrass in Zn-contaminated soil. This is consistent with R. intraradices being more tolerant to Zn than F. mosseae, indicated by a higher colonization percentage in bashfulgrass roots. Taken together, our data indicate that AMFs possibly improve acquisition and translocation of P to promote increased biomass. Moreover, mycorrhiza did not enhance Zn accumulation in shoots and roots of bashfulgrass at the same Zn level. In the future, developing AMF (especially R. intraradices) inoculation of plants might be a desirable means of safe production of ornamental plants in metal-polluted soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus mosseae 3aMimosa pudica 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3abiomass 3agrowth performance 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3aphosphorus 3arisk 3asoil pollution 3atoxicology 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3azinc1 aZhang, Jiahao1 aWei, Qingpeng1 aWang, Ying1 aQin, Chun1 aHu, Feng1 aChen, Yahua1 aShen, Zhenguo1 aXia, Yan0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2021 Mar., v. 106, no. 3 p.507-515dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03113-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245009300164500001900257520096600276592002801242650001201270650001001282650001301292650002501305650001201330650001001342650002801352650001101380650002601391650001001417650000701427650002301434650001001457650002701467650001801494651001401512700003001526700002001556700002901576700003401605773011801639856007701757852000901834655001201843IND60702829020221120112050.0200719e20200314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070282902DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90303392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraujo, Deyanira 10aSensory Profile and Physico-Chemical Properties of Artisanal Honey from Zulia, Venezuela  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe physico-chemical parameters and the sensory profile were determined in honeys from apiaries of the Mara and Maracaibo of Zulia State (Venezuela). The analysis of variance showed that there were no significant differences in the mean value between apiaries for most of the physicochemical parameters and sensory attributes. The obtained value for pH (3.58–4.08), free acidity (30.9–36.0 meq/kg), lactone acidity (9.0–14.3 meq/kg), total acidity (42.1–46.0 meq/kg), moisture content (19.1–20.0%), diastase activity (8.11–12.7 ºG), colour intensity (41.5–86.6 mm Pfund), hydroxymethylfurfural (15.7–26.0 mg/kg), and electrical conductivity (0.33–0.52 mS/cm) were within the criteria set by international quality regulations. The sensory profile of these honeys is characterized by being amber in colour, with a floral, acid fruit, balsamic and animal odour/aroma, a sweet, slightly acid taste, and by being fluid and of a medium persistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aamber 3aamylases 3aanalysis of variance 3aanimals 3acolor 3aelectrical conductivity 3afruits 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aodors 3apH 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3atraditional technology 3awater content 3aVenezuela1 aRuiz Pérez-Cacho, Pilar 1 aSerrano, Salud 1 aDios-Palomares, Rafaela 1 aGalán-Soldevilla, Hortensia 0 tFoods.g2020 Mar. 14, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90303393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014700166300001600313520180400329592002802133650002502161650001602186650001902202650002002221650001402241650001002255650001302265650001102278650001702289650002102306650001502327650001302342650002902355650001802384650002002402700001902422700001802441700002202459700001802481700001902499700001802518773010302536856008102639852000902720655001202729IND60576574220221120145615.0170804e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057657422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-017-0630-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Zhenzhen12aA comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis at the level of isolated root hair cells reveals new conserved root hair regulatory elements  ap. 641-655.  aKEY MESSAGE: A comparative transcriptomic and genomic analysis between Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max root hair genes reveals the evolution of the expression of plant genes after speciation and whole genome duplication. Our understanding of the conservation and divergence of the expression patterns of genes between plant species is limited by the quality of the genomic and transcriptomic resources available. Specifically, the transcriptomes generated from plant organs are the reflection of the contribution of the different cell types composing the samples weighted by their relative abundances in the sample. These contributions can vary between plant species leading to the generation of datasets which are difficult to compare. To gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of gene transcription in and between plant species, we performed a comparative transcriptomic and genomic analysis at the level of one single plant cell type, the root hair cell, and between two model plants: Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and soybean (Glycine max). These two species, which diverged 90 million years ago, were selected as models based on the large amount of genomic and root hair transcriptomic information currently available. Our analysis revealed in detail the transcriptional divergence and conservation between soybean paralogs (i.e., the soybean genome is the product of two successive whole genome duplications) and between Arabidopsis and soybean orthologs in this single plant cell type. Taking advantage of this evolutionary study, we combined bioinformatics, molecular, cellular and microscopic tools to characterize plant promoter sequences and the discovery of two root hair regulatory elements (RHE1 and RHE2) consistently and specifically active in plant root hair cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aGlycine max 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomics 3amodels 3aplant organs 3apromoter regions 3aroot hairs 3asoybeans 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aPingault, Lise1 aZogli, Prince1 aLangevin, Micaela1 aRech, Niccole1 aFarmer, Andrew1 aLibault, Marc0 tPlant molecular biology.g2017 Aug., v. 94, no. 6 p.641-655dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-017-0630-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011600166300001800282500001900300520149400319592002801813650002501841650002101866650001501887650001701902650002101919650001401940650001501954700002101969700001501990700001502005700001602020700005702036700005702093700005702150700002002207773012902227856008402356852000902440655001202449IND60736168920221120104931.0210504e20210420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073616892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c008792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Si-Yuan10aTwin Nanopipettes for Real-Time Electrochemical Monitoring of Cytoplasmic Microviscosity at a Single-Cell Level  ap. 6831-6838.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCytoplasmic microviscosity (CPMV) plays essential roles in governing the diffusion-mediated cellular processes and has been recognized as a reliable indicator of the cellular response of many diseases and malfunctions. Current CPMV studies are exclusively established by probe-assisted optical methods, which nevertheless necessitate the complicated synthesis and delivery of optical probes into cells and thus the issues of biocompatibility and bio-orthogonality. Using twin nanopipettes integrated with a patch-clamp system, a practical electrochemical single-cell measurement is presented, which is capable of real-time and long-term CPMV detection without cell disruption. Specifically, upon the operation of the twin nanopipettes, the cellular CPMV status, which is correlated to cytoplasmic ionic mobility, could be sensibly transduced via the ionic current passing through the nanosystem. The average CPMV value of HeLa cells was detected as ca. 86 cP. Notably, the correlation between chemotherapy and CPMV alterations makes this approach possible for the real-time and long-term assessment of the evolution of external stimuli, as exemplified by the two natural products taxol and colchicine. Integrated with the patch-clamp setup, this study features the first use of twin nanopipettes for electrochemical CPMV monitoring of single living cells, and it is expected to inspire more interest in the exploitation of dual- and multiple nanopipettes for advanced single-cell analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiocompatibility 3acolchicine 3adrug therapy 3aelectrochemistry 3aevolution 3apaclitaxel1 aZhang, Tian-Yang1 aLiu, Yi-Li1 aSong, Juan1 aHan, De-Man1 aZhao, Wei-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8179-47751 aJiang, Dechen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2845-36211 aXu, Jing-Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9579-93181 aChen, Hong-Yuan0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 93, no. 17 p.6831-6838dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c008793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245007600164300001600240520180400256592002802060650001802088650003802106650002902144650002402173650002002197650002102217650002402238650001902262650001402281650002402295650003802319650002102357650001702378650001802395650001402413650001702427650004302444650001502487653002302502653001802525653000902543700001602552700001802568700001502586773017802601856007902779852000902858655001202867IND60764278120221121020735.0220126e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076427812DNAL7 a10.21273/JASHS05078-212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrystel, Joseph10aNovel Plantibodies Show Promise to Protect Citrus from Greening Disease  ap. 377-386.  aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the bacteria responsible for citrus greening disease [huanglongbing (HLB)], has become a worldwide threat to citrus (Citrus sp.) production. HLB has proven difficult to study and treat because of the complex interactions between CLas, the citrus host, and insect vectors. We have selected for single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies from a specialized bacteriophage library for binding activity against CLas proteins InvA and TolC. Portions of each protein were chosen as antigens based on predicted binding availability and theorized necessary functions in pathogenicity. Binding affinity for individual scFv-expressing clones was confirmed by phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The scFv sequences were stably transformed under the control of a tandem Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 2x35S) promoter by Agrobacterium tumefacien–mediated transformation into ‘Carrizo’ citrange (Citrus sinensis × Poncirus trifoliate), a citrus rootstock cultivar. Replicated plants of single transformations were inoculated by infestation with CLas positive asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), a CLas vector. Inoculation and disease progression was monitored through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Inoculated transgenic plants showed significantly reduced CLas titer compared with wild types. A subpopulation of transgenic plants displayed no measurable surviving bacteria after 12 months. Interestingly, individual replicated plants from the same transgenic events strongly segregated into two populations by resistance phenotype: a minority that were indistinguishable from wild-type plants and a majority that were highly resistant. Our results are the first step in developing a novel protection strategy for HLB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium 3aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aCitroncirus webberi 3aCitrus sinensis 3aDiaphorina citri 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3abacteriophages 3acultivars 3adisease progression 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agreening disease 3ahorticulture 3apathogenicity 3aphenotype 3aplantibodies 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arootstocks 0adisease resistance 0ahuanglongbing 0ascFv1 aLiu, Huawei1 aHartung, John1 aStover, Ed0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2021 Nov., v. 146, no. 6 p.377-386dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl27747x2327-97887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS05078-213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01596naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015100157300002000308520036700328592002800695650001600723650001400739650001900753650001500772650002300787650001100810650002800821650001300849650001900862650003700881700001800918700001500936700001300951700001400964700001300978773012400991856007401115852000901189655001201198IND60668940820221119122727.0190920e20150727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066894082DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra07275a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagasawa, Y.10aAerobic photooxidative synthesis of 2-aryl-4-quinazolinones from aromatic aldehydes and aminobenzamide using catalytic amounts of molecular iodine  ap. 63952-63954.  aThis study reports a safe, mild, and environmentally benign synthetic method toward 2-aryl-4-quinazolinones from aromatic aldehydes and aminobenzamides through a cyclization–oxidation sequence using a catalytic amount of iodine, which serves as both a Lewis acid and an oxidant, harmless visible light irradiation, and molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aaldehydes 3aaminobenzoates 3abenzamides 3acatalytic activity 3aiodine 3anitroaromatic compounds 3aoxidants 3aphotooxidation 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aMatsusaki, Y.1 aNobuta, T.1 aTada, N.1 aMiura, T.1 aItoh, A.0 tRSC advances.g2015 July 27, v. 5, no. 78 p.63952-63954dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra07275a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011800165300001600283500001500299520136400314592002801678650002501706650002101731650002601752650001901778650002401797650002101821650001701842650001301859650002401872650002201896650001901918650003301937650001801970650000901988650003001997650002702027650002502054650002102079653001602100653001802116653001802134653001902152653001702171700001902188700002902207700002402236700001902260700005802279700001902337773012002356856008102476852000902557655001202566IND60524973520221120033433.0190318e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052497352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafsa, Jawhar10aPhysical, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of chitosan films containing Eucalyptus globulus essential oil  ap. 356-364.  a2019-12-06  aIn this work active films from chitosan containing Eucalyptus globulus (EG) essential oil (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4% (v/v)) were developed by casting and solvent-evaporation method. Then, the physical properties, the total phenolic content, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of different films were assessed, to define if the chitosan films incorporated with EG essential oil could be used as natural active films for food use. The antioxidant activity was determined with three different analytical assays (DPPH, NO and H2O2). The agar disc diffusion method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. In fact, incorporating EG essential oil into chitosan-based films significantly decreases moisture content and water-solubility. These results can be explained by the films microstructure, which was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The antioxidant properties proved to be significantly enhanced with increasing EG essential oil concentration. The microbiological assessment confirmed antimicrobial efficiency of chitosan films EG containing essential oil.

Numerical modeling of the GSHP system with horizontal ground heat exchangers operating in heating (1.4 kW) mode was carried out for a room, with 9.68 m² floor area, located in Bolu, Turkey. The GSHP simulation model is studied. The codes are written in the MATLAB program for solving the equations obtained from the model developed for the city of Bolu. In this program, additionally, state equations of cooling fluids, which calculate the thermodynamic properties of these fluids, are required. In literature, there are only state equations depending on many coefficients for R12, R22, and R502. So, state equations and table values of ASHRAE of R12, R22, and R502 are used in order to obtain the properties of R134a, R404a, and R410a by using the curve fitting method. The results show that COP values for R134a refrigerant are 3.33 and 3.28 for MATLAB program and Solkane Refrigerant Software program, respectively. The difference on COP was 0.05, i.e. approximately 1.52%. The results obtained from MATLAB program indicate that there was good agreement between Solkane Refrigerant Software program and MATLAB program.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aequations 3aheat exchangers 3aheat pumps 3arenewable energy sources 3asimulation models 3athermodynamics 3aTurkey (country) 0aGround source heat pump 0aGround heat exchanger 0aMathematical modeling 0aSimulation1 aBulut, Murat1 aSozbir, Nedim0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Nov., v. 83 p.352-361dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013000163300002000293520105500313592002801368650002501396650001501421650003201436650002001468650001301488650002101501650002901522650000701551650001901558650001301577650001501590650001401605650002901619650001101648650001301659650001101672700001601683700001301699700001601712700001701728700001901745700001701764700001801781700001701799700001701816773014901833856008101982852000902063655001202072IND60547764720221117041325.0170725e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054776472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6730-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Xiaole10aEffect of photosynthetically elevated pH on performance of surface flow-constructed wetland planted with Phragmites australis  ap. 15524-15531.  aCombination of emergent and submerged plants has been proved to be able to enhance pollutant removal efficiency of surface flow-constructed wetland (SFCW) during winter. However, intensive photosynthesis of submerged plants during summer would cause pH increase, which may have adverse effects on emergent plants. In this study, nitrogen transformation of lab-scale SFCW under pH gradient of 7.5, 8.5, 9.5 and 10.5 was systematically investigated. The results showed that total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency decreased from 76.3 ± 0.04 to 51.8 ± 0.04 % when pH increased from 7.5 to 10.5, which was mainly attributed to plant assimilation decay and inhibition of microbe activities (i.e., nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and denitrifiers). Besides, the highest sediment adsorption in SFCW was observed at pH of 8.5. In general, the combination of submerged and emergent plants is feasible for most of the year, but precaution should be taken to mitigate the negative effect of high alkaline conditions when pH rises to above 8.5 in midsummer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aadsorption 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aemergent plants 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3aplanting 3apollutants 3asediments 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3asummer 3awetlands 3awinter1 aZhang, Jian1 aHu, Zhen1 aXie, Huijun1 aGuo, Wenshan1 aWang, Qingsong1 aNgo, Huu Hao1 aLiang, Shuang1 aLu, Shaoyong1 aWu, Weizhong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Aug., v. 23, no. 15 p.15524-15531dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6730-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012900164300001600293520114600309592002801455650001801483650002301501650002901524650001601553650004301569650002501612650002201637650001401659650002201673650001601695650001301711650001101724650001501735653002101750653002301771653002701794653001801821653002401839700002101863700007301884773012001957856008102077852000902158655001202167IND60524973720221119235553.0190318e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052497372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMingo, Elisa10aSelective antibacterial effect on Campylobacter of a winemaking waste extract (WWE) as a source of active phenolic compounds  ap. 418-424.  aThe feasibility of winemaking waste (WW) as source of active phenolic compounds against Campylobacter was evaluated using a mixture of ethanol-water (50% v/v) as extraction solvent. The winemaking waste extract (WWE) was active against all the strains tested, and most of them were inhibited at WWE concentrations between 40 and 100 mg GAE/L. However, different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were practically unaffected by WWE, suggesting a selective antibacterial effect of WWE against Campylobacter. The fractioning and phenolic characterization of WWE using HPLC-MS showed that catechins and proanthocyanidins were the main compounds involved in the antibacterial effect. Among them, the structural verification using pure phenolic standards showed that epicatechin gallate and resveratrol were the most active compounds against Campylobacter. We conclude that the study of the main mechanisms involved in the antibacterial activity against Campylobacter of epicatechin gallate, resveratrol, and other related compounds presenting gallate side-chain, can contribute for future design of useful antibacterials against this pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aactive ingredients 3aantibacterial properties 3aepicatechin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alactic acid bacteria 3amass spectrometry 3apathogens 3aproanthocyanidins 3aresveratrol 3asolvents 3awastes 3awinemaking 0aWinemaking waste 0aPhenolic compounds 0aAntibacterial activity 0aCampylobacter 0aEpicatechin gallate1 aSilván, Jose M.1 aMartinez-Rodriguez, Adolfo J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6140-07320 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 May, v. 68 p.418-424dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012400165300001600289520182500305592002802130650002402158650002002182650001302202650001202215650001402227650001002241650001002251650002402261650002002285650001102305650000902316650001802325650002402343650002302367650002002390650003102410650001902441650001202460653001802472653001402490653001702504653002802521653002902549653001702578700002602595700001902621700001802640700002102658773012702679856004802806852000902854655001202863IND50075400820140410000000.0140410e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007540082DNAL7 a10.1080/036503409032967852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinha, Arpita10aOptimizing organic and mineral amendments to jatropha seed cake to increase its agronomic utility as organic fertilizer  ap. 193-222.  aThe agronomic utility of an organic residue, jatropha cake (Jc) was assessed according to the NPK requirement of selected crops. Fertilizer combinations were made by mixing jatropha cake (Jc), bone meal (Bm), tobacco dust (Td) and inorganic supplements ammonium Bi-carbonate (NH₄HCO₃), dicalcium phosphate (CaHPO₄ · (H₂O)₂) and potassium chloride (KCl). The effects of combinations on the chemical and biological properties of soil and the growth of Jatropha curcas (used for non-edible oil or biofuel) and Cymbopogon martinii (essential aromatic oil used for anti septic, anti viral, bactericide, cytophylactic, digestive, febrifuge and hydrating properties) were studied. The combination of Jc with other residues turned it into an appropriate soil amendment to increase soil fertility. Utilization of these residues can also solve disposal related issues of these residues. Jc + CaHPO₄ · (H₂O)₂ + KCl, Jc + Bm + Td, Jc + Bm and Jc + Td were most efficient combinations in terms of increasing soil fertility and growth of J. curcas and C. martinii. Most optimal organic combination of Jc + Bm + Td provided 182.4 kg N ha⁻¹, 102.8 kg P ha⁻¹ & 50 kg K ha⁻¹ for J. curcas and 83.7 kg N ha⁻¹, 19.8 kg P ha⁻¹, 33.1 kg K ha⁻¹ for C. martinii. The fertilizer combination gave significantly highest increase of 1.78 and 5.79 mg N g⁻¹, 14.12 and 10.3 mg P g⁻¹, 9.38 and 26.40 mg K g⁻¹ and 9.06 and 4.42 mg C g⁻¹ of experimental soils of J. curcas and C. martini, respectively. The combination also increased the extractable micronutrient content and soil enzymatic activity. Total plant biomass increased 5.9 and 10.5 times higher to control due to Jc + Bm + Td fertilizer combination in test crops of J. curcas and C. martini, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbopogon martinii 3aJatropha curcas 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abone meal 3acakes 3acrops 3adicalcium phosphate 3aenzyme activity 3amixing 3aoils 3aoilseed cakes 3aorganic fertilizers 3apotassium chloride 3asoil amendments 3asoil biological properties 3asoil fertility 3atobacco 0ajatropha cake 0abone meal 0atobacco dust 0afertilizer combinations 0amicrobial biomass carbon 0asoil enzymes1 aSrivastava, Pankaj K.1 aSingh, Nandita1 aSharma, P.

Itrana) processed as green (Oliva Bianca di Itri) and black (Oliva di Gaeta) table olives, according to the Method for the sensory analysis of table olives of International Olive Council. The sensory attributes evaluated were: a) negative sensations or defects (abnormal fermentations and other defects as butyric, putrid and zapateria, winey-vinegary, soapy, metallic, cooking effects, rancid, musty and earthy defects); b) gustatory sensations (salty, bitter, acid) and c) kinaesthetic sensations (hardness, fibrousness, crunchiness). Multivariate statistical analysis has been used to identify similarities and differences between defected and un-defected samples. We carried out the Principal Component Analysis on two data sets: the first data-set included all sensory parameters (data-set A), while the second data-set did not include abnormal fermentation and other defects (data-set B). The occurrence of negative sensations have a negative impact on gustative and kinaesthetic attributes. The samples classified as “Extra or Fancy” but with intensity of defect >1.0 are more similar to defected samples, also not considering the defects as discriminant parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3acooking 3acultivars 3adata collection 3afermentation 3ahardness 3amultivariate analysis 3aolives 3aprincipal component analysis 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3ataste 0aSensory analysis 0aTable olives 0aTexture 0aAbnormal fermentations 0aDefects1 aAmoruso, Filomena0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 May, v. 68 p.365-372dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245011900208300002000327500001900347520135600366592002801722650001701750650001101767650002101778650002001799650001901819650002401838653003101862653001701893653001901910653002301929653002601952700005201978700005902030700005402089773014602143856008502289852000902374655001202383IND60720887320221119174517.0201221e20201208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072088732DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c078632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSha, Xin-Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6816-143110aDevelopment and Mechanism of High-Performance Fully Biobased Shape Memory Benzoxazine Resins with a Green Strategy  ap. 18696-18705.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeveloping high-performance fully biobased shape memory thermosets with a green strategy is a challenging topic of great interest. Herein, two unique fully biobased benzoxazine resins with excellent shape memory properties, denoted as poly(IE-dea) and poly(G-dea), were developed by synthesizing two fully biobased benzoxazine monomers (IE-dea and G-dea) using a solvent-free method. The thermal, mechanical, and shape memory properties of poly(IE-dea) and poly(G-dea) were studied. Among the fully biobased shape memory polymers reported so far, poly(IE-dea) and poly(G-dea) have the highest glass transition temperatures (138 and 216 °C), initial thermal decomposition temperatures (340 and 347 °C), and tensile strengths (85.1 ± 2.5 and 65.9 ± 2.7 MPa). In addition, poly(IE-dea) and poly(G-dea) exhibit excellent shape memory properties. After four shape memory cycles, their shape fixity ratios are 97.7–98.0% and 96.7–97.2%, respectively, and their shape recovery ratios are 96.7–97.2% and 93.0–93.4%. In fact, they are the first two fully neat biobased shape memory benzoxazine resins up-to-date. The mechanism behind the excellent integrated performances of poly(IE-dea) and poly(G-dea) results from unique integrated actions of the flexible decane segment and rigid cross-linked structure from the polymerization of oxazine rings.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adecane 3aglass transition 3agreen chemistry 3apolymerization 3athermal degradation 0aFully biobased benzoxazine 0aShape memory 0aGreen strategy 0aThermal properties 0aMechanical properties1 aYuan, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2059-52351 aLiang, Guozheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9690-79311 aGu, Aijuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2235-10180 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 08, v. 8, no. 50 p.18696-18705dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c078633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245015500161500001900316520156100335592002801896650002301924650002401947650000801971650001201979650001901991650001802010650001702028650001402045650004102059650001902100650001302119650001702132650001402149700001302163700002102176700001902197700001602216700002002232773011802252856007702370852000902447655001202456IND60702829620221120122603.0200719e20200316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070282962DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90303452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Jun-Yu 10aToxicity and Synergistic Effect of Elsholtzia ciliata Essential Oil and Its Main Components against the Adult and Larval Stages of Tribolium castaneum  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInvestigations have indicated that storage pests pose a great threat to global food security by damaging food crops and other food products derived from plants. Essential oils are proven to have significant effects on a large number of stored grain insects. This study evaluated the contact toxicity and fumigant activity of the essential oil extract from the aerial parts of Elsholtzia ciliata and its two major biochemical components against adults and larvae of the food storage pest beetle Tribolium castaneum. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis revealed 16 different components derived from the essential oil of E. ciliata, which included carvone (31.63%), limonene (22.05%), and α-caryophyllene (15.47%). Contact toxicity assay showed that the essential oil extract exhibited a microgram-level of killing activity against T. castaneum adults (lethal dose 50 (LD₅₀) = 7.79 μg/adult) and larvae (LD₅₀ = 24.87 μg/larva). Fumigant toxicity assay showed LD₅₀ of 11.61 mg/L air for adults and 8.73 mg/L air for larvae. Carvone and limonene also exhibited various levels of bioactivity. A binary mixture (2:6) of carvone and limonene displayed obvious contact toxicity against T. castaneum adults (LD₅₀ = 10.84 μg/adult) and larvae (LD₅₀ = 30.62 μg/larva). Furthermore, carvone and limonene exhibited synergistic fumigant activity against T. castaneum larvae at a 1:7 ratio. Altogether, our results suggest that E. ciliata essential oil and its two monomers have a potential application value to eliminate T. castaneum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElsholtzia ciliata 3aTribolium castaneum 3aair 3acarvone 3aessential oils 3afood security 3afood storage 3afumigants 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3alethal dose 50 3alimonene 3astored grain 3asynergism1 aXu, Jie 1 aYang, Ying-Ying 1 aShao, Ya-Zhou 1 aZhou, Feng 1 aWang, Jun-Long 0 tFoods.g2020 Mar. 16, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90303453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010100168300001600269520123600285592002801521650002701549650001801576650002101594650001501615650001001630650001601640650001701656650002201673650002701695650001701722650001001739650001101749650000901760650002401769653001701793653002201810653001501832653001601847653001701863653003701880700002901917773012701946856004802073852000902121655001202130IND50075401020140410000000.0140410e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007540102DNAL7 a10.1080/036503409032968012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChander, Krishan10aSoil microorganisms and the growth of Lupinus albus on a high metal soil in the presence of EDTA  ap. 115-126.  aA pot experiment was designed with the objective of determining whether the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and the resulting mobilization of heavy metals have any affect on: (i) soil microorganisms, (ii) growth of L. albus, and (iii) microbial colonization of roots. There was no effect of the different treatments on the contents of soil microbial biomass C and microbial biomass N. Increasing addition of EDTA to soil led to proportionate increases in extractable C and N, being roughly equivalent to the added amount. Increasing EDTA addition to soil led also to a proportionate increase in mobile heavy metals. Plant height, total amount of shoot and root C were not affected by EDTA addition. Fungal ergosterol in the lupine roots showed a 5- to 8-fold increase in the 0.1 and 0.2% EDTA treatments in comparison with the control. In contrast, EDTA addition did not affect fungal glucosamine or bacterial muramic acid concentrations in the lupine roots. Increasing EDTA addition to soil led also to a proportionate increase in the metal concentrations in the lupine shoots. The concentrations of heavy metals in the lupine shoots and in the NH₄NO₃ soil extracts were all highly significantly correlated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aLupinus albus 3aammonium nitrate 3aergosterol 3afungi 3aglucosamine 3aheavy metals 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial colonization 3amuramic acid 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 0aheavy metals 0amicrobial biomass 0aergosterol 0aglucosamine 0amuramic acid 0achelate-assisted phytoextraction1 aJoergensen, Rainer Georg0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 57, no. 2 p.115-126dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340903296801  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012000168300002000288500001900308520073700327592002801064650002001092650002201112650001801134650002901152650001301181650002401194653004301218653002201261653002201283653003101305653003001336700002001366700001801386700002201404700005801426700002101484773014601505856008501651852000901736655001201745IND60720887420221119174448.0201221e20201209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072088742DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c078972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyd, Robert10aMalonamide-Functionalized Ionic Liquid for Recovery of Rare-Earth Metals from End-Of-Life Products (Lamp Phosphors)  ap. 18706-18711.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel functionalized ionic liquid, namely, malonamide-functionalized ionic liquid (MFIL) was synthesized and evaluated for the liquid–liquid extraction of rare-earth metals (REMs), transition, and other base metals from a hydrochloric acid medium. Theoretical calculations coupled with FT-IR studies were used to establish the mode of complexation between metal ions and the extracting moiety of MFIL. Uptake studies with multimetal feed solutions showed very good selectivity for REMs over other transition and base metals. Quantitative back extraction of REMs from loaded MFIL was accomplished using an acidic solution. MFIL showed preferential uptake of REMs over base and transition metals typically found in lamp phosphors.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrochloric acid 3aionic liquids 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amoieties 3arare earth elements 0amalonamide-functionalized ionic liquid 0arare-earth metals 0atransition metals 0aliquid−liquid extraction 0aphosphonium ionic liquids1 aCarroll, Ciaran1 aDandil, Sahra1 aAcikgoz, Caglayan1 aRuhela, Ritesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4908-69281 aNockemann, Peter0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 09, v. 8, no. 50 p.18706-18711dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c078973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245011600161520131700277592002801594650001901622650001501641650001201656650002001668650002201688650000901710700001901719700002001738700002001758700001901778773012101797856007601918852000901994655001202003IND60757624020221120110815.0211125e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075762402DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111130482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiana, Alessia 12aA Systematic Review of the Use of Technology to Monitor Welfare in Zoo Animals: Is There Space for Improvement?  aA top priority of modern zoos is to ensure good animal welfare (AW), thus, efforts towards improving AW monitoring are increasing. Welfare assessments are performed through more traditional approaches by employing direct observations and time-consuming data collection that require trained specialists. These limitations may be overcome through automated monitoring using wearable or remotely placed sensors. However, in this fast-developing field, the level of automated AW monitoring used in zoos is unclear. Hence, the aim of this systematic literature review was to investigate research conducted on the use of technology for AW assessment in zoos with a focus on real-time automated monitoring systems. The search led to 19 publications with 18 of them published in the last six years. Studies focused on mammals (89.5%) with elephant as the most studied species followed by primates. The most used technologies were camera (52.6%) and wearable sensors (31.6%) mainly used to measure behaviour, while the use of algorithms was reported in two publications only. This research area is still young in zoos and mainly focused on large mammals. Despite an increase in publications employing automated AW monitoring in the last years, the potential for this to become an extra useful tool needs further research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aautomation 3acameras 3adata collection 3asystematic review 3azoos1 aSalas, Marina 1 aPereboom, Zjef 1 aMendl, Michael 1 aNorton, Tomas 0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111130483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03561naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011500166300002000281520106500301592002801366596008301394596008401477596006801561596009601629596009601725596009801821596012301919650001802042650001402060650002102074650001802095650001602113650001402129650001602143650001802159650002302177650001902200650002402219653001602243653001202259653001502271653001202286653001402298653002002312700001502332700001802347700002302365700006102388700002302449700005902472700006202531700006202593700006302655773014102718856007902859852000902938655001202947IND60778349120221120152302.0220525e20220511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077834912DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c036522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanev, Teodor K.10aDirect Patterning of Optoelectronic Nanostructures Using Encapsulated Layered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides  ap. 23775-23784.  aDirect top-down nanopatterning of semiconductors is a powerful tool for engineering properties of optoelectronic devices. Translating this approach to two-dimensional semiconductors such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is challenging because of both the small scales required for confinement and the degradation of electronic and optical properties caused by high-energy and high-dose electron radiation used for high-resolution top-down direct electron beam patterning. We show that encapsulating a TMD monolayer with hexagonal boron nitride preserves the narrow exciton linewidths and emission intensity typical in such heterostructures after electron beam lithography, allowing direct patterning of functional optical monolayer nanostructures on scales of a few tens of nanometers. We leverage this fabrication method to study size-dependent effects on nanodot arrays of MoS₂ and MoSe₂ as well as laterally confined electrical transport devices, demonstrating the potential of top-down lithography for nanoscale TMD optoelectronics.  aPublisher supplied data  aN00014-16-1-3055cOffice of Naval Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000006  aDMR-1929356cDivision of Materials Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000078  aNAcNorthwestern Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007059  a19H05790cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a21H05233cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aJP20H00354cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aJPMXP0112101001cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001700 3aboron nitride 3aelectrons 3aemissions factor 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3aengineers 3amethodology 3ananomaterials 3aoptical properties 3asemiconductors 3atransition elements 0ananopattern 0aquantum 0apatterning 0adefects 0amonolayer 0adichalcogenides1 aLiu, Pufan1 aZeng, Hongfei1 aLenferink, Erik J.1 aMurthy, Akshay A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7677-68661 aSpeiser, Nathaniel1 aWatanabe, Kenji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3701-81191 aTaniguchi, Takashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1467-31051 aDravid, Vinayak P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6007-30631 aStern, Nathaniel P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8903-35160 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 May 11, v. 14, no. 20 p.23775-23784dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c036523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04090naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245012200158300002000280520135900300592002801659596009801687596011001785596010101895596010101996596007902097596007902176596007902255596009002334596009702424650001702521650002402538650001002562650001802572650001002590650001302600650001002613650001302623650001202636650001202648650001402660650001502674650000902689650001302698650002102711650001402732650001802746650001402764650001402778653003202792653001702824653001802841653002602859653002602885700001602911700001902927700005202946700001602998700001603014700001703030700001803047700001703065700005703082773014103139856007903280852000903359655001203368IND60778349220221120152413.0220525e20220511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077834922DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c036842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Jian10aPrevent Drug Leakage via the Boronic Acid Glucose-Insensitive Micelle for Alzheimer’s Disease Combination Treatment  ap. 23182-23193.  aBoronic acid (BA) materials have been widely applied to glucose and oxidative stress-sensitive drug delivery for the treatment of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). There are completely various BA-sensitive delivery conditions in different diseases. BA materials in the treatment of diabetes show better performance at a high-glucose environment than normal. In contrast, the concentration of glucose in the brain is much lower than that in the blood of AD patients. Hence, the typical glucose and oxidative stress dual-sensitive BA materials inevitably encounter drug leakage in circulation in AD. Attempts to decrease the glucose-sensitive capacity of BA materials are extremely essential for AD drug delivery. In this study, the epoxy group (electron-donating group) was introduced to increase the pKₐ values of BA materials by increasing the electron cloud density, and thus, the glucose-insensitive micelle (GIM) was obtained. The treatment effect and the synergism mechanism of the drug-loaded GIM micelle were studied on senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 mice. This work provided excellent antioxidant drugs (vitamin E succinate, melatonin, and quercetin) and a glucose metabolism drug (insulin) loaded in GIM micelle for AD treatment. The discovery of the combination mechanism is enormously valuable for AD clinical research.  aPublisher supplied data  a51773152cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aIRT-17R80cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  a18JCQNJC73700cNatural Science Foundation of Tianjin Citydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006606  a18JCYBJC17500cNatural Science Foundation of Tianjin Citydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006606  a15JCYBJC17900cScience and Technology Plans of Tianjindhttps://doi.org/NA  a18JCYBJC18100cScience and Technology Plans of Tianjindhttps://doi.org/NA  a18PTSYJC00180cScience and Technology Plans of Tianjindhttps://doi.org/NA  a2019YJSB195cTianjin Postgraduate Research and Innovation Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA  aTD13-5044cProgram for Innovative Research Team in University of Tianjindhttps://doi.org/NA 3aantioxidants 3abiomedical research 3ablood 3aboronic acids 3abrain 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3aepoxides 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3amelatonin 3ametabolism 3amice 3amicelles 3aoxidative stress 3aquercetin 3asuccinic acid 3asynergism 3avitamin E 0aglucose-insensitive micelle 0adrug leakage 0aself-assembly 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0acombination treatment1 aHu, Haodong1 aWang, Shaoteng1 aHe, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0695-80391 aJi, Yanhong1 aChen, Yiran1 aWang, Kangna1 aZhang, Haiyan1 aZhao, Yiping1 aDai, Fengying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8593-21970 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 May 11, v. 14, no. 20 p.23182-23193dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c036843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245009600209300001800305520133800323592002801661650002501689650001401714650001701728650001901745650001901764650002101783650001501804650000901819650001901828650002001847700007101867700002101938700006501959773017102024856008002195852000902275655001202284IND60743245420221119073010.0210707e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074324542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c013322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobosz, Kerianne M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4042-539910aRobust, Small Diameter Hydrophilic Nanofibers Improve the Flux of Ultrafiltration Membranes  ap. 9179-9188.  aIn this study, we systematically investigated the flux performance of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes functionalized with randomly accumulated nanofibers. By electrospinning nanofibers from hydrophobic polysulfone (PSf) and hydrophilic cellulose (CL), we were able to explore the role that the bulk nanofiber (NF) layer thickness, individual NF diameter, and intrinsic chemistry play in composite membrane flux. Additional parameters that we systematically tested include the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the base membrane (10, 100, and 200 kDa), flow orientation (cross-flow versus dead-end), and the feed solution (hydrophilic water versus hydrophobic oil). Structurally, the crosslinked PSf nanofibers were more robust than the CL nanofibers, which lead to the PSfNF-UF membranes having a greater flux performance. To decouple the structural robustness from the water affinity of the fibers, we chemically modified the PSf fibers to be hydrophilic and, indeed, the flux of these new composite membranes featuring hydrophilic crosslinked nanofibers was superior. In summary, the greatest increase in flux performance arises from the smallest diameter, hydrophilic nanofibers that are mechanically robust (crosslinked). We have demonstrated that electrospun nanofibers improve the flux performance of ultrafiltration membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3acellulose 3acrosslinking 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3aoils 3aprocess design 3aultrafiltration1 aKuo-Leblanc, Christopher A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1112-24361 aBowden, Jared W.1 aSchiffman, Jessica D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1265-53920 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 June 17, v. 60, no. 25 p.9179-9188dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c013323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008800161300002000249520125000269592002801519650002301547650001601570650002201586650001701608650002301625650002601648650002701674650001601701650001701717650001801734650002101752650001101773650001501784650001201799650002501811650001801836700001401854700001701868700001301885700001201898700002601910700001401936773012501950856007402075852000902149655001202158IND60668941620221119122933.0190920e20151007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066894162DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra07329d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liangxiao10aOne-class classification based authentication of peanut oils by fatty acid profiles  ap. 85046-85051.  aDeveloping a method of identifying oil authenticity is becoming critical for protecting customers' rights as adulteration of edible oils is a particular concern in food quality. Since adulterants in edible oils are usually unknown, the authenticity identification is a one-class classification problem in chemometrics. In this study, a one-class classification model was built to identify the authenticity of peanut oils by fatty acid profiles. Based on previous studies, 28 fatty acids were identified and quantified for peanut oils. The authenticity identification model was built by one-class partial least squares (OCPLS) classifier for peanut oils. Subsequently, the established model was validated by independent test sets. The results indicated that the OCPLS classifier could effectively detect adulterated oils and was therefore employed for authenticity assessment. Moreover, counterfeit oils adulterated with different levels of other edible oils were simulated by the Monte Carlo method and employed to test the lowest adulteration level of this one-class classifier. As a result, the model could identify peanut oils and sensitively detect adulteration of edible oils with other vegetable oils at adulteration level of more than 4%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadulterants 3aadulterated foods 3achemometrics 3aconsumers (people) 3acooking fats and oils 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3afood quality 3aleast squares 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apeanut oil 3apeanuts 3aproduct authenticity 3avegetable oil1 aLi, Peiwu1 aSun, Xiaoman1 aMao, Jin1 aMa, Fei1 aTeng, Sandy Xiao Xia,1 aZhang, Qi0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 07, v. 5, no. 103 p.85046-85051dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra07329d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013600168300001600304520185600320592002802176650001302204650001902217650001802236650002602254650001102280650001402291650001902305650001902324650002402343650002202367650001702389650002202406650001602428650001602444651001802460653002202478653002802500653001902528653002202547653001902569700001902588700001502607700001602622700001702638773011802655856008702773852000902860655001202869IND60614777420221118123708.0181015e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061477742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Weijia10aFactors affecting relative humidity and its relationship with the long-term variation of fog-haze events in the Yangtze River Delta  ap. 242-250.  aRelative humidity (RH) is one of the most important parameters in the study of fog-haze. This paper first estimates the contributions of the key quantities (temperature, water vapor, air pollutant) and their combinations to the relative change of RH, and then investigates the relationships of RH with the long-term variation of haze and fog days based on the meteorological data in the Yangtze River Delta over the period 1970–2010. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) Temperature is the foremost factor influencing RH, with the effect of specific humidity and direct contribution of air pollutant being second and third. (2) RH shows a prominent descending trend in the Yangtze River Delta, due to global warming and the ‘analogous heat island effect’ (AHIE). (3) Decreasing RH was responsible for the reduction of fog days. The AHIE can explain the phenomenon in which fog days in metropolises are less than in small cities. (4) Granger causality analysis of inter-annual variation further shows that increasing aerosol loading Ganger-causes the increasing haze days, rather than meteorological parameters such as RH. High RH would enhance hygroscopic growth of particle and then suppress the planet boundary layer height (PBLH) and lead to more haze days, lower PBLH further increases aerosols and RH, this positive feedback mechanism can be established under the condition of aerosol loading being relatively stable and beyond the threshold for haze formation. (5) If aerosol emissions maintain the status quo, climate cooling would result in serious fog-haze events occurring more frequently in Yangtze River Delta. The research provide a scientific basis for understanding the influence of meteorological factors on RH and the connection between the variation of long term fog-haze days and RH under the background of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acities 3aemissions 3aglobal cooling 3aglobal warming 3ameteorological data 3arelative humidity 3ariver deltas 3aspecific humidity 3atemperature 3awater vapor 3aYangtze River 0aRelative humidity 0aContribution efficiency 0aImpact factors 0aFog and haze days 0aClimate change1 aHan, Yongxiang1 aLi, Jiaxin1 aTian, Xinru1 aLiu, Yangang0 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 Nov., v. 193 p.242-250dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245015100162500001900313520156200332592002801894650001601922650001601938650002101954650001401975650002001989650002602009650001102035650001602046700001102062700002802073773011802101856007702219852000902296655001202305IND60702830020221116225046.0200719e20200410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070283002DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90404762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCullere, Marco 10aFat Inclusion Level, NaCl Content and LAB Starter Cultures in the Manufacturing of Italian-Type Ostrich Salami: Weight Loss and Nutritional Traits  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe experiment studied the effect of two different fat inclusion levels (30% and 40%), NaCl contents (2.4 and 2.6%) and starter cultures (lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 6: L. curvatus/S. xylosus; LAB 8: L. sakei/S. xylosus) on the weight loss and nutritional composition of Italian-type ostrich salami. With this purpose, 8 batches of 9 salami each (n = 72) were prepared. Salami were ripened for 20 weeks: weight loss was monitored throughout the experiment, while salami nutritional composition was evaluated at 10 and 20 weeks of ripening. The lowest fat and highest salt inclusion levels provided the highest cumulative weight loss throughout the trial. At 10 weeks of ripening, salami with 40% fat were the richest in moisture and fat, whereas the leanest ones had the highest protein, ash and cholesterol contents. LAB 6 provided salami with the highest moisture and protein, while LAB 8 increased fat and cholesterol contents. At 20 weeks of ripening the proximate composition of ostrich salami was solely affected by fat inclusion level, with similar findings to those observed at 10 weeks. Overall, fat inclusion level had a great impact on the weight loss and nutritional composition of Italian-style ostrich salami. Reducing the NaCl inclusion from 2.6% to 2.4%, the weight loss of ostrich salami was retarded by approximately 1 week, without affecting the nutritional composition of the final product. Results of the study suggested that it is feasible to produce salami with lower fat and salt contents, while ensuring satisfactory product quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3alactic acid 3anutrient content 3aostriches 3aproduct quality 3aproximate composition 3asalami 3aweight loss1 aYambo,1 aDalle Zotte, Antonella 0 tFoods.g2020 Apr. 10, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90404763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245009000158300001400248520121000262592002801472653001301500653001501513653001401528653002401542653001701566700001501583700001801598700001701616773012601633856008101759852000901840655001201849IND60764279020221119054824.0220126e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076427902DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTSCI16122-212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yan10aPloidy Level, Karyotype, and Genome Size of Bletilla Species (Orchidaceae) From China  ap. 48-55.  aBletilla is an Orchidaceae genus with high medical value, including detumescence, antibacterial, and hemostasis. In this study, detailed estimates of ploidy level, karyotype, and genome size were first obtained, and a comprehensive cytological analysis was carried out to better understand the evolution of the genus. The karyotypes of Bletilla were mainly composed of metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes with lengths ranging from 1.25 to 4.93 μm. There was moderate cytological variation in Bletilla (chromosome number 2n = 32 to 76). Diploid with 2n = 34 and 2n = 36 was detected in Bletilla ochracea and Bletilla formosana, respectively, whereas diploid (2n = 32) was dominant in Bletilla striata, dysploidy (2n = 34, 2n = 36) and polyploid (2n = 48, 51, 64, 76) variations were also observed. Three species had a relatively symmetric karyotype, and which of B. ochracea was more asymmetry. The genome size (1C-values) varied from 2.94 pg (B. striata) to 3.33 pg (B. ochracea), of which B. ochracea was significantly larger than the others (P < 0.05). A positive correlation (P < 0.01) between 1Cx vs. haploid chromosome length (HCL) and asymmetry coefficient of karyotypes (AsK%) was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBletilla 0achromosome 0akaryotype 0anuclear DNA content 0aploidy level1 aYang, Lulu1 aZhang, Yanjun1 aLiang, Qiong0 tHortScience.g2022 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.48-55dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:28404x2327-98347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI16122-213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006600165300001400231500001100245520158600256592002801842650001501870650001101885650001401896650001101910650001901921650001901940650001501959650001001974650002001984700002002004773010702024856008102131852000902212655001202221IND60575949020221119220111.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057594902DNAL7 a10.1007/s40725-017-0051-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindberg, Eva10aIndividual Tree Crown Methods for 3D Data from Remote Sensing  ap. 19-31.  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: The rapid development of remote sensing technology has made dense 3D data available from airborne laser scanning and recently also photogrammetric point clouds. This paper reviews methods for extraction of individual trees from 3D data and their applications in forestry and ecology. RECENT FINDINGS: Methods for analysis of 3D data at tree level have been developed since the turn of the century. The first algorithms were based on 2D surface models of the upper contours of tree crowns. These methods are robust and provide information about the trees in the top-most canopy. There are also methods that use the complete 3D data. However, development of these 3D methods is still needed to include use of geometric properties. To detect a large fraction of the tallest trees, a surface model method generally gives the best results, but detection of smaller trees below the top-most canopy requires methods utilizing the whole point cloud. Several new sensors are now available with capability to describe the upper part of the canopy, which can be used to frequently update vegetation maps. Highly sensitive laser photo detectors have become available for civilian applications, which will enable acquisition of high-resolution 3D laser data for large areas to much lower costs. Methods for ITC delineation from 3D data provide information about a large fraction of the trees, but there is still a challenge to make optimal use of the information from the whole point cloud.

Based on our study, four nine-times miRNAs were selected to examine their functions in adipose formation activities. In 3T3-L1 cells and backfat tissues of castrated and intact male pigs, miR-F4-C12 was identified as a factor in adipose development utilizing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Further, miR-F4-C12 was identified to promote fat development, suggesting that miR-F4-C12 was involved in adipogenesis. Moreover, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) was proposed by the TargetScan, miRDB and starBase as a target of miR-F4-C12 and verified through a two-luciferase reporter assay. The over-expression of miR-F4-C12 dramatically decreases the PIK3R1 protein level in 3T3-L1 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of PIK3R1 in castrated pigs are reduced relative to intact pigs, providing further evidence that PIK3R1 is involved in regulating adipose accumulation. These results suggest that miR-F4-C12 involves adipose development and may regulate subcutaneous adipose tissue accumulation by targeting PIK3R1 in castrated male pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3abackfat 3acastration 3amales 3amicroRNA 3anucleotides 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aChen, Jie 1 aLiu, Ximing 1 aLuo, Yabiao 1 aWang, Tianzuo 1 aFang, Meiying 0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111130533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245007800173300001600251520118500267592002801452650002001480650001101500650001101511650001301522650001101535650001601546650001401562650002701576650001701603650001501620650002301635650001401658653001601672653001501688653002201703700002001725700002101745700001501766700001801781773017801799856007801977852000902055655001202064IND60750650920221119005508.0210916e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075065092DNAL7 a10.21273/JASHS05056-212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Shanthanu Krishna10aClassifying Cider Apple Germplasm Using Genetic Markers for Fruit Acidity  ap. 267-275.  aThe organic acid concentration in apple (Malus ×domestica) juice is a major component of hard cider flavor. The goal of this study was to determine if the malic acid markers, Ma1 and Q8, could classify the titratable acidity concentration in cider apple accessions from the United States Department of Agriculture Malus germplasm collection into descriptive classifications. Our results indicate that for diploid genotypes, the Ma1 marker alone and the Ma1 and Q8 markers analyzed together could be used to predict cider apple acidity (P < 0.0001). Alone, the Ma1 marker categorized acidity into low (<2.4 g⋅L⁻¹), medium (2.4–5.8 g⋅L⁻¹), and high (>5.8 g⋅L⁻¹) groups. The combination of Ma1 and Q8 markers provided more specificity, which would be useful for plant breeding applications. This work also identified a significant difference (P = 0.0132) in acidity associated with ploidy. On average, the triploids accessions had 0.33 g⋅L⁻¹ higher titratable acidity than the diploid accessions. Based on the results of this work, we propose a genetics-based classification system for cider apples with the acidity component defined by the Ma1 and Q8 markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3aciders 3adiploidy 3aflavor 3afruit acids 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3ahorticulture 3amalic acid 3atitratable acidity 3atriploidy 0aapple juice 0ahard cider 0aMalus ×domestica1 aWojtyna, Nathan1 aDougherty, Laura1 aXu, Kenong1 aPeck, Gregory0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2021 July, v. 146, no. 4 p.267-275dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl27747x2327-97887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS05056-213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245010900165500001900274520107000293592002801363650001701391650001301408650001301421650001901434650000901453650001701462650000701479650001501486650002701501700002501528700002001553700002801573700002601601700001801627700002401645700002301669700003001692773011801722856007701840852000901917655001201926IND60702830220221116224517.0200719e20200411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070283022DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90404802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucarini, Massimo 10aStability of the Meat Protein Type I Collagen: Influence of pH, Ionic Strength, and Phenolic Antioxidant  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe water-holding capacity (WHC) is among the key factors in determining the quality of meat and its value, which is strongly influenced by the content and quality of the connective tissue proteins like collagen. Therefore, the factors that influence the proteins’ stability, e.g., pH, ionic strength, and the antioxidants which are used to increase the meat shelf-life, also affect the WHC. The interaction of collagen, whose structure is strongly influenced by the interaction with water molecules, can be studied following the behavior of water diffusion by low-resolution ¹H NMR experiments. The present study is addressed to study the collagen stability as a function of pH, ionic strength, and phenolic antioxidants like catechin. The experimental study demonstrated how the ¹H NMR time domain (TD) experiments are able to evaluate the hydration properties of collagen, not only as a function of ionic strength and pH, but also in determining the ability of catechin to interact both on the surface of the collagen fibrils and inside the fibrillar domain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acatechin 3acollagen 3aionic strength 3ameat 3ameat protein 3apH 3ashelf life 3awater holding capacity1 aDurazzo, Alessandra 1 aSciubba, Fabio 1 aDi Cocco, Maria  Enrica1 aGianferri, Raffaella 1 aAlise, Mosè 1 aSantini, Antonello 1 aDelfini, Maurizio 1 aLombardi-Boccia, Ginevra 0 tFoods.g2020 Apr. 11, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90404803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245021000173300001600383520144200399592002801841650001101869650002201880650001301902650001001915650002901925650001201954650001901966650001501985700001902000700004602019700003102065773011402096856005502210852000902265655001202274IND4510558120221119045437.0150730e200001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451055812DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.00996.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoylova, Svetla10aStructural analysis of photosystem II in farâredâlightâadapted thylakoid membranes: New crystal forms provide evidence for a dynamic reorganization of lightâharvesting antennae subunits  ap. 207-215.  aWe studied twoâdimensional crystals of the major pigmentâprotein complex, photosystem II, in farâredâlightâadapted thylakoid membranes of the viridisâzb63 mutant of barley. Significantly larger grana membranes were produced with an increased synthesis of the entire photosystem II complex. These redâlightâadapted membranes also contained twoâdimensional crystals with a high frequency. Three different crystal forms of photosystem II were observed, providing the following data which further our understanding of the architecture of the native complex. (a) The oligomeric form of photosystem II in the membrane was monomeric in all crystal forms, but with a clear nonâcrystallographic pseudoâtwofold symmetry. This was more apparent on the lumenal face of the complex. (b) The variability of unit cell contacts in different crystal forms implied that the peripheral lightâharvesting antenna complex and the core of the complex were loosely connected. These peripheral subunits were predicted to rearrange so that they can either encircle the core complex or associate in parallel channels separated by lines of core complexes. (c) Grana membranes were found to retain a doubleâlayered insideâout character, with a stromal faceâtoâstromal face packing. However, the presence of a crystal in one membrane did not necessarily impose crystallinity on its pair.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3agrana 3alight harvesting complex 3amutants 3aphotosystem II 3athylakoids1 aFlint, Toby D.1 aFord, Robert C.q(Robert Clayton),d1945-1 aHolzenburg, A.q(Andreas),0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Jan., v. 267, no. 1 p.207-215dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.00996.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245008600214300001400300506011700314506007600431520124100507592002801748506003701776650001501813650000901828650001801837650001301855653002401868653002401892653002401916653002101940653001601961653002001977700005801997700002002055700001802075700006202093773008902155856009002244852000902334655001202343IND60779372520221207104259.0220914e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077937252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2022.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogers, Bridget1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2909-294410aReplacement of in vivo leptospirosis vaccine potency testing in the United States  ap. 36-44.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates the potency testing of leptospirosis vaccines, which are administered to animals to protect against infection by Leptospira bacteria. Despite the long-term availability of in vitro test methods for assessing batch potency, the use of hamsters in lethal in vivo batch potency testing persists to varying degrees across leptospirosis vaccine manufacturers. For all manufacturers of these products, data collected from public USDA records show an estimated 40% decline in the annual use of hamsters from 2014 to 2020, with an estimated 55% decrease in the number of hamsters expected to have been used in leptospirosis vaccine potency tests (i.e., those in USDA Category E). An estimated 49,000 hamsters were used in 2020, with about 15,000 hamsters in Category E specifically. Based on this assessment, additional efforts are needed to fully implement in vitro batch potency testing as a replacement for the in vivo batch potency test. We propose steps that can be taken collaboratively by the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB), manufacturers of leptospirosis vaccines, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations to accelerate broader use of the in vitro approach.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeptospira 3aUSDA 3aleptospirosis 3avaccines 0aLeptospira vaccines 0aVeterinary vaccines 0aAlternative methods 0aIn vitro methods 0aReplacement 0aPotency testing1 aBrown, Jeffrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9691-95931 aAllen, David G.1 aCasey, Warren1 aClippinger, Amy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3623-11960 tBiologicals.g2022 July, v. 78 p.36-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2022.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013800164300001600302500001900318520105300337592002801390650001301418650002101431650004301452650002901495650001301524650000901537700001601546700005701562700001601619700001201635773011801647856008201765852000901847655001201856IND60705249020221119001844.0200803e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070524902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-020-03916-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaobo14aThe Effects of Furoic Acid and Furfuryl Alcohol on Detection of Furfural in Transformer Oil by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography  ap. 927-932.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of furoic acid and furfuryl alcohol on the detection of furfural in transformer oil were studied using the traditional liquid–liquid extraction combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (LLE-HPLC) technology, in which, the methanol used as extraction agent and the C18 column and ultraviolet−visible detector were used as the separation and detection units for the determination of the furfural. The results show that the presence of furfuryl alcohol or furoic acid increases the extraction efficiency of furfural from 42.07 to 73.21% and 65.33%, respectively. The extraction efficiency of furfural decreases when the concentrations of furfuryl alcohol increase from 0.2 to 0.6 mg L⁻¹, but the extraction efficiency of furfural increases with the concentrations of furoic acid from 0.2 to 0.6 mg L⁻¹.

Here, we aimed to address prooxidant, proinflammatory and profibrotic markers in the livers from GDM rats and their fetuses, and to analyze the expression of miR-122 (a relevant microRNA in liver pathophysiology) in fetal and maternal plasma of GDM rats, as well as in the fetal livers of neonatal streptozotocin-induced (nSTZ) diabetic rats, the rats that generate GDM through intrauterine programming. GDM and nSTZ rats were evaluated on day 21 of pregnancy. We found increased nitric oxide production and lipoperoxidation in the livers from GDM rats and their fetuses compared to controls. Livers from GDM fetuses also showed increased levels of connective tissue growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-2. The expression of miRNA-122 was downregulated in the plasma from GDM rats and their male fetuses, as well as in the livers from male fetuses of nSTZ diabetic rats. miR-122 levels were regulated both in vitro through PPARγ activation and in vivo through a maternal diet enriched in PPAR ligands. Our findings revealed a prooxidant/proinflammatory environment in the livers from GDM rats and their fetuses and a dysregulation of miR-122, likely relevant in the programming of offspring's diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3afetus 3agelatinase A 3agestational diabetes 3aligands 3aliver 3amales 3amaternal nutrition 3amicroRNA 3anitric oxide 3apathophysiology 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3arats 0aMaternal diabetes 0aFetus 0aLiver 0aIntrauterine programming 0amiR-1221 aHeinecke, Florencia1 aRoberti, Sabrina Lorena1 aWhite, Veronica,1 aCapobianco, Evangelina1 aJawerbaum, Alicia0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2020 June 15, v. 510 p.110824-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.1108243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011900171300001800290500001900308520144400327592002801771596004401799650001201843650001401855650001901869650002001888650001401908650001401922650001901936650001901955650001501974650001801989650000902007650000702016650001502023650001602038650002702054650001602081650000802097700006102105700002102166700002002187773012002207856008202327852000902409655001202418IND60705249120221119001829.0200803e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070524912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-020-03921-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKartsova, Liudmila10aImidazolium Ionic Liquids in Microemulsion Electrokinetic Chromatography for Separation of Polyphenol Antioxidants  ap. 1001-1008.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnalytical prospects of ionic liquids as the components of the microemulsion for polyphenols separation by microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography are explored. Imidazolium-based hydrophilic ionic liquid 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride was used as a surfactant and hydrophobic ionic liquids 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluormethylsulfonyl)imide were used as the oil phase. It was shown that the addition of ionic liquids into the microemulsion leads to a significant increase in the number of theoretical plates for catechins separation (in the range 200–650 ×10³) in both cases. It was established that the use of hydrophobic ionic liquids 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluormethylsulfonyl)imide increases the sensitivity and selectivity of the polyphenols separation compared to 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. The following composition of microemulsion was found to be optimal for the selective electrophoretic separation of catechins with ionic liquids as the oil phase: 0.6% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate, 0.7% (w/v) 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 1.6% (w/v) 1-butanol, 5 mM phosphate buffer solution, pH = 7. The conditions for the electrophoretic separation of catechins with microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography were used to determine polyphenols in tea samples.  aPublisher supplied data  a19-13-00370cRussian Science Foundation 3abutanol 3achlorides 3achromatography 3aelectrophoresis 3aemulsions 3aflavanols 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3aoils 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolyphenols 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurfactants 3atea1 aMoskvichev, Danil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0545-22871 aBessonova, Elena1 aPeshkova, Maria0 tChromatographia.g2020 Aug., v. 83, no. 8 p.1001-1008dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-020-03921-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245014200210300001800352520182100370592002802191650001902219650002002238650001902258650001202277650001002289650002602299650002102325650002602346650001102372650002702383650001802410650001202428650002902440650001502469650001302484700001802497700001602515700001802531700002302549773014802572856008302720852000902803655001202812IND60647080620221121000954.0190816e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064708062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-019-01829-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoggan, Timothy L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8594-934012aA single analytical method for the determination of 53 legacy and emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous matrices  ap. 3507-3520.  aA quantitative method for the determination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) using liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was developed and applied to aqueous wastewater, surface water, and drinking water samples. Fifty-three PFAS from 14 compound classes (including many contaminants of emerging concern) were measured using a single analytical method. After solid-phase extraction using weak anion exchange cartridges, method detection limits in water ranged from 0.28 to 18 ng/L and method quantitation limits ranged from 0.35 to 26 ng/L. Method accuracy ranged from 70 to 127% for 49 of the 53 extracted PFAS, with the remaining four between 66 and 138%. Method precision ranged from 2 to 28% RSD, with 49 out of the 53 PFAS being below < 20%. In addition to quantifying > 50 PFAS, many of which are currently unregulated in the environment and not included in typical analytical lists, this method has efficiency advantages over other similar methods as it utilizes a single chromatographic separation with a shorter runtime (14 min), while maintaining method accuracy and stability and the separation of branched and linear PFAS isomers. The method was applied to wastewater influent and effluent; surface water from a river, wetland, and lake; and drinking water samples to survey PFAS contamination in Australian aqueous matrices. The compound classes FTCAs, FOSAAs, PFPAs, and diPAPs were detected for the first time in Australian WWTPs and the method was used to quantify PFAS concentrations from 0.60 to 193 ng/L. The range of compound classes detected and different PFAS signatures between sample locations demonstrate the need for expanded quantitation lists when investigating PFAS, especially newer classes in aqueous environmental samples.

Based on the hydrometeorological data collected over a long-term time series (1955–2012) which has been divided into five periods (P1 (1956–1969), P2 (1970–1979), P3 (1980–1989), P4 (1990–1999) and P5 (2000−2012)), changes and implications of the relationships between precipitation, runoff and sediment load (precipitation-runoff-sediment relationships) were studied in the Wuding River basin, China. Conclusions are as follows. (1) There is no obvious change occurs on the distribution of annual precipitation during 1955 to 2012. However, the annual runoff and sediment load are significantly decreased by 51.9% and 86.4%, respectively, from P1 to P5. (2) Under the same precipitation conditions, the runoff and sediment present overall decreasing trends. Decrease in the runoff was greater than that in the sediment load. The incoming sediment coefficient (ISC) reduced by 69.2%, indicating that the sediment transport ability per unit runoff was weakened. The significant reduction of ISC along with the decrease of the runoff amount caused the sediment brought into the Yellow River (STWY) decreased from P1 to P5. (3) Soil conservation measures played a critical role for the changes in precipitation-runoff-sediment relationships. Due to the rapid increases in the available storage of check dams in P2 and P5 and the areas of forest and grassland in P2, relationships among the precipitation, runoff and sediment has drastically changed. Decrease of the effects on sediment interception in check dams caused the sediment increased from P3 to P4. (4) Decreases of runoff and sediment load, and changes in their relationships would continue with the sustainable management of slopes and gullies. The potentially detrimental changes in the storage of check dams and those in runoff and sediment influenced by extreme weather conditions should be monitored and managed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adata collection 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahydrometeorology 3apollution load 3arain 3aravines 3arunoff 3asediment transport 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asoil conservation 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aWuding River 0aRunoff 0aSediment load 0aSoil and water conservation 0aSediment into the Yellow River1 aGao, Jianen1 aLuo, Han0 tCatena.g2019 Apr., v. 175 p.228-235dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245013500161300001600296520091800312592002801230650001101258650001601269650001101285700001801296700001901314773009901333856004801432852000901480655001201489IND4480834320221122220716.0120715e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448083432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-010-3136-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, BaoJun11aAliquid helium temperature target with a 10 K vapor shield for shock compression experiment in the environment condition of 100 Pa  ap. 349-353.  aThe shock compression experiment of liquid helium is an available way to gain properties of specimen at high temperatures and pressures. Based on Fluent, a thermal insulation analysis and design of a liquid helium temperature target in the environment condition of 100 Pa for shock compression experiment is performed. Then, a cryogenic target with a 10 K helium vapor shield and a separated vacuum interval is particularly developed. A lowest temperature of 3.63 K and a stable temperature of 3.70 K in the specimen cavity with an accuracy of 0.1 K are obtained by means of continuous flow and vacuum cooling. Both time-consuming and temperature stability are well-suited to the requirements of the shock compression experiment. The results show that the calculated and experimental data well-matched each other. The simulation method may be effective and feasible for the optimal design of the cryogenic target.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahelium 3atemperature 3avapors1 aHong, GuoTong1 aLiang, JingTao0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 Jan., v. 56, no. 3 p.349-353dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-010-3136-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009800166520195000264592002802214650001502242650002202257650002802279650002002307650001302327650001902340650000902359650001502368650001602383650002302399650002102422650001002443650001802453650001802471650001202489650001802501650001702519650000902536650001002545650002102555651001002576653001302586653001002599653001002609653002302619653002802642653003102670700001502701700001402716700001602730700001402746700001802760700001802778700001402796700001602810700001702826773011602843856008402959852000903043655001203052IND60793678420221121041600.0220929e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079367842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1079542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Wenjing10aEffects of mulching on water saving, yield increase and emission reduction for maize in China  aMulching, an agricultural management measure widely used in arid and semi-arid regions of China, can effectively improve the hydrothermal environment of farmland and increase crop yield and crop water productivity (WPc). However, previous studies on the effects of mulching on water saving, yield increase and emission reduction of maize have provided inconsistent results. Therefore, a meta-analysis was used in this study to (1) evaluate the effect of mulching types [plastic film (PM), straw (SM) and degradable film (DM)] on maize yield, evapotranspiration, WPc and greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) determine the effects of mulching measures on water saving, yield increase and emission reduction in maize farmland under different climatic conditions. Compared with the no-mulching control, mulching significantly raised maize yield, WPc and carbon dioxide (CO₂) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions. The PM, SM and DM increased maize yield by 27.31 %, 6.98 % and 16.55 % compared with no-mulching, respectively, and correspondingly WPc by 34.08 %, 11.48 % and 24.20 %. The PM and SM significantly increased CO₂ emissions by 39.91 % and 16.43 %, respectively, and N₂O emissions by 51.1 % and 30.12 %, but had no significant effect on methane absorption. For maize planting, in areas with altitudes < 500 and > 1000 m, average annual rainfall < 1000 mm, average annual air temperature of 5–15 °C and average annual evaporation < 1500 mm, a combination of PM and ridge–furrow planting can achieve the best effect of increasing production and saving water. In areas with an altitude of 1000–1500 m and average annual evaporation of 1500–2000 mm, the DM had the greatest effect of improving yield (by 16.17 %) and saving water, with a decrease in evapotranspiration of 8.82 % and an increase in WPc of 24.71 %. The local level of mechanization and labor costs should be considered when choosing a maize mulching pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3acarbon dioxide 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3agreenhouse gases 3alabor 3amechanization 3ameta-analysis 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3aplastic film 3arain 3astraw 3awater management 3aChina 0aMulching 0aMaize 0aYield 0aEvapotranspiration 0aCrop water productivity 0aGreenhouse gases emissions1 aGu, Xiaobo1 aDu, Yadan1 aChang, Tian1 aLu, Shiyu1 aZheng, Xiaobo1 aBai, Dongping1 aSong, Hui1 aSun, Shikun1 aCai, Huanjie0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 274 p.107954-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1079543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013200169520148700301592002801788650001601816650002201832650001701854650002201871650002601893650001401919650001601933650003101949650001301980650001701993650001602010650002202026653001702048653002302065653002402088653002702112653002402139700001902163700001902182700001702201700001302218700001602231700001502247700001702262773011802279856008802397852000902485655001202494IND60725889920221119081754.0220103e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072588992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1447422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ai-Lian10aSorghum rhizosphere effects reduced soil bacterial diversity by recruiting specific bacterial species under low nitrogen stress  aRhizosphere microbiota play a pivotal role in promoting plant growth and defending against pathogens, but their responses to abiotic environmental stress remain largely elusive. Here, we investigated the influences of low-N stress on rhizosphere bacteria of six sorghum cultivars in a glasshouse experiment. The alpha diversity of bacteria (as revealed by Shannon diversity and Chao1 richness indices) was remarkably lower in rhizosphere soils than in bulk soils, and was significantly higher under low-N stress than under N addition. Principal coordinates analysis revealed that the bacterial community compositions in rhizosphere soils were clearly separated from bulk soils, and the rhizosphere soils under low-N stress or with N fertilization were clearly separated, indicating that both rhizosphere effects and N fertilization impacted the rhizosphere bacterial community. Notably, the relative abundances of beneficial bacteria such as Bacillaceae and Streptomycetaceae significantly increased in rhizosphere soils under low-N stress, which had significantly positive correlations with the sorghum N uptake. The relative abundance of Nitrosomonadaceae in rhizosphere soils was significantly lower than that in bulk soils, while the relative abundance of Rhizobiaceae showed an opposite pattern. Taken together, our results suggested that sorghum rhizosphere effects can reduce soil bacterial diversity possibly through recruiting specific bacterial species under low N stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillaceae 3aNitrosomonadaceae 3aRhizobiaceae 3aStreptomycetaceae 3abacterial communities 3acultivars 3aenvironment 3agreenhouse experimentation 3anitrogen 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3aspecies diversity 0aLow-N stress 0aRhizosphere effect 0aSorghum rhizosphere 0aNitrogen fertilization 0aBacterial community1 aJiao, Xiao-Yan1 aWang, Jin-Song1 aDong, Er-Wei1 aGuo, Jun1 aWang, Li-Ge1 aSun, An-Qi1 aHu, Hang-Wei0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 May 20, v. 770 p.144742-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1447423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009900174300001800273520165600291592002801947596006001975650000802035650002502043650001502068650001602083650001802099650001602117650002002133650001102153650001102164650002102175650001802196650001302214700002102227700005602248773014802304856008302452852000902535655001202544IND60647080820221121001002.0190816e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064708082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-019-01839-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAktas, Gülsen Betül10aSandwich-type aptasensor employing modified aptamers and enzyme-DNA binding protein conjugates  ap. 3581-3589.  aThe use of aptamers in various analytical applications as molecular recognition elements and alternative to antibodies has led to the development of various platforms that facilitate the sensitive and specific detection of targets ranging from small molecules and proteins to whole cells. The goal of this work was to design a universal and adaptable sandwich-type aptasensor exploiting the unique properties of DNA binding proteins. Specifically, two different enzyme-DNA binding protein conjugates, GOx-dHP and HRP-scCro, were used for the direct detection of a protein using two aptamers for target capture and detection. The specific dsDNA binding sequence for each DNA binding protein tag was incorporated in the form of a hairpin at one end of each aptamer sequence during the synthesis step. Detection was accomplished by an enzymatic (GOx/HRP) cascade reaction after the binding of each enzyme conjugate to its corresponding binding sequence on each aptamer. The proposed sandwich-type aptasensor was validated for the detection of thrombin, which is one of the most commonly used model targets with known dual aptamers. The limit of detection accomplished was 0.92 nM which is comparable with other colorimetric platforms reported in the literature. The sensitivity of the aptasensor was easily modulated by changing the number of dsDNA binding sites incorporated in the aptamer sequences, thus controlling the enzyme stoichiometry. Finally, the potential use of the proposed sensing approach for real sample testing was demonstrated using spiked human plasma and no significant matrix effects were observed when up to 2% plasma was used.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICIG09-GA-2011-294046cFP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aantibodies 3aaptasensors 3abinding sites 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3amodels 3aoligonucleotides 3astoichiometry 3athrombin1 aSkouridou, Vasso1 aMasip, Lluis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3938-46330 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2019 June, v. 411, no. 16 p.3581-3589dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-019-01839-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04098naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003200153245005500185520270300240592002802943650001902971650001102990650000903001650001103010650001803021650001503039650001303054650001403067650001403081650001103095650001303106650002203119650001203141650001203153650001703165650002303182650001203205650001803217650001203235650001603247653003303263653001503296653002103311653002103332653003503353773010703388856008803495852000903583655001203592IND60692586820221122031347.0200509e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069258682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1090522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKooijman, Sebastiaan A.L.M.14aThe comparative energetics of petrels and penguins  aPetrels and penguins form the clade Austrodyptornithes. The Add-my-Pet collection of referenced data and Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) parameters presently has 64 members of this clade. Adaptations to their wandering life style could now be studied; I here try to characterise this clade from an energy perspective. It turned out that petrels are in several respects extreme among birds, showing adaptations to life at low mean food levels. Penguins show the same tendency, but less extreme. Almost all petrel species show a weight-reduction well prior to fledging till the adult weight. This permanent weight reduction suggests that the mean adult feeding level is about 80% of the maximum one. This pattern is well-captured by the standard DEB model, in which (energy) reserve plays an important role. They also have relatively large eggs, and long incubation times and low reproduction rates. I argue that large eggs minimize the age at fledging, given that a particular maturity threshold needs to be reached for fledging. Austrodyptornithes have a high age at puberty, which, in combination with low reproduction rates, causes very low maximum population growth rates. The energy allocation to reproduction for petrels is typical among birds, so the low reproduction rates are the results of the large eggs. Another adaptation to low mean food levels is the large stomach/gut capacity, which appeared to be coupled to a high reserve capacity. This points to be an adaptation to a patchy occurrence of their food, probably in combination with spells of poor weather conditions for feeding. Petrels have a high supply stress and altriciality coefficient, compared to birds, while penguins are a very small altriciality coefficient. This reflects a very high maturity level at puberty for both taxa, in combination with high maturity level at birth for petrels and a typical one for penguins. They have a relatively long life span, compared to other birds, but not extreme. The relative egg size of penguins is typical for birds, to smaller than typical. Penguins combine small eggs with long foraging trips, while small young need frequent feeding. They evolved two adaptation for this: crop milk feeding and collecting lipid-rich food for their offspring. The energetic differences that have been found between petrels and penguins may directly relate to feeding in surface waters by petrels and in deeper waters by penguins; seasonal fluctuations in food density are more pronounced in surface waters. The higher clades Aequornithes and Aequorlitornithes are in many respect intermediate between Austrodyptornithes and other birds, demonstrating a clear taxonomic coherence in energy parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcellariidae 3aadults 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afeeding level 3afledglings 3aforaging 3alifestyle 3alongevity 3amodels 3apenguins 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3apuberty 3areproduction 3aseasonal variation 3astomach 3asurface water 3aweather 3aweight loss 0aDynamic energy budget theory 0aAdd-my-Pet 0aLife at low food 0aReserve capacity 0aLow max population growth rate0 tEcological modelling.g2020 July 01, v. 427 p.109052-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1090523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001600171245014800187300001200335520102500347592002801372650002601400650001201426650001301438650002501451650001501476650001001491650001101501650002101512650001201533650002301545650003801568650004001606650002601646650002901672650001401701653001701715653001201732653004701744653003201791653001301823700001301836700001601849700002001865700001901885773010201904856008702006852000902093655001202102IND50060568620221122220651.0190409e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006056862DNAL7 a231962142pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.10.1602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wu-Jun10aPreparation of liquid chemical feedstocks by co-pyrolysis of electronic waste and biomass without formation of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins  ap. 1-7.  aThe co-pyrolysis of waste electrical and electronic equipments (WEEEs) and waste biomass to obtain pyrolysis-oil, a liquid fuel or chemical feedstock, was carried out in the present work.

The wheat, maize and barley yield loss magnitudes imposed by increasing temperatures reportedly interact with the nitrogen (N) application level under field conditions. However, little is known about the interactive effect between high daytime temperatures and the N supply on the rice grain yield or quality or the influence of this effect on nitrogen use efficiency in the field. In this work, two hybrid rice varieties (Liangyoupeijiu-LYPJ and IIyou602-IIY602) were grown under three N application levels (N75–75 kg ha⁻¹, N150–150 kg ha⁻¹, and N225–225 kg ha⁻¹) in paddy fields in 2019 and 2020 under control and higher-temperature (HT) conditions from the heading stage to maturity. HT exposure significantly decreased the grain yields, grain filling, grain weight, grain-leaf ratio, total biomass at maturity and harvest index (HI) of the two rice varieties at all N levels across both years, while the spikelet m⁻² was only affected in 2019. Moreover, the grain yield reduction caused by HT were least at N150 (57.0%) in LYPJ (68.7% and 68.8% in N75 and N225, respectively) and N75 (60.7%) in IIY602(66.0% and 64.5% in N150 and N225, respectively) on average of two years. Grain filling percentage, biomass and HI also had least decreases under N150 in LYPJ and under N75 in IIY602. Regarding the grain quality, HT exposure decreased the head rice yield and grain length, and increased chalkiness in the two varieties in both years while decreasing the amylose content and increasing the protein content in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Relatively optimal N application rates (N75 or N150 for both varieties) improved grain quality indicators such as the brown rice, head rice, grain length, chalkiness degree and amylose content under HT. After HT exposure, nonsignificant changes in N accumulation at maturity and significant reduction in N translocation and N use efficiencies for grain and biomass production were observed in both varieties. Compared to the relatively higher N applications, applying N150 to LYPJ (by 24.3%) and N75 to IIY602 (by 33.7%) induced lower N translocation reductions. Thus, our results suggest that increasing N supply cannot minimize the damage caused by HT in the realistic fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aamylose 3abarley 3abiomass production 3abrown rice 3acorn 3afood security 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3ahybrids 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3apaddies 3aprotein content 3aresearch 3aspikelets 3atemperature 3atotal nitrogen 3awheat 0aGrain quality 0aGrain yield 0aHigher temperatures 0aNitrogen rates 0aRice1 aShi, Wanju1 aXiao, Gui1 aZhang, Xinzhen1 aWang, De1 aXu, Hang1 aWu, Jinshui1 aYang, Zijin1 aLai, Yusha1 aDuan, Meijuan1 aZhang, Jianhua0 tField crops research.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 288 p.108696-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2022.1086963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245020500202300001800407500001900425520085000444592002801294650001101322650001501333650001701348650001201365650002201377650001501399650003001414700001401444700001501458700001801473700001701491773012001508856008201628852000901710655001201719IND60705249520221119001433.0200803e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070524952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-020-03917-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaude, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5798-224210aHigh Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography of Plant Ecdysteroids Coupled with Desorption Electrospray Ionisation–Ion Mobility–Time of Flight High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HPTLC/DESI/IM/ToFMS)  ap. 1029-1035.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe use of high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) in combination with high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (MS) for the detection, identification and imaging (HPTLC/MSI) of ecdysteroids (insect moulting hormones) present in a number of plant extracts obtained from members of the Silene family is demonstrated.

A number of acidifiers as alternative to AGPs, has been added into diets to prevent the post-weaning syndrome in pigs. However, the effect of feed acidifiers on growth performance of pigs is not consistently positive, especially in comparison with the AGPs. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were therefore conducted to determine the acidifiers those are most consistent on improving growth performance when supplemented to pig diets. Data bases (Web of Science) were searched from 1990 to 2019, unrestricted by language. Fifty-two articles were selected to assess the effects of acidifiers on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed efficiency (G:F), through the side-by-side comparisons with control diets or antibiotic supplemented diets. These acidifiers investigated in the present study were classified into four categories: organic acids, inorganic acids, salts of acids and blends of acids. Results indicated that supplementation of diets with acidifiers had positive effects on growth performance (+6.7 and +5.0% for ADG and G:F, respectively; P < 0.01) in comparison with control diets, and the most consistent improvement was observed in nursery-growing pigs (< 60 kg). In comparison with antibiotic supplementation, the acidifier-supplemented diets had the similar G:F, but lower ADG and ADFI. Furthermore, blends of acids are superior to individual organic acids or salts of acids on improving growth performance in pigs. In conclusion, addition of a range of acidifiers could provide a significant improvement in pig growth, although acidifiers were less effective than antibiotics in the most cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3aaverage daily gain 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3agrowth performance 3ahuman health 3alivestock husbandry 3ameta-analysis 3aswine 3asystematic review 0aADFI 0aADG 0aAGPs 0aCI 0aG:F 0aGIT 0aAcidifier 0aPig 0aAntibiotic 0aFeed efficiency 0aWeight gain1 aLong, Weitong1 aChadwick, Dave1 aZhang, Xiaoying1 aZhang, Shuai1 aPiao, Xiangshu1 aHou, Yong0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2022 July, v. 289 p.115320-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.1153203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245005500160300001600215520138200231592002801613653001801641653002501659653002201684653002201706700002101728773012701749856007501876852000901951655001201960IND60127932820221119145953.0151114e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012793282DNAL7 a10.1290/0406040.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aREYES, MIGUEL R.10aCell growth in vitro directed by handmade patterns  ap. 258-261.  aIn this report, we show how the in vitro model of mechanically injured confluent monolayers of cultured mammalian cells, consisting in denudation by gentle scraping of areas in the monolayer, can be extended to obtain patterned cell cultures without using preadded attaching matrices. This work was done with a sinusoidal endothelial liver cell line. Patterns for cell growth were drawn in confluent monolayers by cell detaching with the aid of pipette tips followed by reincubation of the culture. In one or some d, acellular patterns were closed by cell migration and proliferation. For unveiling the pattern formed by migration and cell duplication, an enzymatic digestion with trypsin––collagenase solution was applied; after some min, only the migrating and younger cells filling the previous acellular pattern remained attached to the dish, and the now cellular pattern was clearly depicted. After stopping and recovering from the enzymatic treatment, the culture was ready for starting studies such as those related to migration, proliferation, cell––cell interactions. This method allows us to create simple and complex patterns, does not require preparation of the dishes with attaching matrices, and extracellular matrices in acellular areas are absent because of the enzymatic treatment, thus, potentially having many applications in cell culture techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 0acell adhesion 0acell culture methods 0aendothelial cells 0awounded monolayer1 aLAZALDE, BRISSIA0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2004 Oct., v. 40, no. 8 p.258-261dTissue Culture Associationx1543-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1290%2F0406040.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04380naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245005700168300001400225520286300239592002803102650002403130650001103154650002303165650001003188650002003198650001003218650001503228650000903243650001503252650001603267650001503283650002603298650003103324650001003355650003803365650001703403650001903420650001403439650002103453653003803474653001803512653001803530653002403548653002303572653003103595700002303626773010603649856008603755852000903841655001203850IND50061774620221122220729.0190318e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006177462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2012.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnger, Julia10aFeed and treat: What to expect from commercial diets  ap. 19-29.  aBasic data describing the physical characteristics of fish fecal waste are important in the design of effective solid waste management in aquaculture, especially in land-based facilities such as recirculating aquacultural systems (RAS).This study describes the physical properties of feces from rainbow trout fed eight different commercially available and widely used diets in Germany. Additional data from an earlier but unpublished study pertaining to feces derived from two rather extreme all-vegetarian diets are also presented for consideration of the settling properties. The diets were tested on duplicate groups of 50 rainbow trout in a flow-through aquaculture system. The effects of the diets on the physical properties of fecal particles such as particle size distribution (PSD), modeled settling velocity and rheological character were examined and the effects of each diet on fish health, growth and feed utilization were determined. Specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) for the different diets ranged from 0.98%d−1±0.012%d−1 to 1.39%d−1±0.012%d−1 and 0.97±0.017 to 1.61±0.017 (mean±S.E.), respectively. The density of presoaked feces was significantly lower than that of intestinal feces and ranged from 1.01013±0.00692gcm−3 to 1.04547±0.00692gcm−3 (mean±S.E.). Stability data were in the range from 390.12±29.4Pa to 1214.79±29.0Pa for elastic modulus and from 62.12±6.1Pas to 232.68±6.0Pas for dynamic viscosity. Based on the stability and PSD data theoretical efficiencies for removal of fecal waste using a drum filter showed remarkable variation, ranging from 82.5 to 95.9% (60μm gauze). Based on the same data, theoretical removal by a sedimentation basin with routinely using overflow rates of 0.057cms−1 to 0.394cms−1 ranged from 62.8 to 93.8%. Both fecal density and PSD have an exponential impact on settling performance. Increasing fecal density improves the removal efficiency of a sedimentation basin by about 20%, however sedimentation was seen to be a less robust and efficient removal technique than drum filtration. Sedimentation systems also experience additional problems with respect to leaching. Turbulence that was mimicked in this study reflects to an optimal fish farm, which means disintegrating effects are mainly caused by fish motion. If disintegrating units e.g. pumps are used, which are known to promote further particle breakdown the effects would be amplified.The results demonstrate the central importance of density of suspended solids in defining removal efficiencies and suggest that manipulation of fecal density might offer a new and effective means of managing and optimizing waste output from aquaculture operations. This study describes the basic properties of fecal wastes generated by commercial diets and can be used as a basis for further research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abasins 3aexperimental diets 3afeces 3afeed conversion 3afeeds 3afiltration 3afish 3afish farms 3afish health 3afish waste 3amodulus of elasticity 3aparticle size distribution 3apumps 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3asolid wastes 3aturbulent flow 3aviscosity 3awaste management 0aRecirculating aquaculture systems 0aRainbow trout 0aFecal density 0aSettling properties 0aRemoval efficiency 0aParticle size distribution1 aBrinker, Alexander0 tAquacultural engineering.g2013 Mar., v. 53 p.19-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2012.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010700176300001400283520145100297592002801748650001601776650001701792650001501809650001201824650001501836650001301851650002201864650001901886650001401905653002001919653002101939653001701960653001501977653001701992653001402009700002202023700002202045700002502067700002202092700002202114773010302136856008502239852000902324655001202333IND60571186420221121020023.0180905e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057118642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fooweb.2017.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruskotter, Jeremy T.14aThe role of science in understanding (and saving) large carnivores: A response to Allen and colleagues  ap. 46-48.  aAllen and colleagues contend that the study designs used to test for indirect effects of large carnivores on lower trophic levels are limited insomuch as they “rely on weak inference when valuing the roles of large carnivores in ecosystems.” Based upon their review of gray wolf and dingo studies, they conclude “that evidence for the ecological roles” (i.e., top-down effect) of these species is “equivocal.” Further, they assert that large carnivore science is being distorted in both the scientific and popular literature in order to justify restoration of large carnivores. They prescribe the use of manipulative experiments as the best means of understanding the effects of large carnivores on ecological systems, and systematic review of studies that “have used only manipulative experiments to investigate these hypotheses.” We take issue with Allen and colleagues' characterization of empirical evidence in the field of ecology, and we question the strength of evidence they present in support of prosecutorial assertions levied against scientists and science communicators. Ultimately, justification for the restoration of large carnivores is provided by two scientific claims that are unperturbed by Allen and Colleagues critique (i.e., that large carnivores routinely have important impacts on ungulate abundance, and overabundant ungulate populations often adversely impact the structure and biodiversity of habitats).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3abiodiversity 3acarnivores 3adingoes 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3asystematic review 3atrophic levels 3aungulates 0aTrophic cascade 0aTop-down effects 0aEpistemology 0aExperiment 0aConservation 0aDiscourse1 aVucetich, John A.1 aSmith, Douglas W.1 aNelson, Michael Paul1 aKarns, Gabriel R.1 aPeterson, Rolf O.0 tFood webs.g2017 Dec., v. 13 p.46-48dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:23213x2352-24967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2017.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245019900167300001600366500001900382520095200401592002801353650003001381650000801411650001501419650001001434650001101444650001101455650001501466650001601481700002301497700001601520700002001536700002001556773011801576856008201694852000901776655001201785IND60705249720221119001607.0200803e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070524972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-020-03918-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŞahin, Saliha10aStudy of the Ability of Lutein and Neoxanthin as Standards and in the Extract of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to Prevent Oxidatively Induced DNA Base Damage Using Ultrasensitive GC–MS/MS Analysis  ap. 919-926.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, two carotenoid antioxidants lutein and neoxanthin were investigated for their ability to prevent oxidatively induced DNA damage. A Chlamydomonas reinhardtii alga was used as the natural source of lutein and neoxanthin. Analysis using HPLC with Diode Array Detector (DAD) showed that lutein and neoxanthin were the most abundant carotenoids in the extract of C. reinhardtii. An analysis using GC–MS/MS was performed to measure the damage induced by Fenton reaction to DNA and to evaluate the ability of lutein, neoxanthin and C. reinhardtii extract to inhibit such damage. The results showed that lutein and neoxanthin have the ability to reduce oxidatively induced DNA base damage to less than half of its magnitude. Extract of C. reinhardtii inhibited about 76% of the damage in comparison to control sample. Neoxanthin in lower concentrations than those of lutein proved to be better inhibitor of oxidatively induced DNA damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aalgae 3adiodes 3alutein 3aneoxanthin 3anucleobases1 aAybastıer, Önder1 aDawbaa, Sam1 aKarkar, Büşra1 aÇakmak, Turgay0 tChromatographia.g2020 Aug., v. 83, no. 8 p.919-926dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-020-03918-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013400165300001800299520131100317592002801628650002101656650001501677650001401692650001901706650002401725650003101749650000901780650001801789650001401807650001301821650001301834700001701847700002201864700002301886700002001909773010801929856008402037852000902121655001202130IND60533400520221121055345.0160731e20150914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053340052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.5b008672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Minnie10aLong-Lasting and Efficient Tumor Imaging Using a High Relaxivity Polysaccharide Nanogel Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent  ap. 2964-2971.  aClinically approved small-molecule magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents are all rapidly cleared from the body and offer weak signal enhancement. To avoid repeated administration of contrast agent and improve signal-to-noise ratios, agents with stronger signal enhancement and better retention in tumors are needed. Therefore, we focused on hydrogels because of their excellent water accessibility and biodegradability. Gadolinium (Gd)-chelating cross-linkers were incorporated into self-assembled pullulan nanogels to both impart magnetic properties and to stabilize this material that has been extensively studied for medical applications. We show that these Gd-chelating pullulan nanogels (Gd-CHPOA) have the highest reported relaxivity for any hydrogel-based particles and accumulate in the 4T1 tumors in mice at high levels 4 h after injection. This combination offers high signal enhancement and lasts up to 7 days to delineate the tumor clearly for longer imaging time scales. Importantly, this long-term accumulation does not cause any damage or toxicity in major organs up to three months after injection. Our work highlights the clinical potential of Gd-CHPOA as a tumor-imaging MRI contrast agent, permitting tumor identification and assessment with a high signal-to-background ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3agadolinium 3ahydrogels 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apullulan 3atoxicity1 aLux, Jacques1 aNishimura, Tomoki1 aAkiyoshi, Kazunari1 aAlmutairi, Adah0 tBiomacromolecules.g2015 Sept. 14, v. 16, no. 9 p.2964-2971dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biomac.5b008673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012100169300001600290520152600306592002801832650001201860650001201872650001301884650001101897650001301908650001501921650001501936650001601951650001701967650001701984650001102001650000902012650001502021650001402036650000902050650000902059650001702068650001102085650001202096651001802108653001702126653001502143653002002158653002702178653002402205700005702229700001902286700001602305700001502321700001602336700002002352700003102372700001802403700002202421773008702443856008502530852000902615655001202624IND60626538420221118011055.0210105e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062653842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2018.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Changping10aHuman health risks of heavy metals in paddy rice based on transfer characteristics of heavy metals from soil to rice  ap. 339-348.  aIn order to investigate the transfer and accumulation pathways of heavy metals in cropland ecosystems, an investigation of the geochemical behaviors of heavy metals in soil and rice plants was carried out in the Yangtze River Delta. Soil is one of the biggest reservoirs of heavy metals and affects food safety at the beginning of the food chain. The results of this study demonstrate that heavy metal levels in soil decreased with increasing soil pH, while rice shoots accumulated heavy metals more readily under low soil pH conditions. The non-carcinogenic hazard quotients (HQ) of heavy metals show that health risks for humans were primarily due to Pb and As. Furthermore, cancer risk (Risk) results suggested that ~76% and ~15.7% of cancer risk was caused by Cd and As levels, respectively. Decreasing soil pH enhanced the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks for the human body. Through exponential change between transfer factor (TFgᵣₐᵢₙ/ₛₒᵢₗ) and soil metals, HQ, a direct monitoring method for rice plants, was built using regression curves. It is proposed that besides condition of soil with high heavy metal concentration, for rice grown with surface soil metals, the safety of the rice product should be monitored when soil metals are under the following levels after harvest: non-carcinogenic risk, As < 20 mg/kg, Pb < 100 mg/kg, Cd < 0.07–0.68 mg/kg and Cu 7.56–30.87 mg/kg; and cancer risk, As < 20 mg/kg, Cd < 4 mg/kg and Cr < 200 mg/kg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3acropland 3aecosystems 3afood chain 3afood safety 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alead 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3arice 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3ashoots 3asoil pH 3aYangtze River 0aHeavy metals 0aPaddy rice 0aTransfer factor 0aHealth risk assessment 0aYangtze River Delta1 aSong, Yinxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7524-97221 aChen, Lingxiao1 aJi, Junfeng1 aLi, Jizhou1 aYuan, Xuyin1 aYang, Zhongfang1 aAyoko, G.

We investigated thoroughly the procedure to isolate cells from skin using the enzymatic tissue dissociation procedure. Tissue digestion efficiency, cell viability, and yield were investigated in relation to size of tissue fragments, digestion volume to tissue ratio, digestion time, and importance of other protease activities present in Clostridium histolyticum collagenase (CHC) (neutral protease, clostripain, and trypsin). The results showed that digestion was optimal with small tissue fragments (2––3 mm³) and with volumes tissue ratios ≥≥2 ml/g tissue. For incubations ≤≤10 h, the digestion efficiency and cell isolation yields were significantly improved by increasing the collagenase, neutral protease, or clostripain activity, whereas trypsin activity had no effects. However, a too high proteolytic activity of one of the proteases present in CHC digestion solution or long exposure times interfered with cell viability and cell culture yields. The optimal range of CHC proteases activities per milliliter digestion solutions was determined for digestions ≤≤10 h (collagenase 2700––3900 Mandl U/ml, neutral protease 5100––10,000 caseinase U/ml, and clostripain 35––48 BAEE U/ml) and for longer digestions (>14 h) (collagenase 1350–– 3000 U/ml, neutral protease 2550––7700 U/ml, and clostripain 18––36 U/ml). Using these conditions, a maximum fibroblast expansion was achieved when isolated cells were seeded at 1 ×× 10⁴ cells/cm². These results did not only allow selection of optimal CHC batches able to digest dermal tissue with an high cell viability but also significantly increased the fibroblast yields, enabling us to produce autologous dermal tissue in a clinically acceptable time frame of 3 wk.  aPublisher supplied data 0atissue digestion 0acrude Clostridium histolyticum collagenase 0acell isolation 0afibroblasts1 aBlitterswijk, Clemens A. van,1 aBERTRAND-DE HAAS, MARION1 aSCHUURMAN, ARNOLD H.1 aLAMME, EVERT N.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2004 Oct., v. 40, no. 8 p.268-277dTissue Culture Associationx1543-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1290%2F0408055.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245008100164300001800245520134000263592002801603650001801631650002301649650002801672650001201700650002301712650001001735650001201745650001501757651001001772653001601782653001401798653001401812653002301826653001801849700002201867773012701889856007902016852000902095655001202104IND60795384920221116173232.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079538492DNAL7 a10.55362/IJE/2022/36972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukhdeep Singh,10aPaddy residue management alternatives in Punjab, India: An economic analysis  ap. 1556-1560.  aFarmer's choice of using crop residue management (CRM) method depends on different factors like the quantum of residue generated, accessibility and affordability of CRM solutions and other technical or marketing constraints. Considering the earnest need for well-managed CRM system with good potential for resource use efficiency, the present study was conducted in the Punjab state during the year 2020–21.Among the four prevalent strategies i.e. complete burning (CB), partial burning (PB), complete incorporation (CI) and complete removal (CR), the CI method proved to be the most cost-effective with highest returns (Rs.115274.2 per hectare) because of higher yield though CB was the most preferred by all the farm categories. CR raised the farmers’ burden by Rs. 7200 per hectare in comparison to CB. Majority of the respondents faced technical problems related to lack of practical knowledge about operating machines, seed rate, moisture requirements and complicated methods followed by economical, managerial and marketing constraints. Steps like compensation to farmers by integrating the cost of paddy residue management in the MSP, assuring the availability of residue management machinery at reduced rates, improving custom hire services and extension services are needed to deal with the state's paddy straw management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3acost effectiveness 3acrop residue management 3aecology 3afarmers' attitudes 3afarms 3apaddies 3arice straw 3aIndia 0aConstraints 0aEconomics 0aInput use 0aManagement methods 0aPaddy residue1 aRanguwal, Sangeet0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2022 Dec., v. 49, no. 4 p.1556-1560dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.55362/IJE/2022/36973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03584naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245013700173520197600310592002802286650001502314650001202329650002202341650001302363650001202376650001702388650001702405650001802422650001802440650001502458650001902473650002002492650001802512650001602530650002602546650002002572650001802592653002002610653002702630653003802657700001402695700001802709700001302727700001402740700002402754700001402778700001702792700001702809773011802826856008902944852000903033655001203042IND60776528420221117023820.0220522e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077652842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.1153232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaghmare, A.G.10aCharacterization of storage stability of microalgal biomass for its applications as protein feed ingredients in animal and aquafeeds  aMicroalgae has recently attracted a significant interest as a sustainable source of nutrients for feed industry. Therefore, it is important to gain a comprehensive understanding on safety, physical and biochemical qualities, and storage stability of the microalgae products intended for use in feeds. This work is a time course evaluation of nutritional and safety parameters of microalgal biomass (Picochlorum sp.) produced under outdoor conditions. Initially, physical properties, proximate composition, aflatoxins, and pathogenic bacterial count of dried microalgal biomass (control = 0 days of storage) were evaluated. The bulk density and tapped density were 0.61 ± 0.005 and 0.86 ± 0.005 g m/L, respectively. 81% of particle size of microalgal biomass powder was below 212 µm size. Protein (~43% w/w), constituted the main component of the proximate composition, followed by carbohydrates (20%) and lipids (18%). Aflatoxins and pathogenic bacterial cell counts were within the regulatory limits, as per the US and EU regulatory guidelines for feed ingredients. Further, the microalgal biomass was stored under three storage conditions: cold storage 4 ± 3 °C (CS), warehouse storage 30 ± 5 °C (WH) and laboratory storage 23 ± 3 °C (LS) and periodically evaluated for stability of above-mentioned parameters. Crude protein concentration did not change over 12 months of storage. An increase (by 3.2%) in moisture content was observed under LS storage conditions with respect to control after 12 months. However, it did not alter the nutritional quality, aflatoxins, or microbial load. Moreover, the amino acids profile remained stable throughout the entire duration of storage. Vitamin D showed a significant decline after 3 months of storage. Results from this study conclude that microalgae can be stored at any of the three storage conditions tested, without compromising the proximate composition of the biomass for a period of 12 months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxins 3aanimals 3aaquaculture feeds 3abacteria 3abiomass 3abulk density 3acold storage 3acrude protein 3afeed industry 3amicroalgae 3amicrobial load 3anutritive value 3aparticle size 3aplate count 3aproximate composition 3astorage quality 3awater content 0aFeed ingredient 0aNutritional properties 0aStorage quality, Safety standards1 aChugh, N.1 aSagaram, U.S.1 aArun, S.1 aMenon, D.1 aSubhash, G.

Removal of LIF, reduced levels of fetal calf serum (FCS), and addition of retinoic acid all induced embryonic stem cell differentiation as measured by reduced Oct4 expression. Lower levels of retinoic acid (0.1––10 nM) promoted the formation of epithelial-like cells, whereas higher levels (100––10,000 nM) favored differentiation into fibroblastic-like cells. The effects of dbcAMP varied with the presence or absence of FCS and LIF and the concentration of dbcAMP. In FCS-containing media, a low level of dbcAMP (100 μμM) increased self-renewal in the absence of LIF, but it had no effect in its presence. In contrast, at higher concentrations (1000 μμM dbcAMP), regardless of LIF, differentiation was promoted. A similar effect of dbcAMP was seen in the presence of retinoic acid. In media without FCS but with serum replacement supplements, there was no effect of dbcAMP. This study shows that the Oct4 expression system of IOUD2 cells provides a novel, simple method for quantifying cellular differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 0amouse 0aembryonic stem cells 0aOct4 0aretinoic acid 0adbcAMP1 aKANE, M.

Dasatinib along with its six known organic impurities were separated using the reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with C₁₈ column and mobile phases consisting of gradient mixture of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 with 1-octanesulphonic acid sodium salt (0.1%, w/v), acetonitrile and ultrapure water. This method was successfully tested with liquid chromatography coupled mass-spectrometry to elucidate the chemical structure of newly formed degradation product of Dasatinib which was identified by comparing its retention time and mass-spectra with literature data. Stability-indicating characteristics of developed HPLC method was assessed using stress testing [5 N HCl at 90 °C/1 h, 5 N NaOH at 90 °C/1 h, H₂O at 90 °C/1 h, 30% H₂O₂ (w/w) at 25 °C ± 5 °C/1 h, dry heat at 105 °C/24 h and UV (200 W h m⁻²) and fluorescent light (1.2 million lux-h)] and was validated as per ICH Q2(R1). For Dasatinib and its six impurities, the quantification limits, linearity and recoveries were found in range of 0.19–0.21 μg/mL, 0.2–3.0 μg mL⁻¹ (R² > 0.995) and 85.5–107.0%, respectively. The developed HPLC method will also suffice the suitability for impurity profiling and assay of Dasatinib in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3achemical structure 3afluorescent lighting 3aheat 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3apotassium phosphates 3aprotein kinases 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asodium1 aKuppan, Chandrasekar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3780-62221 aSrinivas, Kona S.1 aYarra, Raviteja0 tChromatographia.g2020 Aug., v. 83, no. 8 p.947-962dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-020-03920-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03881naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161100001500170245009300185300001600278500002400294500002400318500001500342520196600357650002802323650002302351650002202374650002202396650002302418650002602441650001802467650002302485650001502508650002302523650001202546650003202558650001902590650001202609650005402621650003802675650001102713650002602724650000902750650008102759653003802840653003202878653003302910700001402943700001602957700001602973773011602989852000903105856008203114930003303196945002503229946001303254655001203267IND4390648220221122081312.0070424e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439064822DNAL7 a172742882pmid7 a10.1637/7655-052806R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aZavala, G.10aEnzootic Reticuloendotheliosis in the Endangered Attwater's and Greater Prairie Chickens  ap. 520-525.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-06  aReticuloendotheliosis (RE) in captive greater prairie chickens (GPC, Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) and Attwater's prairie chickens (APC, Tympanuchus cupido attwateri) was first reported in 1998. RE is caused by avian reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), an oncogenic and immunosuppressive retrovirus infecting multiple species of wild and domestic birds. During August 2004 through May 2006 a captive population of prairie chickens was affected simultaneously with a neoplastic condition and also avian pox, the latter being detected in 7.4% (2 of 27) of all birds submitted for histopathology. A survey for REV was conducted in order to examine its possible role in mortality observed primarily in juvenile and adult specimens of prairie chickens. The investigative procedures included postmortem examinations, histopathology, molecular detection, and virus isolation. In total, 57 Attwater's prairie chickens and two greater prairie chickens were included in the study. REV infection was diagnosed using virus isolation or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or both in 59.5% (28 of 47) of blood samples and/or tumors from suspect birds. Lymphosarcomas were detected in the tissues of 37% (10 of 27) of the birds submitted for histopathology. Such lymphosarcomas suggestive of RE represented the most frequent morphologic diagnosis on histopathology among 27 separate submissions of naturally dead prairie chickens. Overall, REV was detected or RE diagnosed in 34 of 59 prairie chickens (57.62%). The average death age of all birds diagnosed with lymphosarcomas on histopathology was 2.2 yr, ranging from <1 to 4 yr. Although deaths associated with neoplasia occurred in males and females in equal proportions based on submissions, overall more males were diagnosed as REV infected or RE affected (16 males vs. 7 females, and 11 birds of undetermined gender). Reticuloendotheliosis virus was confirmed as a significant cause of mortality in captive prairie chickens. 3aepidemiological studies 3aendangered species 3aoncogenic viruses 3aimmunosuppression 3adisease prevalence 3areticuloendotheliosis 3alymphosarcoma 3amolecular genetics 3awild birds 3aindigenous species 3astrains 3aReticuloendotheliosis virus 3ahistopathology 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathologyxvirology. 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aFemale 2aGalliformesxvirology 2aMale 2aReticuloendotheliosis, Avianxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 0aimmunosuppression (physiological) 0aTympanuchus cupido pinnatus 0aTympanuchus cupido attwateri1 aCheng, S.1 aBarbosa, T.1 aHaefele, H.0 tAvian diseases.g2006 Dec., v. 50, no. 4 p.520-525dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/7655-052806R.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20071128b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle03628naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245016500209300001800374506007600392520181900468592002802287596004002315506003702355650001402392650001202406650000902418650002402427650001902451650001802470650001602488650001602504650002202520650000902542650001102551650001502562650001302577650002002590650001302610650002402623650002002647650001402667700002302681700001502704700001902719700003502738700006102773773014802834856008302982852000903065655001203074IND60647081620221207084743.0190816e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064708162DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-019-01816-z2doi7 aPMC65710872pmcid7 a311398602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNitride, Chiara13aAn assessment of the impact of extraction and digestion protocols on multiplexed targeted protein quantification by mass spectrometry for egg and milk allergens  ap. 3463-3475.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe unintentional presence of even trace amounts of certain foods constitutes a major hazard for those who suffer from food allergies. For many food industries, product and raw ingredient surveillance forms part of their risk assessment procedures. This may require the detection of multiple allergens in a wide variety of matrices. Mass spectrometry offers a possible solution for the quantification of multiple allergens in a single analysis. The capability of MS to quantify many peptides from a complex protein digestion is well known. However, a lack of matrix certified reference materials has made the optimisation of extraction and digestion conditions for multiplexed allergen quantification difficult to assess. Here, we report a systematic study, using preliminary screening followed by a Design of Experiments approach, to find the optimal buffer and digestion conditions for detecting milk and egg protein markers in a model processed food matrix. Five of the most commonly used buffers, two chaotropic reagents and two reducing reagents were assessed for the optimal extraction of multiple protein markers. While the choice of background buffer had little impact, the use of chaotropic and reducing reagents showed significant benefits for the extraction of most proteins. A full factorial design experiment was applied to the parameters shown to have a significant impact on protein recovery. These studies suggest that a single optimal set of extraction conditions enabling the quantitative recovery of all proteins is not easily achieved. Therefore, although MS is capable of the simultaneous quantification of many peptides in a single run, greater consideration of protein extraction is required before these are applied for multiplex allergen quantification in food matrices.

Pullorum). The plasmid is 67,685 bp in size and has 72 putative genes. pQJDSal1 harbors a conserved IncX1-type backbone with predicted regions for conjugation, replication and partitioning, as well as a toxin/antitoxin plasmid addiction system. Two regions (A and B) that have not been previously reported in IncX1 plasmids are inserted into the backbone. Region A (10.7 kb), inserted between parA and taxD, consists of a new Tn6168-like transposon containing an arsenic resistant operon arsB2CHR and sulfonamide resistance gene sul2. Region B contains another arsenic resistant operon arsADHR, resistance gene blaTEM-1B and three transposable elements. Conjugation experiments showed that pQJDSal1 could transfer from S. Pullorum to Escherichia coli (E. coli) J53. Statistical analysis of 70 sequenced IncX1 plasmids revealed that IncX1 plasmids harbored various antibiotic resistance genes. The results highlight the importance of IncX1 plasmids in disseminating antibiotic resistance genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3aantitoxins 3aarsenic 3aoperon 3aplasmids 3astatistical analysis 3atransposons 0aIncX1 0aS.

The translation of immunological knowledge about CHB into therapeutic strategies aiming to a sustainable hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance has been challenging. In recent years, however, the understanding on the immune effectors required to overcome chronicity has notably increased thanks to preclinical and clinical research. Therapeutic vaccination may prove to be useful for treating CHB patients when coupled with current antiviral agents and other immunomodulatory strategies. This review summarizes current data and future perspectives on therapeutic vaccination. Other treatment alternatives that could be combined with vaccines for a complete cure from hepatitis B virus infection are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aantiviral agents 3achronic hepatitis B 3aclinical trials 3ahepatoma 3aliver 3apatients 3apeople 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aHepatitis B 0aChronic infection 0aTherapeutic vaccine 0aImmunotherapy 0aImmune response 0aClinical trials1 aMichel, Marie-Louise0 tVaccine.g2017 Apr. 25, v. 35, no. 18 p.2308-2314dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002200147245010800169300001400277520123600291592002801527650001801555650001601573650001001589650001201599650001501611650002501626650001201651650001301663650001001676700002401686700001801710773007801728856008301806852000901889655001201898IND4470977620221118014530.0150812e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447097762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2012.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrieri, Ramona10aDisinhibition is easier learned than inhibition. The effects of (dis)inhibition training on food intake  ap. 96-99.  aImpulsivity seems to be a strong candidate when it comes to psychological factors leading to overeating and eventually to obesity (Guerrieri, Nederkoorn, & Jansen, 2008). The question is whether reversing the logic and strengthening an individual’s inhibitory skills will be equally potent against overeating. In the current study the stop signal task was adjusted so that one group of female students (n=21) gradually got more trials in which they could practise inhibition (inhibition), whereas another group (n=20) gradually got more trials in which they had to react quickly, without having time to think or inhibit (impulsivity). A third group (n=20) did a neutral reading task (control). The participants in the impulsivity group had a significantly higher caloric intake during a subsequent taste test, whereas the inhibition group did not differ from the control group. Hence, the data support that impulsivity is a direct cause of overeating. However, the concept of inhibition training needs to be investigated further. Issues like the specificity of inhibition training (general vs. food specific) need to be addressed and used to optimise the training so that its effectiveness can be tested within clinical settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3afoods 3aobesity 3aovereating 3apsychosocial factors 3areading 3astudents 3ataste1 aNederkoorn, Chantal1 aJansen, Anita0 tAppetite.g2012 Aug., v. 59, no. 1 p.96-99dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03570naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012000173506011700293506007600410520182300486592002802309506003702337650001802374650003002392650001202422650002102434650001902455650001302474650001502487650001502502650001102517650002602528650001502554650001602569651002502585651001002610653001802620653002202638653002102660653002002681653001802701653001502719653001102734700003202745700002302777700003002800773011602830856008502946852000903031655001203040IND60776528920221207054909.0220523e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077652892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2022.1202682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamarero, J.

Pollarding is a traditional management technique used to obtain timber and firewood. However, these woodlands are subjected to different stressors in rapidly depopulating rural regions under continental Mediterranean areas where riparian black poplar (Populus nigra) pollards are widespread but still understudied. First, the rapid rural depopulation has lead to the abandonment of pollarding creating trees with abundant, thick and heavy branches. Second, climate warming and alteration of river flows reduce soil moisture which could contribute to growth decline of riparian pollards. We investigated how these stress factors have impacted radial growth in seven sites located in four river basins of southern Aragón, north eastern Spain. We used dendrochronology to reconstruct the changes in radial growth during the period 1890–2020 and to assess how growth has responded to changes in temperature, precipitation and river flow variability. Since 1900 growth suppressions, probably corresponding to pollarding events, occurred in several decades (1910s, 1960s, 1980s and 1990s) and showed a high variability among sites and river basins. Suppressions peaked during the 1940s, probably associated to intense pollarding related to high timber and firewood demand after the Spanish Civil War. Poplar radial growth increased in response to high precipitation and river flow from March to April, particularly in sites located away of river banks. Pollarding abandonment and declines in soil moisture availability threaten the persistence of veteran black poplars. Active management through pollarding and protection should be implemented to preserve these iconic, anthropogenic woodlands due to their multiple ecological and cultural services.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPopulus nigra 3aadministrative management 3aclimate 3adendrochronology 3aforest ecology 3afuelwood 3apollarding 3ariver flow 3arivers 3arural urban migration 3asoil water 3atemperature 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 0aDendroecology 0aFloodplain forest 0aLand-use changes 0aPollarded trees 0aPopulus nigra 0aRiver flow 0aTeruel1 aGonzález de Andrés, Ester1 aColangelo, Michele1 aJaime Lorén, Chabier de,0 tForest ecology and management.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 517 p.120268-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.1202683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001100141245010100152520156000253592002801813650002401841650002201865650001501887700001301902700001601915700001801931700001401949700001201963700001801975700001601993700001702009700002102026773015902047856007502206852000902281655001202290IND60649185320221118040910.0190703e20180614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064918532DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi70602152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Ya10aConstruction and Optimization of Three-Dimensional Disaster Scenes within Mobile Virtual Reality  aBecause mobile virtual reality (VR) is both mobile and immersive, three-dimensional (3D) visualizations of disaster scenes based in mobile VR enable users to perceive and recognize disaster environments faster and better than is possible with other methods. To achieve immersion and prevent users from feeling dizzy, such visualizations require a high scene-rendering frame rate. However, the existing related visualization work cannot provide a sufficient solution for this purpose. This study focuses on the construction and optimization of a 3D disaster scene in order to satisfy the high frame-rate requirements for the rendering of 3D disaster scenes in mobile VR. First, the design of a plugin-free browser/server (B/S) architecture for 3D disaster scene construction and visualization based in mobile VR is presented. Second, certain key technologies for scene optimization are discussed, including diverse modes of scene data representation, representation optimization of mobile scenes, and adaptive scheduling of mobile scenes. By means of these technologies, smartphones with various performance levels can achieve higher scene-rendering frame rates and improved visual quality. Finally, using a flood disaster as an example, a plugin-free prototype system was developed, and experiments were conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that a 3D disaster scene constructed via the methods addressed in this study has a sufficiently high scene-rendering frame rate to satisfy the requirements for rendering a 3D disaster scene in mobile VR.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3amobile telephones 3aprototypes1 aZhu, Jun1 aLi, Weilian1 aZhang, Yunhao1 aZhu, Qing1 aQi, Hua1 aZhang, Huixin1 aCao, Zhenyu1 aYang, Weijun1 aZhang, Pengcheng0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2018 June 14, v. 7, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi70602153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01485naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245016800176300001800344520041500362592002800777650002300805650001900828650002700847650001300874650002100887700002300908700002600931700002800957773009600985856008101081852000901162655001201171IND60724970820221120204336.0210124e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072497082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.08.1412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmendarez-Camarillo, A.10aEffect of chemical modification of titanium dioxide surface with dicarboxylic acid on the crystalline parameters and rheology behavior in polypropylene composites.  ap. 1220-1223.  aIn this document, we present the effect of the surface modification of titanium dioxide particles with dicarboxylic acid on the rheological behavior of isotactic polypropylene composites.

The approach is innovative along two different dimensions, namely: (1) we extract Volatility Factors from panels of filtered volatilities — in particular large panels of univariate ARCH-type models and propose methods to estimate common Volatility Factors in the presence of estimation error and (2) we price equity volatility risk using factors which go beyond the equity class namely Volatility Factors extracted from panels of volatilities of short-run funding spreads. The role of these Volatility Factors is compared with the corresponding factors extracted from the panels of the above spreads as well as related factors proposed in the literature. Our monthly short-run funding spreads Volatility Factors provide both in- and out-of-sample predictive gains for forecasting the monthly VIX, RV as well as the equity premium, while the corresponding daily volatility factors via Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) models provide further improvements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3afunding 3aprediction 3aprices 3arisk 3avariance 0aC2 0aC5 0aG1 0aFactor asset pricing models 0aVolatility Factors 0aARCH filters1 aGhysels, Eric0 tJournal of econometrics.g2021 Feb., v. 220, no. 2 p.366-398dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009700173300001300270520103600283592002801319650004001347650002801387650001601415650001301431650001001444650002001454650002301474650001201497650001301509650001401522653002801536653003301564653002401597653001301621653002001634700001901654773008601673856008601759852000901845655001201854IND60615679120221121233139.0181127e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061567912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plasmid.2018.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurya, Ganesh K.10aPlasmids for making multiple knockouts in a radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans  ap. 6-13.  aThe gene knockouts are mostly created using homologous recombination-based replacement of target gene(s) with the expressing cassette of selection marker gene(s).

Unlike single mutants, the double and triple mutants showed growth retardation under normal growth conditions and the synergistic effects with Topoisomerase II inhibitor on the growth of this bacterium.

We reported here a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based proteomics analysis of rat subcellular fractions of the pancreas during the early phase of experimental AP, using a sixplex isobaric chemical labeling technique. We identified 997 unique proteins, of which 353 were significantly different (22, 276 or 55 in both, the soluble or the membrane fractions, respectively).Accordingly, using TMT proteomics and bioinformatic tools, in García-Hernández et al., 2018- [1] we were able to detect significant changes in protein expression related to many pathobiological pathways of AP as from the early phase of the disease, including some changes never described before in this disease.

The purpose of this study is to determine if a difference exists in the long-term seropositivity of anti-VZV antibodies in a cohort of young adults who were vaccinated against varicella as compared to a similar cohort with a history of chickenpox disease, and to determine which variables best predict waning seropositivity following varicella vaccination.This retrospective cohort study captures immunization and serology data from approximately 10,000 recruits who entered basic military training between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2015, and who have childhood immunization records in the Air Force Aeromedical Services Information Management System. Varicella vaccine immunogenicity was determined relative to the immunogenicity of chickenpox disease, as measured by multiplex flow immunoassay. Among vaccine recipients, waning seroimmunity was modeled and adjusted for several important covariates.Basic military trainees who received varicella vaccine in childhood were 24% less likely to be seropositive to VZV than trainees who were exempt from vaccine due to a history of chickenpox disease. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between male and female trainees. The odds of a vaccinated trainee being seropositive to VZV decreased by 8% with each year elapsed since vaccination. Seroprevalence declined below estimated herd immunity thresholds in vaccinated trainees born after 1994, and in the cohort as a whole for trainees born after 1995.Despite prior vaccination, seroimmunity in a large cohort of young adults unexposed to wild-type VZV failed to meet the estimated threshold for herd immunity. If vaccination in accordance with the current US VZV vaccination schedule is inadequate to maintain herd immunity, young adults not previously exposed to wild-type VZV may be at increased risk for varicella outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3aserological surveys 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 3 3aseroprevalence 3aimmunoassays 3aantibodies 3acohort studies 3amales 3avaccines 3aserology 3ayoung adults 3aherd immunity 3aimmune response 3avaccination 3achildhood 3afemales 3aUnited States 0aChickenpox 0aHerd immunity 0aVaccine 0aImmunogenicity 0aVaricella 0aOutbreak 0aHuman herpesvirus 3 0arecords1 aWitkop, Catherine T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5366-26631 aWebber, Bryant J.1 aCostello, Amy A.0 tVaccine.g2017 Apr. 25, v. 35, no. 18 p.2351-2357dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.03.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245016000161300001600321500002000337520162700357592002801984650002002012650001502032650002502047650002402072650001302096650002002109650002202129650001702151650000902168650001702177650001602194650003602210650001402246650001902260650001202279650002002291650001002311650002202321650002102343700002002364700001802384700005602402773012302458856007402581852000902655655001202664IND60775703020221118055153.0220427e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077570302DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.150192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrivedi, Sunil P.10aMercuric chloride‐induced oxidative stress, genotoxicity, haematological changes and histopathological alterations in fish Channa punctatus (Bloch, 1793)  ap. 868-883.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study was undertaken to investigate the adverse effects of mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) overload in the fish Channa punctatus. Two sublethal test concentrations of HgCl₂ (1/20th and 1/10th of 96 h LC₅₀ i.e., 0.03 mg l⁻¹ (low concentration) and 0.07 mg l⁻¹ (high concentration), respectively, were used for exposure. Blood, liver and kidney tissues of the control and exposed specimens were sampled at intervals of 15, 30, and 45 days to assess alterations in oxidative stress, genotoxicity haematological parameters and histopathology. Significant changes in Hb%, RBC count, WBC count, antioxidant enzyme activity, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione reductase (GR), were recorded. Micronuclei (MN) induction, nuclear abnormalities (NAs) and histopathological alterations were also observed in the exposed fish. Significant (P < 0.05) increase in the activities of SOD, CAT, GSH and GR was observed. After 45 days, a decrease in the level of GSH and GR was noticed which suggests an undermined anti‐oxidative defence system in the fish exposed to HgCl₂. Histological examination of the liver and kidney showed serious tissue injury and histological alterations. Significant increases in MN and NA frequencies reveal the DNA damage in erythrocytes of fish, and haematological changes show the toxicological potential of HgCl₂. The observed changes in the antioxidant defence system, genotoxicity and haematological and histological changes in the present study provide the most extensive insight into HgCl₂ stress in C. punctatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChanna punctata 3aDNA damage 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocyte count 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3agenotoxicity 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3aleukocyte count 3aliver 3amercuric chloride 3aoxidative stress1 aSingh, Shefalee1 aTrivedi, Abha1 aKumar, Manoj1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9895-06850 tJournal of fish biology.g2022 Apr., v. 100, no. 4 p.868-883dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.150193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007200172300001600244520119500260592002801455650002301483650002301506650002201529650001601551650000901567653000801576653000801584653000801592653001501600653001901615653002401634700002001658773011201678856008601790852000901876655001201885IND60692588020221122041845.0210121e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069258802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreitung, Jörg,10aEstimation of heterogeneous panels with systematic slope variations  ap. 399-415.  aWe analyse estimation procedures for the panel data models with heterogeneous slopes. Specifically we take into account a possible dependence between regressors and heterogeneous slope coefficients, which is referred to as systematic variation. It is shown that under relevant forms of systematic slope variations (i) the pooled OLS estimator is severely biased, (ii) Swamy’s GLS estimator is inconsistent if the number of time periods T is fixed, whereas (iii) the mean-group estimator always provides consistent estimators at the risk of high variances. Following Mundlak (1978) we propose an augmentated regression which results in a simple and robust version of the pooled estimator. The latter approach avoids the risk of large standard errors of the mean-group estimator, whenever T is small. We also propose two test statistics for systematic slope variation using the Lagrange multiplier and Hausman principles. We derive their asymptotic properties and provide a local power analysis of both test statistics. Monte Carlo experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and show that for all combinations of N and T the Mundlak-type GLS estimator outperform all other estimators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3amultipliers 3arisk 0aC13 0aC23 0aC33 0aPanel data 0aRandom effects 0aSlope heterogeneity1 aSalish, Nazarii0 tJournal of econometrics.g2021 Feb., v. 220, no. 2 p.399-415dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245015200171300001600323520124500339592002801584650001601612650002101628650002501649650001201674650001801686650002301704650001001727650001701737700001601754700001301770773011301783856008801896852000901984655001201993IND4477985420221123012742.0150812e20121011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447798542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoureslami, R.10aEffect of ileal sub-section and the method of collection of digesta on the determination of apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids in broilers  ap. 130-133.  aThis study investigated the effect of the site of digestive sampling (terminal ileum vs. entire ileum) and the method of digesta collection (flushing vs. squeezing) on the determination of ileal amino acid (AA) digestibility in broilers. An experimental diet was formulated based on soybean meal and dextrose. The diet was fed to broiler chickens from 14 to 18days of age. Twenty four replicate pens (twelve birds each) were given access to the experimental diet. Ileal contents were collected after euthanizing the birds by cervical dislocation at 18days of age. Digesta were collected from the terminal (last 15cm of the distal ileum) or entire ileum using either by flushing or squeezing with saline solution. The section from which the digesta were collected did not have a significant impact on the AA digestibility coefficients. However, values were higher (P<0.01) when based on digesta samples that were collected via flushing than digesta collected via squeezing. The results suggest that flushing procedure to determine AA digestibility is a more accurate procedure than squeezing the digesta from ileum. However, the digestive section (terminal or entire ileum) of collection of digesta did not affect the CAID of AA in broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abroiler chickens 3acervical dislocation 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3aexperimental diets 3aileum 3asoybean meal1 aBatal, A.B.1 aJung, B.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2012 Oct. 11, v. 177, no. 1-2 p.130-133dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245014700196300001600343500002000359520154700379592002801926650002101954650001701975650002901992650001902021650000902040650001502049650001802064650001102082650001102093651002202104700002202126700001902148700002202167700002002189773012302209856007402332852000902406655001202415IND60775703120221118055145.0220427e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077570312DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.150252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllan, Sam J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5326-414710aSearching for seadragons: predicting micro‐habitat use for the common (weedy) seadragon (Phyllopteryx taeniolatus) based on habitat and prey  ap. 935-943.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHabitat associations can be critical predictors of larger‐scale organism distributions and range shifts. Here the authors consider how a critical habitat, kelp (Ecklonia radiata) and prey (mysid crustacean swarms), can influence small‐ and large‐scale distribution on the iconic common (weedy) seadragon (Phyllopteryx taeniolatus:Syngnathidae). P. taeniolatus are charismatic fish endemic to the temperate reefs of southern Australia, reported to range from Geraldton, Western Australia (28.7667°S, 114.6167°E) around southern Australia to Port Stephens, New South Wales (32.614369°S, 152.325676°E). The authors test a previously developed model of seadragon habitat preferences to predict P. taeniolatus occurrence within four sites from Sydney to the northern limit of their range in eastern Australia. They determined that P. taeniolatus associations with Ecklonia and mysid shrimp can be extrapolated across multiple sites to predict the occurrence of individual P. taeniolatus within a location/site. For instance, the authors demonstrated a significant positive relationship between the density of mysid swarms and the density of P. taeniolatus, evident across all sites despite large differences in the density of mysid swarms among sites. The findings are the first to model P. taeniolatus habitat associations across multiple sites to the northern limit of their range and have applications in protecting P. taeniolatus populations and how they may respond under climate change scenarios, such as poleward kelp retractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEcklonia radiata 3aMalacostraca 3aPhyllopteryx taeniolatus 3aclimate change 3afish 3amacroalgae 3amicrohabitats 3amodels 3ashrimp 3aWestern Australia1 aO'Connell, Max J.1 aHarasti, David1 aKlanten, O.

Flower Bud Emergence and Flower Formation  ap. 1531-1541.  aUnder Florida conditions, sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) affected by Huanglongbing {HLB [Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas)]} frequently exhibits irregular flowering patterns, including off-season flowering and prolonged bloom period. Such patterns can increase the opportunity for temporal and spatial proliferation of pathogens that infect flower petals, including the fungal causal agent for postbloom fruit drop (PFD) Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds. For the development of strategies to manipulate flowering, the effects of floral inhibitor gibberellic acid (GA₃) sprayed monthly at full- and half-strength rates (49 and 25 g·ha⁻¹, or 33 and 17 mg·L⁻¹, respectively) with different regimens, starting from September and ending in November, December, or January, on the pattern of spring bloom were evaluated in field-grown HLB-affected ‘Valencia’ sweet orange at two locations in subsequent February through April for two separate years in this study. To further examine whether GA₃ effects on flowering patterns vary in different cultivars, early-maturing ‘Navel’ sweet orange trees receiving no GA₃ or full-strength GA₃ monthly in September through January were included. Overall, for ‘Valencia’ sweet orange, monthly applications of GA₃ at 49 g·ha⁻¹ from September to December not only minimized the incidence of scattered emergence of flower buds and open flowers before the major bloom but also shortened the duration of flowering, compared with the untreated control trees. In addition, exogenous GA₃ led to decreased leaf flowering locus t (FT) expression starting in December, as well as reduced expression of its downstream flower genes in buds during later months. When applied monthly from September through January at 49 g·ha⁻¹, similar influences of exogenous GA₃ on repressing flower bud formation and compressing bloom period were observed in ‘Navel’ sweet orange. These results suggest that by effectively manipulating flowering in HLB-affected sweet orange trees under the Florida climate conditions, exogenous GA₃ may be used to reduce early sporadic flowering and thereby shorten the window of C. acutatum infection that causes loss in fruit production.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 0aCitrus sinensis 0aColletotrichum actutatum 0apostbloom fruit drop (PFD)1 aSingh, Garima1 aDewdney, Megan1 aVashisth, Tripti0 tHortScience.g2021 Dec., v. 56, no. 12 p.1531-1541dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:28404x2327-98347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI16080-213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011100160300002000271520089300291592002801184596009801212596009801310596009801408596009401506596010501600596012101705650003401826650001601860650002101876653003701897653001901934653002701953653001001980653002301990700001802013700001902031700001302050700005602063700001702119773014102136856007902277852000902356655001202365IND60778346820221120214158.0220525e20220512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077834682DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c029772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Wanlong10aEnhanced Performance of Organic Field-Effect Transistors by a Molecular Dopant with High Electron Affinity  ap. 23709-23716.  aOrganic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are attractive for next-generation electronics, while doping plays an important role in their performance optimization. In this work, a soluble molecular dopant with high electron affinity, CN6-CP, is investigated to manipulate the performance of OFETs with a p-type organic semiconductor as the transport layer. The performance of the model 2,7-didodecyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C12-BTBT) bottom-gate top-contact (BGTC) OFETs is greatly optimized upon doping by CN6-CP, and the field-effect mobility is improved from 5.5 to 11.1 cm² V–¹ s–¹, with a widely tunable threshold voltage from −40 to +5 V. Improvements in performance also appear in CN6-CP doped BGBC OFETs. As compared with commonly used molecular dopant F4-TCNQ, CN6-CP exhibits excellent doping effects and great potential for organic electronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a21973072cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51873172cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51907148cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2018M643648cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858  axjh012019023cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  a2021GXLH-Z-055cthe Key Scientific and Technological Innovation Team Project of Shaanxi Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectronics 3amodel validation 0aorganic field-effect transistors 0aorganic doping 0aorganic semiconductors 0atraps 0athreshold voltages1 aCao, Jingning1 aZhai, Chenyang1 aBu, Laju1 aLu, Guanghao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7829-73081 aZhu, Yuanwei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 May 12, v. 14, no. 20 p.23709-23716dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c029773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01585naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245014300165520062700308592002800935650001100963650001300974650003700987650001001024650001601034700002201050700001701072773012101089856007601210852000901286655001201295IND60757621220221120074116.0211125e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075762122DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111133192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrsolini, Morgan F.13aAn Update on Semen Physiology, Technologies, and Selection Techniques for the Advancement of In Vitro Equine Embryo Production: Section II  aAs the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and in vitro embryo production (IVP) expand in the equine industry, it has become necessary to further our understanding of available semen selection techniques.

However, these gases are environmental pollutants, and their emission into the atmosphere undermines the value they create. In the face of climate change, CO₂ emissions require attention on an unprecedented scale. Abatement technologies focused on carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCUS) enable the continued use of processes and resources that produce CO₂ (and other acid gases) while minimizing their effect on the environment. This review explores the role sorbents play in emission abatement and the acid gas “economy”. We identify 15 sorbent categories, evaluating their performance at both the material and the system levels. We conclude with anticipated research opportunities and future trends in acid gas separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aprocess design 3asorbents1 aHatton, T.

Helical-crack root hairs are first found in the attachment system, representing specialized structures for surface anchorage. The morphological variability of attachment organs reflects diverse climbing strategies. One such anchoring mode in clinging-climbers involves the time-dependent interaction between roots and the support: By naturally occurring adhesive roots with root hairs, the plant can ascend on supports of any shape and size. As a typical root-climber, Syngonium podophyllum develops elongate aerial roots at nodes. Here, we studied its attachment behavior from the external morphology to the internal structure in detail. Through SEM and LM observation on several root-substrate interfaces, we suggested that the attachment of aerial roots was mediated by a multi-step process, in which root hairs played significant roles in releasing mucilaginous substance and securing the durable anchorage. We summarized all the types of shape changes of root hairs with particular focus on the abnormal transition from a tube to a helical-crack ribbon. We demonstrated our understanding with respect to the formation of the helical-crack root hairs, based on the structural evidence of cellulose microfibrils orientation on the cell wall lamellae. The helical-crack root hairs serving as energy-dissipating units retard the failure of adhesion under high winds and loads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSyngonium podophyllum 3acell walls 3acellulose microfibrils 3aroot hairs 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awind speed1 aDeng, Wenli0 tPlanta.g2017 Mar., v. 245, no. 3 p.507-521dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-016-2621-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010800164300002000272520200900292592002802301650003502329650002202364650002102386650001802407650001402425650001702439650004102456650001402497650002002511650001702531650002702548650001802575650001502593650002502608700002002633700002102653700002502674700002802699700001902727700002202746700002302768700001802791700002302809700002302832700002302855700001802878700002202896700002202918700001702940773014902957856008103106852000903187655001203196IND60547762320221117040920.0170725e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054776232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4982-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeath, Ester10aFirst inter-laboratory comparison exercise for the determination of anticancer drugs in aqueous samples  ap. 14692-14704.  aThe results of an inter-laboratory comparison exercise to determine cytostatic anticancer drug residues in surface water, hospital wastewater and wastewater treatment plant effluent are reported. To obtain a critical number of participants, an invitation was sent out to potential laboratories identified to have the necessary knowledge and instrumentation. Nine laboratories worldwide confirmed their participation in the exercise. The compounds selected (based on the extent of use and laboratories capabilities) included cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, etoposide, methotrexate and cisplatinum. Samples of spiked waste (hospital and wastewater treatment plant effluent) and surface water, and additional non-spiked hospital wastewater, were prepared by the organising laboratory (Jožef Stefan Institute) and sent out to each participant partner for analysis. All analytical methods included solid phase extraction (SPE) and the use of surrogate/internal standards for quantification. Chemical analysis was performed using either liquid or gas chromatography mass (MS) or tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry. Cisplatinum was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A required minimum contribution of five laboratories meant that only cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, methotrexate and etoposide could be included in the statistical evaluation. z-score and Q test revealed 3 and 4 outliers using classical and robust approach, respectively. The smallest absolute differences between the spiked values and the measured values were observed in the surface water matrix. The highest within-laboratory repeatability was observed for methotrexate in all three matrices (CV ≤ 12 %). Overall, inter-laboratory reproducibility was poor for all compounds and matrices (CV 27–143 %) with the only exception being methotrexate measured in the spiked hospital wastewater (CV = 8 %). Random and total errors were identified by means of Youden plots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achemical analysis 3acyclophosphamide 3adrug residues 3aetoposide 3afluorouracil 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahospitals 3ainstrumentation 3amethotrexate 3asolid phase extraction 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aČesen, Marjeta1 aNegreira, Noelia1 ade Alda, Miren Lopez1 aFerrando-Climent, Laura1 aBlahova, Lucie1 aNguyen, Tung Viet1 aAdahchour, Mohamed1 aRuebel, Achim1 aLlewellyn, Neville1 aŠčančar, Janez,1 aNovaković, Srdjan1 aMislej, Vesna1 aStražar, Marjeta1 aBarceló, Damià,1 aKosjek, Tina0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Aug., v. 23, no. 15 p.14692-14704dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4982-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003700113040001800150100001900168245012000187300001800307500000900325520160300334592002801937650001301965650000901978650002201987650001702009650001802026650001502044650002202059650001502081650002502096650001702121650002602138650002402164650002202188650002002210650001602230650001802246650002402264650002102288650002502309651001302334651001202347651001302359700002202372700002302394700002502417700001902442700002402461700001802485700001602503700001802519700002002537773012202557852000902679856011202688856008402800961001202884655001202896IND4406621720221121015055.0191228e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440662172DNAL7 a10113/175902hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2007.08.04902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestra, Philip10aWeed Population Dynamics after Six Years under Glyphosate- and Conventional Herbicide-based Weed Control Strategies  ap. 1170-1177.  aepub  aField studies using glyphosate-resistant corn (Zea mays L.), sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.), and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were conducted at Scottsbluff, NE, Torrington, WY, and Fort Collins, CO, over 6 yr to evaluate weed population dynamics under glyphosate- and conventional herbicide–based weed control strategies. We report the response of common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), wild buckwheat (Polygonum convolvulus L.), and all grasses combined to four management strategies imbedded in two crop rotations. There were no consistent or highly significant benefits from a diverse crop rotation versus continuous corn when weed control was considered. Rotating herbicide mode of action for general weed control provided no benefit above that provided by glyphosate at 0.8 kg acid equivalent (ae) ha⁻¹ applied twice each year. There was no evidence that any weed species developed resistance to glyphosate. The most striking finding of these studies was the buildup of common lambsquarters and wild buckwheat that occurs when glyphosate is applied at 0.4 kg ae ha⁻¹ twice each year. Such a low-use-rate approach is to be completely discouraged since it appears to enrich the gene pool for individuals that survive low rates of glyphosate. The continuing decline in the real cost of glyphosate should eliminate any legitimate reason for growers to consider using less than the full labeled rate of glyphosate. All treatments that included glyphosate at all three locations over 6 yr provided significantly better grass control than the nonglyphosate conventional treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aTriticum aestivum 3aspring wheat 3aBeta vulgaris 3asugar beet 3atransgenic plants 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3aweed control 3afield experimentation 3apopulation dynamics 3aChenopodium album 3abroadleaf weeds 3agrass weeds 3acrop rotation 3amechanism of action 3aapplication rate 3aFallopia convolvulus 3aNebraska 3aWyoming 3aColorado1 aWilson, Robert G.1 aMiller, Stephen D.1 aStahlman, Phillip W.1 aWicks, Gail W.1 aChapman, Phillip L.1 aWithrow, John1 aLegg, David1 aAlford, Craig1 aGaines, Todd A.0 tCrop science.g2008 May, v. 48, no. 3 p.1170-1177dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/175903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2007.08.04903Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02102naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010600166300001600272520116400288592002801452650002001480650002001500650001401520650001601534653001501550653001201565653001301577653000901590773009601599856008401695852000901779655001201788IND50075387520221120183337.0150324e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007538752DNAL7 a10.1080/03066150.2013.7994652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOya, Carlos10aMethodological reflections on ‘land grab’ databases and the ‘land grab’ literature ‘rush’  ap. 503-520.  aThis article focuses on two issues. First, it critically engages with the emerging global databases on large-scale land deals and the ‘data’ on global trends so far circulated, paying special attention to their accuracy and reliability, and the extent to which they represent an instance of ‘false precision’. The usefulness of these datasets and some of the possible side effects of their abuse or bad use are also critically explored. Second, the article considers some important methodological problems that may lie behind the fast-growing research on ‘land grabs’. In particular, some of the untested assumptions implicit in many of the existing studies as well as the problematic dichotomies that often influence researchers' interpretations of available evidence will be critically discussed, emphasizing the need for greater ‘reflexivity’ in current ‘land grab’ research. The paper concludes that the need for methodological rigour is not a luxury, but rather politically and tactically crucial from the point of view of those who campaign against real dispossession and exploitation. There is no shortcut for good quality evidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aresearchers 0aland grabs 0amethods 0aevidence 0abias0 tJournal of peasant studies.g2013 May 1, v. 40, no. 3 p.503-520dRoutledgex1743-93617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2013.7994653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
