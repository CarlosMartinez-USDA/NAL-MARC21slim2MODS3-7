It is shown that a combination of efficiency and flexibility can be reached across a range of group sizes if (1) mass recruitment is combined with a low level of group recruitment, and (2) contact rates are weakly regulated. These results are discussed in relation to empirical work. 3aFormicidae 3asocial insects 3aforaging 3aanimal communication 3agroup size 3asocial behavior 3amathematical models 0aefficiency 0arecruitment based foraging 0agroup recruitment1 aTheraulaz, G.1 aDeneubourg, J.L.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1998 Nov. 21, v. 195, no. 2 p.157-166x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02974naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100002400165245010300189300001600292500002400308500001500332520113200347650002201479650002001501650002501521650001301546650002001559650001401579650001501593650001301608650002501621650001001646650001201656650002101668650002001689650003701709650003901746650003901785650004101824650005501865650004701920650001001967653001301977653002301990700001902013700001902032700001602051773016002067852000902227856007702236930003302313945002502346946001302371655001202384IND4416779220221120120230.0090224e20090211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441677922DNAL7 a191522642pmid7 a10.1021/jf803039b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL6001 aRehfeldt, Charlotte10aDose-Dependent Effects of Genistein and Daidzein on Protein Metabolism in Porcine Myotube Cultures  ap. 852-857.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was conducted to investigate whether the isoflavones genistein and daidzein, which are components of soy-based diets, and the estrogen 17β-estradiol affect differentiation and protein metabolism of porcine skeletal muscle cells in vitro. Serum-free porcine myotube cultures expressing the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ were treated with various concentrations of genistein, daidzein, or 17β-estradiol for 26 h. The degree of differentiation by creatine phosphokinase activity was not altered by treatment. At 100 μmol/L both genistein and daidzein caused decreases in protein amount due to cell loss. In addition, 100 μmol/L genistein reduced protein synthesis rate of the surviving cells (P < 0.05) measured as [3H]-phenylalanine incorporation. Interestingly, genistein (0.1 μmol/L), daidzein (10, 100 μmol/L), and 17β-estradiol (0.1, 1 nmol/L) slightly reduced protein degradation (P < 0.05). The results suggest that both genistein and daidzein affect protein metabolism in a dose-dependent manner and that estrogenic actions may play a role in decreasing protein degradation in porcine skeletal muscle. 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein content 3abioactive properties 3amyocytes 3askeletal muscle 3agenistein 3acell lines 3adaidzein 3acell differentiation 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCells, Cultured 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEstradiolxadministration & dosage 2aGenisteinxadministration & dosage 2aIsoflavonesxadministration & dosage 2aMuscle Fibers, Skeletalxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMuscle Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSwine 0amyotubes 0aprotein metabolism1 aKalbe, Claudia1 aNurnberg, Gerd1 aMau, Marcus0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Feb. 11, v. 57, no. 3 p.852-857dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf803039b3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090319b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/19  aOther US 7aarticle01860naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008500165300001600250500002400266520088600290650001501176650002201191650001301213650002301226650002401249650002001273700003501293700002401328773010001352852000901452856008501461655001201546IND4427144920221120120223.0091012s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442714492DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617090500632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeryabin, D.

Nonlinear dependency of the inhibition of binding of AHB-modified antibodies on the AHB chemical structures and concentrations was revealed by enzyme immunoassay. Hexylresorcinol was shown to decrease the antibody affinity and avidity indices and simultaneously increase the indices of nonspecific binding of AHB-modified antibodies to antigens, thereby promoting the formation of “false” antigen-antibody complexes. The nonspecificity of the influence of AHB on the antigenbinding capacity of antibodies is an important characteristic of these effects, which allows us to consider AHB as unique “superhaptenes”. 3aantibodies 3aantibody affinity 3aantigens 3achemical structure 3aenzyme immunoassays 3ahexylresorcinol1 aMikhailenko-(Romanenko), N.

This compound was found to persist in the cells treated with gentamycin and chloramphenicol, while treatment with gramicidin C, ampicillin, benzyl viologen, furadonin, and mercury chloride resulted in a drastic decrease of its intracellular content. Cultivation of M. luteus in a medium with EDTA resulted in accumulation of much higher amounts of lysodektose (up to 300%), and this phenomenon is interpreted as an indication of the possible siderophore function of the compound. Since the M. luteus genome was recently sequenced, this may help to understand the fate and role of lysodektose in bacterial metabolism. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aampicillin 3abacteria 3achloramphenicol 3adeuterium 3agenome 3agentamicin 3agramicidin 3amercuric chloride 3ametabolism 3asiderophores1 aGalon, I.

In this study, we compared the acaricidal properties of spinosad with the commercial bioacaricide abamectin on the life stages of TSSM. Adulticide and ovicide bioassays were performed on a susceptible laboratory strain using direct spraying of leaf disks with five rates of spinosad (20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 mg/l), five rates of abamectin (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2.5 mg/l), sublethal concentrations or a combination of spinosad and abamectin. Both adulticidal and ovicidal effects of spinosad against T. urticae in the laboratory were apparent, based on morality rates of the adults, reduction of female fecundity and death of offspring. Abamectin was also found to significantly reduce female fecundity and killed offspring when applied directly on the eggs. Interestingly, sublethal concentrations of spinosad reduced female fecundity stronger than abamectin. When a mixture of spinosad and abamectin was applied at LC₅₀, mortality was 74%, fecundity reduction was comparable to abamectin alone and egg hatching rate was lower than by either compound alone. In conclusion, spinosad was more harmful than abamectin for TSSM life stages and the combined application is recommended. 3aTetranychus urticae 3aabamectin 3aacaricidal properties 3aacarology 3aadults 3abioassays 3abiopesticides 3adeath 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahatching 3ainsects 3aleaves 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3aprogeny 3aspinosad 3aspraying 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aDrug Combinations 2aFemale 2aInsecticides 2aIvermectinxanalogs & derivatives 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMacrolides 2aTetranychidae 0aAdulticide 0aOvicide 0aOffspring development1 aSoliman, Maha F.

Here, we attempted to establish a fluorescent microplate method to detect arsenic using recombinant Escherichia coli cells transformed with plasmids harboring three tandem copies of the ars promoter/operator—the gene for green fluorescent protein (gfp). In the biosensors, one copy of arsR, whose transcription is autoregulated by the ars promoter/operator and ArsR in the genome of E. coli, was placed in trans in another plasmid under the control of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter. First, this manipulation enabled regulation of the arsR expression at an adequate level. Second, the copy number of reporter unit also affected signal and noise. When the plasmid harboring three copies of the reporter unit was used, the signal-to-noise ratio doubled and the detection limit decreased from 20 to 7.5 μg L⁻¹ As(III), compared to the use of the plasmid harboring one copy of the ars promoter/operator-arsR-gfp. Thus, segregation of arsR from the ars promoter/operator-gfp using two plasmids is effective in regulating the signal-to-noise ratio and the detection limit with the different functions. 3aEscherichia coli 3aarsenic 3abioassays 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aplasmids 3atranscription (genetics)1 aInoue, Kōichi.1 aTani, Yuri1 aHarun-ar-Rashid, Md.1 aAzuma, Norihiro1 aUeda, Shunsaku1 aYoshida, Kazuyuki1 aMaeda, Isamu0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2009 Nov., v. 108, no. 5 p.414-420dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.05.0143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02127naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245007300168300001600241500002400257520105600281650002601337650001301363650001701376650002801393650001001421650001501431650002201446650001301468650001701481650001701498773017701515852000901692856008801701655001201789IND4427083620221120062331.0091011s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442708362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Young-Bae.10aImproved trimethoprim-resistance cassette for prokaryotic selections  ap. 441-445.  aIncludes references  aMany of the antibiotic resistance elements used in molecular biology have idiosyncratic limitations. For example, beta-lactam selections rely on antibiotics that are unstable to hydrolysis and allow satellite colonies to form upon extended incubation, and tetracycline selections typically give rise to widely varying colony sizes and lower transformation efficiencies. Although prokaryotic Type II dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) genes have long been considered to have potential utility for the selection of plasmids and mobile elements in bacteria, practical limitations to the quality of those selections, mostly relating to background and inefficiency, have led for the most part to their underuse. I describe here the construction of a Type IIa dfr prokaryotic expression cassette that confers strong resistance against trimethoprim (Tmp), a bactericidal dfr inhibiting antibiotic. The Tmp-resistance cassette provides consistent and efficient selections and plasmid transformation frequencies equivalent to those encountered with beta-lactamases. 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abeta-lactams 3adihydrofolate reductase 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular biology 3aplasmids 3atetracycline 3atrimethoprim0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2009 Nov., v. 108, no. 5 p.441-445dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.05.0153Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04057naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245016000187300001400347500002400361500001500385520220700400650001302607650000902620650001602629650001402645650002802659650001302687650001002700650001502710650002902725650001502754650002902769650001002798650001802808650002102826650002102847650002202868650002302890653002502913700001702938700001902955700002002974700001502994700001903009700002003028700001903048700002103067700001703088700002203105700002103127700002203148700002003170700002503190700002103215773010503236852000903341856006903350655001203419IND4385677320221120062253.0061203s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438567732DNAL7 a168653322pmid7 a10.1007/s10142-006-0033-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Nagendra K.10aSingle-copy genes define a conserved order between rice and wheat for understanding differences caused by duplication, deletion, and transposition of genes  ap. 17-35.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe high-quality rice genome sequence is serving as a reference for comparative genome analysis in crop plants, especially cereals. However, early comparisons with bread wheat showed complex patterns of conserved synteny (gene content) and colinearity (gene order). Here, we show the presence of ancient duplicated segments in the progenitor of wheat, which were first identified in the rice genome. We also show that single-copy (SC) rice genes, those representing unique matches with wheat expressed sequence tag (EST) unigene contigs in the whole rice genome, show more than twice the proportion of genes mapping to syntenic wheat chromosome as compared to the multicopy (MC) or duplicated rice genes. While 58.7% of the 1,244 mapped SC rice genes were located in single syntenic wheat chromosome groups, the remaining 41.3% were distributed randomly to the other six non-syntenic wheat groups. This could only be explained by a background dispersal of genes in the genome through transposition or other unknown mechanism. The breakdown of rice-wheat synteny due to such transpositions was much greater near the wheat centromeres. Furthermore, the SC rice genes revealed a conserved primordial gene order that gives clues to the origin of rice and wheat chromosomes from a common ancestor through polyploidy, aneuploidy, centromeric fusions, and translocations. Apart from the bin-mapped wheat EST contigs, we also compared 56,298 predicted rice genes with 39,813 wheat EST contigs assembled from 409,765 EST sequences and identified 7,241 SC rice gene homologs of wheat. Based on the conserved colinearity of 1,063 mapped SC rice genes across the bins of individual wheat chromosomes, we predicted the wheat bin location of 6,178 unmapped SC rice gene homologs and validated the location of 213 of these in the telomeric bins of 21 wheat chromosomes with 35.4% initial success. This opens up the possibility of directed mapping of a large number of conserved SC rice gene homologs in wheat. Overall, only 46.4% of these SC genes code for proteins with known functional domains; the remaining 53.6% have unknown function, and hence, represent an important, but yet, under explored category of genes. 3aproteins 3arice 3acentromeres 3atelomeres 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aunigenes 3awheat 3apolyploidy 3atransposition (genetics) 3aaneuploidy 3achromosome translocation 3acrops 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Duplication 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aSyntenyxgenetics 2aTriticumxgenetics 0anucleotide sequences1 aDalal, Vivek1 aBatra, Kamlesh1 aSingh, Binay K.1 aChitra, G.1 aSingh, Archana1 aGhazi, Irfan A.1 aYadav, Mahavir1 aPandit, Awadhesh1 aDixit, Rekha1 aSingh, Pradeep K.1 aHarvinder Singh.1 aKoundal, Kirpa R.1 aGaikwad, Kishor1 aMohapatra, Trilochan1 aSharma, Tilak R.0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2007 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.17-35dSpringer-Verlagx1438-793X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-006-0033-43electronic resource 7aarticle02010naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245015100168300001600319500002400335520090000359650001901259650001501278650001701293650001101310650001301321650000801334700002701342700002201369700001901391773017701410852000901587856008801596655001201684IND4427083220221120054620.0091011s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442708322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshii, Haruyuki10aAnalysis of interaction between liposome membranes induced by stress condition: Utilization of liposomes immobilized on indium tin oxide electrode  ap. 425-428.  aIncludes references  aNBD-cholesterol (NBD-Ch)-modified liposome was immobilized on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode via the covalent binding method. The transfer of NBD-Ch between the immobilized liposomes and the target liposomes was observed by using a fluorescent microscope. The addition of liposome suspension co-incubated with α-chymotrypsin or stimuli-responsive polymer to the surface of the above ITO electrode, enhanced the liposome-liposome interaction, resulting in the promotion of NBD-Ch transfer. The apparent transfer rate constant of NBD-Ch was found to be correlated with the index for the liposome-liposome interaction evaluated by an immobilized liposome chromatography. This suggests that the present method using the liposome-immobilized ITO electrode was effective to evaluate the liposome-liposome interaction induced by the protein or the stimuli-responsive polymer under stress conditions. 3achromatography 3aelectrodes 3afluorescence 3aindium 3apolymers 3atin1 aShimanouchi, Toshinori1 aUmakoshi, Hiroshi1 aKuboi, Ryoichi0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2009 Nov., v. 108, no. 5 p.425-428dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.05.0093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03491naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245019600187300001600383500002400399520173100423650002702154650001302181650001302194650001202207650001402219650002302233650001202256650002002268650001002288650001402298650001502312650001102327650001402338650000702352650001902359650003002378650002602408650002802434650001802462650001302480650003102493650005802524650002802582650005002610700002302660700002502683700002002708700002402728773009502752852000902847856006902856655001202925IND4385656620221120041039.0061203s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438565662DNAL7 a171067982pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-006-0365-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeassoni, Paola R.10aCritical Active-Site Residues Identified by Site-Directed Mutagenesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Phosphorylcholine Phosphatase, A New Member of the Haloacid Dehalogenases Hydrolase Superfamily  ap. 534-539.  aIncludes references  aPseudomonas aeruginosa phosphorylcholine phosphatase (PChP), the product of the PA5292 gene, is synthesized when the bacteria are grown with choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, or carnitine. In the presence of Mg²⁺, PChP catalyzes the hydrolysis of both phosphorylcholine (PCh) and p-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP). PCh saturation curve analysis of the enzyme with or without the signal peptide indicated that the peptide was the fundamental factor responsible for decreasing the affinity of the second site of PChP for PCh, either at pH 5.0 or pH 7.4. PChP contained three conserved motifs characteristic of the haloacid dehalogenases superfamily. In the PChP without the signal peptide, motifs I, II, and III correspond to the residues ³¹DMDNT³⁵, ¹⁶⁶SAA¹⁶⁸, and K²⁴²/²⁶¹GDTPDSD²⁶⁷, respectively. To determine the catalytic importance of the D31, D33, T35, S166, K242, D262, D265, and D267 on the enzyme activity, site-directed mutagenesis was performed. D31, D33, D262, and D267 were identified as the more important residues for catalysis. D265 and D267 may be involved in the stabilization of motif III, or might contribute to substrate specificity. The substitution of T35 by S35 resulted in an enzyme with a low PChP activity, but conserves the catalytic sites involved in the hydrolysis of PCh (Km₁ 0.03 mM, Km₂ 0.5 mM) or p-NPP (Km 2.1 mM). Mutating either S166 or K242 revealed that these residues are also important to catalyze the hydrolysis of both substrates. The substitution of lysine by arginine or by glutamine revealed the importance of the positive charged group, either from the amino or guanidinium groups, because K242Q was inactive, whereas K242R was a functional enzyme. 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aarginine 3abacteria 3abetaine 3acarnitine 3acatalytic activity 3acholine 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aglutamine 3ahydrolysis 3alysine 3amagnesium 3apH 3asignal peptide 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3asubstrate specificity 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aBinding Sites 2aKinetics 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aProtein Sorting Signals 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxenzymologyxgenetics.1 aOtero, Lisandro H.1 aMassimelli, Maria J.1 aLisa, Angela T.1 aDomenech, Carlos E.0 tCurrent microbiology.g2006 Dec., v. 53, no. 6 p.534-539dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-006-0365-23electronic resource 7aarticle02930naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245004800128300001600176520196000192650001502152650002102167650001202188650002402200650002502224653002702249653001102276653001802287653001902305700001902324700001702343700001802360700001902378773009302397852000902490930003302499945001302532946001102545655001202556IND2197613420221120025051.0990318e19980921enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219761342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolkamp, B.J.10aSatiety splits feeding behaviour into bouts  ap. 235-250.  aAnimal behaviour is frequently displayed in bouts. Bout analysis aims at finding a bout criterion, i.e. that time between events that separates intervals within, from intervals between, bouts. Methods used for quantitative bout analysis are log-survivorship and log-frequency analysis. Both models assume that the probability of the start of an event (or a bout) is independent of the time since the last event (or bout) and that, therefore, events as well as bouts occur according to Poisson processes, i.e. purely at random. The frequencies of intervals within, as well as between, bouts are then distributed as negative exponentials. These models are also widely applied in feeding behaviour analysis, where bouts can be meals. However, the satiety concept predicts that after terminating a meal, the animal's feeding motivation will be low. The probability of the animal initiating the next meal is expected to increase with time since the last meal and, therefore, meals will not likely be randomly distributed. A negative exponential is then not the most appropriate model to describe the frequency distribution of intervals between meals. Results of an experiment in which feeding behaviour of 16 cows was recorded continuously for 30 days were used to test the suitability of existing bout analysis techniques. It is concluded that these techniques are inadequate for the description of the observed interval distributions. A new model is proposed that takes account of the observed "shortage" of short intervals between meals. In contrast to existing models, that describe log-transformed frequency distributions of interval lengths, the proposed model describes frequency distributions of log-transformed interval lengths. Compared with existing models, this log-normal model is in better agreement with the biological phenomenon of satiety, it gave a better fit to the observed interval distribution and led to a more meaningful meal criterion. 3adairy cows 3afeeding behavior 3asatiety 3amathematical models 3aprobability analysis 0afrequency distribution 0atheory 0ameal patterns 0ameal intervals1 aAllcroft, D.J.1 aAustin, E.J.1 aNielsen, B.L.1 aKyriazakis, I.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1998 Sept. 21, v. 194, no. 2 p.235-250x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03423naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245011500189300001400304520159900318650001401917650000801931650001501939650001401954650001101968650001001979650001001989650001001999650002202009650001302031650001102044650001602055650001502071650002502086650001402111650001402125650003002139650001002169650001202179650002702191650002802218650005202246650004002298651001402338651001402352653002102366653002402387700002502411700002002436700002402456700003102480700002502511773012302536852000902659856008502668930003302753946001102786655001202797IND4395033320221117160026.0070916e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439503332DNAL7 a177685972pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-007-9099-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco, Richard C. 10aDetection of a novel spotted fever group rickettsia in Amblyomma parvum ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) from Argentina  ap. 63-71.  aThe present study evaluated the rickettsial infection in Amblyomma parvum ticks collected in Northwestern Córdoba Province, Argentina. Each tick was subjected to DNA extraction and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting fragments of the rickettsial genes gltA and ompB. Nine (69.2%) out of 13 adult ticks yielded expected PCR products for the two rickettsial genes. Products from the ompB PCR were sequenced, generating DNA sequences 100% identical for the nine PCR-positive ticks. Three of these ticks were tested in another battery of PCR targeting fragments of the rickettsial genes gltA, htrA, and ompA. Products from the gltA, htrA, and ompA PCRs were sequenced generating DNA sequences 100% identical for the three PCR-positive ticks. The rickettsia detected in the A. parvum ticks was designated as Rickettsia sp. strain Argentina. Phylogenetic analyses performed with partial sequences of the rickettsial genes gltA, htrA, ompB, and ompA showed that Rickettsia sp. strain Argentina belonged to the spotted fever group, being distinct from all known Rickettsia species and genotypes available in GenBank, representing possibly a new Rickettsia species. This was the first evidence of rickettsial infection in the tick A. parvum, and the third report of rickettsial infection among the Argentinean tick fauna. The role of Rickettsia sp. strain Argentina as a human pathogen is unknown. Further studies are needed to obtain tissue-cultured isolates of Rickettsia sp. strain Argentina, in order to better characterize it and to determine its taxonomic status as a new species. 3aAmblyomma 3aDNA 3aRickettsia 3aacarology 3aadults 3afauna 3afever 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3agenotype 3ahumans 3anew species 3anew status 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aIxodidaexmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRickettsiaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRickettsia Infectionsxmicrobiology 3aArgentina 0aArgentina 0aAmblyomma parvum 0aSpotted fever group1 aMoraes-Filho, Jonas 1 aNava, Santiago 1 aBrandão, Paulo E. 1 aRichtzenhain, Leonardo J. 1 aLabruna, Marcelo B. 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2007 Sept., v. 43, no. 1 p.63-71dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-007-9099-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02254naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014100163300001400304500002400318500001500342520105500357650000901412650002201421650001901443650003401462650001001496650001301506650002201519650001801541653002101559653001801580653001801598653001301616653003601629700001301665700001301678773009601691852000901787856004801796655001201844IND4448798320221123034545.0110204e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444879832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-011-0007-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanigrahi, J.10aRFLP mapping of loci controlling self-incompatibility in Brassica campestris and their comparative mapping with B. napus and B. oleracea  ap. 54-60.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aRFLP analysis of a cDNA probe SLG6, governing self incompatibility (SI) in Brassica oleracea, using a recombinant inbred population of Brassica campestris followed by genetic linkage analysis led to the detection of two marker loci, SLG6a and SLG6b controlling SI. SLG6a was mapped in linkage group (LG) 9 and was flanked by the RFLP markers ec4f10 (6.4 cM) and wg5b9 (4.2 cM). SLG6b positioned in LG 2 and was flanked by the RFLP markers wg2d11 (9.9 cM) and ec4e7 (26.9 cM). These results indicated the scope of marker-aided introgression of these genes into self-compatible genotypes for production of SI lines suitable for hybridization in B. campestris. Comparative mapping of LG 9 containing SLG6b with corresponding linkage groups of B. oleracea (BO 2) and B. napus (BN 16) led to the detection of small homologous regions with SLG6 locus linked with another RFLP locus. This evidenced for homology of the SLG genes across Brassica species and possibility of using any single cloned SLG gene for development of SI lines in any Brassica species. 3aloci 3acomplementary DNA 3alinkage groups 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3agenes 3agenotype 3aBrassica oleracea 3aintrogression 0alinkage analysis 0amolecular map 0aRI population 0aSLG gene 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris1 aKole, P.1 aKole, C.0 tBiologia plantarum.g2011 Mar., v. 55, no. 1 p.54-60dSpringer Netherlandsx0006-31347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10535-011-0007-9 7aarticle02943naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008500126300001600211500002400227500001500251520136700266650002801633650001901661650001201680650002501692650000901717650002201726650001101748650002601759650001101785650001801796650003701814650002801851650001101879650001301890650003601903650001601939650002001955650002101975653002401996653003302020653003402053653003402087700001902121773015102140852000902291856005402300930003302354945001302387946001302400655001202413IND2056440620221122234709.0970410e199510  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205644062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafta, A.M.10aEffect of high temperature on plant growth and carbohydrate metabolism in potato  ap. 637-643.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was undertaken to determine the role of sucrose-metabolizing enzymes in altered carbohydrate partitioning caused by heat stress. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) genotypes characterized as susceptible and tolerant to heat stress were grown at 19/17 degrees C, and a subset was transferred to 31/29 degrees C. Data were obtained for plant growth and photosynthesis. Enzyme activity was determined for sucrose-6-phosphate synthase (SPS) in mature leaves and for sucrose synthase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in developing tubers of plants. High temperatures reduced growth of tubers more than of shoots. Photosynthetic rates were unaffected or increased slightly at the higher temperature. Heat stress increased accumulation of foliar sucrose and decreased starch accumulation in mature leaves but did not affect glucose. SPS activity increased significantly in mature leaves of plants subjected to high temperature. Changes in SPS activity were probably not due to altered enzyme kinetics. The activity of sucrose synthase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was reduced in tubers, albeit less quickly than leaf SPS activity. There was no interaction of temperature and genotype with regard to the enzymes examined; therefore, observed differences do not account for differences between genotypes in heat susceptibility. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aheat tolerance 3asucrose 3adevelopmental stages 3aheat 3aSolanum tuberosum 3astarch 3anet assimilation rate 3atubers 3atranspiration 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3anucleotidyltransferases 3aleaves 3agenotype 3achemical constituents of plants 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 3asucrose synthase 0ahexosyltransferases 0asucrose-6-phosphate synthase 0audp-glucose pyrophosphorylase 0aadp-glucose pyrophosphorylase1 aLorenzen, J.H.0 tPlant physiology.g1995 Oct., v. 109, no. 2 p.637-643dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRUM  aOther US 7aarticle02225naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011300129300001600242500002300258500001500281520120200296650001101498650002001509650001801529650001201547650001001559650001001569650001301579650001001592650001301602650002601615651001001641653002001651700002001671773009501691852000901786939003301795946001101828655001201839IND9104200420221122220700.0911024e199106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910420042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawrence, G.B.10aBiogeochemical interactions between acidic deposition and a low-elevation spruce-fir stand in Howland, Maine  ap. 867-875.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe biogeochemical interactions between acidic deposition and a forest ecosystem were investigated in a low-elevation spruce-fir stand in east-central Maine. A 0.2-ha plot was intensively instrumented for measurement of precipitation, throughfall, and soil solutions. Annual precipitation for 1989 had an average pH of 4.39 and an estimated 424, 191, and 231 mol.ha-1 deposition of H+, SO4(2-), and NO3-, respectively. Soil water flux was determined from precipitation and evaporation estimates. Ion flux data are presented for the 12-month period of 1989. Approximately 50% of inorganic strong acid acidity in precipitation plus unmeasured dry deposition was neutralized by the canopy for the measurement period reported. Soil and soil solution buffering were largely controlled by organic matter and mineral weathering. Mobilization of inorganic Al was minimal (<3 micromole) in both the Oa and Bs horizons. Ratios of Al/Ca2+ were well below values considered to cause inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. Annual deposition of SO4(2-) in throughfall (285 mol.ha-1) approximated output (291 mol.ha-1). Virtually 100% of wet-only NO3- input and 90% of wet-only NH4+ input were retained within the ecosystem. 3acanopy 3aacid deposition 3asoil solution 3adecline 3aAbies 3aacids 3aaluminum 3aPicea 3aaltitude 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aMaine 0abiogeochemistry1 aFernandez, I.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1991 June, v. 21, no. 6 p.867-875x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02942naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245018000183300001600363500002400379520133400403650002201737650001901759650001801778650001401796650001201810650003901822650002001861650002001881650002001901650001401921650001201935650002501947650001101972650004901983650003102032650002602063650002002089650001402109650003002123650002402153650003502177651001002212700002202222700001602244773008602260852000902346856006902355655001202424IND4385873320221122183054.0061210s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438587332DNAL7 a160214952pmid7 a10.1007/s00412-005-0013-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshido, Atsuo10aResolution of sex chromosome constitution by genomic in situ hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization with (TTAGG) n telomeric probe in some species of Lepidoptera  ap. 193-202.  aIncludes references  aWe have developed a simple method to resolve the sex chromosome constitution in females of Lepidoptera by using a combination of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization with (TTAGG) n telomeric probe (telomere-FISH). In pachytene configurations of sex chromosomes, GISH differentiated W heterochromatin and telomere-FISH detected the chromosome ends. With this method we showed that Antheraea yamamai has a standard system with a fully differentiated W-Z sex chromosome pair. In Orgyia antiqua, we confirmed the presence of neo-W and neo-Z chromosomes, which most probably originated by fusion of the ancestral W and Z with an autosome pair. In contrast to earlier data, Orgyia thyellina females displayed a neo-ZW₁W₂ sex chromosome constitution. A neo-WZ₁Z₂ trivalent was found in females of Samia cynthia subsp. indet., originating from a population in Nagano, Japan. Whereas another subspecies collected in Sapporo, Japan, and determined as S. cynthia walkeri, showed a neo-W/neo-Z bivalent similar to O. antiqua, and the subspecies S. cynthia ricini showed a Z univalent (a Z/ZZ system). The combination of GISH and telomere-FISH enabled us to acquire not only reliable information about sex chromosome constitution but also an insight into sex chromosome evolution in Lepidoptera. 3aAntheraea yamamai 3aOrgyia antiqua 3aSamia cynthia 3aevolution 3afemales 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3aheterochromatin 3apachytene stage 3asex chromosomes 3atelomeres 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aFemale 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescencexmethods 2aLarvaxcytologyxgenetics. 2aLepidopteraxgenetics 2aMothsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aSex Chromosomesxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTelomerexchemistryxgenetics. 3aJapan1 aMarec, František1 aSahara, Ken0 tChromosoma.g2005 Aug., v. 114, no. 3 p.193-202dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0013-93electronic resource 7aarticle03246naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245016000190300001400350520149000364650002701854650001901881650002201900650001401922650001101936650001501947650001601962650001201978650001001990650001002000650001202010650002902022650001202051650002302063650001102086650004302097650000902140650002202149650002902171650001602200650002102216651001502237653002502252653001502277653001702292653001602309700002102325700002402346700002502370773012302395852000902518856008502527930003302612946001102645655001202656IND4395033020221122183044.0070916e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439503302DNAL7 a178284392pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-007-9102-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalderón, Rafael A. 12aA comparison of the reproductive ability of Varroa destructor (Mesostigmata:Varroidae) in worker and drone brood of Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera)  ap. 25-32.  aColony infestation by the parasitic mite, Varroa destructor is one of the most serious problems for beekeeping worldwide. In order to reproduce varroa females, enter worker or drone brood shortly before the cell is sealed. To test the hypothesis that, due to the preference of mites to invade drone brood to reproduce, a high proportion of the mite reproduction should occur in drone cells, a comparative study of mite reproductive rate in worker and drone brood of Africanized honey bees (AHB) was done for 370 mites. After determining the number, developmental stage and sex of the offspring in worker cells, the foundress female mite was immediately transferred into an uninfested drone cell. Mite fertility in single infested worker and drone brood cells was 76.5 and 79.3%, respectively. There was no difference between the groups (X ² = 0.78, P = 0.37). However, one of the most significant differences in mite reproduction was the higher percentage of mites producing viable offspring (cells that contain one live adult male and at least one adult female mite) in drone cells (38.1%) compared to worker cells (13.8%) (X ² = 55.4, P < 0.01). Furthermore, a high level of immature offspring occurred in worker cells and not in drone cells (X ² = 69, P < 0.01). Although no differences were found in the percentage of non-reproducing mites, more than 74% (n = 85) of the mites that did not reproduce in worker brood, produced offspring when they were transferred to drone brood. 3aAfricanized honey bees 3aApis mellifera 3aVarroa destructor 3aacarology 3aadults 3aapiculture 3abrood cells 3afemales 3amales 3amites 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 2aAnimals 2aBeesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxphysiology 2aMale 2aMitesxphysiology 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSex Factors 2aTropical Climate 0aCosta Rica 0aReproductive ability 0aComparison 0aWorker brood 0aDrone brood1 aZamora, Luis G. 1 aVeen, Johan W. van.1 aQuesada, Mariela V. 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2007 Sept., v. 43, no. 1 p.25-32dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-007-9102-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03579naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245005100190300001600241500002400257520139300281650000801674650001701682650001901699650002501718650001401743650001601757650001001773650001301783650001101796650001501807650002901822650001201851650005601863650002501919650003701944650006901981650005102050650002502101650001102126650001602137650000902153650002102162650003402183650003102217650002402248650005002272650003402322650004402356650003502400650002702435650003802462650001702500650004002517650003002557700001402587700001902601700002702620700002302647700001402670700002102684773008602705852000902791856006902800655001202869IND4385873220221122183116.0061210s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438587322DNAL7 a159862052pmid7 a10.1007/s00412-005-0008-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade la Cruz, Cecile C.10aDevelopmental regulation of Suz12 localization  ap. 183-192.  aIncludes references  aChromatin modifications are among the epigenetic alterations essential for genetic reprogramming during development. The Polycomb group (PcG) gene family mediates chromatin modifications that contribute to developmentally regulated transcriptional silencing. Trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27, mediated by a PcG protein complex consisting of Eed, Ezh2, and Suz12, is integral in differentiation, stem cell self-renewal, and tumorigenesis. Eed and Ezh2 are also implicated in the developmentally regulated silencing of the inactive X chromosome, as they are transiently enriched on the inactive X chromosome when X chromosome silencing is initiated. Here we analyze the dynamic localization of Suz12 during cellular differentiation and X-inactivation. Though Suz12 is a requisite member of the Eed/Ezh2 complexes, we found that Suz12 exhibits a notable difference from Ezh2 and Eed: while Ezh2 and Eed levels decrease during stem cell differentiation, Suz12 levels remain constant. Despite the differential regulation in abundance of Suz12 and Eed/Ezh2, Suz12 is also transiently enriched on the Xi during early stages of X-inactivation, and this accumulation is Xist RNA dependent. These results suggest that Suz12 may have a function that is not mediated by its association with Eed and Ezh2, and that this additional function is not involved in the regulation of X-inactivation. 3aRNA 3aX chromosome 3acarcinogenesis 3acell differentiation 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahistones 3alysine 3astem cells 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Differentiation 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHistone-Lysine N-Methyltransferasexmetabolism 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMethylation 2aMice 2aNuclear Proteins 2aPolycomb Repressive Complex 2 2aProtein Methyltransferases 2aRNA, Long Noncoding 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Untranslatedxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRepressor Proteinsxmetabolism 2aStem Cellsxmetabolism 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTransfection 2aTrophoblastsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aX Chromosome Inactivation1 aFang, Jia1 aPlath, Kathrin1 aWorringer, Kathleen A.1 aNusinow, Dmitri A.1 aZhang, Yi1 aPanning, Barbara0 tChromosoma.g2005 Aug., v. 114, no. 3 p.183-192dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0008-63electronic resource 7aarticle02881naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245016000187300001600347520129800363650001101661650002001672650001401692650002301706650002601729650001601755650002101771650001001792650001201802650002601814650002601840650001101866650003101877651001101908651001801919651001501937653002301952653002101975653002601996653002202022700003502044700002802079773013002107852000902237856008502246930003302331946001102364655001202375IND4393265020221122151837.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439326502DNAL7 a176118062pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-007-9085-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagud, Biljana D. 10aMorphological variation in different populations of Aceria anthocoptes (Acari: Eriophyoidea) associated with the Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense, in Serbia  ap. 173-183.  aThe russet mite, Aceria anthocoptes (Nal.), is the only eriophyid that has been recorded on Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. It has been noted in several European countries and recently in the USA. With its apparent host specificity and because of the damage it causes to its host plant, A. anthocoptes is being studied as a potential candidate for classical biological control. The aim of the present study was to examine quantitative morphological traits in four populations of A. anthocoptes living on two infraspecific host plant taxa (C. arvense var. arvense and C. arvense var. vestitum) in two geographically separate areas of Serbia in order to test the hypothesis of absence of the possible host plant impact on mite morphology. MANOVA analysis revealed significant differences between populations from different localities in Serbia. Populations of A. anthocoptes inhabiting two thistle varieties in the vicinity of Belgrade differed significantly from mites inhabiting the same two host varieties in the vicinity of the town of Ivanjica. Canonical discriminant analysis showed that the trait which best discriminates the populations of A. anthocoptes is the number of dorsal annuli. It was not possible to ascribe morphological differences to the impact of the host plant. 3aAceria 3aCirsium arvense 3aacarology 3abiological control 3adiscriminant analysis 3ahost plants 3ahost specificity 3amites 2aAnimals 2aCirsiumxparasitology 2aDiscriminant Analysis 2aFemale 2aMitesxanatomy & histology 3aSerbia 3aUnited States 0aYugoslavia 0aAceria anthocoptes 0aEriophyoid mites 0aCreeping thistle mite 0aHost plant impact1 aStanisavljević, Ljubiša Ž. 1 aPetanović, Radmila U. 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2007 July, v. 42, no. 3 p.173-183dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-007-9085-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02575naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012100127300001600248520143800264650001601702650001701718650001101735650002001746650001901766650001601785650001901801650001101820650001601831650001101847650001401858650002201872653001101894653001501905653003801920653002501958700001301983773009101996852000902087930003302096945001302129946001102142655001202153IND2196726020221122151817.0990128e19980707enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219672602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPospisil, P.10aTheoretical simulation of temperature induced increase of quantum yield of minimum chlorophyll fluorescence phi F(0)  ap. 125-130.  aThe measured minimum chlorophyll fluorescence intensity FO of barley leaves rises upon linear heating in the temperature range 32-52 degrees C whereas the maximum fluorescence FM gradually decreases. The rise of F0 is thought to be connected with the blocking of electron transport in the reaction centre of PSII (RCII), however a clear interpretation has not yet been settled. In this paper, we have theoretically simulated both FM and F0 temperature dependencies in the temperature range 25-60 degrees C based on a monomolecular model. The fluorescence quantum yields phiF(0) and phiF(M) were expressed as functions of the rate constants of the deexcitation processes and the fraction of open RCII [P]. The temperature dependence of the rate constants was expressed by exponential functions (1/T)1/2 exp(-EA/RT) or exp(-EA/RT). A fitting of the FM dependence served to obtain some yet unknown rate constants. In the temperature interval where the functional RCIIs are supposed to convert gradually into the blocked ones the value [P] was tuned to converge gradually to 0 yielding the increase of phiF(0). The model enabled us to express the theoretical dependencies of quantum yields of internal conversion, intersystem crossing and energy transfer to PSI in reasonable accordance with the known experimental facts. The simulation supports the view that the temperature increase of F0 is predominantly caused by a blocking of RCII. 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3aleaves 3aHordeum vulgare 3aheat treatment 3atemperature 3aphotosystem II 3ayields 3ameasurement 3amodels 3aequations 3aelectron transfer 0atheory 0asimulation 0areaction center of photosystem ii 0amonomolecular models1 aNaus, J.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1998 July 7, v. 193, no. 1 p.125-130x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02372naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245017400128300001400302500001500316520088500331650002301216650001701239650001201256650002201268650001201290650002001302650001401322650001601336650001101352650002301363650001301386650002401399650002501423650001201448650002001460650002701480653003901507653002501546653003701571653002101608653001301629653001701642653002701659700001401686773008801700852000901788930003301797945001301830946001101843655001201854IND2196416420221122151823.0990112e19980507enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219641642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMautino, M.R.10aAnalysis of models involving enzymatic activities for the occurrence of C leads to T transition mutations during repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) in Neurospora crassa  ap. 61-71.  a2019-12-05  aThe phenomenon of repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), acting during the sexual phase of the model eukaryote Neurospora crassa, is considered to study the putative in vivo relationships existing between cellular levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), cytosine methylation and the occurrence of C leads to T transition mutations. We analyse the kinetic behaviour of the different enzymatic models proposed to explain the underlying mutagenic mechanisms of RIP. The dependence of the mutation rate on the cellular levels of the methyl group donor SAM was evaluated for the models of mutation catalysed by a DNA-cytosine deaminase, a DNA-(5-methylcytosine) deaminase, a DNA-(5-cytosine) methyltransferase, and for a model combining the activities of the last two enzymes. We propose that these models can be distinguished by studying the dependence of RIP on intracellular SAM levels. 3aamidine hydrolases 3atransferases 3aalleles 3aNeurospora crassa 3athymine 3aDNA methylation 3aequations 3amutagenesis 3amodels 3aadenosylmethionine 3acytosine 3asexual reproduction 3anucleotide sequences 3amutants 3aenzyme activity 3alife cycle (organisms) 0adna-(5-cytosine) methyltransferase 0acytosine methylation 0adna-(5-methylcytosine) deaminase 0aenzymatic models 0amutation 0asexual cycle 0adna-cytosine deaminase1 aRosa, Al.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1998 May 7, v. 192, no. 1 p.61-71x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03090naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002100186245015600207300001600363506007600379520115000455506003701605650001801642650001801660650001401678650001401692650002201706650001601728650002801744650002801772650001001800650001401810650001401824650001901838650001201857650004401869650002501913650002201938650004101960650001402001650002502015650002302040650002702063650002402090650005902114653000802173653002702181700003002208773012402238852000902362856008502371930003302456946001102489655001202500IND4394863220221207132717.0070909e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439486322DNAL7 a177126052pmid7 aPMC20398152pmcid7 a10.1007/s10493-007-9092-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRos, Vera I.

The central part of the mitochondrial COI region has frequently been used for investigating intra- and interspecific variation. All these studies combined yield an extensive database of sequence information of the family Tetranychidae. We assembled this information in a single alignment and performed an overall phylogenetic analysis. The resulting phylogeny shows that important patterns have been overlooked in previous studies, whereas others disappear. It also reveals that mistakes were made in submitting the data to GenBank, which further disturbed interpretation of the data. Our total analysis clearly shows three clades that most likely correspond to the species T. urticae, T. kanzawai and T. truncatus. Intraspecific variation is very high, possibly due to selective sweeps caused by reproductive parasites. We found no evidence for host plant associations and phylogeographic patterns in T. urticae are absent. Finally we evaluate the application of DNA barcoding.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA barcoding 3aTetranychidae 3aacarology 3abarcoding 3agenetic databases 3ahost plants 3ainterspecific variation 3aintraspecific variation 3amites 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 2aAnimals 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPlantsxparasitology 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 2aTetranychidaexclassificationxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 0aCOI 0aReproductive parasites1 aBreeuwer, Johannes A.

Here we report a rapid and sensitive detection of R. solanacearum using an isothermal method for copying DNA known as loop-mediated amplification (LAMP). A set of four primers was designed to replicate the gene coding for the flagellar subunit, fliC, and conditions for detection were optimized to complete in 60 min at 65°C. Magnesium pyrophosphate resulting from the amplification reaction could be detected optically as an increase in the solution turbidity, and the DNA products spread in a reproducible ladder-like banding pattern after electrophoresis in an agarose gel. Replication of the fliC gene was detected only from R. solanacearum. The detection limit of this LAMP assay was between 10(4) to 10(6) colony forming units/ml, and the technique may be useful for developing rapid and sensitive detection methods for the R. solanacearum pathogen in soil and water. 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease detection 3abacterial wilt 3aDNA primers 3arapid methods 3agenes 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3adisease diagnosis 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRalstonia solanacearumxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aplant diseases and disorders 0anucleic acid amplification 0amolecular diagnostics 0aprimer selectivity 0amethodology 0anew methods 0afliC gene1 aVine, B.G.1 aAlvarez, A.M.1 aJenkins, D.M.0 tPhytopathology.g2008 Sept., v. 98, no. 9 p.1045-1051dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-98-9-10453Available from publisher's Web site  a20090830b20091002c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/29  aOther US 7aarticle03440naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245008000163300001400243520142600257650000901683650001701692650001901709650001901728650002401747650001701771650001601788650003601804650003201840650003101872650003701903650003101940650001701971650001801988650001202006650003102018650003902049650003902088650004202127650000902169650001102178650002002189650003302209650000902242650005402251650004202305650007402347650005302421650003102474650003202505653001802537700001602555700001302571700001802584700002002602773007802622852000902700930003302709945002502742946001102767655001202778IND4371820520221122045834.0050627s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437182052DNAL7 a165942002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHegemann, N.10aCytokine profile in canine immune-mediated polyarthritis and osteoarthritis  ap. 67-72.  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the cytokine profile in 21 dogs with canine immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMA) and 15 dogs with osteoarthritis (OA) caused by cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR). The mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-gamma, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were analysed in synovial fluid by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, while TNF-alpha protein was determined by L929 cytotoxicity assay. The frequency of lymphocytes was analysed using FACScan. Both disorders reveal a similar cytokine expression pattern, except for significant lower IL-1beta expression in OA. Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma were detected, while IL-4 was nearly absent in IMA and OA. Furthermore, the bioassay demonstrates a significantly higher production of TNF-alpha in synovial fluid of dogs with IMA, compared to dogs with OA (p< 0.05). The frequency of CD4(+), CD8(+) and MHC class II(+) cells was relatively higher in synovial fluids compared to peripheral blood in IMA. These findings reveal that the difference between the cytokine pattern of canine IMA and OA seems to be rather quantitative than qualitative. Both joint disorders show predominance of pro-inflammatory cytokines and absence of TH2 cytokine expression, indicating the potential of IL-4 for a gene therapeutic approach. 3adogs 3adog diseases 3aosteoarthritis 3asynovial fluid 3aautoimmune diseases 3ainterleukins 3ainterferons 3atransforming growth factor beta 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 2aAnimals 2aAnterior Cruciate Ligament 2aArthritisximmunologyxveterinary. 2aCytokinesxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aDog Diseasesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aLymphocyte Countxveterinary 2aMale 2aOsteoarthritisxetiologyximmunologyxveterinary. 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aRupture, Spontaneousxcomplicationsxveterinary. 2aSynovial Fluidxmetabolism 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha 0apolyarthritis1 aWondimu, A.1 aKohn, B.1 aBrunnberg, L.1 aSchmidt, M.F.G.0 pVet. comp. orthop. traumatolg2005, v. 18, no. 2 p.67-72x0932-08147nnas  aDNAL  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02551naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100001600189245020000205300001800405500002400423506007600447520116500523506003701688650001901725650001901744650001801763650001801781650001401799650001201813700001401825700001901839700002001858700002101878700002501899700001801924773010201942852000902044856008802053655001202141IND4427029120221207123922.0091011s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442702912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.07.0482doi7 aPMC34436232pmcid7 a196989482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Wenzhe10aApplication of Snyder-Dolan classification scheme to the selection of “orthogonal” columns for fast screening of illicit drugs and impurity profiling of pharmaceuticals - I.

The standard errors (S.E.) of the least squares regressions of log k′ vs. log k′REF were obtained for a given column against a reference column and used to compare and classify columns based on their selectivity. The results are consistent with those obtained with a study of the 16 test solutes recommended by Snyder and Dolan. To the extent these drugs are representative, these results show that the S-D classification scheme is also generally applicable to pharmaceuticals under isocratic conditions. That is, those columns judged to be similar based on the 16 S-D solutes were similar based on the 18 drugs; furthermore those columns judged to have significantly different selectivities based on the 16 S-D probes appeared to be quite different for the drugs as well. Given that the S-D method has been used to classify more than 400 different types of reversed phases the extension to cationic drugs is a significant finding.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3aillicit drugs 3aleast squares 3ascreening 3asolutes1 aZhang, Yu1 aCarr, Peter W.1 aRutan, Sarah C.1 aDumarey, Melanie1 aSchellinger, Adam P.1 aPritts, Wayne0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Sept. 18, v. 1216, no. 38 p.6587-6599dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.07.0483Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02866naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002600148245012400174300001800298500002400316520175900340650001402099650001402113650001302127650002002140650004302160650001102203650001702214650002502231700002002256700001902276700002202295773010202317852000902419856008802428655001202516IND4427029020221122004607.0091011s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442702902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.07.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaczmarski, Krzysztof10aModeling of thermal processes in high pressure liquid chromatography : II. Thermal heterogeneity at very high pressures  ap. 6575-6586.  aIncludes references  aAdvanced instruments for liquid chromatography enables the operation of columns packed with sub-2μm particles at the very high inlet pressures, up to 1000bar, that are necessary to achieve the high column efficiency and the short analysis times that can be provided by the use of these columns. However, operating rather short columns at high mobile phase velocities, under high pressure gradients causes the production of a large amount of heat due to the viscous friction of the eluent percolating through the column bed. The evacuation of this heat causes the formation of significant axial and radial temperature gradients. Due to these thermal gradients, the retention factors of analytes and the mobile phase velocity are no longer constant throughout the column. The consequence of this heat production is a loss of column efficiency. We previously developed a model combining the heat and mass balance of the column, the equations of flow through porous media, and a linear isotherm model of the analyte. This model was solved and validated for conventional columns operated under moderate pressures. We report here on the results obtained when this model is applied to columns packed with very fine particles, operated under very high pressures. These results prove that our model accounts well for all the experimental results. The same column that elutes symmetrical, nearly Gaussian peaks at low flow rates, under relatively low pressure drops, provides strongly deformed, unsymmetrical peaks when operated at high flow rates, under high pressures, and under different thermal environments. The loss in column efficiency is particularly important when the column wall is kept at constant temperature, by immersing the column in a water bath. 3aequations 3aequipment 3afriction 3aheat production 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3aporous media 3atemperature profiles1 aGritti, Fabrice1 aKostka, Joanna1 aGuiochon, Georges0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Sept. 18, v. 1216, no. 38 p.6575-6586dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.07.0493Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02952naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245009400178300001600272500002400288520183300312650001602145650001102161650001602172650001902188650001302207650002002220650001102240650001202251650003302263650000902296650002202305650001802327650001602345700002202361773011902383852000902502856005502511655001202566IND4421676020221122004747.0090612e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442167602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00226.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLAOHAVANICH, JUCKAMAS10aDrying characteristics and milling quality aspects of paddy dried with gas-fired infrared  ap. 442-461.  aIncludes references  aWet paddy was dried under different process conditions applying a laboratory gas-fired infrared (GIR) dryer. Peak wavelength of infrared emitted and initial moisture content of paddy were varied to study the drying behavior. The available thin-layer drying models were fitted to the drying data. Then, the modified Page model was chosen with higher coefficient of determination (R² = 0.9985 - 0.9695) and best-fitted over other models, based on comparing the values of root mean square deviation (RMSD), average percentage of error (%E) and chi-square (χ²) between the observed and predicted moisture ratios. Qualities of GIR and temper-dried wet paddy in terms of head rice yield and whiteness were evaluated. Response surface methodology found that an increase in GIR drying time could increase head rice yield. However, an increase in both GIR drying time and tempering time could decrease the whiteness. The contour overlay graph could then be used for determining the appropriate drying conditions, depending on the industrial or user requirement. Infrared (IR) drying technology has appeared as one of the potential alternatives to the traditional heating methods for obtaining high-quality dried agro-products. For long-grain paddy drying, there is at present a dearth of reports exploring IR drying kinetics, and even in such reports, milling quality was the focus of investigation with respect to appropriate drying process conditions. This study has presented the modeling determination and explanation on milling qualities of paddy dried with gas-fired infrared dryer. The drying process has provided a guideline on basic information to build a commercial drying system. Finally, these results would have practical applications for maintaining or increasing the milling qualities of paddy in the existing industry. 3adry milling 3adryers 3agrain yield 3aheat treatment 3aindustry 3amilling quality 3amodels 3apaddies 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice 3athin-layer drying 3awater content 3awavelengths1 aWONGPICHET, SEREE0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.442-461dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00226.x 7aarticle01974naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245010500130300001600235520077900251650001101030650001401041650001901055650001901074650003801093650001801131650001401149650001601163650002001179650001901199650001401218650002401232653001601256653002101272700001501293700001501308700001601323700001701339700001301356773009301369852000901462930003301471945001301504946001101517655001201528IND2073001120221122004709.0980504e19970921enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207300112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLushnikov, A.A.10aModelling of light-driven RuBP regeneration, carboxylation and CO2 diffusion for leaf photosynthesis  ap. 143-151.  aA two-stage model proposed by Thornley on the photosynthetic rate in leaves is modified to include the transport processes of CO2 molecules.

The novel feature is the detailed analytical analysis of stationary CO2 diffusion in the mesophyll along with respiration. The model is tested against laboratory measurements of CO2 exchange rates of single birch leaves and empirical constants entered into the model are assessed by means of the data. To yield a realistic reaction rate constant for carboxylation, the model requires that the diffusion coefficient describing mesophyllic transport must be somewhat larger than CO2 diffusivity in pure liquid water. 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3aphotosynthesis 3acarbon dioxide 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3acarboxylation 3adiffusion 3adiffusivity 3alight intensity 3aBetula pendula 3aequations 3amathematical models 0arespiration 0atwo stage models1 aAhonen, T.1 aVesala, T.1 aJuurola, E.1 aNikinmaa, E.1 aHari, P.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1997 Sept. 21, v. 188, no. 2 p.143-151x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02973naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002700171245019600198300001600394500002400410520108200434650002201516650001101538650003701549650001101586650001401597650002001611650001901631650002701650650002101677650002801698650001101726650001401737650001301751650004901764650004401813650002401857650003301881650004201914650006001956650002802016700002002044700002302064700002802087700001902115700002702134700002102161700002402182700002802206773010902234852000902343856005502352655001202407IND4457810320221121235222.0110507e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445781032DNAL7 a215353542pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00690.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPARRAVICINI, GABRIELLA10aIdentification of serine/threonine kinase and nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes in the fire blight resistance quantitative trait locus of apple cultivar ‘Evereste'  ap. 493-505.  aIncludes references  aFire blight is the most destructive bacterial disease affecting apple (Malus×domestica) worldwide. So far, no resistance gene against fire blight has been characterized in apple, despite several resistance regions having been identified. A highly efficacious resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) was localized on linkage group 12 (LG12) of the ornamental cultivar ‘Evereste'. A marker previously reported to be closely linked to this resistance was used to perform a chromosome landing. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of 189 kb carrying the fire blight resistance QTL was isolated and sequenced. New microsatellite markers were developed, and the genomic region containing the resistance locus was limited to 78 kb. A cluster of eight genes with homologies to already known resistance gene structures to bacterial diseases was identified and the corresponding gene transcription was verified. From this cluster, two genes were recognized in silico as the two most probable fire blight resistance genes showing homology with the Pto/Prf complex in tomato. 3aErwinia amylovora 3aapples 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aclones 3acultivars 3afire resistance 3alinkage groups 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultigene family 3aquantitative trait loci 3aserine 3athreonine 3atomatoes 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterialxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMalusxmicrobiology 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aQuantitative Trait Loci1 aGESSLER, CESARE1 aDENANCÉ, CAROLINE1 aLASSERRE-ZUBER, PAULINE1 aVERGNE, EMILIE1 aBRISSET, MARIE-NOËLLE1 aPATOCCHI, ANDREA1 aDUREL, CHARLES-ERIC1 aBROGGINI, GIOVANNI A.L.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2011 June, v. 12, no. 5 p.493-505dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00690.x 7aarticle02382naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014000129300001600269500002300285500001500308520137700323650002001700650002101720650002201741650001801763650001401781650001201795651001601807653002601823700001701849700001801866773009501884852000901979939003301988946001102021655001202032IND9104200220221121223246.0911024e199106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910420022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinesley, L.E.10aWeight and nutrient content of litter during secondary succession on well-drained uplands of the East Gulf Coastal Plain in Mississippi  ap. 848-857.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aProduction of forest litter was examined over 2 years in a chronosequence of stands representing four stages of secondary succession on well-drained uplands of the East Gulf Coastal Plain in Mississippi. Average age for these stands was from 22 to 207 years. Early succession was dominated by dense pine stands, whereas mature forests were about 75% hardwood. Litter mass was greatest early in succession, when productivity was highest, and decreased as stands matured. Foliage was approximately 70% of the litter throughout succession. The remaining 30% was mostly large woody material in young pine stands, but a heavy reproductive component in mature stands. Stands dominated by pines produced litter throughout the year, whereas hardwood stands were more cyclic. In young pine stands, the N and P content of litter was already 80-90% of the maximum value realized later in succession, whereas Ca and Mg accumulated in proportion to hardwood basal area. Nutrient concentrations in litter varied by season, component, and stage of succession. Foliar litter that fell in the spring and summer had higher N and P concentrations than that that fell in the fall. Seasonal patterns of litter production, as well as variations in nutrient concentration, made the monthly variation of nutrients returned to the forest floor less extreme than that of foliar litter fall weights. 3achronosequences 3anutrient content 3aforest succession 3aforest litter 3ahighlands 3abiomass 3aMississippi 0aecological succession1 aNelson, L.E.1 aSwitzer, G.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1991 June, v. 21, no. 6 p.848-857x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01870naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002600148245020800174300001800382500002400400520057800424650001501002650002501017650002301042650001501065650001301080650001901093650001501112650002601127650006601153650002101219650002001240700002101260700001601281773010201297852000901399856008801408655001201496IND4427029520221121211322.0091011s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442702952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.07.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalik, Muhammad Imran10aCharacterization of ethylene oxide-propylene oxide block copolymers by combination of different chromatographic techniques and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy  ap. 6627-6635.  aIncludes references  aBlock copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) are characterized by combination of two-dimensional chromatography and MALDI-TOF-MS.

Development of such an archive includes the collection of all available RI values for a variety of compounds including replicates measured under slightly different conditions. Review of retention data often shows a relatively wide range of RI values for certain well studied compounds that is larger than expected on the basis of the simple reproducibility of experimental measurements. The finding of unusual RI data distributions and their examination presents a possible way to detect and correct errors during the development of comprehensive RI libraries. Our approach involves the construction of histograms representing the distribution of data-points in various RI intervals. The observed shape of the distribution is compared to the expected and observed shapes for well-identified compounds. Significant systematic deviations represent anomalies in the sets of RI data. The occurrence of more than a single maximum on a histogram generally indicates the presence of erroneous data. For some compounds such multimode RI distributions may be caused by differences in experimental conditions of the RI determination. The construction and interpretation of histograms for compounds with multiple RI measurements is illustrated by several examples. Thus, the RI sub-set for the diterpene alcohol, isophytol, was separated from the RI data set for phytol and four additional sub-groups of published RI data for one of the sesquiterpenes, γ-elemene, were re-identified as α-, β-, δ-elemenes and germacrene B. 3aalcohols 3achromatography 3adata collection 3agermacrene1 aBabushok, V.I.1 aLinstrom, P.J.1 aWhite, V.

After a 24 h exposure, the proportion of females that survived treatments was 0.71 (6 mg/l), 0.51 (12 mg/l), 0.41 (24 mg/l), 0.30 (48 mg/l) and 0.25 (96 mg/l). At the end of the trial, the survival rate of females treated with the lowest concentration was significantly lower than the survival rate of untreated females but it remained above that of females treated with higher concentrations. Total fecundity/fertility significantly decreased as concentrations of spirodiclofen increased. Viable eggs were laid by females treated with 6, 12 and 24 mg/l, and total fertility was reduced by 42, 84 and 97%, respectively. Compared with control, the gross fecundity/fertility of the treated females was significantly reduced throughout the trial, except in females treated with 6 mg/l. All concentrations caused a significant reduction in the net fecundity/fertility throughout the trial. The females treated with 12 mg/l had significantly reduced net reproductive rate (R ₀ = 6.45), compared to females treated with 6 mg/l (R ₀ = 23.35) and to untreated females (R ₀ = 28.92); there was no significant difference between the last two treatments. The intrinsic rate of increase (r m) and finite rate of increase (λ) were significantly reduced in treated females (r m = 0.141, λ = 1.156 and r m = 0.214, λ = 1.232; 12 and 6 mg/l, respectively), compared to control (r m = 0.251, λ = 1.276). The reduction was significantly greater in females treated with the highest concentration. As a result of the lowered r m , the doubling time in treated females was significantly extended. Sublethal effects of spirodiclofen and its impact on T. urticae management are discussed. 3aTetranychus urticae 3aacarology 3abioassays 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3aimmatures 3alife history 3aspirodiclofen 3asublethal effects 3asurvival rate 2a4-Butyrolactonexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFertilityxdrug effects 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aLife Tables 2aMale 2aSpiro Compoundsxpharmacology 2aTetranychidaexphysiology0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2007 June, v. 42, no. 2 p.121-129dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-007-9082-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20070702b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02611naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163100002400172245007200196300001600268500002400284500002300308500001500331520077600346650001301122650002201135650001701157650001401174650002301188650001001211650002501221650001201246650002301258650001901281650002601300650002401326650004301350650001401393650002701407650002001434653002101454653001301475653001101488653002801499653002101527700001701548700002001565700001901585700002401604700002001628700002001648700001901668773012101687852000901808856007501817930003301892945002501925946001101950655001201961IND4416777120221121174351.0090224e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441677712DNAL7 a189235312pmid7 a10.1139/G08-0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL0011 aCameron, Stephen L.10aMitochondrial genome organization and phylogeny of two vespid wasps  ap. 800-808.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aWe sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome of Abispa ephippium (Hymenoptera: Vespoidea: Vespidae: Eumeninae) and most of the mitochondrial genome of Polistes humilis synoecus (Hymenoptera: Vespoidea: Vespidae: Polistinae). The arrangement of genes differed between the two genomes and also differed slightly from that inferred to be ancestral for the Hymenoptera. The genome organization for both vespids is different from that of all other mitochondrial genomes previously reported. A number of tRNA gene rearrangements were identified that represent potential synapomorphies for a subset of the Vespidae. Analysis of all available hymenopteran mitochondrial genome sequences recovered an uncontroversial phylogeny, one consistent with analyses of other types of data. 3aPolistes 3amitochondrial DNA 3atransfer RNA 3aphylogeny 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGenome, Insect 2aGenome, Mitochondrial 2aGenomic Instability 2aHymenopteraxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aWaspsxgenetics 0aPolistes humilis 0aVespidae 0agenome 0amolecular sequence data 0aAbispa ephippium1 aDowton, Mark1 aCastro, Lyda R.1 aRuberu, Kalani1 aWhiting, Michael F.1 aAustin, Andy D.1 aDiement, Kieren1 aStevens, Julia0 tGenome =.g2008 Oct., v. 51, no. 10 p.800-808dNRC Research Press, National Research Council Canadax0831-27967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/G08-0663Available from publisher's Web site  a20090515b20090608c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03868naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245016700182300001500349520193100364650002102295650001702316650001902333650001402352650001002366650001702376650001202393650002502405650001102430650001702441650001302458650001402471650001302485650002602498650001002524650001402534650001202548650001102560650002702571650001702598650000902615650001002624650003202634650001602666650003502682650002402717650001002741651001102751651001102762653002402773653002802797653001502825653001502840653002302855700002902878700002002907773012902927852000903056856008503065930003303150946001103183655001203194IND4392851820221121174337.0070702e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439285182DNAL7 a175647892pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-007-9084-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbar, Ziad 10aAssessment of pesticide susceptibility for Typhlodromus exhilaratus and Typhlodromus phialatus strains (Acari: Phytoseiidae) from vineyards in the south of France  ap. 95-105.  aTwo species of Phytoseiidae predominated in and around vineyards in an experimental site in the south of France: Typhlodromus exhilaratus is the dominant species on grapes, whereas T. phialatus occurs in the uncultivated areas surrounding these crops. To help understand their distribution, this study aims to determine their susceptibility to a fungicide (dimethomorph + mancozeb) and an insecticide (chlorpyriphos-ethyl), which have been widely used at the experimental site for at least four years. The hypothesis tested is that the effects of these two pesticides differ between T. exhilaratus and T. phialatus. Two populations of T. exhilaratus, one collected on a vine crop where the two pesticides were applied and the other in an unsprayed orchard of Sorbus domestica, and one population of T. phialatus collected on Viburnum tinus from uncultivated areas adjacent to the vine crop, were tested under laboratory conditions. The fungicide seems to affect the females of T. phialatus more than those of T. exhilaratus from vine. However, at the recommended field concentration the female mortality rates of the three strains were low and female fecundities were not significantly different. Conversely, mortality rates were very high for the three strains at the recommended field concentration of chlorpyrifos-ethyl. The strain of T. exhilaratus from vine seems to be more tolerant and 20% of females survived the recommended field rate. This suggests better survival after insecticide application than females of T. phialatus (100% mortality at a lower concentration than the recommended rate). As extrapolation of laboratory results to the field is often irrelevant, these differences could be just one of several factors affecting the spatial segregation of the two species in the agrosystem considered. Possible explanations other than pesticides for the poor settlement of T. phialatus in vine plots are discussed. 3aSorbus domestica 3aTyphlodromus 3aViburnum tinus 3aacarology 3acrops 3adimethomorph 3afemales 3afungicide resistance 3agrapes 3ainsecticides 3amancozeb 3amortality 3aorchards 3apesticide application 3avines 3avineyards 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFungicides, Industrial 2aInsecticides 2aMale 2aManeb 2aMitesxgrowth & development 2aMorpholines 2aOrganothiophosphorus Compounds 2aVitisxparasitology 2aZineb 3aFrance 0aFrance 0aChlorpyriphos-ethyl 0aDimethomorph + mancozeb 0aResistance 0aVine crops 0aUncultivated areas1 aTixier, Marie-Stéphane 1 aKreiter, Serge 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2007 June, v. 42, no. 2 p.95-105dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-007-9084-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070702b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03544naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137072000900155100001800164245010500182300001600287500002400303500001500327520149500342650001001837650001901847650001301866650002601879650002201905650001201927650005001939650001401989650003602003650002902039650002802068650003802096650002402134650005702158651001202215653002602227653001602253653002202269653001302291653002002304653001902324653001802343653001702361653002702378653001902405653001502424700002402439700001802463700001802481700001402499700001802513700002302531700001702554700001602571773010502587852000902692856007602701930003302777945002502810946001102835655001202846IND4416737220221121103426.0090220e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441673722DNAL7 a192198522pmid7 a10.1002/pca.11122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aFoubert, Kenn10aLC-MS analysis of 13,28-epoxy-oleanane saponins in Maesa spp. extracts with antileishmanial activity  ap. 159-167.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aINTRODUCTION: Saponins are natural products that are well known for a wide range of biological activities. For saponins of Maesa balansae, selective antileishmanial activity has been described. OBJECTIVE: In view of their pharmacological interest, several Maesa species from the National Botanical Garden of Meise (Belgium) and wild-grown plants from Vietnam were screened for their antileishmanial potential and saponin content. METHODOLOGY: Different parts of the plants (mainly leaves and twigs) were collected, dried and extracted. Plant extracts were evaluated by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using electrospray ionisation in the negative ion mode and their saponin content was compared with those of Maesa balansae (maesabalides) and Maesa lanceolata (maesasaponins). RESULTS: Several Maesa species (M. ambigua, M. argentea, M. brevipaniculata, M. japonica and M. perlarius) showed potent antileishmanial activity (<0.1 μg/mL) and indeed contained known maesasaponins and maesabalides. However the leaves of M. argentea also revealed two new compounds. Two saponins with [M - H]⁻ ions at m/z 1465 and 1477 were characterised. Their mass spectrometric fragmentation pattern revealed a structure that was the same or closely related to maesasaponin V.3 and VI.2, respectively, but had a glycan part with one additional hexose residue.

METHODS: Using a prospective design, male (n=551) and female (n=872) participants of the Framingham Heart Study were classified by presence or absence of obesity and hypertension based on data collected over an 18-y surveillance period. All subjects were free from dementia, stroke, and clinically diagnosed cardiovascular disease up to the time of cognitive testing. Statistical models were adjusted for age, education, occupation, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, total cholesterol, and a diagnosis of type II diabetes. Body mass index status (nonobese or obese) and blood pressure status (normotensive or hypertensive) were then related to cognitive performance (learning, memory, executive functioning, and abstract reasoning) on tests administered 4-6 y later. RESULTS: Adverse effects of obesity and hypertension on cognitive performance were observed for men only. Obese and hypertensive men performed more poorly than men classified as either obese or hypertensive, and the best performance was observed in nonobese, normotensive men. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse effects of obesity and hypertension in men are independent and cumulative with respect to cognitive deficit. 3aadverse effects 3aalcohol drinking 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3acholesterol 3acognition 3adementia 3aeducation 3aheart 3ahypertension 3amemory 3amen 3amonitoring 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3asmoking (habit) 3astatistical models 3astroke 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBody Mass Index 2aCognition Disordersxetiology 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxcomplicationsxpsychology. 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeuropsychological Tests 2aObesityxcomplicationsxpsychology. 2aProspective Studies 2aSex Factors1 aElias, P.K.1 aSullivan, L.M.1 aWolf, P.A.1 aD'Agostino, R.B.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2003 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.260-268dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.8022253Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02745naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001800163245009900181300001400280500002400294500001500318520116700333650001701500650002401517650002401541650001701565650002601582650002201608650001001630650002201640650001701662650002801679650003101707650002301738650003701761653002201798653003701820700002001857700001301877700001701890700001801907700002001925773010501945852000902050856008502059930003302144945002502177946001302202655001202215IND4416680520221121035842.0090220e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441668052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-008-0057-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aDuan, Kaixuan10aCharacterization of a Novel Stress-Response Member of the MAPK Family in Malus hupehensis Rehd  ap. 69-78.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMalus hupehensis Rehd. var. pinyiensis Jiang (Pingyi Tiancha, PYTC) is a botanical variety of Malus (tea crabapple) originating from China. This species is characterized as apomictic, and it is highly capable of resisting water-logging, shade, cold, and various diseases. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been implicated in the regulation of stress and developmental signals in plants. In this study, an MAPK gene, MhMAPK, has been isolated from a PYTC complementary DNA (cDNA) library using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The gene encodes a 373-amino-acid protein with high-sequence similarity to other previously reported plants MAPKs. MhMAPK contains all 11 MAPK conserved sub-domains and the phosphorylation motif TEY, and when fused to the green fluorescent protein, it is found to be localized in the nucleus of epidermal cells of onion. Transcripts of MhMAPK accumulate when PYTC is treated with 20% polyethylene glycol and 200 mM NaCl. These results indicated that MhMAPK may be functional within the nucleus by phosphorylating transcriptional factors. This, in turn, allows plants to rapidly respond to the environmental signals. 3aplant stress 3aconserved sequences 3asignal transduction 3awater stress 3aplant-water relations 3asequence homology 3aMalus 3amolecular cloning 3aactive sites 3aprotein phosphorylation 3agene expression regulation 3aflooding tolerance 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 0asequence analysis 0aMalus hupehensis var. pinyiensis1 aYang, Hongqiang1 aRan, Kun1 aYou, Shuzhen1 aZhao, Haizhou1 aJiang, Qianqian0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2009 Mar., v. 27, no. 1 p.69-78dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-008-0057-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/06/03  aOther US 7aarticle01837naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245009800133300001400231300002200245500001500267520089100282650001901173650001601192650002501208650001901233650002001252651001201272653001901284653002101303700001801324773008201342852000901424939003301433945000801466946001301474655001201487991609935690742620221121023634.0860522e198503  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860104872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnyanwu, R.C.10aImpact of urbanization and socioeconomic status on infant feeding practices in Lagos, Nigeria  ap. 33-37.  ap. 33-37. charts.  a2019-12-05  aA report covers the first phase of an on-going national study to evaluate current maternal perceptions of infant feeding among different ethnic, religious, cultural, and socioeconomic groups in urbanized Nigeria. The main objective of the study is to assess the extent of breast-feeding decline, the principal factors responsible for this negative change, and how best to institute corrective eductional measures. Present findings demonstrate that virtually all mothers studied still held strong positive feelings about the importance of breast-feeding. However, a wide discrepancy was found between actual infant feeding practices of mothers and their expressed views on what these practices should be. One influencing factor appears to be the great pressure on mothers to spend more time trying to augment the family income at the expense of caring adequately for their children.

The field-grown plants accumulate abundant ADS and CYP71AV1 but a trace amount of CPR in all tested tissues. Furthermore, ADS and CYP71AV1 accumulations in leaves are 16- and eightfold higher than in roots, and ten- and fourfold higher than in stems, respectively, demonstrating a tissue-specific expression pattern. Interestingly, the flowering field plants and cold-acclimated cultural plants produce higher levels of ADS and CYP71AV1 than non-flowering field plants or untreated cultural plants, indicating the environmental and developmental induction on ADS and CYP71AV1 genes and providing possible explanation for the observation that elevation of artemisinin level occurs after flowering. 3aArtemisia annua 3aartemisinin 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aoxygenases 3acytochrome P-450 3apolyclonal antibodies 3atissue distribution 3aflowering 3abiochemical pathways 0aamorpha-4,11-diene synthase 0acytochrome P450 reductase1 aZeng, Xiao-Mei1 aYin, Lu-Lu1 aYang, Rui-Yi1 aFeng, Li-Ling1 aYang, Xue-Qin0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2009 Mar., v. 27, no. 1 p.50-57dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-008-0056-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/06/03  aOther US 7aarticle02117naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245008500167300001600252520086800268650002801136650002401164650001401188650001101202650001201213650001201225650002401237650001601261650000901277650002401286650002001310650001301330653002201343653001501365653000901380700002101389700001901410773013201429852000901561856006901570930003301639946001101672655001201683IND4387452120221120212750.0070204e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438745212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-006-9038-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWijk, Michiel van10aMorphology of the olfactory system in the predatory mite Phytoseiulus Persimilis  ap. 217-229.  aThe predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis locates its prey, the two-spotted spider mite, by means of herbivore-induced plant volatiles. The olfactory response to this quantitatively and qualitatively variable source of information is particularly well documented. The mites perform this task with a peripheral olfactory system that consists of just five putative olfactory sensilla that reside in a dorsal field at the tip of their first pair of legs. The receptor cells innervate a glomerular olfactory lobe just ventral of the first pedal ganglion. We have made a 3D reconstruction of the caudal half of the olfactory lobe in adult females. The glomerular organization as well as the glomerular innervation appears conserved across different individuals. The adult females have, by approximation, a 1:1 ratio of olfactory receptor cells to olfactory glomeruli. 3aPhytoseiulus persimilis 3aTetranychus urticae 3aacarology 3aadults 3afemales 3aganglia 3ainformation sources 3ainnervation 3alegs 3aolfactory receptors 3apredatory mites 3asensilla 0a3D reconstruction 0aGlomerulus 0aCLSM1 aWadman, Wytse J.1 aSabelis, M.

Apistan and the fungal treatments resulted in successful control of mite populations in both locations. At the end of the 42-day period of the experiment in Texas, the number of mites per bee was reduced by 69-fold in bee hives treated with Apistan and 25-fold in hives treated with the fungus; however mite infestations increased by 1.3-fold in the control bee hives. Similarly, the number of mites in sealed brood was 13-fold and 3.6-fold higher in the control bee hives than in those treated with Apistan and with the fungus, respectively. Like the miticide Apistan, the fungal treatments provided a significant reduction of mite populations at the end of the experimental period. The data from the broodless colonies treated with the fungus indicated that optimum mite control could be achieved when no brood is being produced, or when brood production is low, such as in the early spring or late fall. In established colonies in Florida, honey bee colony development did not increase under either Apistan or fungal treatments at the end of the experimental period, suggesting that other factors (queen health, food source, food availability) play some major role in the growth of bee colonies. Overall, microbial control of Varroa mites with fungal pathogens could be a useful component of an integrated pest management program for the honey bee industry. 3aApis mellifera 3aHyphomycetes 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aVarroa destructor 3aacarology 3aautumn 3abeehives 3aconidia 3afield experimentation 3afood availability 3afungi 3ahoney bee colonies 3ahoney bees 3aindustry 3aintegrated pest management 3amite control 3amite infestations 3amites 3apathogens 3aspring 3aFlorida 3aTexas 0aStrips1 aJones, Walker A. 1 aGracia, Carlos 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2006 Dec., v. 40, no. 3-4 p.249-258dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-006-9033-23electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03153naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245009300169300001600262520175600278650001502034650002602049650001502075650001502090650002302105650001702128650001402145650002302159650000902182650001102191650002002202650001102222650001002233650002002243650001302263650001402276651001102290651001102301653002602312700002802338700002002366700001902386773013202405852000902537856006902546930003302615946001102648655001202659IND4387451720221120202733.0070204e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438745172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-006-9045-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurtado, Imeuda P. 10aSearch for effective natural enemies of Tetranychus evansi in south and southeast Brazil  ap. 157-174.  aTetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard is an important pest of Solanaceae in several countries. Introduced accidentally to Africa, it presently occurs in many countries of that continent. In some of them, it is considered a key pest. The suspected area of origin of this mite is South America. The objective of the present study was to identify phytoseiid mites on solanaceous plants in association with T. evansi in south and southeast Brazil for introduction in the African continent for use in a classic biological control program. Almost 1,400 predatory mites of the family Phytoseiidae were collected, on 22 solanaceous species. The Amblyseiinae were the most diverse group in this study. Twenty-three of the species found belong to this subfamily, while only three belong to the Typhlodrominae and two to the Phytoseiinae. The most abundant and most frequent phytoseiid species were Phytoseius guianensis De Leon and Galendromus annectens (De Leon) of the Phytoseiinae and Typhlodrominae, respectively. The most frequent and abundant species of Amblyseiinae was Neoseiulus tunus (De Leon). Phytoseius guianensis and N. tunus were never found in association with T. evansi and G. annectens was found only once in association with it. Two factors suggested Phytoseiulus longipes Evans as the most promising predator found in this study. It could walk very well on tomato leaves infested by T. evansi, without being hampered by the profuse webbing produced by the prey and by the trichomes. In addition, several specimens of both sexes including eggs and nymphs of the predator were found associated with T. evansi on three different plant species and in two different periods of the year, when T. evansi was the only arthropod present on the leaves. 3aNeoseiulus 3aPhytoseiulus longipes 3aPhytoseius 3aSolanaceae 3aTetranychus evansi 3aTyphlodromus 3aacarology 3abiological control 3aeggs 3aleaves 3anatural enemies 3anymphs 3apests 3apredatory mites 3atomatoes 3atrichomes 3aAfrica 3aBrazil 0aPhytoseiulus longipes1 ade Moraes, Gilberto J. 1 aKreiter, Serge 1 aKnapp, Markus 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2006 Dec., v. 40, no. 3-4 p.157-174dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-006-9045-y3electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03696naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204100001800213245007800231300001600309500002400325500001500349520188200364650002002246650001302266650001802279650001602297650002302313650001902336650001102355650002502366650002102391650002302412650002102435650002502456650003502481650003302516650007602549650006102625650002802686650004102714653001502755700002302770700001602793700002202809773009602831852000902927856008902936930003303025945002503058946001103083655001203094IND4432634020221120191515.0100213e20100301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443263402DNAL7 a200049842pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2009.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH000 0aF841 0aM001 0aM3001 aKnauer, Katja10aCo-tolerance of phytoplankton communities to photosynthesis II inhibitors  ap. 256-263.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNatural variability in sensitivity and pollution induced community tolerance (PICT) to atrazine, isoproturon and diuron and a mixture of these three herbicides to natural algal assemblages in mesocosms was determined. The specificity of PICT was examined by evaluating co-tolerance pattern for these photosystem-II (PSII) inhibitors. Phytoplankton communities were constantly exposed to equipotent concentrations of atrazine, isoproturon, diuron namely the 30% hazard concentration (HC₃₀) obtained from species sensitivity distributions and an equitoxic mixture (Σ3×1/3×HC₃₀ of each herbicide) for five weeks in outdoor mesocosms. Induction of tolerance to the various herbicides was investigated by photosynthetic efficiency measurements of the algal assemblages in short-term laboratory tests. The composition of the algal communities in the various treatments was determined and ordination techniques such as the principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to log-transformed data to compare the seasonal community structure development. Temporal variation in sensitivity of the control algal assemblage to atrazine and isoproturon, but less to diuron was observed. The results further demonstrated that the control communities were in general more sensitive than the treated ones over the whole period tested indicating an enhanced tolerance of pre-exposed phytoplankton in the mesocosms. Co-tolerance was also observed for atrazine pre-exposed algal community to isoproturon, however, not vise versa. A pre-exposure to diuron induced similar tolerance to all three herbicides. A pre-exposure to the mixture treatment also lead to tolerance to isoproturon and diuron, less to atrazine. Overall, the observed co-tolerance pattern indicates that co-tolerance was not comparable between the herbicides with strong similarity in their biochemical mode of action. 3awater pollution 3aatrazine 3aphytoplankton 3aisoproturon 3apesticide mixtures 3aphotosystem II 3adiuron 3aherbicide resistance 3atoxicity testing 2aAtrazinextoxicity 2aDiuronxtoxicity 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 2aPhenylurea Compoundsxtoxicity 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effects 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxantagonists & inhibitorsxdrug effects. 2aPhytoplanktonxclassificationxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aToxicity Tests, Chronic 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0ainhibitors1 aLeimgruber, Andrea1 aHommen, Udo1 aKnauert, Stefanie0 tAquatic toxicology.g2010 Mar. 1, v. 96, no. 4 p.256-263dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2009.11.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100407b20100501c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02708naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002400178245010600202300001800308500002400326506007600350520103900426506003701465650001701502650001201519650004001531650002001571650001301591650002401604650002101628650000901649650003001658650005801688650005001746650004801796650003701844650001101881650003401892650001701926650003901943700001901982700002202001773010502023852000902128856007702137655001202214IND4426808820221207133329.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442680882DNAL7 a195497362pmid7 aPMC27529122pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-01092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilpatrick, Eric S.10aEffect of Glucose Variability on the Long-Term Risk of Microvascular Complications in Type 1 Diabetes  ap. 1901-1903.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: This study analyzed data from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study to see whether longer-term follow-up of Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) patients reveals a role for glycemic instability in the development of microvascular complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The mean area under the curve glucose and the within-day glucose variability (SD and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE]) during the DCCT were assessed to see whether they contributed to the risk of retinopathy and nephropathy by year 4 of the EDIC. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that mean glucose during the DCCT and mean A1C during EDIC were independently predictive of retinopathy (each P < 0.001) as well as A1C during EDIC of nephropathy (P = 0.001) development by EDIC year 4. Glucose variability did not add to this (all P > 0.25 using SD or MAGE). CONCLUSIONS: Glucose variability in the DCCT did not predict the development of retinopathy or nephropathy by EDIC year 4.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepidemiology 3aglucose 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3akidney diseases 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3aretinal diseases 3arisk 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xcomplicationsxmetabolism. 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aDiabetic Retinopathyxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMicrovesselsxphysiopathology 2aRisk Factors 2aVascular Diseasesxphysiopathology1 aRigby, Alan S.1 aAtkin, Stephen L.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1901-1903dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-01093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03538naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001500178245009300193300001800286500002400304506007600328520172700404506003702131650001802168650002202186650002002208650002402228650002302252650001302275650002102288650001702309650002402326650001602350650003002366650001002396650003102406650002102437650002002458650001102478650001102489650000902500650001602509650004202525650001602567700002002583700002102603700001602624700002302640700001502663700001902678700001702697700001902714773010502733852000902838856007702847655001202924IND4426809120221207133316.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442680912DNAL7 a195873632pmid7 aPMC27529382pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-09432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, Ram10aShort-Term Dynamics and Metabolic Impact of Abdominal Fat Depots After Bariatric Surgery  ap. 1910-1915.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Bariatric surgery is gaining acceptance as an efficient treatment modality for obese patients. Mechanistic explanations regarding the effects of bariatric surgery on body composition and fat distribution are still limited. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Intra-abdominal and subcutaneous fat depots were evaluated using computed tomography in 27 obese patients prior to and 6 months following bariatric surgery. Associations with anthropometric and clinical changes were evaluated. RESULTS: Excess weight loss 6 months following surgery was 47% in male and 42.6% in female subjects. Visceral fat and subcutaneous fat were reduced by 35% and 32%, respectively, in both sexes, thus the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio remained stable. The strongest relation between absolute and relative changes in visceral and subcutaneous fat was demonstrated for the excess weight loss following the operations (r ~0.6-0.7), and these relations were strengthened further following adjustments for sex, baseline BMI, and fat mass. Changes in waist circumference and fat mass had no relation to changes in abdominal fat depots. All participants met the criteria of the metabolic syndrome at baseline, and 18 lost the diagnosis on follow-up. A lower baseline visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (0.43 ± 0.15 vs. 0.61 ± 0.21, P = 0.02) was associated with clinical resolution of metabolic syndrome parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio between visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat remains fairly constant 6 months following bariatric procedures regardless of sex, procedure performed, or presence of metabolic complications. A lower baseline visceral-to-abdominal fat ratio is associated with improvement in metabolic parameters.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabdominal fat 3abariatric surgery 3abody mass index 3acomputed tomography 3ametabolic syndrome 3apatients 3asubcutaneous fat 3avisceral fat 3awaist circumference 3aweight loss 2aAbdominal Fatxmetabolism 2aAdult 2aBariatric Surgeryxmethods 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesity, Morbidxmetabolismxsurgery. 2aWeight Loss1 aAppelbaum, Liat1 aSchweiger, Chaya1 aMatot, Idit1 aConstantini, Naama1 aIdan, Alon1 aShussman, Noam1 aSosna, Jacob1 aKeidar, Andrei0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1910-1915dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-09433Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03249naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072000900189072000900198100002300207245006100230300001400291500011900305500002400424506007600448520080600524506003701330650003401367650001701401650001201418650004601430650002201476650002301498650002201521650002301543650002501566650001901591650002001610650001901630650001201649650002801661650001901689650002501708650002001733650001101753650004501764650006301809650000901872650001401881650003001895651001301925651002801938653002301966653001701989653002102006700002502027700002402052700001602076700001802092700002002110700002402130700002202154700002402176773011302200852000902313856008802322930003302410945002502443946001102468655001202479IND4432633620221207121330.0100213e20100315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443263362DNAL7 a199261442pmid7 aPMC28221062pmcid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aP0501 aBrown, Meredith A.10aFeline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in wild Pallas' cats  ap. 90-95.  aIn the special issue: 9th International Feline Retrovirus Research Symposium 2008 / edited by Jill Pecon-Slattery.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFeline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a feline lentivirus related to HIV, causes immune dysfunction in domestic and wild cats. The Pallas' cat is the only species from Asia known to harbor a species-specific strain of FIV designated FIVOma in natural populations. Here, a 25% seroprevalence of FIV is reported from 28 wild Mongolian Pallas' cats sampled from 2000 to 2008. Phylogenetic analysis of proviral RT-Pol from eight FIVOma isolates from Mongolia, Russia, China and Kazakhstan reveals a unique monophyletic lineage of the virus within the Pallas' cat population, most closely related to the African cheetah and leopard FIV strains. Histopathological examination of lymph node and spleen from infected and uninfected Pallas' cats suggests that FIVOma causes immune depletion in its' native host.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3awild animals 3aFelidae 3afeline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 3awildlife diseases 3athreatened species 3adisease incidence 3avirus transmission 3adisease surveillance 3aanimal tissues 3atissue analysis 3ahistopathology 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wildxvirology 2aCatsxvirology 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aFelisxvirology 2aFemale 2aImmunodeficiency Virus, Felinexgenetics 2aLentivirus Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aMale 2aPhylogeny 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 3aMongolia 0aMongoliaxepidemiology. 0aliterature reviews 0aPallas' cats 0aOtocolobus manul1 aMunkhtsog, Bariushaa1 aTroyer, Jennifer L.1 aRoss, Steve1 aSellers, Rani1 aFine, Amanda E.1 aSwanson, William F.1 aRoelke, Melody E.1 aO'Brien, Stephen J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2010 Mar. 15, v. 134, no. 1-2 p.90-95dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02906naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002600177245013100203300001400334500002400348520147700372650000901849650002001858650002101878650001201899650002101911650002801932650002301960650002701983650003002010650001302040650001302053653002602066653002902092700002002121700001802141773010902159852000902268856009002277930003302367945002502400946001102425655001202436IND4432635520221120165640.0100213e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443263552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2009.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL500 0aL8401 aMcKenzie, Samantha J.10aReduction in grass eating behaviours in the domestic dog, Canis familiaris, in response to a mild gastrointestinal disturbance  ap. 51-55.  aIncludes references  aGrass eating behaviour in the domestic dog may be related to gastrointestinal distress. To explore this theory, the current study observed grass eating behaviours in dogs fed a standard diet with and without supplementation of a fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS). The FOS diet temporarily induced loose, watery stools to simulate a mild gastrointestinal disturbance. During both FOS Diet and Standard Diet periods, dogs were presented with couch (Cynodon dactylon) and kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) grasses, and the time spent eating grass and the number of grass eating and vomiting events was recorded. Our study found that dogs spent significantly more time eating grass when fed the standard diet and producing normal stools than when they were fed the FOS diet and producing loose stools, suggesting that dogs do not use grass to self-medicate a diarrhoeal gastrointestinal disturbance. However, this does not preclude that other forms of gastrointestinal disturbance may be self-medicated by grass eating behaviours. Importantly, dogs did not use grass as an emetic, as there were only two vomiting events and 374 grass eating events observed. Alternatively, the reduction in grass eating may be attributable to a feeling of satiety caused by the fermentation of FOS. For further clarity, future research should examine the effect of other gastrointestinal disturbances, such as constipation (hard, dry stools) or nausea, on grass eating behaviour in the domestic dog. 3adogs 3aanimal behavior 3afeeding behavior 3agrasses 3aCynodon dactylon 3aPennisetum clandestinum 3aexperimental diets 3afructooligosaccharides 3adigestive system diseases 3adiarrhea 3avomiting 0agrass eating behavior 0aself-medicating behavior1 aBrown, Wendy Y.1 aPrice, Ian R.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2010 Feb., v. 123, no. 1-2 p.51-55dElsevier Sciencex0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2009.12.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100318b20100403c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/03/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03050naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002100178245009300199300001800292500002400310500001500334506007600349520105300425506003701478650002101515650001401536650001701550650001101567650001801578650001801596650001401614650001301628650002301641650001101664650002001675650001001695650002501705650001801730650002601748650005001774650001801824650003901842650001101881650003101892650003101923650001101954650005001965650000902015650001602024653003202040700002202072700002302094700001202117700002102129700003302150700001402183773010502197852000902302856007702311655001202388IND4426808520221207133448.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442680852DNAL7 a195497312pmid7 aPMC27529202pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-07442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuch, Bernard E.10aSafety and Viability of Microencapsulated Human Islets Transplanted Into Diabetic Humans  ap. 1887-1889.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Transplantation of insulin-producing cells placed inside microcapsules is being trialled to overcome the need for immunosuppressive therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four type 1 diabetic patients with no detectable C-peptide received an intraperitoneal infusion of islets inside microcapsules of barium alginate (mean 178,200 islet equivalents on each of eight occasions). RESULTS: C-peptide was detected on day 1 post-transplantation, and blood glucose levels and insulin requirements decreased. C-peptide was undetectable by 1-4 weeks. In a multi-islet recipient, C-peptide was detected at 6 weeks after the third infusion and remains detectable at 2.5 years. Neither insulin requirements nor glycemic control was affected. Capsules recovered at 16 months were surrounded by fibrous tissue and contained necrotic islets. No major side effects or infection occurred. CONCLUSIONS: While allografting of encapsulated human islets is safe, efficacy of the cells needs to improve for the therapy to make an impact on the clinical scene.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aglycemic control 3aviability 3aallografting 3ahumans 3aimmunotherapy 3ablood glucose 3ac-peptide 3apatients 3amicroencapsulation 3abarium 3aadverse effects 2aAdult 2aAlginatesxchemistry 2aBlood Glucose 2aC-Peptidexmetabolism 2aCapsulesxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aCell Survival 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xtherapy 2aFemale 2aGlucuronic Acidxchemistry 2aHexuronic Acidsxchemistry 2aHumans 2aIslets of Langerhans Transplantationxmethods 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 0aimmunosuppression (therapy)1 aKeogh, Gregory W.1 aWilliams, Lindy J.1 aWu, Wei1 aFoster, Jayne L.1 aVaithilingam, Vijayganapathy1 aPhilipps.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1887-1889dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-07443Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03465naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002400178245010200202300001800304500002400322500001500346506007600361520186600437506003702303650000802340650001802348650001002366650001702376650004302393650001302436650000902449650004902458650001902507650004102526650001102567650001102578650001402589650000902603650001602612650001502628650003202643650001702675653000902692700002202701700002102723773010502744852000902849856007702858655001202935IND4426807820221207133447.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442680782DNAL7 a197940032pmid7 aPMC27529312pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-09392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNichols, Gregory A.10aIndependent Contribution of Diabetes to Increased Prevalence and Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation  ap. 1851-1856.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Diabetes has long been recognized as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, but its independent contribution to atrial fibrillation has not been fully evaluated. We sought to compare the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation in age- and sex-matched patients with and without type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using an observational cohort design, we selected 10,213 members of an HMO diabetes registry as of 1 January 1999 plus 7,159 patients who entered the registry by 31 December 2004 and matched them to patients without diabetes on year of birth and sex. All patients were followed until they died, left the health plan, or until 31 December 2008. We compared the baseline prevalence of atrial fibrillation and then followed patients without atrial fibrillation to compare atrial fibrillation incidence while controlling for known risk factors. RESULTS: Atrial fibrillation prevalence was significantly greater among patients with diabetes (3.6 vs. 2.5%, P < 0.0001). Over a mean follow-up of 7.2 ± 2.8 years, diabetic patients without atrial fibrillation at baseline developed atrial fibrillation at an age- and sex-adjusted rate of 9.1 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.6-9.7) compared with a rate of 6.6 (6.2-7.1) among nondiabetic patients. After full adjustment for other risk factors, diabetes was associated with a 26% increased risk of atrial fibrillation among women (hazard ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.08-1.46]), but diabetes was not a statistically significant factor among men (1.09 [0.96-1.24]). CONCLUSIONS: In this population, diabetes was an independent determinant of atrial fibrillation prevalence but predicted incidence only among women. These findings have potential public health implications and emphasize the need for further investigation of the mechanistic links between diabetes and atrial fibrillation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amen 3apublic health 3awomen 3arisk factors 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 2aAged 2aAtrial Fibrillationxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Complicationsxepidemiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrevalence 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRisk Factors 0arisk1 aReinier, Kyndaron1 aChugh, Sumeet S.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1851-1856dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-09393Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02136naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245007400135300001400209500005300223520128200276650001801558650002401576650001601600650001601616650001401632650002001646650001701666650001001683650001101693773012101704852000901825655001201834IND6081679320221120150452.0141110s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND608167932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiswender, Gordon D.10aGetting Cows Pregnant and Keeping Them Pregnant Requires Progesterone  ap. 73-77.  aMeeting held September 23-25, Fort Worth, Texas.  aEarly embryonic mortality in sheep and cattle averages 38%, with the majority of losses occurring prior to 30 days post-conception. This loss is primarily due to two factors: 1) genetic abnormalities in the embryo (7 to 10%), and 2) inadequate secretion of progesterone at critical times (approximately 30%). Supplementation of progesterone in cattle increased pregnancy rates by 13 to 30%. Thus, the requirement for continued secretion of progesterone has been clearly documented. Therefore, it is important to understand the complex hormonal interactions between the developing embryo, uterus, pituitary gland and ovary that regulate the secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum. The mechanisms whereby the pregnant uterus prevents regression of the corpus luteum, which occurs at the end of a normal reproductive cycle, are complex and sensitive to a number of environmental and management factors. These factors include heat stress, level of nutrition, genetics and general herd health. Any biological process which retards the growth of the embryo may result in early embryonic mortality due to a lack of synchrony between the embryo and the uterus. The basic physiological mechanisms involved in establishing and maintaining pregnancy are presented and discussed. 3acorpus luteum 3aembryonic mortality 3aheat stress 3aherd health 3anutrition 3apituitary gland 3aprogesterone 3asheep 3auterus0 tProceedings of the ... annual conference.g2004, , no. 37th p.73-77dThe AssociationwJournal:12368x1079-97377nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04152naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002100178245009300199300001800292500002400310506007600334520178800410506003702198650003102235650001602266650002802282650001502310650001002325650002502335650002402360650004302384650002602427650001302453650002402466650001802490650001902508650000902527650001602536650003102552650004202583650005102625650002202676650005802698650002902756650001102785650003002796650001102826650003502837650000902872650001602881650003202897650002402929650003502953700001802988700002303006700001803029700002103047700001903068700001803087700001803105700001703123700002003140700002003160700002303180773010503203852000903308856007703317655001203394IND4426808620221207121329.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442680862DNAL7 a195644552pmid7 aPMC27529422pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-21682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaier, Christina10aEndothelial Markers May Link Kidney Function to Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes  ap. 1890-1895.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: The increased cardiovascular risk in diabetes has been linked to endothelial and renal dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of stable fragments of the precursors of adrenomedullin, endothelin-1, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide in progression of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study design with a composite end point (death or unexpected admission to hospital due to a cardiovascular event) on 781 patients with type 2 diabetes (54 events, median duration of observation 15 months). The four stable precursor peptides midregional adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), COOH-terminal proendothelin-1 (CT-proET-1), and COOH-terminal provasopressin or copeptin (CT-proAVP) were determined at baseline, and their association to renal function and cardiovascular events was studied using stepwise linear and Cox logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis, respectively. RESULTS: MR-proADM, CT-proET-1, CT-proAVP, and MR-proANP were all elevated in patients with future cardiovascular events and independently correlated to serum creatinine. MR-proADM and MR-proANP were significant predictors of a future cardiovascular event, with MR-proANP being the stronger (area under the curve 0.802 ± 0.034, sensitivity 0.833, specificity 0.576, positive predictive value 0.132, and negative predictive value 0.978 with a cutoff value of 75 pmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: The four serum markers of vasoactive and natriuretic peptides are related to both kidney function and cardiovascular events, thus linking two major complications of diabetes, diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aatrial natriuretic peptide 3ablood serum 3acardiovascular diseases 3acreatinine 3adeath 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aexperimental design 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arenal failure 3arenal function 3arisk 3avasopressin 2aAdrenomedullinxmetabolism 2aAtrial Natriuretic Factorxmetabolism 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aCreatininexblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplicationsxmetabolism. 2aEndothelin-1xmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGlycopeptidesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aKidneyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aProspective Studies 2aProtein Precursorsxmetabolism1 aClodi, Martin1 aNeuhold, Stephanie1 aResl, Michael1 aElhenicky, Marie1 aPrager, Rudolf1 aMoertl, Deddo1 aStrunk, Guido1 aLuger, Anton1 aStruck, Joachim1 aPacher, Richard1 aHülsmann, Martin.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1890-1895dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-21683Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02044naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245002100128300001400149500005300163520127700216650002801493650001801521650001201539650001901551650000801570650001001578650002001588650001601608773012101624852000901745655001201754IND6081679220221120135946.0141110s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND608167922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaacke, R. G.10aSperm Morphology  ap. 67-71.  aMeeting held September 23-25, Fort Worth, Texas.  aAbnormal spermatozoa have been historically associated with male subfertility and sterility. As early as 1927, an insightful report by Williams and Savage in the Cornell Vet stated that "the dimensions of sperm heads from good fertility bulls are remarkably uniform". This is still true. Presence of abnormal spermatozoa in semen is one of our most sensitive indications that spermatogenesis of a male has been impaired. In addition, occurrence of certain types of abnormal sperm are more dangerous, and can indicate that normal-appearing sperm in the same sample may also be abnormal or incompetent in fertilization or sustaining embryogenesis once initiated. In this paper, we will summarize current concepts of how sperm morphology impacts fertilization rate, as well as early embryogenesis, by examining their transport in the female and engagement of the ovum. Also discussed is the relationship of sperm morphology as we measure it in the breeding soundness exam to what we recognize as the two main components comprising seminal deficiencies in artificial insemination: 1) those deficiencies which can be overcome by raising the sperm dosage to the female (compensable) 2) and those deficiencies where subfertility exists regardless of sperm dosage (uncompensable). 3aartificial insemination 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3amale fertility 3aova 3asemen 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa0 tProceedings of the ... annual conference.g2004, , no. 37th p.67-71dThe AssociationwJournal:12368x1079-97377nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01563naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009700126300001300223500001500236520073200251650002600983650002501009650001301034650002001047653001301067653001201080653002201092773009201114852000901206939003301215946001301248655001201261IND8802683320221120130846.0880714e198709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880268332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, L.L.10aConsumer use of label information in ratings of clothing quality and clothing fashionability  ap. 8-14.  a2019-12-04  aIn two simulated "shopping" tasks college female subjects rated four white blouses on quality and fashionability.

Content analysis of the information selected indicated that subjects disregarded about half the available information when making the ratings. Style and price were the most sought pieces of information. The 100% cotton designer label blouse was rated higher in quality and fashionability than the other blouses, although the blouses were consistent across construction quality and styling. The use of the behavioral process technique for investigating pre-purchase information search behavior for clothing is discussed. 3aclothing construction 3aconsumer information 3aclothing 3aproduct quality 0alabeling 0afashion 0apurchasing habits0 tClothing and textiles research journal.g1987 Fall, v. 6, no. 1 p.8-14x0887-302X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880714c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03360naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002200182245009400204300001600298500002400314506007600338520177400414506003702188650002002225650001202245650001102257650001402268650002302282650000902305650001602314650002102330650002002351650004102371650002002412650003802432650001302470650005702483650001602540650004202556700002202598700002502620700001902645773011202664852000902776856008102785655001202866IND4405199220221207134850.0080502e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440519922DNAL7 a183598432pmid7 aPMC23303202pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.108.1164182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemming, Megan N.10aLow-Temperature and Daylength Cues Are Integrated to Regulate FLOWERING LOCUS T in Barley  ap. 355-366.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInteractions between flowering time genes were examined in a doubled haploid barley (Hordeum vulgare) population segregating for H. vulgare VERNALIZATION1 (HvVRN1), HvVRN2, and PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD-H1). A deletion allele of HvVRN2 was associated with rapid inflorescence initiation and early flowering, but only in lines with an active allele of PPD-H1. In these lines, the floral promoter FLOWERING LOCUS T (HvFT1) was expressed at high levels without vernalization, and this preceded induction of HvVRN1. Lines with the deletion allele of HvVRN2 and the inactive ppd-H1 allele did not undergo rapid inflorescence initiation and were late flowering. These data suggest that HvVRN2 counteracts PPD-H1 to prevent flowering prior to vernalization. An allele of HvVRN1 that is expressed at high basal levels (HvVRN1-1) was associated with rapid inflorescence initiation regardless of HvVRN2 or PPD-H1 genotype. HvFT1 was expressed without vernalization in lines with the HvVRN1-1 allele and HvFT1 transcript levels were highest in lines with the active PPD-H1 allele; this correlated with rapid apex development postinflorescence initiation. Thus, expression of HvVRN1 promotes inflorescence initiation and up-regulates HvFT1. Analysis of HvVRN1 expression in different genetic backgrounds postvernalization showed that HvVRN2, HvFT1, and PPD-H1 are unlikely to play a role in low-temperature induction of HvVRN1. In a vernalization responsive barley, HvFT1 is not induced by low temperatures alone, but can be induced by long days following prolonged low-temperature treatment. We conclude that low-temperature and daylength flowering-response pathways are integrated to control expression of HvFT1 in barley, and that this might occur through regulation of HvVRN2 activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHordeum vulgare 3aalleles 3abarley 3aflowering 3agenetic background 3aloci 3aphotoperiod 2aCold Temperature 2aDown-Regulation 2aFlowering Topsxgrowth & development 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenotype 2aHordeumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPhotoperiod 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aPeacock, W.

Prior to replication in host cells, they form circular templates by unknown mechanisms. Examining lytic infection with bovine herpesvirus 1, we observed immediate-early transcription over joined genome ends, which suggested that circles are present at the initial stage of infection. Among the transcripts was a spliced immediate-early RNA (1.5 kb) sharing exon 1 with previously described major immediate-early transcripts from the right genome end and exon 2 with a late transcript located near the left genome end. Exon 2 encodes a putative circ-encoded protein with homology to the varicella-zoster virus open reading frame 2 and equine herpesvirus 1 open reading frame 3 products. The novel features reported here for bovine herpesvirus 1 may constitute a more general property of herpesviruses. 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviral proteins 3aexons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aCells, Cultured 2aDNA, Circularxgenetics 2aGenes, Viralxgenetics 2aGenome, Viral 2aHerpesvirus 1, Bovinexgenetics 2aHerpesvirus 3, Humanxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aRNA Precursorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Splicingxgenetics 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0abovine herpesvirus 0agenome 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/m964531 aWirth, U.V.1 aVogt, B.1 aSchwyzer, M.0 tJournal of virology.g1993 Mar., v. 67, no. 3 p.1328-1333x0022-538X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03052naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011500125300001600240520207000256650002002326650001102346650002002357650001102377650001802388650001302406650001902419650002102438650002302459653001502482653001402497700001602511773009502527852000902622930003302631945001302664946001302677655001202690IND2328788720221120090721.0020903e200110  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232878872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirase, K.10aEffect of flurazole and other safeners for chloroacetanilide herbicides on cysteine synthase in sorghum shoots  ap. 116-123.  aThe effects of selected herbicide safeners on shoot growth inhibition and on cysteine synthase [CS; EC 4.2.99.8] activity of sorghum were examined. Seed treatment (1.25 g/kg seed) of flurazole [phenylmethyl 2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-5-thiazolecarboxylate] protected seedlings from growth inhibition by alachlor [2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl) acetamide]. Flurazole seed treatment (1.25 g/kg) increased the specific activity micromol/min/mg protein) and total activity (micromol/min/g fresh weight) of CS from 1.13- to 1.41-fold and from 1.40- to 1.75-fold at 48 and 72 h after planting, respectively. CS activity at 48 h after planting increased as the dosage of flurazole increased from 0.01 to 2.5 g/kg seed. Protection from growth inhibition by alachlor (100 micromolar) also increased as the flurazole dosage increased from 0.01 to 0.625 g/kg seed. Flurazole had little inhibitory effect on CS activity between 3 and 30 micromolar in the in vitro enzyme assay, suggesting that increased CS activity by this safener was not due to the activation of constitutive CS. Protection from growth inhibition by alachlor was also observed for the seed treatments of fluxofenim [O-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)-2,2, 2-trifluoro-4'-chloroacetophenone-oxime; 0.1-0.4 g/kg seed], naphthalic anhydride [1H, 3H-naphtho(1,8-cd)-pyran-1,3-dione; 0.625-2.5 g/kg seed], benoxacor [4-(dichloroacetyl)-3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2H-1,4-benzoxa zine; 0.625-2.5 g/kg seed], and dichlormid [2,2-dichloro-N-N'-di-2-propenylacetamide; 0.625-2.5 g/kg seed]. The safening efficacy of dichlormid was the lowest for the compounds tested. Fluxofenim (0.4 g/kg seed), naphthalic anhydride (2.5 g/kg seed), benoxacor (2.5 g/kg seed), and dichlormid (2.5 g/kg seed) increased CS activity (micromol/min/g fresh weight) by 36, 38, 61, and 22%, respectively at 48 h after planting. However, the safening efficacy by these compounds and the increase in CS activity were not clearly correlated. These results suggest that safener treatments increase the extractable CS activity in sorghum shoots. 3aSorghum bicolor 3alyases 3aenzyme activity 3ashoots 3aphytotoxicity 3aalachlor 3aseed dressings 3aapplication rate 3aherbicide safeners 0aprotection 0aflurazole1 aMolin, W.T.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.116-123x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02839naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014800127300001500275520175200290650002302042650001102065650001702076650001602093650002802109650001302137650002002150650002202170650002702192650002302219653002402242700001702266700002002283773009402303852000902397930003302406945001302439946001302452655001202465IND2328788220221120090712.0020903e200110  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232878822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurham, E.W.10aToxicity and neurophysiological effects of fipronil and its oxidative sulfone metabolite on European corn borer larvae (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)  ap. 97-106.  aThe phenylpyrazole insecticide fipronil is the first compound of its class to be registered for commercial use. The mode of action of this class of insecticides involves antagonism of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The sulfone metabolite of fipronil has been reported to be similar in toxicity to the parent compound. In this study, the toxicity and neurophysiological effects of fipronil and the sulfone metabolite were determined for European corn borer larvae. Fipronil was very toxic to neonate European corn borer larvae in feeding bioassays (LC50 = 3.34 ng a.i./cm2 of treated diet) and to fifth instars in topical bioassays (LD50 = 18.78 ng/insect). The sulfone metabolite was slightly more toxic to neonate larvae (LC50 = 1.44 ng a.i./cm2) and equally toxic to fifth instar larvae (LD50 = 19.54 ng/insect) compared with the parent compound. Neonate larvae preexposed to piperonyl butoxide (PBO) residues coated on the inside of glass scintillation vials for 6 h at 100 microgram/vial resulted in significant antagonism of fipronil toxicity (LC50 = 4.39 ng a.i./cm2), whereas preexposure to PBO at 1 microgram/vial had no effect (LC50 = 2.91 ng a.i./cm2). Fifth instars topically treated with 10 microgram of PBO caused significant antagonism of fipronil toxicity (LD50 = 34.41 ng/insect). Electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous electrical activity were conducted on isolated ventral nerve cords from fifth instar larvae. Results from these experiments indicate that fipronil and its sulfone metabolite both reverse the inhibitory effect of GABA on spontaneous electrical activity. Fipronil, however, caused an increase in spontaneous electrical activity relative to that of the sulfone metabolite. 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3alarvae 3ainsecticides 3ametabolites 3ainsecticidal properties 3atoxicity 3aneurophysiology 3aelectrophysiology 3acentral nervous system 3apiperonyl butoxide 0aventral nerve cords1 aScharf, M.E.1 aSiegfried, B.D.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.97-106x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04138naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100003000181245012000211300001800331500002400349506007600373520146000449506003701909650002801946650003101974650001802005650002502023650001302048650002002061650001102081650002102092650002502113650001602138650003702154650001402191650002702205650001402232650002002246650001402266650005002280650003702330650003202367650002202399650005202421650005902473650003602532650001102568650002302579650003702602650005102639650004302690650002002733650002902753650005202782650003602834650005402870700002102924700002302945700002202968700002402990700002403014700002103038700002103059700002303080700002603103700002003129773011803149852000903267856008003276655001203356IND4427439320221207132856.0091016s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442743932DNAL7 a197207612pmid7 aPMC27725412pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00607-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGagliardi, Maria Cristina10aMycobacteria Exploit p38 Signaling To Affect CD1 Expression and Lipid Antigen Presentation by Human Dendritic Cells  ap. 4947-4952.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGroup I CD1 proteins are specialized antigen-presenting molecules that present both microbial and self lipid antigens to CD1-restricted α/β T lymphocytes. The production of high levels of gamma interferon and lysis of infected macrophages by lipid-specific T lymphocytes are believed to play pivotal roles mainly in the defense against mycobacterial infections. We previously demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis and bacillus Calmette-Guérin (Mycobacterium bovis BCG) induce human monocytes to differentiate into CD1⁻ dendritic cells (DC), which cannot present lipid antigens to specific T cells. Here, we show that in human monocytes mycobacteria trigger phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase to inhibit CD1 expression in DC derived from infected monocytes. Pretreatment with a specific p38 inhibitor renders monocytes insensitive to mycobacterial subversion and allows them to differentiate into CD1⁺ DC, which are fully capable of presenting lipid antigens to specific T cells. We also report that one of the pathogen recognition receptors triggered by BCG to activate p38 is complement receptor 3 (CR3), as shown by reduced p38 phosphorylation and partial reestablishment of CD1 membrane expression obtained by CR3 blockade before infection. In conclusion, we propose that p38 signaling is a novel pathway exploited by mycobacteria to affect the expression of CD1 antigen-presenting cells and avoid immune recognition.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigen presentation 3aantigens 3adendritic cells 3ahumans 3ainterferon-gamma 3amacrophage-1 antigen 3amacrophages 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amonocytes 3amycobacterial diseases 3apathogens 3aphosphorylation 3areceptors 2aActivating Transcription Factor 2xmetabolism 2aAntigen Presentationximmunology 2aAntigens, CD1xbiosynthesis 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDendritic Cellsximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aLipidsximmunology 2aMacrophage-1 Antigenxmetabolism 2aMonocytesxcytologyximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMycobacteriumximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylation 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism1 aTeloni, Raffaela1 aGiannoni, Federico1 aMariotti, Sabrina1 aRemoli, Maria Elena1 aSargentini, Valeria1 aVidetta, Melissa1 aPardini, Manuela1 aDe Libero, Gennaro1 aCoccia, Eliana Marina1 aNisini, Roberto0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.4947-4952dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00607-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02801naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011500126300001400241500001500255520180400270650001402074650001102088650001302099650000802112650001602120650002102136650001702157650001602174653001502190653003102205653001102236700001902247773009302266852000902359930003302368945001302401946001302414655001202427IND2328788020221120090653.0020903e200110  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232878802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlasiak, J.10aGenotoxicity of malaoxon: induction of oxidized and methylated bases and protective effect of alpha-tocopherol  ap. 88-96.  a2019-12-05  aMalaoxon, the first and main metabolite of malathion, unlike its parent compound, can damage DNA in human lymphocytes, by mechanism(s) including oxidative action. Vitamin C may inhibit the DNA-damaging effect of malaoxon. To explore this effect further, we investigated the action of malaoxon on DNA in lymphocytes pretreated with a potent antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Addition of alpha-tocopherol to a final concentration of 20 and 80 micromolar reduced a dose-dependent DNA damaging effect of a 1-h incubation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes at 37 degrees C with malaoxon at 25, 75, or 200 micromolar, measured as the increase in the comet tail moment of the lymphocytes. Lymphocytes treated with alpha-tocopherol displayed faster kinetics of removing damage to their DNA, and alpha-tocopherol abolished the cytotoxic effect of malaoxon at 200 micromolar. The protective action of alpha-tocopherol followed from its interaction with DNA or with malaoxon bound to DNA or lymphocytes rather than from chemical inactivation of malaoxon by it. Catalase, an enzyme inactivating hydrogen peroxide, decreased the extent of DNA damage induced by malaoxon. Lymphocytes exposed to malaoxon and treated with formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase and 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II, enzymes recognizing oxidized and methylated bases, displayed a greater extent of DNA damage than those not treated with these enzymes. The results suggest that hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species may be involved in the formation of DNA lesions induced by malaoxon. Malaoxon can also methylate DNA bases, and alpha-tocopherol can be considered a protective agent against DNA damage in persons occupationally exposed to malathion/malaoxon. 3amalathion 3ahumans 3acatalase 3aDNA 3alymphocytes 3aalpha-tocopherol 3agenotoxicity 3ametabolites 0aprotection 0aorganophosphorus compounds 0adamage1 aStankowska, D.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.88-96x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02841naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002100136245009600157300001600253500002400269520171100293650001602004650001602020650001602036650001302052650001802065650002402083650002402107650001502131650002202146650001802168650000902186650001702195700002202212700002102234773011502255852000902370856007602379655001202455IND4426898320221120090800.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442689832DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.11962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouw, Jason E.B.10aInfluences of flooding and hyporheic exchange on floodplain plant richness and productivity  ap. 929-945.  aIncludes references  aFlooding disturbance and associated fluvial processes are generally thought to be the primary controls on floodplain species richness patterns. We expanded this idea to include ground and surface water (hyporheic) exchange within alluvial flood plains. At the floodplain scale, we hypothesized that upwelling areas would be richer in species and support higher growth rates of woody plants. At reaches within each flood plain, we evaluated the mechanisms of flood duration, patterns in sedimentation and driftwood as influences. We found patterns of species richness within the shifting mosaic of floodplain wetland habitats to be incoherent with flood duration for large flood plains on the Flathead and Talkeetna Rivers. Rather, species richness was closely associated with hyporheic exchange at the floodplain scale and locally with alluvial particle size. Species richness was highest in areas of both flood plains characterized by upwelling groundwater. On annually scoured surfaces, richness was affected by large wood debris that reduced flow competence, allowing fine sediment deposition and plant establishment. Richness within upwelling and downwelling reaches was highest at sites with the finest alluvia.Growth rates of woody species used as indices of site productivity were also significantly higher at areas characterized by upwelling. We concluded that plant species richness was strongly controlled by hyporheic exchange at the floodplain scale and locally by the deposition of fine alluvia. This interpretation was not consistent with intermediate levels of flood disturbance. Indeed, areas of the flood plain least influenced by flow energy had the highest richness on both flood plains. 3aenergy flow 3afloodplains 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3aparticle size 3aplant establishment 3asediment deposition 3asite index 3aspecies diversity 3asurface water 3awood 3awoody plants1 aStanford, Jack A.1 aAlaback, Paul B.0 tRiver research and applications.g2009 Oct., v. 25, no. 8 p.929-945dJohn Wiley '' Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.11963Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02547naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002100136245008000157300001600237500002400253520154400277650002401821650001101845650000901856650000901865650001401874650002301888650001301911650001101924650002001935700002301955700001901978773011501997852000902112856007602121655001202197IND4426898520221120075032.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442689852DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.11942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarty, Jérôme.14aThe influence of fluctuating ramping rates on the food web of boreal rivers  ap. 962-974.  aIncludes references  aA BACI (before-after-control-impact) sampling design was applied to determine the possible effects of ramping rate (RR) regulation on food webs structure and function in a regulated boreal river. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of primary producers, macroinvertebrates and fish to determine variations in the source of carbon fuelling the food web as well as changes in the food web structure under variable RR flow regime. We hypothesized that unrestricted RR would (1) increase the connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic environments allowing for a higher contribution of terrestrial carbon to support the food web and (2) decrease food web length because of frequent disturbances. Unrestricted RR had little influence on δ¹³C values for the overall food web with most of the differences found between impacted sites compared and control sites, indicating that the proportion of various carbon sources entering the diet of consumers remained unchanged under unrestricted RR. In contrast, significantly higher δ¹⁵N values were measured in impacted sites (invertebrates and fish) and as well as under unrestricted ramping flow regime (invertebrates). Further, unrestricted RR was associated to a significant decrease in the difference between macroinvertebrates and fish δ¹⁵N signatures, equivalent to a reduction of the length of the food web by at least one trophic level. Results from this study indicate that RR should be taken into consideration in the regulation of operating regimes on rivers. 3aaquatic environment 3acarbon 3adiet 3afish 3afood webs 3amacroinvertebrates 3anitrogen 3arivers 3astable isotopes1 aSmokorowski, Karen1 aPower, Michael0 tRiver research and applications.g2009 Oct., v. 25, no. 8 p.962-974dJohn Wiley '' Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.11943Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02216naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010900127300001400236520115100250650001501401650002501416650002001441650002701461650001201488650002601500653003601526700001501562700001701577700001601594700001501610700001701625700001501642700001301657773009201670852000901762930003301771945001301804946001301817655001201830IND2325311820221120062941.0020209e200105  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232531182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamamoto, H.14aThe role of the ABC transporter gene PMR1 in demethylation inhibitor resistance in Penicillium digitatum  ap. 19-26.  aIn a previous study, we showed that disruption of the Penicillium digitatum ABC transporter gene PMR1 in a demethylation inhibitor (DMI)-resistant strain decreases its DMI resistance and that the level of constitutive expression of PMR1 in the DMI-resistant strains was slightly higher than that in the sensitive strains. In this study, we carried out the following three experiments to investigate the specific role of PMR1 in DMI resistance: (i) disruption of PMR1 in a DMI-sensitive strain, (ii) sequencing of the PMR1 genes from DMI-sensitive and -resistant strains, and (iii) introduction of PMR1 under the control of a strong promoter or an intact inducible promoter into a PMR1-disrupted strain and into a DMI-sensitive strain. Our findings suggest that a PMR1-based toxicant efflux mechanism for DMI resistance is present in both the DMI-sensitive and the DMI-resistant strains, and it might play a role in determining the baseline resistance of this fungus. A slight difference in PMR1 expression is not considered to be the factor that determines the difference in DMI resistance between the sensitive strains and the resistant strains. 3afungicides 3afungicide resistance 3agene expression 3agenetic transformation 3astrains 3aPenicillium digitatum 0asterol demethylation inhibitors1 aNawata, O.1 aHasegawa, K.1 aNakaune, R.1 aLee, Y.

Thyme oil controlled the growth of G. citri-aurantii effectively. Arthroconidia germination and germ tube elongation in potato dextrose broth was greatly inhibited by thyme oil. At 600 μl l⁻¹, it inhibited the germination of about 94% of the arthroconidia and the germ tube length was only 4·32 ± 0·28 μm. Observations using light microscope, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope revealed ultrastructural modifications caused by thyme oil that included markedly shrivelled and crinkled hyphae and arthroconidia, plasma membrane disruption and mitochondrial disorganization. Thyme oil applied to 'Satsuma' mandarin oranges that had been artificially wounded and inoculated with G. citri-aurantii reduced sour rot from 78·1% among untreated control fruit to 14·1% after 5 days at 26°C. Thyme oil applied to intact fruits reduced the decay from 76% among untreated control fruit to 35% after 30 days at 20°C. Thyme oil treatment did not harm 'Satsuma' mandarin oranges when they were examined after treatment and storage at 20°C for 30 days. Thyme oil may provide an alternative means of controlling postharvest sour rot on citrus fruit. The use of such essential oil may constitute an important alternative to synthetic fungicides. They can be exploited in commercial production and applied under storage and greenhouse conditions. 3aGeotrichum 3aSatsuma 3aantifungal properties 3adisease control 3aessential oils 3afruits 3afungi 3afungicides 3agerm tube 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3alight microscopes 3amandarins 3aoils 3aplasma membrane 3ascanning electron microscopes 3athyme 3atransmission electron microscopes 0acitrus fruit 0aGalactomyces citri-aurantii 0aGeotrichum citri-aurantii 0asour rot 0athyme oil1 aWang, L.P.1 aLi, Y.C.1 aLi, H.Y.1 aYu, T.1 aZheng, X.D.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Nov., v. 107, no. 5 p.1450-1456dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04328.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02474naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011900168300001400287500002400301520144500325650002001770650001401790650001501804650001501819650001101834650001101845650001101856651001201867700001901879700002301898700001401921773009501935852000902030856008502039655001202124IND4426837820221120062943.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442683782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-009-9344-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbonnel, Vincent10aDynamics of dissolved and biogenic silica in the freshwater reaches of a macrotidal estuary (The Scheldt, Belgium)  ap. 49-72.  aIncludes references  aTemporal evolution of dissolved and biogenic silica concentrations along the Scheldt tidal river and in its tributaries was investigated during 1 year in 2003. In the tributaries, dissolved silica (DSi) concentrations remained high and biogenic silica (BSi) concentrations were low throughout the year. In the tidal river during summer, DSi was completely consumed and BSi concentrations increased. Overall, most of the BSi was associated with living diatoms during the productive period in the tidal river. Nevertheless, the detrital BSi was a significant fraction of the total BSi pool, of which less than 10% could be attributed to phytoliths. The tidal river was divided into two zones for budgeting purposes. The highest productivity was observed in the zone that received the highest water discharge, as higher riverine DSi input fluxes induced presumably a less restrictive DSi limitation, but the discharge pattern could not explain all by itself the variations in DSi consumption. Silica uptake and retention in the tidal river were important at the seasonal time-scale: from May to September, 48% of the riverine DSi was consumed and 65% of the produced BSi was deposited, leading to a silica (DSi + BSi) retention in the tidal river of 30%. However, when annual fluxes were considered, DSi uptake in the tidal river amounted to 14% of the DSi inputs and only 6% of the riverine silica (DSi + BSi) was retained in the tidal river. 3aBacillariophyta 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3aphytoliths 3arivers 3asilica 3asummer 3aBelgium1 aLionard, Marie1 aMuylaert, Koenraad1 aChou, Lei0 tBiogeochemistry.g2009 Dec., v. 96, no. 1-3 p.49-72dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9344-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02879naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245013600176300001600312500002400328520147200352650001501824650002001839650002901859650001701888650001501905650001301920650001301933650001001946650002601956650001601982650001601998650001102014650001202025650001402037650001702051650001602068650001302084650002502097650001502122651001002137700001802147700001402165700001502179773009702194852000902291856008502300655001202385IND4426836920221120053411.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442683692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-009-9348-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAitkenhead-Peterson, J.

The proportion of urban land use ranged from 6 to 100% in our 12 study watersheds which included nine watersheds without waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and three watersheds sampled downstream of a WWTP. Annual mean DOC concentrations ranged 20.4-52.5 mg L⁻¹. Annual mean DON concentrations ranged 0.6-1.9 mg L⁻¹. Only the rural watersheds without a WWTP had significantly lower DOC concentrations compared to those watersheds with a WWTP but all the streams except two had significantly reduced DON compared to those with a WWTP. Analysis of the nine watersheds without a WWTP indicated that 68% of the variability in mean annual DOC concentration was explained by urban open areas such as golf courses, sports fields and neighborhood parks under turf grass. There was no relationship between annual mean DON concentration and any land use. Urban open area also explained a significant amount of the variance in stream sodium and stream sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). Ninety-four percent of the variance in annual mean DOC concentration was explained by SAR. Irrigation of urban turf grass with domestic tap water high in sodium (>181 mg Na⁺ L⁻¹) may be inducing sodic soil conditions in watershed soils in this region resulting in elevated mean annual DOC concentrations in our streams. 3aadsorption 3aathletic fields 3adissolved organic carbon 3agolf courses 3airrigation 3aland use 3anitrogen 3aparks 3aquantitative analysis 3arural areas 3asodic soils 3asodium 3astreams 3atap water 3aturf grasses 3aurban areas 3avariance 3awastewater treatment 3awatersheds 3aTexas1 aSteele, M.

Zeaxanthin levels in blood plasma have been negatively correlated to the development of AMD (age-related macular degeneration) (). Under normal conditions, plants have a low content of zeaxanthin. The aim of this study was to increase the zeaxanthin content in green vegetables by post harvest treatments. Efficient conditions for activation of the endogenous enzyme system generating zeaxanthin was established and included incubation at low pH (2.5-5.5), with the membrane permeable acetic acid/acetate buffer at room temperature or above for 30min or more. Typically more than 20-fold increase in zeaxanthin content was obtained for spinach, corn salad, parsley, basil, lemon balm and peas. For spinach up to 4mg/100g fresh weight of leaves were obtained. In consequence less amount of vegetables would be needed in the diet to provide the same amount of zeaxanthin for the eye. 3aacetates 3abasil 3aOcimum basilicum 3aPetroselinum crispum 3aPisum sativum 3apeas 3aspinach 3araw vegetables 3aambient temperature 3aValerianella locusta 3azeaxanthin 3aparsley 3apostharvest treatment 3aMelissa officinalis 3acorn 3alutein 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3amembrane permeability 3aacetic acid 3asalads 3abuffers 3aSpinacia oleracea 3apH 3aplant-based foods 0alemon balm 0acarotenoids 0agreen leafy vegetables 0avegetables1 aHuang, Siyu1 aEmek, Sinan C.1 aSjöholm, Ingegerd1 aÅkerlund, Hans-Erik0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 May, v. 98, no. 2 p.192-197dElsevier Science Pub.

With increasing particle density C concentration decreased, implying that the soil organic matter (OM) accumulations were thinner. With thinner accumulations we saw evidence for both an increase in ¹⁴C-based mean residence time (MRT) of the OM and a shift from plant to microbial origin.Evidence for the latter included: (1) a decrease in C/N, (2) a decrease in lignin phenols and an increase in their oxidation state, and (3) an increase in δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N. Although bulk-soil OM levels varied substantially across the four soils, trends in OM composition and MRT across the density fractions were similar. In the intermediate density fractions (~1.8-2.6 g cm⁻³), most of the reactive sites available for interaction with organic molecules were provided by aluminosilicate clays, and OM characteristics were consistent with a layered mode of OM accumulation. With increasing density (lower OM loading) within this range, OM showed evidence of an increasingly microbial origin. We hypothesize that this microbially derived OM was young at the time of attachment to the mineral surfaces but that it persisted due to both binding with mineral surfaces and protection beneath layers of younger, less microbially processed C. As a result of these processes, the OM increased in MRT, oxidation state, and degree of microbial processing in the sequentially denser intermediate fractions. Thus mineral surface chemistry is assumed to play little role in determining OM composition in these intermediate fractions. As the separation density was increased beyond ~2.6 g cm⁻³, mineralogy shifted markedly: aluminosilicate clays gave way first to light primary minerals including quartz, then at even higher densities to various Fe-bearing primary minerals. Correspondingly, we observed a marked drop in δ¹⁵N, a weaker decrease in extent of microbial processing of lignin phenols, and some evidence of a rise in C/N ratio. At the same time, however, ¹⁴C-based MRT time continued its increase. The increase in MRT, despite decreases in degree of microbial alteration, suggests that mineral surface composition (especially Fe concentration) plays a strong role in determining OM composition across these two densest fractions. 3afractionation 3aphenols 3asoil organic matter 3airon 3aquartz 3asoil 3aactive sites 3aoxidation 3alignin 0aorganic matter1 aKramer, Marc G.1 aSwanston, Christopher1 aLajtha, Kate1 aFilley, Timothy1 aAufdenkampe, Anthony K.1 aWagai, Rota1 aBowden, Richard D.0 tBiogeochemistry.g2009 Dec., v. 96, no. 1-3 p.209-231dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9359-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03093naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010900180300001600289500002400305520101800329650002101347650001801368650001301386650001101399650002001410650002001430650001301450650002001463650000901483650001401492650000901506650001401515650001101529650001101540650001301551650000901564650001201573650001201585650002801597650002801625650002701653650002501680650002501705650005601730650002001786650001101806650001701817650002001834650003701854650003801891650002301929650003701952650003201989650000902021650001602030650002402046650002702070650002302097700001502120700001502135700001702150773011002167852000902277856008502286655001202371IND4426833220221120025802.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442683322DNAL7 a192833422pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-009-8352-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Yingtao10aComparison of Hypoglycemic Activity of Trace Elements Absorbed in Fermented Mushroom of Coprinus comatus  ap. 177-185.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of fermented mushroom of Coprinus comatus rich in trace elements, including vanadium, chromium, zinc, magnesium, copper, iron, and nickel, on glycemic metabolism was studied in this paper. Alloxan-induced hyperglycemic mice were used in the study. The blood glucose, glycohemoglobin, and glycogen synthesis of the mice were analyzed, respectively. At the same time, the gluconeogenesis of the normal mice was also determined. After the mice were administered (ig) with C. comatus rich in vanadium (CCRV), the blood glucose and the glycohemoglobin of alloxan-induced hyperglycemic mice decreased (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), glycogen synthesis of alloxan-induced hyperglycemic mice elevated (p < 0.01), the gluconeogenesis of the normal mice was inhibited (p < 0.01), and the sugar tolerance of the normal mice was improved. However, the same result did not occur in other groups. Vanadium at lower doses in combination with C. comatus induced significant effect on glycemic metabolism in mice. 3aCoprinus comatus 3ablood glucose 3achromium 3acopper 3agluconeogenesis 3aglycemic effect 3aglycogen 3aglycohemoglobin 3airon 3amagnesium 3amice 3amushrooms 3anickel 3asugars 3avanadium 3azinc 2aAlloxan 2aAnimals 2aBlood Chemical Analysis 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aChromiumxpharmacology 2aCopperxpharmacology 2aCoprinusxmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxchemically induced 2aDown-Regulation 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aGluconeogenesis 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxpharmacology 2aIronxpharmacology 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMetals, Heavyxpharmacology 2aMice 2aMice, Obese 2aReference Standards 2aVanadiumxpharmacology 2aZincxpharmacology1 aHan, Linna1 aYuan, Chao1 aGuo, Jianyou0 tBiological trace element research.g2009 Nov., v. 131, no. 2 p.177-185dHumana Press Incx0163-49847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-009-8352-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02567naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245013600185300001600321500002400337520099400361650002701355650001301382650001901395650000901414650002301423650001301446650001201459650006401471650002901535650001601564650002801580650003701608650002501645650002001670700001301690700001701703700001401720700001501734700002101749700002301770700002301793700002201816700001901838773011001857852000901967856008501976655001202061IND4426833420221120025746.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442683342DNAL7 a192943422pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-009-8358-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussel, Mohammad10aBiological and Microcalorimetric Studies of the Toxic Effect of Organoarsenic(V) Compounds to Wild Strain of Bacillus thuringiensis  ap. 192-203.  aIncludes references  aMicrocalorimetric and biological methods were carried out to determine the toxicity of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) to wild strain of Bacillus thuringiensis. Thermokinetic parameters were obtained from the power-time curves, showing that the peak-heat output power, total heat output, and number of colonies decreased with the increases in concentration of DMA and MMA. In addition, the generation time and peak maximal time increased with the increases in the dosage of DMA and MMA. The half inhibitory concentrations of DMA and MMA were 99.02 and 142.02 μg mL⁻¹, respectively for the wild strain of B. thuringiensis. DMA shows higher toxicity to bacteria than MMA. The toxicity resistance of B. thuringiensis against organoarsenic(V) is quite high for the wild strain. Our work demonstrates that microcalorimetry is a very sensitive, simple, and useful technique for in vitro investigation of the toxic effect of organoarsenic(V) on microbial activity. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3abacteria 3acacodylic acid 3aheat 3amicrobial activity 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aBacillus thuringiensisxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aCacodylic Acidxtoxicity 2aCalorimetry 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 2aHot Temperature1 aYao, Jun1 aChen, Huilun1 aWang, Fei1 aZhou, Yong1 aZhuang, Rensheng1 aChoi, Martin M.

This phenomenon could be particularly prevalent in the Acari due to the often intimate interaction these species have with their hosts. In this review, we explore the process of host race formation, whether it is likely to occur in this group and what features may favour its evolution. Although few studies are currently available and tend to be biased toward two model species, results suggest that host races are indeed common in this group, and more likely to occur when hosts are long-lived. We discuss future directions for research on host-associated adaptations in this group of organisms and the potential relevance of host race formation for the biodiversity of mites and ticks. 3aAcari 3aacarology 3abiodiversity 3aevolution 3ahosts 3amites 3araces 3aticks 2aAcarixgenetics 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aGenetic Speciation 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxgenetics 0aHost race formation 0aSpecialization 0aMolecular markers 0aExperimental evolution 0aLocal adaptation1 aForbes, Mark R. 1 aSkoracka, Anna 1 aOsakabe, Masahiro 1 aChevillon, Christine 1 aMcCoy, Karen D. 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2007 Aug., v. 42, no. 4 p.225-238dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-007-9091-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02466naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100001600195245011800211300001400329500001500343520087000358650002601228650001601254650001501270650002201285650001401307650001301321650003001334650001501364650001501379650001601394650002501410650002601435650002101461650002301482650001201505651001401517651001801531653002201549653002301571653001001594700002701604773009301631852000901724856007501733930003301808945002501841946001101866990002301877655001201900IND4404429820221117155845.0080414s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440442982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A field experiment was conducted in the Rolling Pampas, Argentina area under a no-tillage system to establish the competition relationship between large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.) and glyphosate-resistant soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Hyperbolic and exponential models were compared to model the effect of large crabgrass density and biomass on soybean yield. The hyperbolic model represented these relationships better than the exponential model. Weed-biomass models showed a better prediction than weed-density models. Results showed that approximately 50% of soybean yield loss was reached with 4±1 plants m-2 or with 256.20±34.45 g dry matter m-2 of Digitaria sanguinalis. 3aDigitaria sanguinalis 3aGlycine max 3ano-tillage 3atransgenic plants 3aequations 3asoybeans 3aherbicide-resistant weeds 3acrop yield 3aglyphosate 3agrass weeds 3aherbicide resistance 3acrop-weed competition 3anonlinear models 3astatistical models 3adensity 3aArgentina 3aPampas region 0ahyperbolic models 0aexponential models 0aweeds1 aGonzalez-Andujar, J.L.0 tCommunications in biometry and crop science.g2007, v. 2, no. 2 p.62-67x1896-07827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://agrobiol.sggw.waw.pl/cbcs/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080708b20080801c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/07/08  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02618naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245006900146300001400215500001500229520133800244650002301582650002801605650001301633650001901646650002201665650001401687650002801701650001201729650001601741650002101757650003801778650001101816650002201827650000901849650001401858650002301872653001001895653002501905653001601930700001701946700001701963700001801980773007101998852000902069939003302078946001302111655001202124IND9302350020221117155829.0930419e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930235002DNAL7 a84408892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDominguez, A.10aChromosomal analysis of D. melanogaster long-term selected lines  ap. 63-66.  a2019-12-04  aCrosses and chromosomal substitutions among five selected lines of Drosophila melanogaster were carried out. These lines came from the same natural population after long-term selection for increasing dorsocentral bristle number. Two of them (Ac-27S and Ac-27P) show a bristle number around 16, and the other three (S-27S, S-27P, and N-21) present very extreme phenotypes, between 35 and 40 bristles. Selected genes were located on the three major chromosomes. Recessivity and synergistic interactions among the selected chromosomes account for the existence of hidden genetic variability, which can be released by selection, for a trait that scarcely shows phenotypic variability in populations. Genes responsible for selection response in lines Ac-27S and Ac-27P are present in all the selected lines, while lines S-27S, S-27P, and N-21 have accumulated additional increasing alleles common to the three of them. Long-term response and the extreme phenotypes achieved by these three lines point to variation that arose de novo during the selection process. However, this idea disagrees with the low genetic variability found between them. All these facts are consistent with the idea that variability originated in the course of selection by a low-probability nonrandom mechanism such as the occurrence of rare recombination events. 3aselection response 3achromosome substitution 3acrossing 3asetae (animal) 3agenetic variation 3asynergism 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAnimals 2aChromosomes 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aMale 2aPhenotype 2aSelection, Genetic 0alines 0aphenotypic selection 0arecessivity1 aAlbornoz, J.1 aSantiago, E.1 aGutierrez, A.0 tJournal of heredity.g1993 , v. 84, no. 1 p.63-66x0022-15037nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02116naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005800128300001800186500001500204520112000219650002801339650003101367650001201398650001201410650001101422650002301433650001701456650002801473650001301501650002001514650002101534653002401555653001801579773009201597852000901689939003301698946001101731655001201742IND9302343620221122235841.0930420e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930234362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastrillo, M.10aSucrose metabolism in bean plants under water deficit  ap. 1557-1561.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of water stress on sucrose metabolism were evaluated in bean plants of Tacarigua variety grown for 25 d. Decreasing water potential and relative water content were observed. Water stress effects resulted in a decrease of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) in both total (substrate saturating conditions) and Pi-insensitive (substrate limiting conditions plus inorganic phosphate) activities. The SPS Pi-insensitive activity was lower than the total SPS activity, but the decrease in activity induced by water deficit was relatively lower in the Pi-insensitive; however the activation state increased during the water deficit period. An increase in sucrose synthase activity increased the activities of both neutral and acid invertases at moderate water stress (-0.8 MPa) and decreased activities at severe water stress (-1.45 MPa). The activity values of neutral invertase were lower than those for the acid invertase. The starch/sucrose ratio decreased and the ratio of total glucose/total fructose increased. These results indicate a relevant physiological role of SPS in bean plants under water stress. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3aglucose 3asucrose 3astarch 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3awater stress 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3afructose 3aenzyme activity 3asucrose synthase 0ahexosyltransferases 0awater deficit0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1992 Dec., v. 43, no. 257 p.1557-1561x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02069naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008100128300001800209500001500227520112500242650001101367650001101378650002201389650001501411650001501426650002101441650000801462653001801470653002601488653001401514653001801528700001601546773009201562852000901654939003301663946001101696655001201707IND9302343920221122235957.0930420e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930234392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutschera, U.10aTurgor and longitudinal tissue pressure in hypocotyls of Helianthus annuus L  ap. 1577-1581.  a2019-12-04  aThe quantitative relationship between turgor and the pressure exerted by the inner tissues (cortex, vascular tissue, and pith) on the peripheral cell walls (longitudinal tissue pressure) was investigated in hypocotyls of sunflower seedlings (Helianthus annuus L.). In etiolated hypocotyls cell turgor pressures, as measured with the pressure probe, were in the range 0.38 to 0.55 MPa with an average of 0.48 MPa. In irradiated hypocotyls turgor pressures varied from 0.40 to 0.57 MPa with a mean at 0.49 MPa. The pressure exerted by, the inner tissues on the outer walls was estimated by incubating peeled sections in a series of osmotic test solutions (polyethylene glycol 8000). The length change was measured with a transducer. In both etiolated and irradiated hypocotyls an external osmotic pressure of 0.5 MPa was required to inhibit elongation of the inner tissues, i.e. the average cell turgor and the longitudinal tissue pressure are very similar quantities. The results indicate that the turgor of the inner tissues is displaced to and borne by the thick, growth-limiting peripheral cell walls of the hypocotyl. 3acortex 3aturgor 3aHelianthus annuus 3ahypocotyls 3acell walls 3aosmotic pressure 3asap 0aplant tissues 0aperipheral cell walls 0aepidermis 0ainner tissues1 aKöhler, K.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1992 Dec., v. 43, no. 257 p.1577-1581x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03067naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017100126300001800297500001500315520164300330650002001973650002301993650002902016650001802045650001102063650002702074650001802101650000902119650002002128650001902148650002502167650001602192650001802208650001902226653001202245653002502257653002102282653002502303700002202328700001802350700001402368700001702382700001402399700001402413773007902427852000902506939003302515946001302548655001202561IND9302345020221122235908.0930419e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930234502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassiri, M.10aImmunologigal responses of mice and cattle to baculovirus- expressed F and H proteins of rinderpest virus: lack of protection in the presence of neutralizing antibody  ap. 1255-1261.  a2019-12-04  aRinderpest is a highly contagious viral disease of ruminants and has greater than 95% morbidity and mortality. The etiological agent, rinderpest virus (RPV), is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae and the genus Morbillivirus. Immune responses to both the hemagglutinin (H) and the fusion (F) antigens of morbilliviruses play an important role in the prevention of infection, and only attenuated live vaccines have been shown to provide protective immunity against the group. The lack of protection with inactivated vaccines has been attributed to the denaturation of the F glycoprotein of the virus. Our previous study, however, demonstrated complete protection of cattle vaccinated with infectious vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the H (vRVH) or F (vRVF) protein alone, even in the presence of only 4 U of serum-neutralizing (SN) antibody to RPV (T. Yilma, D. Hsu, L. Jones, S. Owens, M. Grubman, C. Mebus, M. Yamanaka, and B. Dale, Science 242:1058-1061, 1988). We have constructed recombinant baculoviruses that express the F (F(b)) and H (H(b)) glycoproteins of RPV. Furthermore, we have analyzed the immune responses of mice and cattle to these antigens. Cattle vaccinated with F(b) or H(b) or a mixture of both antigens were not protected from challenge inoculation with RPV, even when the SN titer was greater than in cattle vaccinated with vRVF alone. This lack of protection, in the presence of SN antibody, would indicate that live attenuated and recombinant vaccines induce immune responses necessary for protection (e.g., cell-mediated immunity) that are not generated by subunit or inactivated whole-virus vaccines. 3arecombinant DNA 3aantibody formation 3aRinderpest morbillivirus 3aBaculoviridae 3acattle 3acell-mediated immunity 3alive vaccines 3amice 3agene expression 3aviral proteins 3arecombinant vaccines 3avaccination 3aglycoproteins 3aviral antigens 0avectors 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0aRinderpest virus 0avirus neutralization1 aS.

In a greenhouse experiment, radish (Raphanus sativus L.) cv. 'Cherry Belle' plants were treated with EDU as a soil drench (150 mg l-1, 60 ml plant-1) at three stages of development: early, maximum and late hypocotyl thickening. Two days later the plants were exposed to O3, mimicking an ambient pattern (70 nl l-1 O3, 7 h d-1, 5 d, and up to 120 nl l-1 O3 on 2 d), or remained in filtered air. Assessment of leaf injury showed complete protection from ozone-induced leaf damage at all stages of growth due to EDU. EDU did cause slight leaf margin necrosis and hyponastic leaf deformation irrespective of the atmospheric treatment, but biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) of the shoot and leaf number duration were not altered and leaf area duration was increased when compared to control plants. EDU did not affect dry weight accumulation nor RGR of the hypocotyl. Ozone-induced reductions in growth of below-ground organs (hypocotyl and root), which were most prominent in the intermediate and early stage of growth, were largely suppressed by the EDU-treatment. Decreases of hypocotyl biomass due to O3 were transient and significant increases in RGR of the hypocotyl during the post-exposure period indicated a substantial capability of compensation during the period of recovery. 3aRaphanus sativus 3aozone 3aair pollution 3aethylene diurea 3aplant protection 3aphytotoxicity 3aseedling growth 3aleaves 3anecrosis 3aroots 3ahypocotyls 3adry matter accumulation 0agrowth rate 0aseedling stage1 aManning, W.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1992 Dec., v. 43, no. 257 p.1621-1631x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02879naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245012900165300001600294500001500310520132400325650001101649650001901660650002501679650000801704650002701712650001201739650005801751650001801809650002301827650001401850650001301864650002501877650001401902650002801916650003001944650001001974650002701984650003802011650004902049650004402098653002002142653002102162700001702183700001702200773007702217852000902294939003302303946001302336655001202349IND9302347720221122182024.0930419e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930234772DNAL7 a83800702pmid7 aPMC2373502pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAronoff, R.10aAvian retroviral RNA encapsidation: reexamination of functional 5' RNA sequences and the role of nucleocapsid Cys-His motifs  ap. 178-188.  a2019-12-04  aRNA packaging signals (psi) from the 5' ends of murine and avian retroviral genomes have previously been shown to direct encapsidation of heterologous mRNA into the retroviral virion. The avian 5' packaging region has now been further characterized, and we have defined a 270-nucleotide sequence, A psi, which is sufficient to direct packaging of heterologous RNA. Identification of the A psi sequence suggests that several retroviral cis-acting sequences contained in psi+ (the primer binding site, the putative dimer linkage sequence, and the splice donor site) are dispensable for specific RNA encapsidation. Subgenomic env mRNA is not efficiently encapsidated into particles, even though the A psi sequence is present in this RNA. In contrast, spliced heterologous psi-containing RNA is packaged into virions as efficiently as unspliced species; thus splicing per se is not responsible for the failure of env mRNA to be encapsidated. We also found that an avian retroviral mutant deleted for both nucleocapsid Cys-His boxes retains the capacity to encapsidate RNA containing psi sequences, although this RNA is unstable and is thus difficult to detect in mature particles. Electron microscopy reveals that virions produced by this mutant lack a condensed core, which may allow the RNA to be accessible to nucleases. 3avirion 3aviral proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aRNA 3alife cycle (organisms) 2aAnimals 2aAvian Leukosis Virusxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBase Sequence 2aCapsidxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aCysteine 2aGenes, gagxgenetics 2aHistidine 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aQuail 2aRNA Splicingxgenetics 2aRNA, Viralxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aVirionxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0aavian oncovirus 0aviral morphology1 aHajjar, A.M.1 aLinial, M.L.0 tJournal of virology.g1993 Jan., v. 67, no. 1 p.178-188x0022-538X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03221naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245009800166300001600264520148400280650002901764650002701793650002101820650002201841650002601863650002101889650001501910650005301925650010101978650007402079650003902153650003302192650003802225650003202263650003002295650003602325650001302361650002702374650001902401650003502420650004102455653001402496653002402510653001802534700001602552773007002568852000902638939003302647946001102680655001202691IND9302347120221122152026.0930419e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930234712DNAL7 a84402562pmid7 aPMC4132502pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayinger, P.13aAn ATP transporter is required for protein translocation into the yeast endoplasmic reticulum  ap. 659-666.  aThe transfer of precursor proteins through the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in yeast is strictly dependent on the presence of ATP. Since Kar2p (the yeast homologue of mammalian BiP) is required for translocation, and is an ATP binding protein, an ATP transport system must be coupled to the translocation machinery of the ER. We report here the characterization of a transport system for ATP in vesicles derived from yeast ER. ATP uptake into vesicles was found to be saturable in the micromolar range with a Km of 1 X 10(-5) M. ATP transport into ER vesicles was specifically inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), a stilbene derivative known to inhibit a number of other anion transporters, and by 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (Bz2-ATP). Inhibition of ATP uptake into yeast microsomes by DIDS and Bz2-ATP blocked protein translocation in vitro measured co- as well as post-translationally. The inhibitory effect of DIDS on translocation was prevented by coincubation with ATP. Moreover, selective membrane permeabilization, allowing ATP access to the lumen, restored translocation activity to DIDS-treated membranes. These results demonstrate that translocation requires a DIDS and Bz2-ATP-sensitive component whose function is to transport ATP to the lumen of the ER. These findings are consistent with current models of protein translocation in yeast which stipulate the participation of Kar2p in the translocation process. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aactive transport 3aprotein transport 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3abinding proteins 3amicrosomes 2a4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid 2a4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transportxdrug effects 2aCarrier Proteinsxmetabolism 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMicrosomesxmetabolism 2aPhotochemistry 2aProtein Precursorsxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 0amembranes 0aatp binding protein 0akar2p protein1 aMeyer, D.I.0 tEMBO journal.g1993 Feb., v. 12, no. 2 p.659-666x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02974naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010700127300001400234520205000248650001702298650002702315650001402342650002002356650001502376650002502391650002902416650002402445700001702469773009402486852000902580930003302589945001302622946001302635655001202648IND2324884120221122152014.0020116e200109  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232488412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValles, S.M.12aA microsomal esterase involved in cypermethrin resistance in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica  ap. 56-67.  aAdult male German cockroaches of the Marietta strain exhibited 5-fold resistance to cypermethrin compared with the insecticide-susceptible Orlando strain. The cypermethrin resistance level decreased to 2.9-fold when cockroaches were pretreated with S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate, indicating that esterase played a role in the resistance. Cypermethrin was metabolized faster by microsomal esterase from the Marietta strain (15.4 +/- 1.1 pmol/h/mg) than by those from the Orlando strain (12.5 +/- 0.2 pmol/h/mg). Partial purification of microsomal esterase from the Marietta and Orlando strains was accomplished by anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and native-PAGE. HIC partitioned the single anion exchange peak of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity into three fractions, HIC I, HIC II, and HIC III. All three HIC fractions metabolized cypermethrin significantly faster than microsomes. Native-PAGE analysis of each of these fractions revealed a unique band in Marietta HIC II and III which was referred to as microsomal esterase Marietta (MEmar). MEmar was isolated by native-PAGE and found to hydrolyze alpha-naphthyl acetate at a rate of 25.5 micromol/min/mg protein, representing a purification of 54-fold over that of microsomes. Furthermore, Marietta strain HIC II and III fractions (which contained MEmar) metabolized cypermethrin significantly faster than the corresponding fractions from the Orlando strain. MEmar metabolized cypermethrin at 3461 pmol/min/mg protein, representing a 225-fold increase over that of microsomes. MEmar was found to exhibit a molecular weight of 57 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 64 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, indicating that the esterase was a monomer. Also, the MEmar isozyme was inhibited by paraoxon and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that the esterase was a "B"-type serine esterase. Finally, none of the isozymes in the HIC III fraction, including the MEmar isozyme, bound to concanavalin A, indicating that the HIC III isozymes were not glycosylated. 3acypermethrin 3ainsecticide resistance 3aesterases 3aenzyme activity 3amicrosomes 3apesticide synergists 3ametabolic detoxification 3aBlattella germanica1 aStrong, C.A.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2001 Sept., v. 71, no. 1 p.56-67x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02927naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009800126300001400224520190000238650001602138650003802154650002902192650001502221650002502236650002202261650001602283650002002299650003302319700001502352700001802367700001802385773009402403852000902497930003302506945001302539946001302552655001202565IND2324884020221122151939.0020116e200109  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232488402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPline, W.A.10aAntibacterial activity of the herbicide glufosinate on Pseudomonas syringae pathovar glycinea  ap. 48-55.  aThe antibacterial activity of the herbicide glufosinate on Pseudomonas syringae pathovar (pv.) glycinea (L-529), causal agent of soybean blight, was examined in culture and in planta. Bacteria were grown in medium containing either formulated or technical-grade glufosinate from 0.01 to 100 mM, and growth was monitored by turbidity measurements over time. Glufosinate inhibited bacterial growth at concentrations of 1 mM or greater and delayed growth at concentrations as low as 0.01 mM. Metabolism of [14C]glufosinate by P. syringae pv. glycinea grown in Davis minimal medium containing either a sublethal (1 mM) or a lethal (100 mM) glufosinate concentration was measured incrementally up to 45 h after inoculation. Thin-layer chromatography analysis revealed the presence of three glufosinate metabolites in addition to the parent compound. The rate of [14C]glufosinate metabolism by bacteria was greater in medium treated with 1 mM than in medium treated with 100 mM glufosinate. More 14C was recovered as 3-methylphosphinico-propionic acid and as an unidentified metabolite with an Rf value of 0.45 in medium treated with 1 mM than in medium treated with 100 mM glufosinate. These data suggest that P. syringae pv. glycinea can slowly metabolize glufosinate into less toxic metabolites, resulting in greater bacterial growth in medium treated with 1 mM glufosinate. Treatment of transgenic glufosinate-resistant (GR) soybeans with field rates of glufosinate reduced the number of live P. syringae pv. glycinea at 90 h after inoculation. Inoculated GR soybeans showed a 45% reduction of colony forming units after treatment with 0.5 kg/ha glufosinate and a 60% reduction after treatment with 1.0 kg/ha glufosinate. These results show that glufosinate exhibits some antibacterial activity against P. syringae pv. glycinea, but at concentrations greater than those of registered bactericides. 3aglufosinate 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea 3aantibacterial properties 3ametabolism 3aherbicide resistance 3atransgenic plants 3aGlycine max 3adisease control 3aplant diseases and disorders1 aLacy, G.H.1 aStromberg, V.1 aHatzios, K.K.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2001 Sept., v. 71, no. 1 p.48-55x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01974naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012900126300001600255500001500271520089100286650001701177650001801194650000901212650001801221650001301239650002301252650002901275650001201304650001701316653001501333653002001348653001901368653001701387700002001404773009101424852000901515939003301524945000801557946001101565655001201576IND9302349020221122152013.0930419e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930234902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQureshi, N.10aEthanol production from sulphuric acid wood hydrolysate of Pinus radiata using free and immobilized cells of Pichia stipitis  ap. 117-122.  a2019-12-04  aEthanol was produced by a strain of Pichia stipitis adapted to an inhibitory acid wood hydrolysate of Pinus radiata. The best ethanol productivity for batch cultures was 0.21 g/1 h at 0.7% ethanol. Varying culture conditions increased ethanol concentration to 0.76% however the productivity decreased to 0.18 g/l h. A decrease in ethanol concentration in the culture fluid was noted late in the batch which suggested ethanol catabolism. Values of kinetic parameters (Km, Ks, micromax, and Vmax) were evaluated for this system. The use of calcium alginate immobilized cells in a continuous-flow stirred tank reactor lead to enhanced fermentative performance, namely a maximum productivity of 0.27 g/lh and 1.13% ethanol yield. The immobilized cells in continuous flow reactors represent an attractive option for fermenting sugars released by sulphuric acid hydrolysis of P. radiata wood. 3afermentation 3aPinus radiata 3awood 3asulfuric acid 3akinetics 3aethanol production 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3aethanol 3ahydrolysates 0ametabolism 0aPichia stipitis 0aimmobilization 0aproductivity1 aManderson, G.J.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology.g1991 Mar., v. 7, no. 2 p.117-122x0169-41467nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aENE  aNon-US 7aarticle02007naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245011300168300001600281520049400297650000900791650003400800650001300834650001600847650002300863650001200886650002900898650000900927650007400936650007301010650003701083650001601120650004301136650004001179700001701219700001801236700001101254700001401265700002101279700001601300700001801316700001701334700001801351773007701369852000901446939003301455946001301488655001201501IND9302348620221122114017.0930420e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930234862DNAL7 a83800952pmid7 aPMC2374032pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, J.K.10aExperimental vaccine protection against homologous and heterologous strains of feline immunodeficiency virus  ap. 601-605.  aMore than 90% of cats immunized with inactivated whole infected-cell or cell-free feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vaccines were protected against intraperitoneal infection with 10 50% animal infectious doses of either homologous FIV Petaluma (28 of 30 cats) or heterologous FIV Dixon strain (27 of 28 cats).

Thirty-four dogs with AD from 17 animal hospitals in Japan were administered half or one-fifth of the approved rCaIFN-γ dose of 10 000 units/kg, three times a week for 4 weeks, followed by once weekly for an additional 4 weeks. Pruritus, excoriation, erythema and alopecia were evaluated and scored by the investigators on weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12. The efficacy rate (number of excellent cases + number of good cases/total number of cases) at week 8 in the 2000 units/kg group was 36.4% for pruritus, 36.4% for excoriation, 45.5% for erythema and 36.4% for alopecia. In contrast, in the 5000 units/kg group, the efficacy rate was 64.3% for pruritus, 57.1% for excoriation, 78.6% for erythema and 78.6% for alopecia. The efficacy rate of the 5000 units/kg group was high for all signs evaluated and comparable to that of the 10 000 units/kg group reported in a previous study. The results of this study showed that 2000 units/kg of rCaIFN-γ is less effective than 5000 units/kg to treat dogs with AD, and the efficacy of the 5000 units/kg dose is comparable to that of 10 000 units/kg at week 8. 3adose response 3adog diseases 3arecombinant proteins 3adogs 3adosage 3acytokines 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3afood allergies 3aatopic dermatitis 3aadverse effects 3ainterferons 0arandomized comparative trial 0atherapeutics 0arecombinant canine interferon-gamma1 aSaito, Shiori1 aKubo, Takuya1 aShibasaki, Yuya1 aYamaoka, Kayo1 aHachimura, Hisae1 aKuyama, Tomoko1 aAmimoto, Akiteru1 aKumata, Tsuyoshi1 aKitahara, Yuko1 aTakenaka, Masahiko1 aMatsumura, Hitoshi1 aUno, Takehiro1 aUchino, Tomiya1 aTakehara, Kazutaka1 aNishida, Kouji1 aKadoya, Michiyo1 aSato, Masafumi1 aKato, Kaoru1 aMatsumoto, Kanako1 aSaitō, Satoshi.1 aShimoda, Tetsuya0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2010 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.42-49dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2009.00764.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/04/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03591naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198100001400207245008200221300001400303500002400317500001500341520172500356650001302081650002502094650002002119650001002139650002102149650001402170650002202184650001902206650002102225650002402246650002502270650002202295650001202317650002602329650001102355650003202366650000902398650004002407653002102447653002802468653002602496653002102522653002002543653001402563700001602577700002202593700001402615700001502629773011502644852000902759856009202768930003302860945002502893946001102918655001202929IND4432592820221122052136.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443259282DNAL7 a203777372pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2915.2009.00849.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL210 0aL001 0aL3001 aSHUTT, B.10aMale accessory gland proteins induce female monogamy in anopheline mosquitoes  ap. 91-94.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe role of male accessory gland (MAG) secretions in inducing refractoriness to further mating in mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) was established in the late 1960s. In a set of simple experiments, MAG extract was injected intra-thoraxically into the hemocoel of virgin Aedes aegypti (L.), Culex pipiens pipiens (L.) and Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say females. This subsequently caused most females to remain unmated when exposed to males. For anophelines these findings were later challenged by a study involving intra-abdominal injections of MAG extracts into Anopheles gambiae Giles s.l. and Anopheles albimanus Wiedmann females, which failed to induce refractoriness to further mating. These findings led to controversy about the respective role of sperm and accessory gland peptides in inducing female monogamy in Anopheles and are at odds with our current understanding of the mating process in Drosophila spp. (Diptera: Drosophillidae) and other dipterans. Here we confirm the function of MAG secretions in anophelines experimentally by showing that intra-thoracic injections in Anopheles stephensi Liston and in the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. result in the expected female monogamy. Cross-injections of MAG extracts between the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae, two cryptic taxa within An. gambiae s.s. which are thought to be undergoing incipient speciation, also elicited effective refractoriness, suggesting that the two sub-taxa have not diverged with regard to sex peptides responsible for female monogamy. Importantly, this also suggests that the rare cases of re-mating following cross-mating observed in this species may not be a form of reproductive barrier between molecular forms. 3amonogamy 3aaccessory sex glands 3ainsect proteins 3amales 3asexual selection 3ainjection 3aAnopheles gambiae 3avirgin females 3amating frequency 3aAnopheles stephensi 3agenetic polymorphism 2aAedesxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxphysiology 2aFemale 2aInsect Hormonesxphysiology 2aMale 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 0aS molecular form 0aintrathoracic injection 0asexual refractoriness 0aM molecular form 0amating behavior 0amonoandry1 aSTABLES, L.1 aABOAGYE-ANTWI, F.1 aMORAN, J.1 aTRIPET, F.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2010 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.91-94dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2009.00849.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100308b20100403c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/03/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01872naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002800110245010400138520096600242650002601208650001401234650001101248650001201259650002001271650001501291650001301306650001001319700001901329773005601348852000901404856010101413939003301514946001101547655001201558IND4462234120221122041649.0111108s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446223412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrivastava, Atul Kumar10aModification and performance evaluation of tractor drawn improved till plant machine under vertisol  aA tractor drawn (TD) till plant machine was designed and developed with the help of computer aided design package for adoption of minimum till technology by the farmers, in black cotton soil conditions.

LGLs, generally considered to be analogous to natural killer (NK) cells, can also be highly cytolytic CD8/CD57 T cells. Neutropenia has been reported during acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection, but there is a paucity of information describing the pathogenesis of this condition. During HIV-1 infection, LGLs have been shown to be both CD16⁺ NK cells and CD8⁺/CD57⁺ T cells, but an association with neutropenia has not been described. However, neutropenia with concurrent LGL lymphocytosis has been demonstrated in both LGL leukemia and common variable immunodeficiency syndrome in people, and in both syndromes, an increase in soluble Fas ligand (FasL) has been associated with neutrophil apoptosis leading to neutropenia. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated increases in CD56 and CD8 peripheral blood cell surface expression during acute FIV-C-PG infection. Expression of FasL mRNA was increased at the same time points as these peripheral hematologic abnormalities, and also decreased as FIV-C-PG proviral load reached set point. We describe an interesting temporal association between innate immune responses and viral load during acute FIV-C-PG infection, which has similarities to HIV-1 infection and other immune dyscrasias of people, and which may contribute to the neutropenia and LGL lymphocytosis during FIV-C-PG infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atemporal variation 3alymphocytes 3aneutropenia 3aproviruses 3amessenger RNA 3acats 3aacute course 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3afeline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 2aAcute Disease 2aAnimals 2aCD56 Antigenximmunology. 2aCD8 Antigensximmunology. 2aCat Diseasesximmunologyxvirology. 2aCatsximmunologyxvirology. 2aFas Ligand Proteinxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aImmunodeficiency Virus, Felineximmunology 2aLentivirus Infectionsximmunologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aLymphocytesximmunology 2aLymphocytosisximmunologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aNeutropeniaximmunologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aProvirusesximmunology 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxgenetics. 2aViral Loadximmunologyxveterinary. 0alarge granular lymphocytosis, 0aproviral load 0aFas ligand1 aTerWee, J.A.1 aVandeWoude, S.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2010 Mar. 15, v. 134, no. 1-2 p.115-121dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01377naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007600131520057200207650002000779650002000799650001500819650001900834700001800853700001800871773005600889852000900945856010100954939003301055946001101088655001201099IND4462954220221121033408.0120323s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446295422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlunloyo, V.O.S.10aNeural network-based electronic nose for cocoa beans quality assessment  aIn this study, a prototype electronic nose was developed for monitoring the quality of cocoa beans.

Use of vegetable oils in conventional not adapted diesel engines leads to slightly inferior performance and higher smoke emissions due to their high viscosity. The performance of vegetable oils can be improved by modifying them through the transesterification process. In the present study, a comparison on the basis of the performance and emission characteristics of different blends of transesterified Hemp (B10 and B20)and Jatropha (B10 and B20) biodiesel was done on a 550 cm³ single cylinder four stroke water cooled diesel engine and the results were compared to that of diesel. Results indicated that in comparison to pure diesel and Jatropha, B20 blend of Hemp biodiesel provides better thermal efficiency, lower specific fuel consumption, reduced CO and CO2 emissions but a considerable increase was found in NOx emission and smoke density was decreased with increase in biodiesel concentration i.e. at 20%. 3aJatropha 3aalternative fuels 3abiodiesel 3acomparative study 3adiesel engines 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3ahemp 3asmoke 3atransesterification 3avegetables 3aviscosity1 aSoni, S.K.1 aKundu, K.0 tCIGR ejournal.g2011, v. 13, no. 3x1682-11307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/issue/view/453Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20121023  aNon-US 7aarticle02866naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007500125520180200200650001302002650001302015650000802028650001602036650001102052650001602063650001202079650000902091650001902100700001602119700001502135700001702150700001602167700001602183700001402199700001602213700001702229773005602246852000902302856010102311939003302412946001102445655001202456IND4462907620221121024523.0120313s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446290762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhot, L.R.10aAssessment of aerosol deposition and movement in open field conditions  aThe overall objective of this study was to evaluate the dispersion of aerosol plumes generated by a truck-mounted ultra low-volume (ULV) applicator and a hand-held thermal fogger under open field conditions. Experiments were also planned to determine the relative capture efficiencies of various sampling techniques in such applications. The ULV applicator was used at three travel speeds (8.5 km/h, 16.8 km/h, and 24.8 km/h) and the thermal fogger at two release heights (0.6 m and 1.1 m above ground) to investigate the effects of speed or release height on deposition at 6 m, 12 m, 24 m, and 48 m downwind. High volume air samplers (HVS), low volume air samplers (LVS), spinning cotton ribbon (CR) samplers, polypropylene green plastic cards (GC), acetate cards (AC), and water-sensitive papers (WSP) were used to collect deposits. The ULV applicator was tested with water and oil sprays while the thermal fogger was tested with the latter tracer only. Using water- and oil-based tracers, all deposition targets were analyzed by fluorometry. Results showed decreased tracer deposition with increase in sampling distance. Overall, travel speed affected deposition at the near sample locations only, but in most sample locations, normalized deposits were comparable at all speeds. Spray release height did not affect deposition of active samplers but had significant effect on deposition of passive samplers at 6 m location only. Overall, the higher release height resulted in more deposition in most downwind locations. There were good correlations between depositions on active and passive samplers. The HVS, CR, GC, and AC samplers were effective in sampling aerosol plume dispersion under open field conditions. The paper includes relationships among capture efficiencies of various samplers. 3aacetates 3aaerosols 3aair 3aapplicators 3acotton 3afluorometry 3afoggers 3aoils 3apolypropylenes1 aSalyani, M.1 aFarooq, M.1 aWalker, T.W.1 aSweeb, R.D.1 aLarbi, P.A.1 aSmith, V.1 aPomolis, R.1 aStoops, C.A.0 tCIGR ejournal.g2011, v. 13, no. 3x1682-11307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/issue/view/453Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120313  aNon-US 7aarticle03946naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011300128520291200241650001603153650001103169650003103180650001003211650002203221650001303243650002203256650001103278650002603289650001503315651001003330700001503340700001903355773005603374852000903430856010103439939003303540946001103573655001203584IND4462953420221121014645.0120323s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446295342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanga'u, S.N.10aEvaluation of the Performance of Smallholder Pumped Irrigation Systems, in Arid and Semi-arid Areas of Kenya  aA study was carried out to evaluate the performance of smallholder pumped irrigation systems with a view of comparing if the system operated within the designed optimal engineering standards. Different parameters studied were selection, design and operations of the irrigation systems with detailed analysis on energy uses for pumping (fuel use), efficiency of pumping devices as well as pump power required and energy losses (headlosses) during pumping. Semi structured questionnaires were administered to 80 smallholder farmers practicing pumped irrigated agriculture in Mitubiri location of Kakuzi division and Kithimani sub location of Yatta division, Kenya. An observational study was done to identify the irrigation methods used. Detailed study was done in 10 farms (5 in each study site) using pumped irrigated agriculture and water application through furrow irrigation system. 79% of the farmers assessed used small motorized pumps run by petrol and diesel fuel and ranging from 4.0-6.5 horsepower. Water was pumped from nearby rivers and conveyed to their farms using closed conduits, open channels or a combination of both. Furrow irrigation method was widely used by 94% of the farmers studied in the two study areas. 60% of the irrigation setups using PVC pipes in water conveyance had the allowable water discharge within the design optimal range. The frictional head loss in the PVC pipes used exceeded the design limit for 60% of the irrigation systems while 90% of the irrigation setups used fittings whose resultant frictional head losses were within the desired optimal range. Of the 10 pumps evaluated, 6 of them operated below the optimal design efficiency level while fuel consumption rate of each pump varied. The study of the amount of fuel used to run the different pumps used in the 10 farm setups varied from one farm to the other. In some farms, mean fuel amount used to irrigate 1 hectare of land was in excess of 60 L/ha while in other farm setups, fuel used was as low as 5 L/ha. The varied fuel amounts used could be attributed to varied factors in each farm such as topographic elevations, water conveyance distance and different make and model of pump. An assessment of fuel consumption rate for each of the 10 pumps at similar operational speed was also different. Pumps age did not affect its efficiency. A comparison of the calculated pump power required and the power rated on the pumps being used showed a big difference indicating that the farmers used pumps which had a higher power rating than required. The effect of using an oversized pump is high initial cost of purchasing the pump as well as high operation costs due to high fuel use. From the study, it was found that smallholder pumped irrigated agriculture despite showing tremendous increase in uptake faces numerous challenges ranging from components selection, design and use leading to poor performance. 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3afarms 3afurrow irrigation 3agasoline 3airrigated farming 3amodels 3aobservational studies 3atopography 3aKenya1 aHome, P.G.1 aGathenya, J.M.0 tCIGR ejournal.g2011, v. 13, no. 4x1682-11307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/issue/view/463Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120323  aNon-US 7aarticle01975naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011300166300001600279500002400295520098500319650001301304650002001317650000901337650001701346650001501363650001001378650001501388650001201403650002401415650001401439700002101453773009401474852000901568856004801577655001201625IND4409656320221121014711.0080830e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440965632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-007-0453-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFenner, Aaron L.14aThe impact of nematode parasites on the behaviour of an Australian lizard, the gidgee skink Egernia stokesii  ap. 897-903.  aIncludes references  aThe Australian scincid lizard Egernia stokesii lives in social groups and is infected with two nematode species: Pharyngodon tiliquae and Thelandros trachysauri. This study asked whether those nematodes affected levels of lizard activity in field populations. In a laboratory colony, application of a combination of ivermectin and fenbendazole reduced nematode egg count in lizard scats after 12 weeks. In the field, the same doses of those antihelminthic drugs were applied to lizards in six social groups across three populations, and a saline control was given to lizards in six adjacent groups. Observations showed significant changes in behaviour between the two groups developing over 2 months. Drug-treated lizards spent more time basking and moved about for longer times during observation sessions. The results suggest that nematode infection altered host behaviour and reduced fitness. No influence of social group size was detected on the impact of parasitic nematodes. 3aNematoda 3abehavior change 3aeggs 3afenbendazole 3agroup size 3ahosts 3aivermectin 3alizards 3anematode infections 3aparasites1 aBull, C.

Results indicated that all examined dioxaphospholenes had less inhibitory effects on mammalian AChE than fenitrothion, a commercial pesticide with moderate mammalian toxicity. The highest selectivity was obtained with compounds containing glutamic and leucine moieties (2.70 and 2.18, respectively) while selectivity of fenitrothion was 0.93. The low inhibitory effects of the examined dioxaphospholenes on mammalian AChE were attributed to their low phosphorylation rates (k(p) < 2.2 min-1) compared to that of fenitrothion (k(p) = 4.84 min-1). QSAR equations indicated that the inhibition process is controlled mainly by both the phosphorylation rate (direct effect) and the affinity of compounds toward the enzyme (inverse effect). Although the compounds hydrophobicity had no effects on the inhibition process, it affects the compounds toxicity since it affects the ability of compounds to penetrate insects to reach the enzyme active site. 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzyme kinetics 3ainsecticidal properties 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 0ainhibition kinetics 0a1,3,2-benzodioxaphospholenes1 aEldeen, H.A.S.1 aHikal, M.S.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2005 Sept., v. 83, no. 1 p.58-65x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a20060608b20060702c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/06/07  aOther US 7aarticle02838naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001600151245007100167300001600238500018600254500002400440520133000464650002201794650001101816650001701827650002201844650001301866650002001879650001201899650001101911650001801922650002501940650001001965650005201975650001302027650002002040650001202060650001802072650001602090700001702106700001702123773014002140852000902280856009102289655001202380IND4464227020221121014830.0121002s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446422702DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeguchi, M.10aIncrease in sorbitol biosynthesis in stressed Japanese pear leaves  ap. 511-517.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Asian Pears Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of "Nijisseiki" Pear, volume 2, held August 25-29, 2001, Kurayoshi, Tottori, Japan.  aIncludes references  aTo clarify the mechanism of stress response in leaf tissue of Japanese pear, sugar content, conversion from glucose to sorbitol, and S6PDH mRNA expression were investigated in leaf discs incubated under salt or low temperature stress. Sorbitol contents increased in the leaf discs under both stresses. The recovery of 14C in sorbitol also increased in the leaf discs incubated with 14C-glucose under both stresses. Glucose, fructose, and sucrose content also increased in the leaf discs although the recoveries of 14C in those sugars in the leaf discs did not change. The result suggests that Japanese pear leaves respond to salt and low temperature stress and dominantly synthesize sorbitol. Next, the PCR fragment of putative S6PDH cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR from Japanese pear leaves because sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (S6PDH) could be a key enzyme in sorbitol biosynthesis as described in apple. The nucleotide sequence was identical to 98% S6PDH cDNA from apple seedlings. Northern blot analysis suggested that S6PDH mRNA expression was source-specific and was induced by salt and low temperature stress. Collectively, sorbitol accumulation is induced by salt and low temperature stress, and the accumulation is probably due to an increase in sorbitol biosynthesis that is related to the expression of S6PDH gene. 3aNorthern blotting 3aapples 3abiosynthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3afructose 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3apears 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asorbitol 3astress response 3asucrose 3asugar content 3atemperature1 aWatanabe, M.1 aKanayama, Y.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Oct., , no. 587 p.511-517dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.663Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle00983naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245002800172300001200200500002400212500001500236520017900251650002700430650002300457651000900480653001700489700001600506773010700522852000900629856005500638655001200693IND4390497920221121014732.0070416e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439049792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8748.2007.00551.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgisu, Mikinori10a572. bergenia emeiensis  ap. 2-6.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBergenia emeiensis C.Y.

The effects of three organic modifiers, methanol, isopropanol, and acetonitrile, on the separations of enantiomers of these compounds were investigated. Separation of enantiomers could be achieved in relatively dilute solutions of the pure surfactant. However, best separations of enantiomers were obtained only in the presence of 10% v/v acetonitrile.

  1 aDuff, S.M.G.14aThe development of a medium throughout assay for lanosterol synthase from Leptosphaeria nodorum: Comparison of the enzyme from L. nodorum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and two species of Fusarium  ap. 97-106.  a2019-12-05  aLanosterol synthase (LS) was isolated from microsomes from the plant pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria nodorum (L. nodorum) and characterized with respect to its physical and kinetic properties. A medium throughput radiometric assay was developed for LS in order to screen potential inhibitors and to determine its kinetic properties. Quantification of LS activity relies on the separation of (+/-)2,3-oxidosqualene from lanosterol by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) followed by analysis in a flow scintillation counter. LS from L. nodorum has an apparent Km (oxidosqualene) of 43 micromolar and an apparent native molecular weight of 150 kDa as determined by size exclusion chromatography. L. nodorum LS was compared to LS from Fusarium culmorum (F. culmorum), Fusarium graminearum (F. graminearum), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) for kinetic properties and inhibitory activity of a known LS inhibitor (4-bromophenyl)[2-fluoro-4-[[6-(methyl-2-propenylamino)hexyl]oxy]phenyly]-methanone (compound 1) and a derivative of this inhibitor (compound 2). While the Km (oxidosqualene) was similar for LS from all four organisms, there were differences in the activity of the two inhibitors against LS from these species. The characteristics of the assay and its use for screening molecules to find fungal inhibitors are described. To compare the biological activity of the inhibitors with their activity against LS, they were tested to determine the extent to which they suppressed the growth of L. nodorum and F. culmorum. The results suggest that the fungicidal activity of these inhibitors is related to their inhibitory effect on LS. 3aParastagonospora nodorum 3aantifungal properties 3alanosterol 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aergosterol 0aLeptosphaeria nodorum 0aergosterol biosynthesis1 aDavila-Aponte, J.1 aThompson, R.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2005 , v. 83, no. 2-3 p.97-106x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a20060703b20060804c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/03  aOther US 7aarticle03618naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001500151245008500166300001600251500018600267500002400453520202000477650004702497650004102544650001702585650001102602650002202613650001202635650001302647650002402660650001002684650001102694650001002705650001302715650001602728650001302744700001702757700001502774700001102789700002002800700001702820700001502837700001702852700001502869773014002884852000903024856009103033655001203124IND4464226720221120222831.0121002s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446422672DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPech, J.C.10aRecent developments on the role of ethylene in the ripening of climacteric fruit  ap. 489-495.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Asian Pears Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of "Nijisseiki" Pear, volume 2, held August 25-29, 2001, Kurayoshi, Tottori, Japan.  aIncludes references  aIt has long been recognised that ethylene plays a major role in the ripening process of climacteric fruit. A more thorough analysis, however, has revealed that a number of biochemical and molecular processes associated with climacteric fruit ripening are ethylene-independent. One of the crucial steps of the onset of ripening is the induction of autocatalytic ethylene production. In ethylene-suppressed melons, ACC synthase activity is induced at the same time as in control melons, indicating that ACC biosynthesis during the early stages of ripening seems to be a developmentally-regulated (ethylene-independent) process. The various ripening events exhibit differential sensitivity to ethylene. For instance, the threshold level for degreening of the rind is 1 ppm, while 2.5 ppm are required to trigger some components of the softening process. The saturating level of ethylene producing maximum effects is less than 5 ppm, which is by far lower than the internal ethylene concentrations found in the fruit at the climacteric peak (over 100 ppm). In many fruit chilling temperatures hasten ethylene production and ripening and in some late season pear varieties, exposure to chilling temperatures is even absolutely required for the attainment of the capacity to synthesize autocatalytic ethylene. This is correlated with the stimulation of expression of ACC oxidase and of members of the ACC synthase gene family. Ethylene operates via a perception and transduction pathway to induce the expression of genes responsible for the biochemical and physiological changes observed during ripening. However, only a few genes induced via the ethylene transduction pathway have been described so far. We have used a differential display method to isolate novel ethylene-reponsive (ER) cDNA clones of tomato that potentially play a role in propagating the ethylene response and in regulating fruit ripening. Collectively, these data permit a general scheme of the molecular mechanisms of fruit ripening to be proposed. 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3abiosynthesis 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3acooling 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3agenes 3amelons 3apears 3aripening 3atemperature 3atomatoes1 aSharkawi, I.1 aChaves, A.1 aLi, Z.1 aLeLièvre, J.M.1 aBouzayen, M.1 aFrasse, P.1 aZegzouti, H.1 aLatche, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Oct., , no. 587 p.489-495dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.633Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01128naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245003200173300001200205500002900217520031600246592002800562650001400590650001000604650001700614650001100631650001300642773009200655856008200747852000900829655001200838IND60731375120221121232717.0210320e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073137512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchreiber, Stuart L.14aThe Rise of Molecular Glues  ap. 3-9.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  a2021 marks the 30th anniversary of the revelation that cyclosporin A and FK506 act in a way previously not seen—as “molecular glues” that induce neo-protein–protein associations.

The strain is Gram-positive, motile, and produces terminal endospores. The isolate is facultative aerobic and grows at salinities of 0.0–25.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 10–15% NaCl), pH 5.5–8.5 (optimum pH 7.0–7.5), and 15–42°C (optimum 37°C). The predominant isoprenoid quinone in the strain is menaquinone-7 and the peptidoglycan of the strain is meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major fatty acids of the strain are anteisio-C₁₅:₀, iso-C₁₅:₀, and, C₁₆:₀ (other components were < 10.0%), while the major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and three unidentified lipids. A phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity showed that the isolated strain was a cluster of the genus Gracilibacillus. High levels of gene sequence similarity were observed between strain K7ᵀ and Gracilibacillus orientalis XH-63ᵀ (96.5%), and between the present strain and Gracilibacillus xinjiangensis (96.5%). The DNA G+C content of this strain is 37.7 mol%. Based on these findings, strain K7ᵀ is proposed as a novel species: Gracilibacillus kimchii sp. nov. The type strain is K7ᵀ (KACC 18669ᵀ; JCM 31344ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGracilibacillus 3abacteria 3aendospores 3afatty acids 3aisoprenoids 3akimchi 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3apeptidoglycans 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asalinity 3asequence homology 3asodium chloride1 aLee, Hae-Won1 aLim, Seul Ki1 aKwon, Min-Sung1 aLee, Jieun1 aJang, Ja-Young1 aPark, Hae Woong1 aNam, Young-Do1 aSeo, Myung-Ji1 aChoi, Hak-Jong0 tjournal of microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.588-593dThe Microbiological Society of Koreax1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-016-6349-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01120naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245004600167300001300213520030400226592002800530650002300558650005200581650001800633650001300651773009800664856008300762852000900845655001200854IND60731375220221121232729.0210506e20210318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073137522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopol, Eric J.10aMessenger RNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2  ap. 1401.  aThe first two vaccines proven to be effective for inhibiting COVID-19 illness were both mRNA, achieving 95% efficacy (and safety) among 74,000 participants (half receiving placebo) after intramuscular delivery of two shots, 3–4 weeks apart.

Bamboo sharks were induced to swim at 0.5 and 0.75 body lengths per second in a laminar flow tank. Displacement, lag and angles were analyzed from high-speed video images. Onset, offset, duration, duty cycle and asynchrony index were calculated from three muscle implants on each side of each dorsal fin. The dorsal fins were displaced more laterally than the undulating body. In addition, the dorsal tips had larger lateral displacement than the trailing edges. Increased speed was accompanied by an increase in tail beat frequency with constant tail beat amplitude. However, lateral displacement of the fins and duration of muscle bursts remained relatively constant with increased speed. The range of lateral motion was greater for the second dorsal fin (mean 33.3°) than for the first dorsal fin (mean 28.4°). Bending within the fin was greater for the second dorsal fin (mean 43.8°) than for the first dorsal fin (mean 30.8°). Muscle onset and offset among implants on the same side of each dorsal fin was similar. Three-dimensional conformation of the dorsal fins was caused by interactions between muscle activity, material properties, and incident flow. Alternating bilateral activity occurred in both dorsal fins, further supporting the active role of these hydrofoils in thrust production during steady swimming. The dorsal fins in bamboo sharks are capable of thrust production during steady swimming and do not appear to function as stabilizing structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiloscyllium 3aelectromyography 3afins 3akinematics 3alaminar flow 3amuscles 3aswimming 3atail1 aWilga, Cheryl A.0 tZoology.g2013 Aug., v. 116, no. 4 p.224-231dElsevier GmbHx0944-20067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2013.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009100163300001600254520114500270592002801415650001201443650000801455650001701463650001201480650001701492650001801509650001101527650001801538650001601556650001301572650001301585650001801598650001001616650001001626650001201636650003001648650001801678650001301696650001101709700001901720700001901739700002001758700001701778773012001795856008101915852000901996655001202005IND60549120620221120151212.0171214e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054912062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-016-6017-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErdem, Mine10aApplication of high-resolution melting analysis for differentiation of spoilage yeasts  ap. 618-625.  aA new method based on high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was developed for the differentiation and classification of the yeast species that cause food spoilage. A total 134 strains belonging to 21 different yeast species were examined to evaluate the discriminative power of HRM analysis. Two different highly variable DNA regions on the 26 rRNA gene were targeted to produce the HRM profiles of each strain. HRM-based grouping was compared and confirmed by (GTG)5 rep-PCR fingerprinting analysis. All of the yeast species belonging to the genera Pichia, Candida, Kazachstania, Kluyveromyces, Debaryomyces, Dekkera, Saccharomyces, Torulaspora, Ustilago, and Yarrowia, which were produced as species-specific HRM profiles, allowed discrimination at species and/or strain level. The HRM analysis of both target regions provided successful discrimination that correlated with rep-PCR fingerprinting analysis. Consequently, the HRM analysis has the potential for use in the rapid and accurate classification and typing of yeast species isolated from different foods to determine their sources and routes as well as to prevent contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aDNA 3aDebaryomyces 3aDekkera 3aKazachstania 3aKluyveromyces 3aPichia 3aSaccharomyces 3aTorulaspora 3aUstilago 3aYarrowia 3afood spoilage 3afoods 3agenes 3amelting 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aspoilage 3ayeasts1 aKesmen, Zülal1 aÖzbekar, Esra1 aÇetin, Bülent1 aYetim, Hasan0 tjournal of microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.618-625dThe Microbiological Society of Koreax1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-016-6017-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013000155300001800285500001500303520156200318592002801880650002401908650001601932650002201948650001701970650002601987650001902013650001202032650001602044650002602060650001002086650002502096650001002121650001102131650001502142650002202157650001202179653002002191700001602211700002002227700001402247700001402261700001502275700001502290700001702305773013302322856007302455852000902528655001202537IND60419280920221119032629.0151002e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041928092DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.45212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hailong10aFunctional expression and synergistic cooperation of xylan‐degrading enzymes from Hypocrea orientalis and Aspergillus niger  ap. 2083-2091.  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Xylan plays an important role in the enzymatic digestion of biomass, but xylan‐degrading enzymes are expensive to produce. Current research is focused on improving the activity and efficacy of hydrolytic enzymes by molecular engineering and on understanding the synergistic cooperation of these enzymes. RESULTS: In this study, xylan‐degrading enzymes, including endo‐β‐1,4‐xylanases (HoXyn11A and AnXyn10C), β‐xylosidases (AnXln3D) and α‐L‐arabinofuranosidases (AnAxh62A) from Hypocrea orientalis and Aspergillus niger, were expressed at high levels in Pichia pastoris. Substrate specificity and end product analysis verified the mode of actions of the recombinant enzymes, which were specific for xylan degradation. Synergistic cooperation among these recombinant enzymes was clearly demonstrated. AnXyn10C was more efficient than HoXyn11A for producing both xylose and xylo‐oligosaccharides from beechwood xylan and wheat arabinoxylan. AnAxh62A displayed better cooperative effects with HoXyn11A than AnXyn10C in the hydrolysis of wheat arabinoxylan and increased the yield of xylobiose and xylotriose 8.6‐fold and 7.3‐fold, respectively. Although AnXln3D was the key enzyme for producing xylose, the yield of xylose depended strongly on the main‐chain and side‐group cleaving enzymes. CONCLUSION: This study will facilitate the development of highly efficient enzyme cocktails for the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into monosaccharides and xylo‐oligosaccharides. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanism of action 3aengineering 3aAspergillus niger 3aarabinoxylan 3aKomagataella pastoris 3alignocellulose 3aenzymes 3aTrichoderma 3asubstrate specificity 3axylan 3axylooligosaccharides 3awheat 3axylose 3ahydrolysis 3abiotransformation 3abiomass 0aPichia pastoris1 aWu, Jinlian1 aJiang, Fengjiao1 aXue, Yong1 aLiu, Jian1 aGan, Lihui1 aAli, Nasir1 aLong, Minnan0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2015 Nov., v. 90, no. 11 p.2083-2091dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.45213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245010500176300001400281520127900295592002801574650001101602650001501613650002001628650001301648650001501661650001101676650001101687650002201698651001501720653003701735653001501772653002701787653001601814653001601830700003301846700002101879773010501900856008802005852000902093655001202102IND60538118620221120180336.0190319e20151010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053811862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchand, Philippe10aTesting models of bee foraging behavior through the analysis of pollen loads and floral density data  ap. 41-49.  aThe composition of social bees’ corbicular pollen loads contains information about both the bees’ foraging behavior and the surrounding floral landscape. There have been, however, few attempts to integrate pollen composition and floral landscape to test hypotheses about foraging behavior. Here, we present an individual-based model that generates the species composition of pollen loads given a foraging model and a spatial distribution of floral resources. We apply this model to an existing dataset of inflorescence counts and bumble bee pollen loads sampled at different field sites in California. For two out of three sites, a foraging model consisting in correlated random walks with constant preferences for each plant species provides a plausible fit for the observed distribution of pollen load content. Pollen load compositions at the third site could be explained by an extension of the model, where different preferences apply to the choice of an initial foraging patch and subsequent foraging steps. Since this model describes the expected level of pollen load differentiation due solely to the spatial clustering of conspecific plants, it provides a null hypothesis against which more complex descriptions of behavior (e.g. flower constancy) can be tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3abee pollen 3adata collection 3aforaging 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apollen 3aspecies diversity 3aCalifornia 0aApproximate Bayesian computation 0aBumble bee 0aIndividual-based model 0aPollination 0aRandom walk1 aHarmon-Threatt, Alexandra N.1 aChapela, Ignacio0 tEcological modelling.g2015 Oct. 10, v. 313 p.41-49dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013100169300001600300520129300316592002801609650001401637650001001651650001601661650001101677650002301688650001401711650001001725700002201735773008101757856008201838990002301920852000901943655001201952IND60085411920221122190750.0141101e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008541192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.zool.2013.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcalde, Leandro10aOld and new hypotheses about the homology of the compound bones from the cheek and otico-occipital regions of the anuran skull  ap. 232-245.  aWe studied the larval development of compound bones from the otico-occipital and cheek regions in species of the neobatrachian genera Batrachyla, Hylorina, Leptodactylus, Odontophrynus and Pleurodema. Comparisons were made using a set of Ambystoma spp. (Caudata) and Ceratophrys ornata (Anura; Ceratophryidae) larvae. As suggested by previous studies, we verified the compound nature of the exoccipital (two centers, anurans only), frontoparietal (one center, most anurans and Ambystoma; three centers, some anurans), and squamosal (two centers, all anurans and Ambystoma) bones. We discuss old and new homology hypotheses for each of the compound bone centers in the context of the most widely accepted scenario of lissamphibian origins and relationships, i.e., monophyletic Lissamphibia that includes the clade Batrachia (Caudata+Anura) and the most divergent Gymnophiona. Our findings have a direct impact on our understanding of the composition of the skull in Lissamphibia. We recognized the presence of the following bones: (i) opisthotic (fused to the exoccipital) and tabular (fused to the squamosal) in Batrachia (Anura+Caudata) and (ii) supratemporal (fused to the parietal portion of the frontoparietal) in Anura. Separate centers of the parietal were found only in Pleurodema.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbystoma 3aAnura 3aGymnophiona 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amonophyly 3askull1 aBasso, Néstor G.0 tZoology.g2013 Aug., v. 116, no. 4 p.232-245dElsevier GmbHx0944-20067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2013.03.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012500165300001600290500001500306520121600321592002801537650001401565650001001579650002401589650001701613650002501630650001601655650001101671650001901682650002101701650002801722650002701750650001001777650001501787650002101802650001701823650001601840650000701856650002601863650002501889650002801914650003001942653001401972700003501986700001802021773012002039856008102159852000902240655001202249IND60549120720221120141250.0171214e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054912072DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-016-6271-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Joo-Bin10aMolecular characterization of SCO0765 as a cellotriose releasing endo-β-1,4-cellulase from Streptomyces coelicolor A(3)  ap. 626-631.  a2019-12-06  aThe sco0765 gene was annotated as a glycosyl hydrolase family 5 endoglucanase from the genomic sequence of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and consisted of 2,241 bp encoding a polypeptide of 747 amino acids (molecular weight of 80.5 kDa) with a 29-amino acid signal peptide for secretion. The SCO0765 recombinant protein was heterogeneously over-expressed in Streptomyces lividans TK24 under the control of a strong ermE* promoter. The purified SCO0765 protein showed the expected molecular weight of the mature form (718 aa, 77.6 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis. SCO0765 showed high activity toward β-glucan and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and negligible activity to Avicel, xylan, and xyloglucan. The SCO0765 cellulase had a maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 40°C toward CMC and at pH 9.0 and 50–60°C toward β-glucan. Thin layer chromatography of the hydrolyzed products of CMC and β-glucan by SCO0765 gave cellotriose as the major product and cellotetraose, cellopentaose, and longer oligosaccharides as the minor products. These results clearly demonstrate that SCO0765 is an endo-β-1,4-cellulase, hydrolyzing the β-1,4 glycosidic bond of cellulose into cellotriose.  aPublisher supplied data 3asecretion 3agenes 3agel electrophoresis 3apolypeptides 3arecombinant proteins 3aamino acids 3asodium 3asignal peptide 3amolecular weight 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3axylan 3ahydrolysis 3aoligosaccharides 3abeta-glucans 3axyloglucans 3apH 3aStreptomyces lividans 3anucleotide sequences 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3athin layer chromatography 0acellulose1 aDhakshnamoorthy, Vijayalakshmi1 aLee, Chang-Ro0 tjournal of microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.626-631dThe Microbiological Society of Koreax1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-016-6271-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245007800171300001600249520106000265592002801325650001801353650002601371650002101397650002201418650001501440650001001455650001201465650001201477650001801489653001901507653002501526653001701551653003401568700002201602773008901624856008301713990002301796852000901819655001201828IND60697545020221117230534.0200605e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069754502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2017.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaghodia, Ajay B.10aInfectivity of Sf-rhabdovirus variants in insect and mammalian cell lines  ap. 234-245.  aSf-rhabdovirus was only recently identified as an adventitious agent of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) cell lines used as hosts for baculovirus vectors. As such, we still know little about its genetic variation, infectivity, and the potential impact of variation on the Sf-rhabdovirus-host interaction. Here, we characterized Sf-rhabdoviruses from two widely used Sf cell lines to confirm and extend information on Sf-rhabdovirus variation. We then used our novel Sf-rhabdovirus-negative (Sf-RVN) Sf cell line to assess the infectivity of variants with and without a 320bp X/L deletion and found both established productive persistent infections in Sf-RVN cells. We also assessed their infectivity using heterologous insect and mammalian cell lines and found neither established productive persistent infections in these cells. These results are the first to directly demonstrate Sf-rhabdoviruses are infectious for Sf cells, irrespective of the X/L deletion. They also confirm and extend previous results indicating Sf-rhabdoviruses have a narrow host range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaculoviridae 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3achronic diseases 3agenetic variation 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ainsects 3amammals 3apathogenicity 0aSf-rhabdovirus 0aAdventitious viruses 0aInsect cells 0aBaculovirus expression system1 aJarvis, Donald L.0 tVirology.g2017 Dec., v. 512 p.234-245dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.09.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03994naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100003300192245009300225500001900318506007600337520229700413592002802710506003702738650003402775650001102809650001202820650001602832650002302848650001502871650002002886650002002906650001402926650001102940650001702951650001502968650001402983650001002997650001403007650001403021650001703035650001503052653001803067653002603085653001203111653001203123653001303135700002703148700003203175700002103207773009403228856008503322852000903407655001203416IND60690743820221207064602.0200508e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069074382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e004122doi7 aPMC56353452pmcid7 a290343372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFadl, Alyaa Elsaid Abdelaziz10aNew biomarkers of post-settlement growth in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSome sea urchins, including the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, have been successfully used in aquaculture, but their slow growth and late reproduction are challenging to overcome when developing efficient aquaculture production techniques. S. purpuratus develops via an indirect life history that is characterized by a drastic settlement process at the end of a larval period that lasts for several weeks. During this transition, the bilateral larva is transformed into a pentaradial juvenile, which will start feeding and growing in the benthic habitat. Due to predation and other ecological factors, settlement is typically associated with high mortality rates in juvenile populations. Additionally, juveniles require several days to develop a functional mouth and digestive system. During this perimetamorphic period, juveniles use up larval resources until they are capable to digest adult food. Mechanisms underlying the onset of juvenile feeding and metabolism have implications for the recruitment of natural populations as well as aquaculture and are relatively poorly understood in S. purpuratus. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS)/Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway (IIS/TOR) is well conserved among animal phyla and regulates physiological and developmental functions, such as growth, reproduction, aging and nutritional status. We analyzed the expression of FoxO, TOR, and ILPs in post-settlement juveniles in conjunction with their early growth trajectories. We also tested how pre-settlement starvation affected post-settlement expression of IIS. We found that FoxO provides a useful molecular marker in early juveniles as its expression is strongly correlated with juvenile growth. We also found that pre-settlement starvation affects juvenile growth trajectories as well as IIS. Our findings provide preliminary insights into the mechanisms underlying post-settlement growth and metabolism in S. purpuratus. They also have important implications for sea urchin aquaculture, as they show that pre-settlement nutrient environment significantly affects both early growth trajectories and gene expression. This information can be used to develop new biomarkers for juvenile health in sea urchin population ecology and aquaculture aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStrongylocentrotus purpuratus 3aadults 3aanimals 3aaquaculture 3abenthic ecosystems 3abiomarkers 3agene expression 3agenetic markers 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alife history 3ametabolism 3amortality 3amouth 3apredation 3arapamycin 3areproduction 3astarvation 0aEndocrinology 0aDevelopmental biology 0aZoology 0aEcology 0aGenetics1 aMahfouz, Magdy Elsayed1 aEl-Gamal, Mona Mabrouk Taha1 aHeyland, Andreas0 tHeliyon.g2017 Oct., v. 3, no. 10 p.e00412-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e004123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245012300171500001900294520160600313592002801919650001101947650001201958650002701970650002201997650001502019650001702034650001602051650001502067700002202082773012202104856008002226852000902306655001202315IND60732102620221118050353.0210326e20210110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073210262DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology80100072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapadaki, Christina 10aRiver Flow Alterations Caused by Intense Anthropogenic Uses and Future Climate Variability Implications in the Balkans  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRiver flow alterations, caused by climate variability/change and intense anthropogenic uses (e.g., flow regulation by dams) are considered among the main global challenges of which hydrologists should be dealing with. For the purpose of this study, environmental flow and potential hydrological alterations are made for the extended Drin river basin, with limited historical hydrological information available. To overcome this limitation environmental flow assessment is made using simulated streamflow data from a watershed hydrological model. Descriptive statistics applied to streamflow values indicate that median monthly flows with no anthropogenic uses are consistently greater than those with anthropogenic uses by 0–37.4 m³/s in all subbasins. Moreover, an investigation of potential climate variability/change impact on river flow regime is made using streamflow simulations from a global hydrological model. Results indicate that hydrologic alteration is intense between nonregulated and regulated streamflow conditions. More specifically, for all Global Circulation Models and Regional Climate Models combinations, and both regulated and unregulated streamflow conditions, the minimum discharge values had statistically significant decreasing trends, except one combination (RCP 4.5–RCA4/ECEARTH) for unregulated conditions. Finally, results from this preliminary analysis could enhance the necessary conversations among all relevant stakeholders to discuss and decide on sustainable water resources management issues for the development of a Drin Basin Management Plan in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3adescriptive statistics 3ahydrologic models 3ariver flow 3astakeholders 3astream flow 3awatersheds1 aDimitriou, Elias 0 tHydrology.g2021 Jan. 10, v. 8, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology80100073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245014500163520150800308592002801816650002801844650002001872650001201892650001901904650001501923650001501938650002101953650001901974651001801993700002502011700002402036700002902060700002202089700002402111773012902135856007402264852000902338655001202347IND60651330920221122154750.0190711e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065133092DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111214092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaxwell, Aaron  E.10aLarge-Area, High Spatial Resolution Land Cover Mapping Using Random Forests, GEOBIA, and NAIP Orthophotography: Findings and Recommendations  aDespite the need for quality land cover information, large-area, high spatial resolution land cover mapping has proven to be a difficult task for a variety of reasons including large data volumes, complexity of developing training and validation datasets, data availability, and heterogeneity in data and landscape conditions. We investigate the use of geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), random forest (RF) machine learning, and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) orthophotography for mapping general land cover across the entire state of West Virginia, USA, an area of roughly 62,000 km2. We obtained an overall accuracy of 96.7% and a Kappa statistic of 0.886 using a combination of NAIP orthophotography and ancillary data. Despite the high overall classification accuracy, some classes were difficult to differentiate, as highlight by the low user&rsquo;s and producer&rsquo;s accuracies for the barren, impervious, and mixed developed classes. In contrast, forest, low vegetation, and water were generally mapped with accuracy. The inclusion of ancillary data and first- and second-order textural measures generally improved classification accuracy whereas band indices and object geometric measures were less valuable. Including super-object attributes improved the classification slightly; however, this increased the computational time and complexity. From the findings of this research and previous studies, recommendations are provided for mapping large spatial extents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3aforests 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aorthophotography 3aremote sensing 3aWest Virginia1 aStrager, Michael P.,1 aWarner, Timothy A.,1 aRamezan, Christopher  A.1 aMorgan, Alice  N.1 aPauley, Cameron  E.0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 June 13, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111214093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245012800201300001800329500002000347520041100367592002800778596005800806650003000864650002200894650001300916650001000929650001400939650001200953650001500965651001100980700002100991700001601012700001801028700002801046700003101074700005701105773013601162856007401298852000901372655001201381IND60644744320221119135617.0190521e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064474432DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.131322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallardo, Carmina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3293-306X10aAttenuated and non‐haemadsorbing (non‐HAD) genotype II African swine fever virus (ASFV) isolated in Europe, Latvia 2017  ap. 1399-1404.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA non‐haemadsorbing (non‐HAD) ASF virus (ASFV) genotype II, namely Lv17/WB/Rie1, was isolated from a hunted wild boar in Latvia in 2017.

However, recently the IUCN has listed the species under the endangered category because the population has critically declined in the wild. The sexually mature C. magur brooders are often collected from their natural habitats for seed production in captivity. In many cases, the brooder dies due to handling injuries or confinement stress. In this study, we demonstrated that viable progeny could be generated from freshly dead sexually mature C. magur. Three hours after death, the gonads were excised, macroscopically examined and gamete viability was evaluated. Artificial fertilization was performed by mixing the sperm suspension with the eggs. Water was added after 1 min of mixing to activate the fertilization process. We observed 85%-93% fertilization success from gametes derived from dead donors as opposed to 90%-95% from those derived from live control donors. The embryos showed normal development and resulted in the generation of 88%-92% viable progeny, which was similar to the progeny derived from control donors (92%-93%). The results obtained in this study will have profound implications in enhancing the seed production of endangered C. magur and could potentially be applied to other key commercially or endangered fish species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClarias magur 3aaquaculture 3acaptive animals 3acatfish 3adeath 3aendangered species 3aprogeny 3asexual maturity 3aspermatozoa 3ataste 3aviability 0aBiological sciences 0aDevelopmental biology 0aZoology1 aKumar, Santosh0 tHeliyon.g2017 Oct., v. 3, no. 10 p.e00434-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e004343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014100158520209200299592002802391650002202419650002502441650001402466650002302480650001202503650002502515650002002540650002902560650002702589650001502616650001202631650002602643650001002669650001902679650001102698650002202709650001202731650002102743651001002764700001602774700001902790700002202809700001702831700001902848773012802867856007502995852000903070655001203079IND60768504420221118061145.0220225e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076850442DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140409782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Jiajia 10aRevealing the Structure and Composition of the Restored Vegetation Cover in Semi-Arid Mine Dumps Based on LiDAR and Hyperspectral Images  aRemotely sensed images with low resolution can be effectively used for the large-area monitoring of vegetation restoration, but are unsuitable for accurate small-area monitoring. This limits researchers’ ability to study the composition of vegetation species and the biodiversity and ecosystem functions after ecological restoration. Therefore, this study uses LiDAR and hyperspectral data, develops a hierarchical classification method for classifying vegetation based on LiDAR technology, decision tree and a random forest classifier, and applies it to the eastern waste dump of the Heidaigou mining area in Inner Mongolia, China, which has been restored for around 15 years, to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results were as follows. (1) The intensity, height, and echo characteristics of LiDAR point cloud data and the spectral, vegetation indices, and texture features of hyperspectral image data effectively reflected the differences in vegetation species composition. (2) Vegetation indices had the highest contribution rate to the classification of vegetation species composition types, followed by height, while spectral data alone had a lower contribution rate. Therefore, it was necessary to screen the features of LiDAR and hyperspectral data before classifying vegetation. (3) The hierarchical classification method effectively distinguished the differences between trees (Populus spp., Pinus tabuliformis, Hippophae sp. (arbor), and Robinia pseudoacacia), shrubs (Amorpha fruticosa, Caragana microphylla + Hippophae sp. (shrub)), and grass species, with classification accuracy of 87.45% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.79, which was nearly 43% higher than an unsupervised classification and 10.7–22.7% higher than other supervised classification methods. In conclusion, the fusion of LiDAR and hyperspectral data can accurately and reliably estimate and classify vegetation structural parameters, and reveal the type, quantity, and diversity of vegetation, thus providing a sufficient basis for the assessment and improvement of vegetation after restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmorpha fruticosa 3aCaragana microphylla 3aHippophae 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aPopulus 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3ahyperspectral imagery 3alidar 3aremote sensing 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3atexture 3avegetation cover 3aChina1 aLiang, Jie 1 aYang, Yongjun 1 aZhang, Shaoliang 1 aHou, Huping 1 aZhu, Xiaoxiao 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Feb. 17, v. 14, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140409783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01814naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245017200170300001800342520062900360592002800989650001401017650002301031650002301054650002601077650002301103650002201126650000901148700001601157700002101173700001801194700002001212700002001232773010601252856008501358852000901443655001201452IND60578976920221119180847.0170815e20151016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057897692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b024892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jian-Qiang10aZn-Catalyzed Diastereo- and Enantioselective Cascade Reaction of 3-Isothiocyanato Oxindoles and 3-Nitroindoles: Stereocontrolled Syntheses of Polycyclic Spirooxindoles  ap. 5020-5023.  aA catalytic asymmetric Michael/cyclization cascade reaction of 3-isothiocyanato oxindoles and 3-nitroindoles has been disclosed with a chiral Zn(OTf)₂/diphenylamine-linked bis(oxazoline) complex as the catalyst.

Potassium (K⁺) channels are also considered, but less well recognized, to be necessary for cell proliferation by either hyperpolarizing or depolarizing cells during the cell cycle. A block of polyamine synthesis as well as block or knockout of K⁺channels can halt cell proliferation. K⁺channels like BK (maxi calcium (Ca²⁺)-activated K⁺), Kir (inward rectifier), M-type K⁺-and TASK (two-pore domain K⁺) channels or the delayed rectifier K⁺channels are modulated in their electrical properties by polyamines. Polyamines are most effective in blocking these channels when applied to the intracellular face of these channels except for TASK channels where they act only from the extracellular side. Quinidine, a general K⁺channel blocker, was found to reduce putrescine concentrations, to block the ornithine decarboxylase and halt cell proliferation. From these results, the question arises if there is an interaction between polyamines, K⁺channels and proliferation. It might be speculated that a decrease of intracellular polyamines allows more K⁺channels to be active, thus inducing hyperpolarization, while an increase of the polyamine concentration may block K⁺channel activity leading to depolarization of the membrane potential. On the other hand, a block or a deletion of K⁺channels may cause a decrease of the polyamine concentration in cells. More research is needed to test these hypotheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3aelectrical properties 3amembrane potential 3aornithine decarboxylase 3apolyamines 3apotassium 3apotassium channels 3aputrescine 3aquinidine1 aHermann, Anton0 tAmino acids.g2014 Mar., v. 46, no. 3 p.681-688dSpringer-Verlagx0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-013-1536-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01668naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245017700170300001600347520054100363592002800904653002800932653002900960653001700989653002901006653001701035653001301052653001901065653001901084700001701103773013001120856008301250852000901333655001201342IND60554037220221122003203.0161023e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055403722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejmhg.2015.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShawky, Rabah M.10aMeier–Gorlin syndrome: An additional Egyptian patient with gastroesophageal reflux, hydronephrosis, renal stones and hypoplastic labia majora and minora with clitromegaly  ap. 397-400.  aWe report a 4.5year old female child with the classical triad of Meier–Gorlin syndrome (microtia, absent patella and short stature) with normal mentality.

SNF also binds to the U2A′ protein, but only in the U2 snRNP. Although previous reports have implicated U2A′ as a necessary auxiliary protein for the binding of SNF to Stemloop IV, there are no mechanisms that explain the partitioning of U2A′ to the U2 snRNP and its absence from the U1 snRNP. Using in vitro RNA binding isotherms and isothermal titration calorimetry, the thermodynamics of SNF/RNA/U2A′ ternary complex formation have now been characterized. There is a very large binding cooperativity unique to Stemloop IV that favors formation of the SLIV/SNF/U2A′ complex. The binding cooperativity, or heterotropic linkage, is interpreted with respect to linked conformational equilibria of both SNF and its RNA ligand and so represents an example of protein–RNA allostery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3abinding proteins 3acalorimetry 3asmall nuclear RNA 3athermodynamics 3atitration1 aHall, Kathleen B.0 tBiochemistry.g2014 June 10, v. 53, no. 22 p.3529-3539dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi500192a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002400148245011700172300001800289500001500307520152500322592002801847650001601875650001801891650001401909650001301923650001101936650002001947650001701967650001701984650001202001650002502013650001502038650001102053650001202064650001502076650001102091650001002102650001902112650001002131650001102141651001502152653003602167700002702203773011402230856008402344852000902428655001202437IND4472285020221120205438.0150808e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447228502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Edward A.10aDetermination of selected heavy metal concentrations and distribution in a southwestern stream using macrophytes  ap. 1504-1511.  a2019-12-06  aSince the reduction of the arsenic standard from 50 to 10μgL⁻¹ by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2006 many small town and rural water municipalities were left with the task of preventing or mitigating arsenic contamination of drinking water supplies. In this study macrophytes and sediments were used to determine the concentration and distribution of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) within the primary source of drinking water (Gallinas River watershed) to the residents of Las Vegas, New Mexico. Sampling was done in the spring and fall at four sites, two above the city and two below, and samples were analyzed using ICP-MS. Results showed significantly higher (p<.05) metal concentrations in plant roots than shoots for most metals. Spearman’s correlation showed positive correlations (r>.3) between plant and sediment concentrations of Cd, Pb, Zn, As, and a negative correlation for Cu. The site above waste water treatment plant (AWWTP) had the highest plant tissue concentrations of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As. All of these concentrations attained critical toxicity levels exceeding sediment quality guidelines. High concentration factor values and levels of metals detected in macrophyte tissues indicate that heavy metals within sediments in the Gallinas River occur in bioavailable forms. Correlations between plant and sediment metal concentrations indicate that metal concentrations in macrophyte tissues are a good reflection of metal concentrations within the sediment in the Gallinas River.  aPublisher supplied data 3amacrophytes 3aplant tissues 3asediments 3atoxicity 3arivers 3awater pollution 3awater supply 3aheavy metals 3aarsenic 3awastewater treatment 3aguidelines 3aspring 3astreams 3awatersheds 3acities 3atowns 3adrinking water 3aroots 3ashoots 3aNew Mexico 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aShu-Nyamboli, Chemanji0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2011 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.1504-1511dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245007100163520192300234592002802157650001202185650001102197650001502208650001702223650001802240650001102258650001202269650003002281650002002311650002402331650001602355650002002371700001802391700002402409700001802433700001902451700001702470700002102487700002602508700001802534700002602552773012002578856007702698852000902775655001202784IND60715280720221122235449.0201026e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071528072DNAL7 a10.3390/genes111012062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalid, Madiha 10aGenetic Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder in a Pakistani Population  aAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of complex multifactorial neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders in children characterized by impairment of communication and social interaction. Several genes with associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified for ASD in different genetic association studies, meta-analyses, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, associations between different SNPs and ASD vary from population to population. Four SNPs in genes CNTNAP2, EIF4E, ATP2B2, CACNA1C, and SNP rs4307059 (which is found between CDH9 and CDH10 genes) have been identified and reported as candidate risk factors for ASD. The aim of the present study was, for the first time, to assess the association of SNPs in these genes with ASD in the Pakistani population. PCR-based genotyping was performed using allele-specific primers in 93 ASD and 93 control Pakistani individuals. All genetic associations, genotype frequencies, and allele frequencies were computed as odds’ ratios (ORs) using logistic regression with a threshold of p ≤ 0.01 to determine statistical significance. We found that the homozygous genotypes of mutant T alleles of CNTNAP2 and ATP2B2 were significantly associated with Pakistani ASD patients in unadjusted ORs (p < 0.01), but their significance score was lost in the adjusted model. Other SNPs such as rs4307059, rs17850950 of EIF4E, and rs1006737 of CACNA1C were not statistically significant. Based on this, we conclude that SNPs are not associated with, or are not the main cause of, autism in the Pakistani population, indicating the involvement of additional players, which need to be investigated in future studies in a large population size. One of the limitations of present study is its small sample size.

The inclusion complex of SASP and DMβCD was prepared at 1:1 host–guest stoichiometry based on Job’s plot and then characterized through various analytical techniques. Then, the DMβCD/SASP inclusion complex was incorporated in CS to form DMβCD/SASP/CS NPs. The loading efficiency of SASP in the DMβCD/SASP/CS NPs was significantly higher than that of the SASP/CS NPs. A positive zeta potential of +35.4mV was also observed in the DMβCD/SASP/CS NPs with an average size of 90nm. SASP exhibited a sustained release after the DMβCD/SASP/CS NPs were formed. The toxicity of the NPs to LO2 cells was lower than that of free SASP. Therefore, the CD inclusion complex-loaded CS NPs can be applied to deliver hydrophobic drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3achitosan 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3astoichiometry 3atoxicity 3azeta potential 0aSalazosufapyridine 0a2,6-dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin 0aChitosan 0aNanoparticles 0aSustained release 0aSalazosulfapyridine (PubChem CID: 5359476) 0a2,6-dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin (PubChem CID: 10171019) 0aChitosan (PubChem CID: 71853)1 aYang, Hongqin1 aTang, Bin1 aWu, Di1 aDu, Qiaohong1 aXu, Kailin1 aLi, Hui0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Jan. 20, v. 156 p.215-222dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.09.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014000173300001600313520158400329592002801913650001501941650001501956650001201971650001301983650002301996650001202019650002202031650003502053650001202088650001002100650001202110650001802122650001002140650001402150650001402164651002202178653001702200653001802217653001902235653002502254653002502279653003202304700002102336700002902357773010802386856008502494852000902579655001202588IND60536095420221122050032.0190215e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053609542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2014.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaunders, Denis A.10aUse of tree hollows by Carnaby’s Cockatoo and the fate of large hollow-bearing trees at Coomallo Creek, Western Australia 1969–2013  ap. 185-193.  aThe loss of hollow-bearing trees and lack of replacements are important issues throughout the world where development of intensive agriculture has resulted in the reduction and fragmentation of natural woodlands. Many species of animal depend on hollows (cavities) for breeding and shelter, and are impacted by these changes. One such species is the endangered Carnaby’s Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus latirostris, an endemic of southwestern Australia, which nests in large hollows in eucalypt trees. Nest hollow selection by a breeding population at Coomallo Creek, in the wheatbelt of Western Australia, was studied from 1969 to 2013. The cockatoos nested in any hollow large enough to access (mean entrance diameter 270mm, floor diameter 407mm and depth 1.24m). Nesting attempts in shallow hollows (<400mm) were less successful than those in deeper hollows (>1000mm). Breeding females returned to the same hollow they used previously, provided they had been successful in the previous breeding attempt and the hollow was not occupied.During the study, the cockatoos used 252 large hollow-bearing trees. By 2013 40% of these had fallen or been pushed over, had been burnt deliberately or by wildfire, or had been damaged such that they were no longer suitable for use by the cockatoos; an average annual loss rate of 0.91%. Based on this rate of loss, only 29% of large hollow-bearing trees standing in 2013 will be extant in 2125 and not all of these can be expected to offer useable nest hollows. The conservation implications arising from the results of the study are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCacatuidae 3aEucalyptus 3aanimals 3abreeding 3aendangered species 3afemales 3aintensive farming 3anatural resources conservation 3anesting 3anests 3astreams 3atree cavities 3atrees 3awildfires 3awoodlands 3aWestern Australia 0aTree hollows 0aTree cavities 0aHollow-nesting 0aLoss of tree hollows 0aCarnaby’s Cockatoo 0aCalyptorhynchus latirostris1 aMawson, Peter R.1 aDawson, Richard,d1939?-0 tBiological conservation.g2014 Sept., v. 177 p.185-193dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01312naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100003200157245004200189300001500231506002800246520034800274592002800622506003700650650001100687650001200698651001200710700003400722773016500756856009200921852000901013655001201022IND60774447420221207125744.0170815e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077444742DNAL7 a10.21498/2518-1017.2(12).2010.593192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aДаниленко, Б.

The spread of MDR plasmids is founded on their ability of horizontal transference, as well as their faithful inheritance in progeny cells. Here, we investigated the genetic factors involved in the prevalence of the IncI conjugative plasmid pESBL, which was isolated from the Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak strain in Germany in 2011. Using transposon-insertion sequencing, we identified the pESBL partitioning locus (par). Genetic, biochemical and microscopic approaches allowed pESBL to be characterized as a new member of the Type Ib partitioning system. Inactivation of par caused mis-segregation of pESBL followed by post-segregational killing (PSK), resulting in a great fitness disadvantage but apparent plasmid stability in the population of viable cells. We constructed a variety of pESBL derivatives with different combinations of mutations in par, conjugational transfer (oriT) and pnd toxin-antitoxin (TA) genes. Only the triple mutant exhibited plasmid-free cells in viable cell populations. Time-lapse tracking of plasmid dynamics in microfluidics indicated that inactivation of pnd improved the survival of plasmid-free cells and allowed oriT-dependent re-acquisition of the plasmid. Altogether, the three factors—active partitioning, toxin-antitoxin and conjugational transfer—are all involved in the prevalence of pESBL in the E. coli population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O104 3acell viability 3agenes 3aloci 3amicrofluidic technology 3amultiple drug resistance 3amutants 3aplasmids 3aprogeny 3aGermany1 aGoldlust, Kelly 1 aQuebre, Valentin 1 aShen, Minjia 1 aLesterlin, Christian 1 aBouet, Jean-Yves 1 aYamaichi, Yoshiharu 0 tGenes.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes111012073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003600117024003900153040001800192100000300210245009300213506007600306506003100382520147800413592002801891596008401919596000802003596000902011506003702020650001702057650001902074650001102093650001102104650002902115650001202144651001102156700000302167700000302170700000302173700000302176700000302179700000302182773007602185856011402261856008302375961000902458852000902467655001202476IND60754458020221215142344.0221002e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075445802DNAL7 a10113/75445802hdl7 a10.1016/j.rser.2020.1097812doi7 a10.1016/j.rser.2020.1097812chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 10aEnergy choices in Alaska: Mining people's perception and attitudes from geotagged tweets  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAlaska is at the forefront of climate change and subject to salient challenges including energy consumption. It is important to understand Alaskans' perceptions and opinions about energy consumption to solve Alaska's domestic energy problems and creating a sustainable future. However, it is challenging to collect public opinions about energy consumption using conventional survey methods, which are often expensive, labor-intensive, and slow. This study utilizes information-rich Twitter data to investigate Alaskans' perceptions and opinions on various energy sources and in particular clean energy sources. Using the geotagged Twitter data collected in Alaska from 2014 to 2016, a lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach was first applied to analyze the polarity in the expressed opinions. Further, a novel fuzzy-based theory is employed to derive the sentiment of the opinion in each tweet. The results indicate that there is a valuable growth rate for a set of energy-related keywords, such as "sun", "power", and "nuclear". The rank of top 20 renewable energy-related keywords shows the word "Tidal" has the highest ranking followed by "solar panel". Moreover, the attention to various types of energy is increasing dramatically among Alaskans. Importantly, Alaskans' attitudes toward energy and renewable energy changed positively from 2014 to 2016, indicating that Alaskans' energy choices are more acceptive towards or even favor renewable energy in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  cEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  cNSF  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclean energy 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3apeople 3arenewable energy sources 3asurveys 3aAlaska1 1 1 1 1 1 0 tRenewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.dElsevier BVx1364-03217nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/75445803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.1097813Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001800094024003100112040001800143100001700161245012900178300001800307500001500325520126400340592002801604650001601632650001301648650001701661650001701678650001801695650002801713650002401741650001301765650003101778650001701809650001101826650002801837650003601865650002601901650003901927653002401966700001401990700001402004700001602018700001502034773009902049856007702148852000902225655001202234IND50088794620221120160948.0151024e199810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008879462DNAL7 a98560772pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500504262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEickmann, M.10aEffect of cysteine substitutions on dimerization and interfragment linkage of human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B (gp UL55)  ap. 1865-1880.  a2019-12-06  aExperiments were carried out to analyze the function of cysteine residues at amino acid positions 506 (cI), 550 (cII), 573 (cIII), and 610 (cIV), in dimerization and/or disulfide linkage of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) glycoprotein B (gB). Single c-codons or pairs were substituted in the gB sequence of constructs which were used for transfection and selection of stable transfectants. Analysis of gB expression products revealed that single substitutions of cIII or cIV, but neither single nor double substitutions of cI or/and cII prevented gB dimerization. All substituted gB derivatives were, however, no longer processed by proteolytic cleavage. After deletion of the membrane anchor domain, correct proteolytic processing was again observed for anchorless gB forms. Substitutions of cI or cI/cII in secretory gB appeared to interfere with disulfide linkage between gB cleavage fragments. In the case of anchorless gB with substitutions of cII, cIII, or cIII/cIV, however, extracellular gB forms were not recovered. Using the Sindbis expression system recovery of all anchorless gB forms with cysteine substitutions was achieved. Analysis verified involvement of cI/II substitutions in intrachain disulfide linkage between cleavage fragments of HCMV gB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteolysis 3acysteine 3adimerization 3atransfection 3aglycoproteins 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCysteine 2aCytomegalovirusxchemistry 2aDimerization 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxchemistry 0aHuman herpesvirus 51 aLange, R.1 aOhlin, M.1 aReschke, M.1 aRadsak, K.0 tArchives of virology.g1998 Oct., v. 143, no. 10 p.1865-1880dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0070500504263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01255naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006500171300001600236520034100252592002800593650001600621650000800637650001300645650001000658650001200668650001300680700001700693700002300710773011300733856008600846852000900932655001200941IND60561538920221117005140.0190411e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056153892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2016.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEekhout, Thomas10aModification of DNA Checkpoints to Confer Aluminum Tolerance  ap. 102-105.  aAlthough aluminum (Al) toxicity represents a global agricultural problem, the biochemical targets for Al remain elusive.

This has implications for large-scale bioprocessing of cell therapies where capillary transfer is needed. The recovery, viability, and osteogenic differentiation potential of two subsets of MDPCs, early-adherent pre-plate 1 (PP1) and late-adherent PP3 populations, have been examined: PP1 MDPCs produced a greater degree of osteogenic differentiation than PP3 MDPCs, quantified by Alizarin Red S staining intensity (P < 0.05). For both cell populations, capillary flow-induced significant increases in Alizarin Red S staining (P < 0.05). However, PP1 cells were more susceptible to capillary flow-induced damage than PP3 cells and this was dependent on duration of exposure. Overall, results indicate that different cell subsets, even from within a single tissue, can respond variably to capillary shear stress, necessitating its precise monitoring and control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalizarin 3abioprocessing 3abone formation 3aexposure duration 3ashear stress 2aAnimals 2aBlood Flow Velocity 2aCapillariesxphysiology 2aCell Adhesion 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Survival 2aMusclesxcytology 2aMyoblastsxphysiology 2aRats1 aMulhall, Hayley1 aAl-Quatani, Khalid1 aLewis, Mark1 aWall, Ivan0 tBiotechnology letters.g2011 July, v. 33, no. 7 p.1481-1486dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-011-0570-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008800170300001600258520104800274592002801322650002201350650000901372650001901381650002801400650001301428650001501441650001001456650002101466650002901487650001601516650001401532650002101546653003301567653002301600653002701623653004201650700001701692700001901709773010801728856008601836852000901922655001201931IND60540848120221120204952.0190318e20150306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054084812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.09.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajput, Gaurav10aCarboxymethylation of Cassia angustifolia seed gum: Synthesis and rheological study  ap. 494-500.  aThe seeds of Cassia angustifolia are a rich source of galactomannan gum. The seed gums possess a wide variety of industrial applications. To utilize C. angustifolia seed gum for broader industrial applications, the carboxymethyl-Cassia angustifolia seed gum (CM-CAG) was synthesized. The gum was etherified with sodium monochloroacetate (SMCA) in a methanol-water system in presence of alkali (NaOH) at different reaction conditions. The variables studied includes alkali concentration, SMCA concentration, methanol:water ratio, liquor:gum ratio, reaction temperature and time. The extent of carboxymethylation was determined as degree of substitution (DS). The optimum conditions for preparing CM-CAG (DS=0.474) comprised 0.100mol of NaOH, 0.05mol of SMCA, 80% of methanol:water ratio (as % methanol) and liquor:gum ratio (v/w) of 10:1 at 75°C for 60min using 0.03mol (as AGU) of CAG. Rheological studies showed CM-CAG to exhibit non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behaviour, relatively high viscosity, cold water solubility and solution stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSenna alexandrina 3acold 3agalactomannans 3aindustrial applications 3amethanol 3aplant gums 3aseeds 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium monochloroacetate 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awater solubility 0aCassia angustifolia seed gum 0aCarboxymethylation 0aDegree of substitution 0aNon-Newtonian Pseudoplastic behaviour1 aPandey, I.P.1 aJoshi, Gyanesh0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Mar. 06, v. 117 p.494-500dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.09.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245008100130300001600211500001900227520103600246592002801282650001501310650001301325650002501338650001901363650002801382653001801410653004301428700002101471773019601492852000901688655001201697IND60716744320221119043349.0201107e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071674432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Manmeet10aSocio-economic Determinants of Women Leaders in PRIs: A Study in Uttarakhand  ap. 140-145.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe 73ʳᵈ Constitutional Amendment Act has brought many women leaders into the Panchayati Raj Institutions.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmed infection with Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola (Oo) in 36.8% (n = 14) of the 38 mycotic infections. Infections with Oo were evenly distributed over the 35-y period and lacked a sex predilection. There was a period prevalence of 4.5% of completed snake necropsy or biopsy cases that were Oo positive. Species affected included green anaconda (Eunectes murinus, n = 4), garden tree boa (Corallus hortulanus, n = 1), false water cobra (Hydrodynastes gigas, n = 5), yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus, n = 1), eastern milksnake (Lampropeltis triangulum, n = 1), Brazilian rainbow boa (Epicrates cenchria cenchria, n = 1), and eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus, n = 1). Histopathology demonstrated one or more of the following: heterophilic to necrotizing epidermitis with or without granulomatous dermatitis (n = 12), granulomatous pneumonia (n = 5), granulomatous endophthalmitis (n = 1), and subcutaneous-intramuscular fungal granuloma (n = 1).

Alcohol use contributes directly and indirectly to weight gain. Health behaviours cluster in adolescence and track to adulthood. This review identified and synthesised qualitative research to provide insight into common underlying factors influencing alcohol use and unhealthy eating behaviours amongst young people aged 10&ndash;17. Sixty two studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty eight studies focused on alcohol; 34 focused on eating behaviours. Informed by principles of thematic analysis and meta-ethnography, analysis yielded five themes: (1) use of alcohol and unhealthy food to overcome personal problems; (2) unhealthy eating and alcohol use as fun experiences; (3) food, but not alcohol, choices are based on taste; (4) control and restraint; and (5) demonstrating identity through alcohol and food choices. Young people faced pressure, reinforced by industry, to eat and drink in very specific ways, with clear social consequences if their attitudes or behaviour were deemed unacceptable. No qualitative studies were identified with an explicit and concurrent focus on adolescent eating behaviours and alcohol consumption. Further exploratory work is needed to examine the links between food and alcohol in young people&rsquo;s emotional, social and cultural lives.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aadulthood 3aalcohol drinking 3aalcohols 3aattitudes and opinions 3abody weight 3afood choices 3ahealth behavior 3aqualitative analysis 3asocial impact 3asystematic review 3ataste 3aweight gain1 aElamin, Wafa 1 aGiles, Emma L.,1 aHillier-Brown, Frances 1 aByrnes, Kate 1 aConnor, Natalie 1 aNewbury-Birch, Dorothy 1 aElls, Louisa 0 tNutrients.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110819143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011600168300001600284520171300300536022802013592002802241596011502269650002902384650001102413650000902424650001902433650001702452650002202469650001002491650002002501650001502521650001402536650001902550650001402569650001702583650001702600650001402617650001502631651001002646653002502656653001602681653002002697653001002717653001702727653002202744653002202766653001902788700001502807700001902822700001902841773010502860856008002965852000903045655001203054IND60645153120221119183830.0190523e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064515312DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836188165042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHillman, Aubrey L10aTwo millennia of anthropogenic landscape modification and nutrient loading at Dian Lake, Yunnan Province, China  ap. 505-517.  aLandscapes have been shaped by human activities for millennia and there is a pressing need to characterize pre-industrial impacts in order to mitigate present-day effects. We present the analysis of two sediment cores from Dian Lake in Yunnan, China, which span 4000 years. We compare cores from the northern and southern ends of the lake to investigate spatial variability in natural and anthropogenic environmental changes in this large (300 km²) lake. To document the initiation of human impacts on the landscape and characterize the attendant changes in the lake water and sediment quality, we rely on organic and inorganic geochemical measurements as well as sedimentology and stratigraphy. The character and magnitude of proxy changes are coherent between the two core sites with slight differences in the timing of events. At both core sites, we find definitive evidence for substantial anthropogenic change beginning AD 100 (1850 yr BP), coincident with the introduction of terraced agriculture. Sedimentological shifts are distinctive and characterized by an increase in magnetic susceptibility values and a visible change to red, fine-grained clay. The geochemistry of this sediment suggests that it was sourced from the eastern catchment of the lake and delivered into the basin following intensive agriculture and soil erosion. Anthropogenic impacts intensify after AD 900 through hydrologic modification and cultural eutrophication resulting from increased nutrient loading. This study presents evidence that human-affected landscapes have been present in this region of China for longer than previously believed and that ‘small-scale’ land use change can have measureable impacts on lakes.  aFunding This work was financially supported by the US National Science Foundation (BCS-1357347).

Nozzles types TJ 11004, Albuz ATR 8004 and Arag TFA 11004 were used for application of systemic fungicide Duett Ultra (0.5 l/ha). FHB intensity (%) was determined on the basis of a visual assessment of the number of infected heads and the perecentage of the disease symptoms on the individual head. Differences in grain yield between the treated variants, as well as between the treated and untreated variants, were determined after hand threshing. The lowest percentage of FHB development in wheat and the highest yield were recorded in variants where fungicides were applied by nozzle type ATR 8004. Application technique directly affects the reduction of fusarium head blight in wheat and indirectly it also reduces yield loss.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium head blight 3afungicides 3agrain yield 3ahead 3awheat 0aapplication technique 0afungicide 0afusarium head blight 0awheat 0ayield1 aBagi, Ferenc F.1 aSedlar, Aleksandar D.1 aSavić, Zagorka N.1 aVuković, Slavica M.1 aStojšin, Vera B.1 aGrahovac, Mila S.0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2017, v. 2017, no. 133 p.315-320dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x2406-08287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN1733315S3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01588naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245007400172300001600246506002800262520053600290592002800826506003700854650001600891650001100907650001800918650000900936653001800945653001800963653002400981700002201005700001701027773010301044856008201147852000901229655001201238IND60774447720221207125739.0180913e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077444772DNAL7 a10.31289/biolink.v2i2.8022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewi, Yunesya Elfira10aEfek Bawang Bombay dalam Menurunkan Kadar Gula Darah pada Tikus Putih  ap. 125-131.  aResource is Open Access  aThe research was conducted to observe the effect of Allium cepa L in reducing blood glucose level in white rat (Rattus novergicus).

The sorption process was significantly affected by pH and ionic strength. The maximum adsorption capacity of HA on BsG was approximately 0.9493mgg−1 at pH=6.7 and T=305K, and the thermodynamic parameters indicated that the sorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. The SEM–EDS results indicated the presence of a certain amount of HA on BsG after sorption with HA. The results of FT-IR spectroscopy and the change in pH demonstrated that ligand exchange–surface complexation may be an important mechanism. BET analysis showed that parts of the HA tended to enter the pores formed by close-packing of BsG particles, and albite and muscovite might have played a role in the sorption process, as indicated by the XRD analysis. Overall, it is speculated that the mechanisms governing the sorption behaviors of HA on BsG are precipitation, ligand exchange–surface complexation and electrostatic interaction. Moreover, the colloidal properties of HA under certain conditions may also significantly affect its sorption interactions with BsG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acolloidal properties 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agranite 3ahumic acids 3aionic strength 3aligands 3amuscovite 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aBeishan granite 0aHumic acid 0aSorption interactions 0aGeological disposal 0aRadioactive waste1 aYang, Xiaoyu1 aLi, Chun1 aLiu, Chunli0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Nov. 05, v. 484 p.37-46dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.07.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04625naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245008400214300001200298506007600310520239300386592002802779506003702807650001902844650001002863650000902873650003802882650001702920650001502937650001902952650001102971650002002982650002003002650001703022650002003039650002103059650001903080650001903099650001903118650001803137650001803155650001803173650001103191650001003202650001003212650000903222650001403231650001703245650003203262650001303294700004203307700002503349700002503374700002403399700003703423700003203460700002503492700003003517700002403547700002203571700002403593700002103617700002203638700002503660773009203685856008103777852000903858655001203867IND60555523420221207074245.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055552342DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-015-0962-72doi7 aPMC44947982pmcid7 a261353972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aResende, Nathália M.10aNew insights into the immunopathology of early Toxocara canis infection in mice  ap. 354.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Nematodes of the genus Toxocara are cosmopolitan roundworms frequently found in dogs and cats. Toxocara spp. can accidentally infect humans and cause a zoonosis called human toxocariasis, which is characterized by visceral, ocular or cerebral migration of larval stages of the parasite, without completing its life cycle. In general, chronic nematode infections induce a polarized TH2 immune response. However, during the initial phase of infection, a strong pro-inflammatory response is part of the immunological profile and might determine the outcome and/or pathology of the infection. METHODS: Parasitological aspects and histopathology during larval migration were evaluated after early T. canis experimental infection of BALB/c mice, which were inoculated via the intra-gastric route with a single dose of 1000 fully embryonated eggs. Innate immune responses and systemic cytokine patterns (TH1, TH2, TH17 and regulatory cytokines) were determined at different times after experimental challenge by sandwich ELISA. RESULTS: We found that experimental infection with T. canis induced a mix of innate inflammatory/TH17/TH2 responses during early infection, with a predominance of the latter. The TH2 response was evidenced by significant increases in cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-33, in addition to increasing levels of IL-6 and IL-17. No significant increases were observed for IL-10, TNF-α or IFN-γ levels. In parallel, parasitological analysis clearly revealed the pattern of larval migration through the mouse organs, starting from the liver in the first 24 h of infection, reaching the peak in the lungs on the 3rd day of infection and finally being found numerously in the brain after 5 days of infection. Peripheral leukocytosis, characterized by early neutrophilia and subsequent eosinophilia, was remarkable during early infection. The tissue damage induced by larvae was evidenced by histopathological analysis of the organs at different time points of infection. In all of the affected organs, larval migration induced intense inflammatory infiltrate and hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these new insights into early T. canis infection in mice presented here enabled a better understanding of the immunopathological events that might also occur during human toxocariasis, thus contributing to future strategies of diagnosis and control.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aToxocara canis 3abrain 3aeggs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aeosinophilia 3ahemorrhage 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmunopathology 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-5 3ainterleukin-6 3alarvae 3aliver 3alungs 3amice 3aparasites 3atoxocariasis 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3azoonoses1 aGazzinelli-Guimarães, Pedro Henrique1 aBarbosa, Fernando S.1 aOliveira, Luciana M.1 aNogueira, Denise S.1 aGazzinelli-Guimarães, Ana Clara1 aGonçalves, Marco Túlio P.1 aAmorim, Chiara C.

Here, we present the first ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurement data of Irenebreen, and high-resolution DEM and orthomosaic, obtained from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry. A combination of GPR and UAV data allowed for the reconstruction of the glacier geometry including thermal structure. We compare different methods of GPR signal propagation speed determination and argue that a common midpoint method (CMP) should be used if possible. Our observations reveal that Irenebreen is a polythermal glacier with a basal temperate ice layer, the volume of which volume reaches only 12% of the total glacier volume. We also observe the intense GPR signal scattering in two small zones in the ablation area and suggest that intense water percolation occurs in these places creating local areas of temperate ice. This finding emphasizes the possible formation of localised temperate ice zones in polythermal glaciers due to the coincidence of several factors. Our study demonstrates that a combination of UAV photogrammetry and GPR can be successfully applied and should be used for the high-resolution reconstruction of 3D geometries of small glaciers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3ageometry 3aglaciers 3aground-penetrating radar 3aice 3aphotogrammetry 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aNorway1 aLamsters, Kristaps 1 aJeškins, Jurijs 1 aSobota, Ireneusz 1 aDžeriņš, Pēteris 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 19, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140304563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015600159300002000315520125600335592002801591650001401619650001401633650001901647650001201666650001901678650001901697650002001716650002601736650001701762700001401779700001301793700001201806700001501818700001401833700001701847700001401864700001701878700001701895773012401912856007402036852000902110655001202119IND60618629920221120194931.0181030e20180627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061862992DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra04241a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jianhong10aTAK1 inhibition by natural cyclopeptide RA-V promotes apoptosis and inhibits protective autophagy in Kras-dependent non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells  ap. 23451-23458.  aTAK1 kinase is required for the survival of Kras-dependent non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. Here, we report that the inhibition of TAK1 by a small natural cyclopeptide (RA-V) can promote apoptosis and inhibit protective autophagy in Kras-dependent NSCLC cells. Using short hairpin RNAs to deplete K-Ras, we identified H441 and H358 cells as Kras-dependent NSCLC cells which require protective basal autophagy for cell viability. We found that RA-V could selectively kill and induce apoptosis in H441 and H358 cells but had little effect on A549 and H460 (Kras-independent) cells. Furthermore, RA-V could inhibit basal autophagy in H441 and H358 cells. Mechanistic studies further showed that RA-V inhibits the level of TAK1 phosphorylation by binding directly to TAK1, resulting in the inhibition of the autophagy-related TAK1–AMPK–mTOR pathway. In addition, we found that RA-V could inhibit TAK1–P70S6K interaction, which may also inhibit basal autophagy. Our study shows that RA-V acts as an inducer of apoptosis and inhibitor of autophagy via the inhibition of TAK1 and provides the first example of TAK1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to promote apoptosis and inhibit protective autophagy in Kras-dependent NSCLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell viability 3aenzymes 3alung neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics1 aYang, Tao1 aYan, Wei1 aLi, Dan1 aWang, Fang1 aWang, Zhe1 aGuo, Yingjie1 aBai, Peng1 aTan, Ninghua1 aChen, Lijuan0 tRSC advances.g2018 June 27, v. 8, no. 41 p.23451-23458dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra04241a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04042naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016000159520233500319592002802654650004102682650001802723650001702741650001202758650001902770650001902789650002002808650001602828650002302844650001402867650001302881650001202894650001502906650001902921650002202940650001102962650001102973650001902984650002203003650002403025650002303049650001103072650001803083650001503101651001103116700001903127700002103146700003103167700001903198700001803217700002603235773012003261856007403381852000903455655001203464IND60787900920221116212303.0220811e20220722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078790092DNAL7 a10.3390/w141522882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadora, Damian 10aSimulating the Effects of Agricultural Adaptation Practices onto the Soil Water Content in Future Climate Using SWAT Model on Upland Bystra River Catchment  aThe article presents predicted changes in soil water content in the Bystra river catchment (eastern Poland) for various scenarios of climate change and adaptation practices obtained on the basis of a SWAT model simulation for three regional climate models driven by the global climate model EC-EARTH for the years 2041–2050 and the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 RCP scenarios. Climate scenarios were put against five adaptation scenarios presenting changes in land use and protective measures compared against a zero scenario of BaU (Business as Usual) kept in the future climate. Adaptation scenarios 1–5 are modifications of Scenario 0 (S-0). The 0–5 scenarios’ analysis was based on comparing soil water content and total runoff, sediment yield, actual evapotranspiration. The first adaptation scenario (AS-1) assumes an increase in afforestation on soils from the agricultural suitability complex of soil 6–8 (semi-dry, permanent dry, semi-wet). The second adaptation scenario (AS-2) assumes the creation of a forested buffer for the Bystra River and its tributaries. The third adaptation scenario (AS-3) shows one of the erosion prevention practices, the so-called filter strips. The fourth adaptation scenario (AS-4) assumes the reduction in plowing on arable land. The fifth adaptation scenario (AS-5) involves increasing soil organic carbon to 2%. Simulations revealed that each of the adaptation scenarios 1, 2, 3, 5 does not generally contribute to increasing the water content in soil on BARL (spring crops), CANP (rape), WWHT (winter crops), CRDY (other crops) on arable lands (which together account for over 50% of the catchment area). However, they can contribute to the reduction in sediment yield, total runoff and changes in actual evapotranspiration. The adaptation scenario 4 (AS-4) shows a slight increase in the soil water content on Bystra catchment in the 2041–2050 perspective. Scenario 4 indicated a slight increase in total runoff and a decrease in sediment yield, which in combination with slightly higher water content reflects the protective role of plant residue mulch, lowering the evaporation from the bare soil surface during warm seasons. The no-till adaptation practice had the highest effect in positively affecting water balance at the catchment scale among the adaptation scenarios considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aafforestation 3aarable soils 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aerosion control 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3ahighlands 3aland use 3amulches 3ano-tillage 3aplant residues 3aprotective effect 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asimulation models 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil water content 3aspring 3awater content 3awatersheds 3aPoland1 aWawer, Rafał 1 aNieróbca, Anna 1 aKról-Badziak, Aleksandra 1 aKozyra, Jerzy 1 aJurga, Beata 1 aNowocień, Eugeniusz 0 tWater.g2022 July 22, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141522883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009600171300001400267506002800281520114800309592002801457506003701485650001101522650000901533650001301542650002201555650001601577650001401593650002401607650001501631650001501646650001601661651001401677653002201691653003201713653002501745700002001770700001301790700002501803700003101828700002001859773015801879856008402037852000902121655001202130IND60774962420221207123509.0200708e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077496242DNAL7 a10.20961/stjssa.v17i1.384592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidiarso, Bambang10aPredicting peatland groundwater table and soil moisture dynamics affected by drainage level  ap. 42-49.  aResource is Open Access  aExcessive drainage of peatlands can cause subsidence and irreversible drying; therefore, it is necessary to predict groundwater levels in peatlands to ensure adequate water for crops and control excessive water loss simultaneously. This study aimed to predict the peatland groundwater level and soil moisture affected by drainage. This research was conducted in a peatland located in Rasau Jaya Umum, Kubu Raya Regency, West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia from February to December 2016. Three treatments of drainage setting were established with maize cropping: without drainage (P0) and drainage channel with water level maintained at depths of 30 cm (P1) and 60 cm (P2) from the soil surface. The results indicated that a polynomial regression model is a good approach to predicting groundwater table level and soil moisture in peatlands, with R2 values ranging 0.71-0.96 and 0.65-0.93, respectively. For agricultural purposes, maintaining the water level at 30 cm from the soil surface in the drainage channel appears to be the ideal level as adequate soil moisture is provided for annual cash crops and drying is prevented simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3acorn 3adrainage 3adrainage channels 3agroundwater 3apeatlands 3aregression analysis 3asoil water 3asubsidence 3awater table 3aIndonesia 0apeatland drainage 0apeatland evapotranspiration 0apeatland groundwater1 aMinardi, Slamet1 aKomariah1 aChandra, Tino Orciny1 aElmahdi, Mohamed Abdesalam1 aSenge, Masateru0 tSains Tanah: Jurnal Penelitian Ilmu Tanah dan Agroklimatologi.g2020 June, v. 17, no. 1 p.42-49dSebelas Maret UniversitywJournal:27757x2356-14247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20961/stjssa.v17i1.384593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013900164300001600303520178700319592002802106650004402134650001902178650001202197650001302209650001602222650002102238650000902259650001902268650001102287650003702298650001602335650001502351650001402366650001402380650001502394650000902409650001602418650000902434651001002443700003302453700001802486700001902504773010802523856008202631852000902713655001202722IND60085269720221118231032.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008526972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2012.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaal, Joeri10aMolecular characterization of Ulex europaeus biochar obtained from laboratory heat treatment experiments – A pyrolysis–GC/MS study  ap. 205-212.  aGorse species (Ulex sp.) are ubiquitous in the shrublands of NW Spain and have the potential to become key players in an integral biofuel/biochar program in NW Spain. Here we present molecular characterization (using pyrolysis–GC/MS) of a biochar “thermosequence” obtained by laboratory heating of Ulex europaeus wood in a muffle furnace between 200 and 600°C (TCHAR). Low temperature chars (TCHAR≤350°C) produced significant amounts of pyrolysis products of which the precursor biopolymer could be recognized, while high-temperature chars (TCHAR≥400°C) produced mainly phenols and monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are not specific for any biopolymer. Carbohydrate could hardly be recognized at TCHAR≥350°C. The thermal rearrangement of polyphenols, mainly lignin, was reflected in more detail (1) C₃-side chain shortening and probably depolymerization (TCHAR 200–350°C), (2) demethoxylation of syringyl and probably also some guaiacyl lignin (TCHAR 300–400°C), (3) elimination of virtually all remaining methoxyl groups (TCHAR 350–400°C), through dehydroxylation and demethoxylation, (4) almost complete dehydroxylation of lignin and other biopolymers (TCHAR 400–500°C), (5) progressive condensation into polyaromatic structures (TCHAR 300–500°C) and (6) partial elimination of alkyl bridges between (poly)aromatic moieties (TCHAR 450–500°C). These results were supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the same samples. We conclude that pyrolysis–GC/MS can be used as a rapid molecular screening method of gorse-derived biochar. Molecular properties elucidation is an essential part of predicting the stability and agronomical behavior of gorse-derived biochar after future implementation in soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aUlex europaeus 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abiopolymers 3adepolymerization 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3alignin 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolyphenols 3aprediction 3apyrolysis 3ascreening 3ashrublands 3asoil 3atemperature 3awood 3aSpain1 aMartínez Cortizas, Antonio,1 aReyes, Otilia1 aSoliño, Mario0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2012 May, v. 95 p.205-212dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2012.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009400171300001600265520175700281592002802038653001102066653003202077653001202109653001702121653001402138700002002152700002802172700002002200700002402220773013002244856008302374852000902457655001202466IND60554037720221121232806.0161023e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055403772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejmhg.2015.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHastuti, Pramudji10aPolymorphism in leptin receptor gene was associated with obesity in Yogyakarta, Indonesia  ap. 271-276.  aLeptin is a hormone that regulates homeostasis energy through the central–peripheral mechanism as well as regulates hunger and satiety. Leptin receptor is important in leptin signal transduction that is located mainly in the hypothalamus. The mutation in leptin receptor (LEPR) gene causes splicing abnormality that resulted in truncated receptor, aberrant signal transduction, leptin resistance, and obesity.This study aims to determine the association of LEPR gene polymorphisms, rs1137100 and rs1137101, on phenotype and leptin level between obese and control groups in Yogyakarta population.We examined two polymorphisms of LEPR gene, rs1137100 (K109R) and rs1137101 (Q223R) in 110 subjects consisting of 55 obese and 55 healthy adult subjects as controls from Yogyakarta. A correlation study was done between body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and leptin level with their genotypes. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test to show the significant difference between the groups. SNPs of LEPR gene for obese and control groups were compared using chi-square analysis.Body mass index, waist circumference and leptin level in obese group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The frequency of R103R homozygote in obese group was higher than in the control group, whereas Q223Q homozygote in obese group was lower than in the control group. Polymorphism of rs1137100 (K109R) and rs1137101 (Q223R) were associated with obesity and leptin level.In Yogyakarta population, polymorphisms of rs1137100 (K109R) and rs1137101 (Q223R) LEPR gene are associated with obesity. Thus further study on another Indonesian ethnic population is required to investigate the variation in LEPR gene.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLeptin 0aLeptin receptor (LEPR) gene 0aObesity 0aPolymorphism 0aPhenotype1 aZukhrufia, Izza1 aPadwaswari, Made Harumi1 aNuraini, Afifah1 aSadewa, Ahmad Hamim0 tEgyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics.g2016 July, v. 17 p.271-276dElsevier B.V.aAin Shams Universityx1110-86307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmhg.2015.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008900168300001800257520151100275592002801786650001801814650002501832650001401857650001601871650002401887650001301911650001601924650002301940650001501963650001001978650001601988650002302004650001502027650001302042650002202055650002202077650001402099650001102113650001502124650000902139650001802148650002002166650001202186650001202198651001802210700002502228700001702253700002202270773011402292856008402406852000902490655001202499IND60549047220221121073013.0160906e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054904722DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-02-12-0211-FE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranke, Leah L.10aAdvances in Research on Phytophthora capsici on Vegetable Crops in The United States  ap. 1588-1600.  aSince L. H. Leonian's first description of Phytophthora capsici as a pathogen of chile pepper in 1922, we have made many advances in our understanding of this pathogen's biology, host range, dissemination, and management. P. capsici causes foliar blighting, damping-off, wilting, and root, stem, and fruit rot of susceptible hosts, and economic losses are experienced annually in vegetable crops including cucurbits and peppers. Symptoms of P. capsici infection may manifest as stunting, girdling, or cankers for some cultivars or crops that are less susceptible. P. capsici continues to be a constraint on production, and implementation of an aggressive integrated management scheme can still result in insufficient control when weather is favorable for disease. Management of diseases caused by P. capsici is currently limited by the long-term survival of the pathogen as oospores in the soil, a wide host range, long-distance movement of the pathogen in surface water used for irrigation, the presence of fungicide-resistant pathogen populations, and a lack of commercially acceptable resistant host varieties. P. capsici can infect a wide range of hosts under laboratory and greenhouse conditions including cultivated crops, ornamentals, and native plants belonging to diverse plant families. As our understanding of P. capsici continues to grow, future research should focus on developing novel and effective solutions to manage this pathogen and prevent economic losses due to the diseases it causes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbitaceae 3aPhytophthora capsici 3acultivars 3adamping off 3afinancial economics 3agirdling 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ahot peppers 3aindigenous species 3airrigation 3aoospores 3aornamental plants 3apathogen survival 3apathogens 3apepper 3aplant rots 3asoil 3asurface water 3avegetable crops 3aweather 3awilting 3aUnited States1 aQuesada-Ocampo, Lina1 aLamour, Kurt1 aHausbeck, Mary K.0 tPlant disease.g2012 Nov., v. 96, no. 11 p.1588-1600dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPDIS-02-12-0211-FE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245011800162300001400280506002800294520151700322592002801839506003701867650002001904650001301924650001501937650001501952650000901967650001401976650001601990650001402006650001702020650001002037651001402047653001502061653001402076653000902090653001002099700002802109700002002137700002602157773010902183856007602292852000902368655001202377IND60774447920221207125729.0190821e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077444792DNAL7 a10.22146/ipas.366802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWulandari, Putri10aGrowth and Yield Response of Maize (Zea mays L.) on Acid Soil to Different Rates of Humic Acid and NPK Fertilizer  ap. 76-84.  aResource is Open Access  aThe main constraint in the extensification of maize on the dry land of acid soil is the low availability of P in soil. This study aimed to determine the effect and the optimal dose of humic acid on the growth and yield of maize on acid soil. This research was conducted from February to May 2017 at Tri Dharma Field Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Gadjah Mada University. Acid soil with low P availability used was from sub-district Cigudeg and Jasinga, West Java. The research was arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 2 factors. The first factor was maize cultivar, namely Bisi 2 and Pioneer 35. The second factor was the rate of humic acid and NPK fertilizer, consisting of 0 kg.ha-1 (without) NPK and 0% (without) humic acid, NPK + 0% (without) humic acid, NPK + 5% humic acid, NPK + 10% humic acid, and NPK + 15% humic acid. NPK fertilizer applied was NPK 16:16:16 at a dose of 350 kg.ha-1. The results showed that humic acid application on acid soil increased C-humic content in the soil, soil P availability, total dry weight of the plant, and kernel dry weight at harvest (15 weeks after planting). The increase in soil P availability did not improve the plant growth but increased the accumulation of plant biomass. The application of humic acid at 15% (52.5 kg.ha-1) combined with NPK fertilizer on acid soil significantly increased total dry weight of plant and kernel dry weight up to 13.14% and 21.81%, respectively, thus, it is recommended for maize cultivation on acid soil.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNPK fertilizers 3aZea mays 3aacid soils 3aarid lands 3acorn 3acultivars 3ahumic acids 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aseeds 3aIndonesia 0aHumic acid 0aacid soil 0acorn 0amaize1 aSulistyaningsih, Endang1 aHandayani, Suci1 aPurwanto, Benito Heru0 tIlmu pertanian.g2019 Aug., v. 4, no. 2 p.76-84dUniversitas Gadjah MadawJournal:22161x2527-71627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22146/ipas.366803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009700172300001600269500001500285520085800300592002801158650001101186650002201197650002401219650001901243650001501262650001701277650001501294653001301309653001301322653000901335653001501344653001501359653001401374700002001388700002101408700001601429700001601445700001701461773013401478856008601612852000901698655001201707IND60552903520221121233636.0170607e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055290352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.07.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomer, Vijay K.10aOne pot synthesis of mesoporous ZnO–SiO2 nanocomposite as high performance humidity sensor  ap. 121-128.  a2019-12-06  aIn this work, we report a facile synthesis of ZnO loaded mesoporous silica nanocomposite for detecting relative humidity (RH) at room temperature. ZnO was loaded into mesoporous silica using ex situ and in situ loading processes. Response of the nanocomposite sensors synthesized using different loading process were investigated by exposing them to humid environments in wide range of 11–98%RH at 25°C. The sensor utilizing in situ loading process exhibits a ∼5 orders impedance change along with excellent linearity, quick response time, rapid recovery time, negligible hysteresis, good repeatability and stability. AC nyquist plots of the sensor at different RHs were analyzed to understand the humidity-sensing mechanism. Our study can open a new way for realizing ZnO–SiO2 hybrid nanocomposite for fabrication of high performance RH sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3asilica 3arelative humidity 3aambient temperature 3ananocomposites 3azinc oxide 3aporous media 3ahysteresis 0aResponse 0aHumidity 0aSiO2 0aZinc oxide 0aMesoporous 0aimpedance1 aDuhan, Surender1 aSharma, Ashok K.1 aMalik, Ritu1 aNehra, S.P.1 aDevi, Sunita0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Oct. 20, v. 483 p.121-128dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.07.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011000161300001400271520088800285592002801173650001301201650001601214650001701230650001401247650001601261650000901277650001201286650001201298650001701310650001101327650001101338650001201349650002401361651001101385653003401396653001301430653002801443653002701471653002501498653001101523700002501534700002601559700002101585700002101606773015101627856007601778852000901854655001201863IND60125538820221120191945.0151104e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012553882DNAL7 a10.2744/CCB-1005.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFamelli, Shirley10aReproductive Biology of the Freshwater Turtle Hydromedusa maximiliani (Chelidae) from Southeastern Brazil  ap. 81-88.  aHydromedusa maximiliani is a freshwater turtle endemic to the mountainous regions of the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. Using X-rays techniques, we provide the first substantial records of the species' reproductive biology in the wild. Twenty-six of 42 X-rayed females from 2007 to 2009 were ovigerous between September and December and 9 had eggs each year during the 3-yr period. Clutch size varied from 1 to 3, with 55% of females having 2 eggs. The smallest reproductive female was 100.2 mm in plastron length, corresponding to an age of about 13 yrs old. Significant positive correlation was verified between female body size and both egg size and clutch volume. Nesting was inferred to occur from late spring to early summer (November and December). These findings are important for management programs since this vulnerable species inhabits a threatened biodiversity hotspot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelidae 3aX-radiation 3abiodiversity 3abody size 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3afemales 3anesting 3arain forests 3aspring 3asummer 3aturtles 3awildlife management 3aBrazil 0aBrazilian Atlantic rainforest 0aChelidae 0aHydromedusa maximiliani 0areproductive allometry 0areproductive biology 0aX-rays1 aAdriano, Leonardo R.1 aPinheiro, Sarah C.

Due to low biodiversity, species distribution patterns and richness are infrequently investigated in arid lands. Here, we take the Xinjiang Urgur Autonomous Region (Province), a large area in arid northwest China, as a case to investigate the patterns of woody species diversity and their relationship to environmental factors. At the same time, we aim to evaluate the current protected areas network and improve conservation planning based on woody plant diversity of Xinjiang. In this study, we sampled 133 woody forest species and 220 woody xerophytic species, which are about 10% of the plant species and near 80% of woody species in this region, and modeled current and last glacial maximum (LGM) distributions of these species using the method of species distribution modeling (SDM). Based on the results of SDMs, species richness and LGM refugia were estimated for forest and xerophytic species. Then, we assessed correlations between current species richness and environmental variables as well as glacial refugia. Finally, we applied the digital approach of systematic conservation planning to determine priority areas based on patterns of species diversity. Precipitation variables and glacial refugia have influenced the distribution patterns of woody species diversity for forest and xerophytic species in this province. In our proposed network for biodiversity conservation, high priority areas mostly coincided with zones having low species diversity, and many of these concerned areas fall outside of the ranges of the current existing conservation network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abiogeography 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3amodels 3aplanning 3arefuge habitats 3aspecies diversity 3awoody plants 3aChina 0aXinjiang 0aSpecies distribution modeling 0aSpecies diversity 0aPrecipitation 0aGlacial refugia 0aSystematic conservation planning1 aZhang, Ming-Li0 tBiological conservation.g2014 Sept., v. 177 p.165-173dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012100172500001900293520101200312592002801324650001901352650001901371650002501390650001401415650002101429650001101450650001901461650002001480650001501500650001601515653001601531653001601547653001501563653001201578653000801590700001701598700001501615700001801630700001401648700001301662700001701675700001201692700002001704700001101724773011901735856009001854852000901944655001201953IND60720044420221120050604.0210124e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072004442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2020.1114302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Mingyi14aThe chemical composition and potential role of epicuticular and intracuticular wax in four cultivars of table grapes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlant cuticular wax is the first barrier to resist biotic and abiotic stress. However, little is known about the compositional differences between the epicuticular and intracuticular wax in grape berry. The compositional, morphological and functional features of cuticular wax in grape berries of Vitis vinifera cv. ‘Kyoho’, ‘Muscat Hamburg’, ‘Redglobe’, and ‘Zuijinxiang’ were investigated. The total and epicuticular wax of four berries were mainly composed of terpenoids, hydrocarbons, alcohols, fatty acids and esters. Oleanolic acid was the most abundant terpenoid among the four cultivars. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the crystalline flakes structure of the cuticular wax. Additionally, the removal of epicuticular wax accelerated the weight loss, browning, and softening of grape berries, indicating the plastic-wrap-like effect of the cuticular wax on postharvest quality. This study provided the theoretical basis for further application of the fruit wax or waxy analogue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aabiotic stress 3achemical composition 3acultivars 3aepicuticular wax 3afruits 3aoleanolic acid 3astorage quality 3atechnology 3aweight loss 0aGrape berry 0aComposition 0aMorphology 0aGC–MS 0aSEM1 aLuo, Zisheng1 aGao, Sunan1 aBelwal, Tarun1 aWang, Lei1 aQi, Ming1 aBan, Zhaojun1 aWu, Bin1 aWang, Fengzhong1 aLi, Li0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2021 Mar., v. 173 p.111430-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2020.1114303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245008900173300001600262500002000278520111700298592002801415650002501443650001301468650002201481650002101503650002001524650001401544650001601558650001301574650001401587650001501601650001301616650001301629700003401642700002701676700002701703700003301730773015101763856007801914852000901992655001202001IND60595580720180705000000.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059558072DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2017004132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira Barreto, Rafael10aAccompanying ions of ammonium sources and nitrate : ammonium ratios in tomato plants  ap. 382-387.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cultivar Micro‐Tom (MT) is widely used in physiological studies, but the effects of nitrate (NO3 -) and ammonium (NH4 +) ratios (NO3 - : NH4 + ratios) and, in particular, the effects of the accompanying ions in NH4 + sources are unknown. To determine whether the accompanying ions in NH4 + sources influence NH4 + toxicity, the effects of NO3 - : NH4 + ratios on the physiology, electrolyte leakage index, nutrition, and dry weight were studied using hydroponics. The NH4 + sources were ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) or ammonium sulfate [(NH₄)₂SO₄], and five NO3 - : NH4 + ratios were used: 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100. The NO3 - source was calcium nitrate [Ca(NO₃)₂], and the nitrogen (N) concentration was 15 mmol L⁻¹. The results indicate that NH₄Cl or (NH₄)₂SO₄ can be used in studies on NH4 + toxicity because the accompanying ions did not influence the tomato plants. In addition, NO3 - : NH4 + ratios of 100 : 0 and 75 : 25 resulted in the highest dry weight of tomato plants, whereas ratios of 25 : 75 or 0 : 100 were toxic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aammonium 3aammonium chloride 3aammonium sulfate 3acalcium nitrate 3acultivars 3ahydroponics 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aphysiology 3atomatoes 3atoxicity1 aRodrigues Cruz, Flávio José1 aAparecido Gaion, Lucas1 ade Mello Prado, Renato1 aFalleiros Carvalho, Rogério0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2018 June, v. 181, no. 3 p.382-387dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2017004133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009600169300001600265520083100281592002801112650004401140650002501184650002501209650004301234650002101277650004401298650001301342650002401355650002001379650002101399650002201420650001001442650001101452650001001463653001501473653001801488653003201506653003201538700001901570700004801589700001501637700001501652700001801667700001801685700001901703700001501722773010801737856008601845852000901931655001201940IND60558438920221117211931.0190318e20170120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055843892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xianhai10aCharacterization of hemicelluloses from Neolamarckia cadamba (Rubiaceae) during xylogenesis  ap. 333-339.  aIn this study, hemicelluloses were isolated from the apical, middle and basal segments of N. cadamba using a 2N KOH extraction procedure. Chemical composition and structural characterization of the three hemicellulosic fractions obtained were comparatively investigated by a combination of HPLC, GPC, FTIR, 1H,13C, HSQC NMR and TGA techniques. According to the sugar analysis and spectral results, (4-O-methyl) glucuronoxylan was the primary hemicellulose identified in the samples with trace levels of mannan also present. All of the three samples showed spherical polymers in 0.005M sodium phosphate solution (containing 0.02N NaCl). Xylan in the middle and basal segment stems had higher molecular weights. Our findings show that during xylogenesis in N. cadamba, changes are observed in xylan content and molecular weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aNeolamarckia cadamba 3achemical composition 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3apotassium hydroxide 3asodium chloride 3asodium phosphate 3aspectral analysis 3astems 3asugars 3axylan 0aN. cadamba 0aHemicellulose 0a(4-O-methyl) glucuronoxylan 0aStructural characterization1 aTong, Tingting1 aLi, Brenda W.

In pathological and cellular models, the appearance of protein-rich inclusions in cells acts as a read out of protein aggregation. The precise organization of aggregated protein in these inclusions and their mode of growth are still poorly understood. Here, fluorescence anisotropy-based measurements have been used to probe protein packing across inclusions of varying brightness, formed by an monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP)-tagged polyglutamine model peptide in cells. High-resolution, confocal-based steady-state anisotropy measurements report a large depolarization, consistent with extensive homo-Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the sequestered mEGFP-tagged protein molecules. An inverse correlation of fluorescence anisotropy with intensity is seen across inclusions, which becomes emphasized when the observed fluorescence anisotropy values of inclusions are corrected for the fluorescence contribution of the diffusible protein, present within and around smaller inclusions. Homo-FRET becomes enhanced as inclusion size increases. This enhancement is confirmed by two-photon excitation-based time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements, which also suggest that the mEGFP-tagged protein molecules are arranged in multiple ways within inclusions. Bright inclusions display faster FRET rates with a larger number of mEGFP moieties participating in homo-FRET than faint inclusions do. These results are consistent with a model in which the protein is more closely packed in the brighter inclusions. In such a possible mechanism, the higher packing density of protein molecules in brighter inclusions would suggest that inclusion growth could involve an intermolecular compaction event within the inclusion, as more monomers and aggregates are recruited into the growing inclusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amodels 3aneurodegenerative diseases1 aPanicker, Mitradas M.1 aUdgaonkar, Jayant B.0 tBiochemistry.g2014 June 10, v. 53, no. 22 p.3621-3636dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi500383h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03877naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003700132024001100169040001800180100002200198245007600220300001800296500000900314506017300323520170300496592002802199650001602227650001702243650001202260650001702272650001402289650002602303650002302329650001402352650002202366650001802388650001202406650001902418650003502437650001302472650001602485651001802501700002302519700002102542700002102563700002302584700002102607700002302628700002002651700002302671773013302694856011202827856008402939956011203023956011003135961000903245852000903254655001203263IND60006186220221214224709.0191122e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000618622DNAL7 a3027292aris7 a10113/618622hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2014.03.01892doi8 ans8923  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkpertey, Abraham10aEffects of Selective Genetic Introgression from Wild Soybean to Soybean  ap. 2683-2695.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] breeding in the United States currently relies on a narrow genetic base. For decades, but more intensely in recent years, efforts have been made to incorporate exotic soybean germplasm into the breeding pool. Although wild soybean (G. soja Seib. and Zucc.) is genetically much more diverse than soybean, much less effort has been devoted to utilizing wild soybean in soybean breeding. The objectives of this research were to identify high-yielding lines derived from crosses between five wild soybean accessions and soybean cultivars and determine if there are differences in the genetic contributions of each wild soybean parent. Each wild soybean was crossed to Williams 82, and the F₁ plants were backcrossed to Williams 82 to create the backcross generation (BC₁) lines. The BC₂ parent lines were developed through family selection and backcrossed to Williams 82, IA2052, IA3023, or LN97–15076. Family selection beginning in the F₂ generation was used to develop lines from plant introduction (PI) 507807 and PI 549046. The lines from PI 479767 and PI 483461 were selected by early generation testing through yield testing F₂ lines in the F₃ and F₄ generations. The lines derived from PI 65549 were developed from a single seed descent (SSD) population. Field evaluation of the derived lines identified lines that are not significantly different from their recurrent parents. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we found unique contributions being made by the G. soja parents. Despite intense selection pressure to recover good agronomic types, an average of 13% of SNP alleles in the derived lines came from the G. soja parents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aGlycine soja 3aalleles 3abackcrossing 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3agenetic background 3agermplasm 3aintroduced plants 3aintrogression 3aparents 3aplant breeding 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoybeans 3awild plants 3aUnited States1 aBelaffif, Mohammad1 aGraef, George L.1 aRouf Mian, M.

In many regions of southern Africa, so-called waste stabilisation ponds (WSP) represent a widespread method of sewage disposal. Since capacity bottlenecks lead to overflowing ponds and contamination, a concept was designed and piloted in order to upgrade a plant and reuse water in agriculture. Using a social–ecological impact assessment (SEIA), the aim of this study was to identify and evaluate intended and unintended impacts of the upgrading of an existing WSP to reuse water for livestock fodder production. For this purpose, semistructured expert interviews were conducted. In addition, a scenario analysis was carried out regarding a sustainable operation of the water reuse system. The evaluation of the impacts has shown that intended positive impacts clearly outweigh the unintended ones. The scenario analysis revealed the consequences of an inadequate management of the system and low fodder demand. Furthermore, the analysis showed that good management of such a system is of fundamental importance in order to operate the facility, protect nature and assist people. This allows subsequent studies to minimize negative impacts and replicate the concept in regions with similar conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforage 3airrigation 3alivestock 3apeople 3asewage 3awater 3awater reuse 3awater supply 3aNamibia1 aNeu, Felix 0 tWater.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141523813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245011400174300002000288520112700308592002801435650001401463650002301477650002101500650001001521650001301531650001101544650001501555650001501570650001301585650001701598650001301615650002101628700001901649773012401668856007401792852000901866655001201875IND60640821020221122220229.0190505e20160623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064082102DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra09525a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukthar Ali, S.

The method yields a highly crystalline, high surface area N-TiO₂ of pure anatase nature and is attributed to the use of organic solvents alone. The N-TiO₂ exhibited higher visible light (>400 nm) catalytic activity (∼50% increase) in the photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) compared to that of the commercial P25. Annealed N-TiO₂ (aN-TiO₂) showed a ∼70% increase in the visible light degradation of RhB and nearly 100% increase in transient photocurrent density to that of P25. The improvement in the visible light photoactivity of N-TiO₂ and aN-TiO₂ is assigned mainly to the improved visible light response because of the narrowed the band gap by introducing intra-band electronic states and reduced charge transfer resistance and the comparatively better performance of aN-TiO₂ is assigned to the additional Ti³⁺ defect states caused by oxygen vacancies formed during annealing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric current 3alight 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotolysis 3arhodamines 3asolvents 3asurface area 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide1 aK.

To accomplish the extraction of plastic-derived xenoestrogens from environmental samples, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have been proved to be selective, efficient, and reliable sorbents. Despite some problems associated with the use of MIPs as sorbents, these have been found to be of considerable interest due to their advantages of selectivity, easy synthetic procedures, and better stability over commercially available solid sorbents. Modifications in their synthetic strategies are continuously in progress and new approaches are being made through graphene oxide substrates, nanostructured platforms, nanoferrites, cryogels, and co-electropolymerization to design better sorbents. Apart from this, efforts to create molecularly imprinted solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers have also been successful in improving the efficiency of the methodology. In future, the use of MIPs developed from advanced synthetic strategies, or as sorbents for more robust techniques like SPME and microextraction on packed sorbents, will add new horizons to explore the potential of MIPs in the field of plastic-derived xenoestrogens. This review presents various challenges, as well as progress and prospects associated with the extraction of plastic-derived phthalates and phenolic compounds using molecularly imprinted sorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3achromatography 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3amolecular imprinting 3amonitoring 3aphenolic compounds 3aphthalates 3apolymers 3asolid phase microextraction 3awildlife 3axenoestrogens1 aSingh, Raghubir1 aKaur, Varinder1 aMalik, Ashok Kumar0 tChromatographia.g2014 Feb., v. 77, no. 3-4 p.207-221dSpringer-Verlagx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-013-2596-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009800168300001600266520138300282592002801665653002001693653002101713653001801734653001501752700001901767700002401786773013001810856008301940852000902023655001202032IND60554038020221122050504.0161023e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055403802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejmhg.2016.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Pradeep10aPrevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in India: An updated meta-analysis  ap. 295-302.  aGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a house keeping enzyme which catalyzes the first step in the hexose monophosphate pathway of glucose metabolism. G6PD deficiency is the commonest hemolytic X-linked genetic disease, which affects approximately 400million people worldwide. The prevalence rate of G6PD deficiency varies worldwide with a higher prevalence in malarial endemic population. In India several studies were published and reported with varying incidences of this disease in different populations.The aim of the present study was to assess the overall frequency of G6PD deficiency in the Indian population using meta-analysis.PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Springer Link databases were searched for studies that investigated G6PD deficiency in Indian population. If any author studied different sub-populations we treated the study as an independent study.A total of 72 studies with a total sample size of 38,565 and 2,623 G6PD deficient subjects were included in the present meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed in both fixed and random effect models. Meta-analysis with random model showed an overall prevalence proportion as 0.085 (95% CI=0.070–0.103; p=0.000; tau=0.826; I2=0.486; Cochran Q=0.999).In conclusion the present meta-analysis confirms the overall magnitude of the frequency of G6PD deficiency (8.5%) in the Indian population.  aPublisher supplied data 0aG6PD deficiency 0aHemolytic anemia 0aMeta-analysis 0aPrevalence1 aYadav, Upendra1 aRai, V.q(Vandana),0 tEgyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics.g2016 July, v. 17 p.295-302dElsevier B.V.aAin Shams Universityx1110-86307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmhg.2016.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003100141245013200172500001400304520183400318592002802152650001302180650002302193650001502216650000902231650002802240650002902268650001202297650001102309650001102320650001402331650001602345650001602361650001502377650001102392650001402403650001502417650003002432650000902462650001702471650001202488650001202500650001502512650001502527651001602542700001802558773016102576856007502737852000902812655001202821IND60715281320221121045245.0201026e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071528132DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi91005692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPradhan, Ananta  Man Singh10aRainfall-Induced Shallow Landslide Susceptibility Mapping at Two Adjacent Catchments Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms  aNAL-light  aLandslides impact on human activities and socio-economic development, especially in mountainous areas. This study focuses on the comparison of the prediction capability of advanced machine learning techniques for the rainfall-induced shallow landslide susceptibility of Deokjeokri catchment and Karisanri catchment in South Korea. The influencing factors for landslides, i.e., topographic, hydrologic, soil, forest, and geologic factors, are prepared from various sources based on availability, and a multicollinearity test is also performed to select relevant causative factors. The landslide inventory maps of both catchments are obtained from historical information, aerial photographs and performed field surveys. In this study, Deokjeokri catchment is considered as a training area and Karisanri catchment as a testing area. The landslide inventories contain 748 landslide points in training and 219 points in testing areas. Three landslide susceptibility maps using machine learning models, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Deep Neural Network (DNN), are prepared and compared. The outcomes of the analyses are validated using the landslide inventory data. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) method is used to verify the results of the models. The results of this study show that the training accuracy of RF is 0.756 and the testing accuracy is 0.703. Similarly, the training accuracy of XGBoost is 0.757 and testing accuracy is 0.74. The prediction of DNN revealed acceptable agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing landslides, with a training accuracy of 0.855 and testing accuracy of 0.802. The results showed that the DNN model achieved lower prediction error and higher accuracy results than other models for shallow landslide modeling in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aaerial photography 3aalgorithms 3aarea 3aartificial intelligence 3adecision support systems 3aforests 3agraphs 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3ainformation 3ainventories 3alandslides 3amodels 3amountains 3aprediction 3asocioeconomic development 3asoil 3aspatial data 3asurveys 3atesting 3atopography 3awatersheds 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Yun-Tae 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 Sept. 29, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi91005693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245011600213300001600329520091000345592002801255650002301283650002001306650001901326650001001345650001701355650001101372650001501383650001801398650002801416650001401444653001101458653000801469653000901477653001401486653000801500653000801508653000801516653001601524653002101540653002101561653002101582653001801603653003601621700002001657700002601677700006501703773010401768856008501872852000901957655001201966IND60621676220221119192716.0190129e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062167622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2018.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristou, Anastasis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6249-964210aCan the pharmaceutically active compounds released in agroecosystems be considered as emerging plant stressors?  ap. 360-364.  aPharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) entering agroecosystems as a result of various human activities may be taken up by and accumulated within crop plants, with potential human health implications. Despite their extensive metabolism by a sophisticated enzyme-based detoxification system in plant cells, PhACs and their transformation products (TPs) may result in adverse effects on plants' physiology. PhACs–mediated phytotoxic effects, as well as plants' defense responses have been depicted on plants exposed to individual or low number of PhACs under controlled conditions. We highlight the need to consider the cocktails effects and synergistic interactions of PhACs present in mixtures in actual agroecosystems, towards phytotoxicity and agricultural sustainability in general. Considering PhACs as emerging plant stressors will better facilitate the understanding of their phytotoxic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aadverse effects 3aagroecosystems 3acrops 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3aphytotoxicity 3asustainable agriculture 3asynergism 0aCytcOx 0aDow 0aGSTs 0aH+-ATPase 0aKoc 0aRWW 0aTPs 0aAntibiotics 0aCocktail effects 0aOxidative stress 0aPlant physiology 0aPhytotoxicity 0aReclaimed wastewater irrigation1 aMichael, Costas1 aFatta-Kassinos, Despo1 aFotopoulos, Vasileios1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1205-20700 tEnvironment international.g2018 May, v. 114 p.360-364dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011600166300001800282520135100300592002801651650001801679650001801697650001401715650001501729650002001744653002801764653002701792653001801819653002501837653001601862653001701878653002901895700005801924773012801982856008302110852000902193655001202202IND60717441520221117004059.0211219s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071744152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoll, Philipp10aHistory and Evolution of Modeling in Biotechnology: Modeling & Simulation, Application and Hardware Performance  ap. 3309-3323.  aBiological systems are typically composed of highly interconnected subunits and possess an inherent complexity that make monitoring, control and optimization of a bioprocess a challenging task. Today a toolset of modeling techniques can provide guidance in understanding complexity and in meeting those challenges. Over the last four decades, computational performance increased exponentially. This increase in hardware capacity allowed ever more detailed and computationally intensive models approaching a “one-to-one” representation of the biological reality. Fueled by governmental guidelines like the PAT initiative of the FDA, novel soft sensors and techniques were developed in the past to ensure product quality and provide data in real time. The estimation of current process state and prediction of future process course eventually enabled dynamic process control. In this review, past, present and envisioned future of models in biotechnology are compared and discussed with regard to application in process monitoring, control and optimization. In addition, hardware requirements and availability to fit the needs of increasingly more complex models are summarized. The major techniques and diverse approaches of modeling in industrial biotechnology are compared, and current as well as future trends and perspectives are outlined.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioprocessing 3abiotechnology 3aevolution 3aprediction 3aproduct quality 0aModeling & optimization 0aBioprocess engineering 0aBiotechnology 0aHardware development 0aSoft sensor 0aIndustry 4.0 0aAdvanced process control1 aHenkel, Marius1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5343-96610 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.3309-3323dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010900169520167800278592002801956650001201984650001301996650001002009650001202019650002202031650001302053650001802066650001302084650003102097650001402128650000902142650001702151650001202168650001202180650001302192650001402205650002402219650001802243650002402261650001902285650001302304650002302317650001802340653001202358653001402370653001402384653001802398653002002416773012202436856008302558961001302641852000902654655001202663IND60696105420221120083454.0200626e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069610542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1016572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Hong-sik,12aA critical review on structures, health effects, oxidative stability, and sensory properties of oleogels  aOleogels developed for foods are typically composed of a vegetable oil and a food-grade oleogelator or a combination of multiple oleogelators. During the last decade, the interest in the oleogel technology has dramatically increased due to the concern of the negative health effects of trans and saturated fats used in foods. Oleogels have been recognized as very promising alternatives to trans and saturated fats although none of them are yet used on a commercial basis. This is because oleogel technology is relatively new to the food industry. Fundamental studies have been conducted to understand gelation phenomena, crystal structures of oleogelators and networks of crystals that affect physical properties of oleogels. Recently, studies on their practical application in foods have also been conducted. Oleogels were incorporated in real foods such as cakes, muffins, biscuits, sausages, burgers, instant fried noodles, peanut butters, and many other food products. Furthermore, efforts have been made to enhance the gelation ability of an oleogelator by adding another oleogelator or an additive. It has been recognized that sensory properties and oxidative stability of oleogel-containing foods are critical to the practical application of the oleogel technology in foods. These properties have been evaluated for spreads, margarine, cookies, sausages, meat patties, and meat batters. Although some studies found that oleogels had positive or negligible negative effects on sensory and oxidation properties, some studies found that further studies were needed to achieve satisfactory sensory properties and oxidative stability of oleogel-containing food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatters 3abiscuits 3acakes 3acookies 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3afood industry 3agelation 3ahealth effects assessments 3amargarine 3ameat 3ameat patties 3amuffins 3anoodles 3aoleogels 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apeanut butter 3aphysical properties 3asaturated fats 3asausages 3asensory properties 3avegetable oil 0aOleogel 0aOrganogel 0aTrans fat 0aSaturated fat 0aUnsaturated fat0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 July, v. 26 p.101657-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1016573Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245018000165300001800345520135800363592002801721650001301749650003501762650001401797650003501811650002001846650001301866650001201879650000701891650002501898650000801923700002101931700002201952773009601974856008102070852000902151655001202160IND60549119220221119034631.0160906e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054911922DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-016-0487-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltunay, Nail12aA New Ultrasound Assisted-Cloud Point Extraction Method for the Determination of Trace Levels of Tin and Antimony in Food and Beverages by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry  ap. 2960-2971.  aIn the current study, a new ultrasonic-assisted cloud-point extraction (UA-CPE) method for the preconcentration and determination of antimony and tin in the selected food and beverages was developed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The method is based on the fact that formation of the stable ternary complexes of Sb(III) and Sn(IV) with 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxychromen-4-one (morin) in presence of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB) as both sensitivity improvement auxiliary ligand and counter ion, and then extraction into the micellar phase of poly(ethylene glycol-mono-p-nonylphenylether (PONPE 7.5) as extracting agent at pH 8.5. Under the optimized conditions, the calibration curves for Sb(III) and Sn(IV) were rectilinear with changing calibration sensitivities in ranges of 0.1–140 and 0.1–225 μg L⁻¹, respectively. The limit of detection for both Sb(III) and Sn(IV) was 0.03 μg L⁻¹ with sensitivity enhancement factor of 114.5 and 110.6, respectively. The precision as a relative standard deviation (RSD) for Sb(III) and Sn(IV) is in range of 2.3–5.2 and 2.6–5.4 %, respectively. The trueness of the method was verified by analysis of certified reference materials (CRMs). The method was successfully applied to determination of antimony and tin in the selected food and beverage matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abeverages 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adetection limit 3aethylene 3aligands 3apH 3astatistical analysis 3atin1 aGürkan, Ramazan1 aYıldırım, Emre0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Oct., v. 9, no. 10 p.2960-2971dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-016-0487-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009500156520235600251592002802607650001302635650001602648650001602664650002102680650001902701650001902720650001102739650001102750650001902761650002902780651001002809700001502819700001802834700001802852773012902870856007402999852000903073655001203082IND60651329520221117165021.0190711e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065132952DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111214982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Feifei 10aIdentify and Monitor Growth Faulting Using InSAR over Northern Greater Houston, Texas, USA  aGrowth faults are widely distributed in the Greater Houston (GH) region of Texas, USA, and the existence of faulting could interrupt groundwater flow and aggravate local deformation. Faulting-induced property damages have become more pronounced over the last few years, necessitating further investigation of these faults. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been proved to be an effective way for mapping deformations along and/or across fault traces. However, extracting short-wavelength small-amplitude creep signal (about 10&ndash;20 mm/yr) from long time span interferograms is extremely difficult, especially in agricultural or vegetated areas. This study aims to position, map and monitor the rate, extent, and temporal evolution of faulting over GH at the highest spatial density using Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) technique. The MTI method, which maximizes usable signal and correlation, has the ability to identify and monitor faulting and provide accurate and detailed depiction of active faults. Two neighboring L-band Advanced Land Observing (ALOS) tracks (2007&ndash;2011) are utilized in this research. Numerous areas of sharp phase discontinuities have been discerned from MTI-derived velocity map. InSAR measurements allow us to position both previously known faults traces as well as nucleation of new fractures not previously revealed by other ground/space techniques. Faulting damages and surface scarps were evident at most InSAR-mapped fault locations through our site investigations. The newly discovered fault activation appears to be related to excessive groundwater exploitation from the Jasper aquifer in Montgomery County. The continuous mining of groundwater from the Jasper aquifer formed new water-level decline cones over Montgomery County, corroborating the intensity of new fractures. Finally, we elaborate the localized fault activities and evaluate the characteristics of faulting (locking depth and slip rate) through modeling MTI-derived deformation maps. The SW&ndash;NE-oriented faults pertain to normal faulting with an average slip rate of 7&ndash;13 mm/yr at a shallow locking depth of less than 4 km. Identifying and characterizing active faults through MTI and deformation modeling can provide insights into faulting, its causal mechanism and potential damages to infrastructure over the GH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adeformation 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ainfrastructure 3ainterferometry 3amining 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aTexas1 aLu, Zhong 1 aKim, Jin Woo,1 aZheng, Weiyu 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 June 25, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111214983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010700165300001600272500001900288520097500307592002801282650001801310650002501328650001301353650002401366650001401390650001101404650002101415650002401436650003301460650001301493653000801506653000801514653001601522653002401538700001301562700001701575700001501592700001601607700002001623700001601643700001801659773009201677856008301769990002301852852000901875655001201884IND60697543720221117230820.0200605e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069754372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2017.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Fenfen10aIdentification of the interaction and interaction domains of chicken anemia virus VP2 and VP3 proteins  ap. 188-194.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChicken anemia virus (CAV) is a small, single-stranded DNA virus of Anelloviridae family. Its genome segments encode three proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3. This study identified an interaction between VP2 and VP3 and mapped the interaction domains. Through the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system, VP2 was found to interact with VP3. The presence of the VP2–VP3 complex in CAV-infected chicken cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Confocal microscopy showed that VP2 and VP3 were expressed in the cytoplasm in cotransfected Vero cells. In the Y2H system, the interaction domains were identified as being within the N-terminal aa 1–30 and C-terminal aa 17–60 for VP2 and the N-terminal aa 46–60 and C-terminal aa 1–7 for VP3. This study showed the interaction between VP2 and VP3 of CAV and identified multiple independent interactive domains within the two proteins. This provides novel information for investigating the biological functions of these proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnelloviridae 3aChicken anemia virus 3achickens 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytoplasm 3agenome 3aprecipitin tests 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3avirology 0aVP2 0aVP3 0aInteraction 0aInteraction domains1 aPan, Wei1 aGao, Honglei1 aQi, Xiaole1 aQin, Liting1 aWang, Yongqiang1 aGao, Yulong1 aWang, Xiaomei0 tVirology.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 513 p.188-194dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.09.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245013900176300001600315500001500331520170200346592002802048650002002076650001902096650001702115650002602132650001902158650001302177650001602190650002302206650002302229650001402252650001102266650002302277650001102300650001502311650002102326650001602347650002302363650001502386650001802401650001802419650001602437650001802453651001202471653001702483653001502500653002702515653002002542653001802562653001802580653002302598700002202621700001602643700001702659773010802676856008802784852000902872655001202881IND60538117520221120180355.0190319e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053811752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauniainen, Samuli10aCoupling boreal forest CO2, H2O and energy flows by a vertically structured forest canopy – Soil model with separate bryophyte layer  ap. 385-405.  a2019-12-06  aA 1-dimensional multi-layer, multi-species soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model APES (Atmosphere-Plant Exchange Simulator) with a separate moss layer at the forest floor was developed and evaluated for a boreal Scots pine forest situated in Hyytiälä, Southern Finland. The APES is based on biophysical principles for up-scaling CO2, H2O, heat and momentum exchange from canopy element level to a stand scale. The functional descriptions of sub-models were parametrized by literature values, previous model approaches and leaf and moss gas exchange measurements, and stand structural characteristics derived from multi-scale measurements. The model was independently tested against eddy-covariance fluxes of CO2, H2O and sensible heat measured above and within the canopy, and against soil heat flux and temperature and moisture profiles. The model was shown to well reproduce fluxes and resulting scalar gradients at diurnal and seasonal timescales. Also predictions for moss moisture content and soil moisture and temperature dynamics were acceptable considering the heterogeneity in soil hydraulic and thermal properties and uncertainties in boundary conditions.The model framework allows for (1) coupling above-ground with the soil domains through the feedbacks between soil water and vegetation mediated by the moss layer, (2) several vascular plant species or cohorts in a multi-species canopy, and (3) explicit treatment of bryophyte layer energy and water balance and bottom layer – atmosphere exchange. These features make APES well-suited for exploring feedbacks between boreal forest structure, site conditions and vegetation processes controlling ecosystem-atmosphere exchange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeddy covariance 3aboreal forests 3agas exchange 3amosses and liverworts 3acarbon dioxide 3amomentum 3auncertainty 3asoil heterogeneity 3aconiferous forests 3aBryophyta 3aleaves 3asoil water content 3amodels 3asoil water 3aPinus sylvestris 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3aprediction 3aforest canopy 3aforest litter 3aenergy flow 3aheat transfer 3aFinland 0aGas exchange 0aMoss layer 0aMulti-layer SVAT model 0aEnergy exchange 0awater balance 0aBoreal forest 0aSoil water balance1 aKatul, Gabriel G.1 aLauren, Ari1 aKolari, Pasi0 tEcological modelling.g2015 Sept. 24, v. 312 p.385-405dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008900173520203100262592002802293650001302321650001502334650001102349650001002360650002902370650001502399650002402414650001102438650001702449650001502466650000902481650002402490650002202514650001402536650003002550650002502580650001902605650001502624651001002639653000802649653001802657653002202675653002102697653001802718653002302736653002102759700001802780700001902798773011102817856008502928852000903013655001203022IND60731374220221118191714.0210723e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073137422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2021.1025572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaralakṣmi, Pi.,10aTropical Cyclone prediction based on multi-model fusion across Indian coastal region  aTropical cyclone prediction is essential to limit death toll and damage caused by them. In this paper, a model has been formulated to classify the cyclone as no cyclone, minimal, moderate, extensive, extreme and catastrophic in view of attributes such as Wind Speed(10 m), Rainfall, Wind Direction(10 m), Sea Surface Temperature(2 m), Sea Level Pressure(2 m) and Relative humidity(2 m). The models have been trained using the meteorological data from MERRA-2 Web service which provides time-series data with spatial resolution of approximately 50 km. The cyclone data is taken from RSMC — New Delhi for Tropical cyclone disturbances over Indian Oceans. Initially, the models are trained using deep learning networks like MLP, LSTM, GRU, RNN, BI-LSTM and CNN. Since CNN gives better results, the CNN model is chosen for further analysis. The hyper parameters of the CNN model are optimized using genetic algorithm. The values drawn from genetic algorithm appear to be promising than the values which were chosen manually in random. The model is then modified by removing the fully connected layer which operates as a classifier in CNN network. The conventional machine learning classifiers like — Decision Tree, K-Nearest neighbor, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM and XGBoost are used as a classifier in the place of a fully connected layer in CNN. Further to increase the prediction accuracy, C4.5 Decision tree algorithm is modified to be used as a classifier in CNN. Classification is performed by considering the Spatio-temporal data of various important cities in India. The model was tested to classify the category for 5 different cyclones and was also compared with Saffir–Simpson’s scale to validate the correctness of the model. The proposed model gives a better performance compared to the conventional machine learning and deep learning classifiers in terms of time complexity, accuracy, precision and recall and this can supplement the cyclone prediction process of current NWP models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aalgorithms 3acoasts 3adeath 3adecision support systems 3ahurricanes 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aoceanography 3aprediction 3arain 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asea level 3asurface water temperature 3atime series analysis 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aIndia 0aCNN 0aDeep learning 0aGenetic algorithm 0aMachine learning 0aModified C4.5 0aMulti-model fusion 0aTropical cyclone1 aVasumathi, N.1 aVenkatesan, R.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2021 Apr.,  May, v. 193 p.102557-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.1025573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245010100214500001900315506007600334520174700410592002802157506003702185650002202222650001102244650001502255650002202270650002002292650001602312650001302328653002002341653002402361653002302385653001502408653001302423653001502436700003002451700002302481700002102504700002302525700002002548700002302568700001902591700002202610700002102632700002802653773009302681856008602774852000902860655001202869IND60690742320221207050941.0200508e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069074232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e003332doi7 aPMC54864352pmcid7 a287213922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumarage, Jeevani14aThe response to Typhi Vi vaccination is compromised in individuals with primary immunodeficiency  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMeasurement of an individuals ability to respond to polysaccharide antigens is a crucial test to determine adaptive immunity. Currently the response to Pneumovax® is utilized but with the success of Prevnar®, measurement of the response to Pneumovax may be challenging. The aim of the study was to assess the response to Typhi Vi vaccination in both children and adult control groups and patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID). In the control groups, >95% of the individuals had pre Typhi Vi vaccination concentrations <100 U/mL and there was significant increase in concentration post Typhi Vi vaccination (p<0.0001) with>94% achieving ≥3 fold increase in concentration (FI). The response to Typhi Vi vaccination was significantly lower in both children (p = 0.006) and adult (p = 0.002) PID groups when compared to their control groups. 11% and 55% of the children and adult PID groups respectively did not obtain a response >3FI. There were no significant differences between the responses obtained in the children and adult PID groups. When all individuals with PID were separated into those with either hypogammaglobulinemia (HYPO) or common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), both groups had a significantly lower median FI than the control group (19, 95%CI 5–56 vs 59, 95%CI 7–237; p = 0.01 and 1, 95%CI 1–56 vs 32, 95%CI 5–136; p = 0.005). Further, a >3FI differentiated the antibody responses between both the CVID and HYPO groups and their control groups (AUC: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.65–1.00, p = 0.005 and 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65–0.97, p = 0.01). The data suggests that measurement of the response to Typhi Vi vaccination could represent a complementary assay for the assessment of the response to a polysaccharide vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadaptive immunity 3aadults 3aantibodies 3aimmunosuppression 3apolysaccharides 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aHealth sciences 0aBiological sciences 0aInfectious disease 0aImmunology 0aMedicine 0aPediatrics1 aSeneviratne, Suranjith L.1 aSenaratne, Vijitha1 aFernando, Amitha1 aGunasekera, Kirthi1 aGunasena, Bandu1 aGurugama, Padmalal1 aPeiris, Sudath1 aParker, Antony R.1 aHarding, Stephen1 ade Silva, Nilhan Rajiva0 tHeliyon.g2017 June, v. 3, no. 6 p.e00333-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e003333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005700167300001600224520107900240592002801319650003301347650001401380650001601394650001301410650001101423650001201434650001701446700002001463700001801483773013001501856008201631852000901713655001201722IND60089496220221119021108.0141102e20111216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008949622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Kyum-Yil10aCCCP induces autophagy in an AMPK-independent manner  ap. 343-348.  aAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important sensor of cellular energy status, and is involved in cell growth and autophagy through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler, leads to AMPK activation and Parkin-dependent mitophagy, respectively. However, the detailed biochemical mechanism of how CCCP induces autophagy or mitophagy has not been investigated yet. Here, we showed that CCCP inhibits mTORC1 independently of AMPK, although CCCP induces AMPK activation. Using wild type (WT) and AMPKα1/α2 double knockout (DKO) MEFs, we observed that CCCP promotes endogenous LC3 lipidation and formation of RFP-LC3 puncta, indicating autophagosome or autolysosome, in an AMPK-independent manner. Finally, we also revealed that the percentage of CCCP-dependent colocalization between mitochondria and RFP-LC3 puncta is similar both in WT and AMPKα1/α2 DKO MEFs. Based on these data, we concluded that AMPK is not essential in regulation of CCCP-induced autopahgy including mitophagy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aautophagy 3acell growth 3acyanides 3aenergy 3amammals 3amitochondria1 aViollet, Benoit1 aYoo, Ook Joon0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Dec. 16, v. 416, no. 3-4 p.343-348dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010800160300001800268520112300286592002801409650001301437650002001450650002801470650002101498650001501519650003801534650000901572650001801581650000901599650002601608650001801634650001701652700001501669700001401684700001601698700001401714700001201728773009601740856008101836852000901917655001201926IND60549119420221119034701.0160906e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054911942DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-016-0480-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xia10aElectrochemical Immunosensor Based on the Chitosan-Magnetic Nanoparticles for Detection of Tetracycline  ap. 2972-2978.  aIn this paper, a low-cost, simple, and highly sensitive electrochemical immunosensor was fabricated for the tetracycline detection based on gold electrode-modified carboxyl-Fe₃O₄ nanoparticle (MNPs) by chitosan (CS) as linker. The anti-tetracycline monoclonal antibody (Ab) was immobilized on the modified electrode surface. The binding of tetracycline to Ab was analyzed by differential pulse voltammetry. Here, MNPs were used as the signal amplifier to improve the sensitivity of the immunosensor. The stepwise assembly process of the electrochemical immunosensor was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Under the optimum operating conditions, the fabricated immunosensor showed a linear current response to the target concentration in the range from 0.08 to 1 ng/mL with a lower detection limit of 0.0321 ng/mL (S/N = 3). It was successfully applied to the detection of tetracycline in milk. Enzyme-linked immunoassay analysis was also conducted to detect tetracycline in the same samples for demonstrating the applicability of the electrochemical immunosensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agold 3aimmunosensors 3amilk 3amonoclonal antibodies 3ananoparticles 3atetracycline1 aZheng, Shu1 aHu, Yuxin1 aLi, Zongjun1 aLuo, Fang1 aHe, Zao0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Oct., v. 9, no. 10 p.2972-2978dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-016-0480-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245008600197300001800283506007600301520034100377592002800718506003700746650001500783650002300798650002300821650000900844650001700853650002200870650002200892700001500914700001600929700001500945700001600960700001900976700001700995700001701012700001601029700002601045773011801071856007501189852000901264655001201273IND60550320220221207131323.0160910e20140221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055032022DNAL7 a10.1021/jo402160b2doi7 aPMC44156012pmcid7 a244760412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Lijuan10aAccessing Near-Infrared-Absorbing BF2-Azadipyrromethenes via a Push–Pull Effect  ap. 1830-1835.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNovel aza-BODIPYs with significant bathochromic shifts were designed and synthesized by installation of strong electron-withdrawing groups on the para-positions of 1,7-phenyls and electron-donating groups on the para-positions of 3,4-phenyls.

With the interaction between CaCl₂ solution and cutoff wall, how does its permeability change, is the response pattern consistent for different concentrations, and what is the mechanism? To address this series of problems, the effects of CaCl₂ solutions of varying concentrations on the permeability of remolded loess were investigated by saturated permeability test, and the mechanisms underlying these effects were explored through free swelling ratio, zeta potential, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), grain-size tests, as well as SEM and MIP tests. The results indicate that Kₛₐₜ values of the samples permeated with both deionized water (DW) and 0.001 mol/L CaCl₂ solution increase with time, with a greater increase observed in the latter. This is mainly due to that the electrical double layer (EDL) effect induced by Ca²⁺, as the dominant factor, controls particle flocculation and pore structure development. Under seepage of a 0.010 mol/L CaCl₂ solution, the EDL effect plays a dominant role during the initial stage. However, chemical weathering causes the disintegration of loess particles, and the dissolution of carbonates is inhibited by Ca²⁺. These are not conducive to pore development; thus, Kₛₐₜ first increases and then decreases significantly. The Kₛₐₜ of samples permeated with a 0.005 mol/L CaCl₂ solution first increases and then stabilizes, which represents the transitional stage of the two aforementioned change trends. This is mainly because the effective pores are increased by leaching and cation exchange, and then the porosity is in dynamic equilibrium under the combined action of the EDL effect, geochemical action, and microstructural evolution. Thus, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛₐₜ) of remolded loess is sensitive to the concentrations of CaCl₂ solutions, with different response modes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3aflocculation 3aloess 3amicrostructure 3apermeability 3aporosity 3aremediation 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3aseepage 3athermogravimetry 3azeta potential 3aChina 0aSaturated hydraulic conductivity 0aCaCl2 solution 0aElectrical double layer effect 0aMicrostructural evolution 0aRemolded loess1 aQian, Hui1 aZhang, Qiying1 aLi, Weiqing1 aRen, Wenhao0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Sept., v. 612 p.128135-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1281353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009100156520203200247592002802279650001302307650001902320650001902339650001702358650002802375650002502403650002102428651001002449700001602459700002002475700001702495700001602512700001802528700002002546700001602566700001902582773012902601856007402730852000902804655001202813IND60651329720221120023155.0190711e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065132972DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111215002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ning 10aLarge-Scale Crop Mapping Based on Machine Learning and Parallel Computation with Grids  aLarge-scale crop mapping provides important information in agricultural applications. However, it is a challenging task due to the inconsistent availability of remote sensing data caused by the irregular time series and limited coverage of the images, together with the low spatial resolution of the classification results. In this study, we proposed a new efficient method based on grids to address the inconsistent availability of the high-medium resolution images for large-scale crop classification. First, we proposed a method to block the remote sensing data into grids to solve the problem of temporal inconsistency. Then, a parallel computing technique was introduced to improve the calculation efficiency on the grid scale. Experiments were designed to evaluate the applicability of this method for different high-medium spatial resolution remote sensing images and different machine learning algorithms and to compare the results with the widely used nonparallel method. The computational experiments showed that the proposed method was successful at identifying large-scale crop distribution using common high-medium resolution remote sensing images (GF-1 WFV images and Sentinel-2) and common machine learning classifiers (the random forest algorithm and support vector machine). Finally, we mapped the croplands in Heilongjiang Province in 2015, 2016, 2017, which used a random forest classifier with the time series GF-1 WFV images spectral features, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Ultimately, the accuracy was assessed using a confusion matrix. The results showed that the classification accuracy reached 88%, 82%, and 85% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. In addition, with the help of parallel computing, the calculation speed was significantly improved by at least seven-fold. This indicates that using the grid framework to block the data for classification is feasible for crop mapping in large areas and has great application potential in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3asupport vector machines 3atime series analysis 3avegetation index 3aChina1 aLiu, Diyou 1 aFeng, Quanlong 1 aXiong, Quan 1 aZhang, Lin 1 aRen, Tianwei 1 aZhao, Yuanyuan 1 aZhu, Dehai 1 aHuang, Jianxi 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 June 25, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111215003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245011600183300001600299520099800315592002801313650003201341650001001373650001601383650001501399650001301414650001401427650001201441650000901453650001201462650002401474650001201498650003601510650008501546650002801631650001401659650001001673650003801683651001001721651001201731651001001743651001001753700001801763700001701781700001301798700001901811700001201830700002101842700002001863700002001883773010001903856008202003852000902085655001202094IND4478529520221119135542.0190430e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447852952DNAL7 a212872562pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-011-0578-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Ting Rong10aPhylogenetic analysis of the E2 gene of classical swine fever virus from the Guangxi Province of southern China  ap. 347-354.  aIn this study, suspected classical swine fever (CSF) samples from the Guangxi Province of China were obtained from pigs with acute CSF, aborted fetuses, newborn pigs that died at 1–2 days of age, tonsils of healthy pigs, and leukocytes of immunized sows during 2001–2009.

The traditional Laeuren classification divides gastric cancer into two histopathological subtypes: diffuse and intestinal. Recent cancer genomics research has led to the development of a new classification based on molecular characteristics. The newly defined genomically stable (GS) subtype shares many cases with the histopathologically diffuse type. In this study, we performed genetic profiling of recurrently and significantly mutated genes in diffuse type and GS subtype tumors. We observed significantly different genetic characteristics, although the two subtypes overlapped in many cases. In addition, based on the profiles of the significantly mutated genes, we identified molecular functions and mutational signatures characteristic of each subtype. These results will advance the clinical application of the diffuse type and GS subtype gastric cancer in precision medicine for treating gastric cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3agenomics 3ahistopathology 3aintestines 3aprecision medicine 3astomach neoplasms 0aGastric cancer 0aGenomically stable 0aDiffuse type 0aMutational signature 0aLauren classification1 aWatanabe, Yū,1 aNagahashi, Masayuki1 aShimada, Yoshifumi1 aIchikawa, Hiroshi1 aWakai, Toshifumi1 aOkuda, Shujiro0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.3301-3308dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245016400162300001400326520080000340592002801140650002701168650002801195650002201223650001901245650002501264650001701289650001001306650001201316650001801328650003001346650001501376650001301391650001801404650001301422650002301435700001901458700001801477773012001495856007801615961001201693852000901705655001201714IND60130447120221120160205.0151127e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013044712DNAL7 a10.3958/059.038.01122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrosslin, J.

Drought-driven tree mortality has been observed in some savannas, but little is known about how tolerant savanna trees are to drought, or what determines differences among species in drought vulnerability. Here, we examine which characteristics best distinguished tree species that were most negatively affected by a recent drought in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Woody-encroaching, root-suckering species, which tended to have relatively low investments in non-structural carbohydrates, had the highest mortality rates. Of particular interest was Dichrostachys cinerea, a notable contributor to widespread woody encroachment across southern African savannas, which suffered high drought mortality. Using rainfall maps and vegetation survey data, we show that D. cinerea distributions in Kruger National Park are limited to areas with higher mean annual rainfall and lower past drought frequency, and stem densities are lower where droughts have occurred more frequently, suggesting that past droughts have had lasting impacts on the distribution and abundance of this species. Woody encroachers, such as D. cinerea, may face a trade off between traits promoting proliferation vs. drought tolerance, and more frequent and severe droughts could increasingly limit their spread.  aPublisher supplied data  aGraduate Research Fellowship  aMacMillan International Dissertation Fellowship 3aDichrostachys cinerea 3acarbohydrates 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3amortality 3anational parks 3arain 3asavannas 3asurveys 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aSouth Africa 0aDichrostachys cinerea 0afunctional traits 0arainfall 0atree mortality 0avegetation dynamics1 aWigley, Benjamin J1 aWigley-Coetsee, Corli1 aCarla Staver, A0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 37, no. 1 p.19-29dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2019.16973633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245016400212500001900376506007600395520119000471592002801661506003701689650001301726650002201739650001501761650001101776650001901787650001201806653001501818773009301833856008501926852000902011655001202020IND60690742520221207064621.0200508e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069074252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e003462doi7 aPMC55018832pmcid7 a287258702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadlington, Lee10aHuman factors in cybersecurity; examining the link between Internet addiction, impulsivity, attitudes towards cybersecurity, and risky cybersecurity behaviours  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study explored the relationship between risky cybersecurity behaviours, attitudes towards cybersecurity in a business environment, Internet addiction, and impulsivity. 538 participants in part-time or full-time employment in the UK completed an online questionnaire, with responses from 515 being used in the data analysis. The survey included an attitude towards cybercrime and cybersecurity in business scale, a measure of impulsivity, Internet addiction and a ‘risky’ cybersecurity behaviours scale. The results demonstrated that Internet addiction was a significant predictor for risky cybersecurity behaviours. A positive attitude towards cybersecurity in business was negatively related to risky cybersecurity behaviours. Finally, the measure of impulsivity revealed that both attentional and motor impulsivity were both significant positive predictors of risky cybersecurity behaviours, with non-planning being a significant negative predictor. The results present a further step in understanding the individual differences that may govern good cybersecurity practices, highlighting the need to focus directly on more effective training and awareness mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3acomputer security 3aemployment 3ahumans 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 0aPsychology0 tHeliyon.g2017 July, v. 3, no. 7 p.e00346-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e003463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01696naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001500138245003600153300001400189520069300203592002800896650001700924650001700941650002100958650001900979650002500998650001201023653001201035653001901047653001901066653002501085653001801110700001801128773010401146852000901250856007501259655001201334IND4374388520221119052513.0181004e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437438852DNAL7 a10.1354/vp.42-1-842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrubor, B.10aThyroid Carcinosarcoma in a Dog  ap. 84-87.  aAn adult male mixed breed dog developed pain, on swallowing, that lasted for 1 week.

The fundamental question of PICS temporal stability has not been adequately addressed. However, the main purpose of this work is to evaluate the temporal stability of a few PICS using a new approach. The analysis was performed over six PICS (Libya 1, Libya 4, Niger 1, Niger 2, Egypt 1 and Sudan 1). The concept of a &ldquo;Virtual Constellation&rdquo; was developed to provide greater temporal coverage and also to overcome the dependence limitation of any specific characteristic derived from one particular sensor. TOA reflectance data from four sensors consistently demonstrating &ldquo;stable&rdquo; calibration to within 5%&mdash;the Landsat 7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus), Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Sentinel-2A MSI (Multispectral Instrument)&ndash;were merged into a seamless dataset. Instead of using the traditional method of trend analysis (Student&rsquo;s T test), a nonparametric Seasonal Mann-Kendall test was used for determining the PICS stability. The analysis results indicate that Libya 4 and Egypt 1 do not exhibit any monotonic trend in six reflective solar bands common to all of the studied sensors, indicating temporal stability. A decreasing monotonic trend was statistically detected in all bands, except SWIR 2, for Sudan 1 and the Green and Red bands for Niger 1. An increasing trend was detected in the Blue band for Niger 2 and the NIR band for Libya 1. These results do not suggest abandoning PICS as a viable calibration source. Rather, they indicate that PICS temporal stability cannot be assumed and should be regularly monitored as part of the sensor calibration process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aSudan dyes 3adata collection 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aradiometry 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3at-test 3athematic maps 3aEgypt 3aLibya 3aNiger1 aPinto, Cibele  Teixeira1 aAngal, Amit 1 aXiong, Xiaoxiong 1 aHelder, Dennis 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 June 25, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111215023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245006900179300001600248500000900264520170800273592002801981650002402009650001902033650002202052650001402074650001702088650002202105650002502127650002302152700001802175773012102193852000902314856009802323655001202421IND9103078320221117074412.0191122e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910307832DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100020039x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, C. E.10aResponse to Divergent Selection for Anthesis Date in Tall Fescue  ap. 422-424.  aepub  aDate of anthesis is the major factor controlling the seasonal distribution of forage yield and quality in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the response to divergent selection for anthesis date in three cultivars of tall fescue that differ for date of anthesis. Three cultivars, Fawn, Alta, and Kentucky 31, were evaluated for date of anthesis in the field from 1981 to 1983. There was a strong juvenile requirement for some genotypes within each cultivar; however, this tended to be more of a problem with the earlier-maturing cultivars, Fawn and Alta. Correlations of establishment year data (1981) with mature plant data (1982 and 1983) were low; consequently, establishment year data were not utilized in selecting for anthesis date. Selections for both earlier and later anthesis were made within each population based on mature plant data. The six selected populations and the three unselected parent populations were evaluated as mature plants in the field for 2 yr. All populations exhibited a significant response to selection except for the Fawn population that was selected for earlier anthesis date. Realized heritabilities for later anthesis were higher (0.71–0.79) than for earlier anthesis (0.18–0.38) within each cultivar. The variance for anthesis date within each cultivar was increased by selection for later anthesis and decreased by selection for earlier anthesis. There appeared to be sufficient residual variation for further selection in all populations, with the possible exception of the Fawn population that was selected for earlier anthesis.

The review focuses on classes of acyclic twisted amides and their key structural properties, such as amide bond twist and nitrogen pyramidalization, which are primarily responsible for disrupting nN to π*C═O conjugation. Through discussing acyclic twisted amides in comparison with the classic bridged lactams and conformationally restricted cyclic fused amides, the reader is provided with an overview of amidic distortion that results in novel conformational features of acyclic amides that can be exploited in various fields of chemistry ranging from organic synthesis and polymers to biochemistry and structural chemistry and the current position of acyclic twisted amides in modern chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3achemistry 3alactams 3anitrogen1 aZhang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6616-70871 aSzostak, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9650-96900 tChemical reviews.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 121, no. 20 p.12746-12783dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c002253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01627naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016300166300001600329520059300345592002800938650001200966650001400978650001900992650002701011650002301038651001501061700002001076700002401096700001901120773010501139856004801244852000901292655001201301IND50072984920221118144531.0140213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007298492DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-013-0033-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowak, Carsten10aRapid development of microsatellite markers for the critically endangered Saiga (Saiga tatarica) using Illumina® Miseq next generation sequencing technology   ap. 159-162.  aWe developed 17 variable microsatellite markers for the threatened Saiga antelope.

Based on published datasets, a hypothesis that the relative respiration per area unit in trees can be independent of tree surface area was tested. There is a gap in the published data when the allometric studies of tree size do not intercept with studies on tree respiration. The indirect comparison showed that the scaling exponents, volume vs. surface area and respiration vs. stem volume, are slightly larger than they should be for the hypothesis to hold. The data studied showed that the relative respiration per area unit slightly increases with increase in tree surface area. Possible explanations of the relationship include a different distribution of metabolically active parts of stem and higher nitrogen content in larger trees. Also, the published datasets might include large fast growing trees which had higher growth respiration.

The cellular membrane cholesterol was activated by the exposure of the cells to low ionic strength buffer or the inhibition of intracellular acyl-coA/cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). The active membrane cholesterol was reacted with cholesterol oxidase in the solution to generate a peak concentration of hydrogen peroxide on the electrode surface, which induced a measurable luminol electrochemiluminescence. Further treatment of the active cells with mevastatin decreased the active membrane cholesterol resulting in a drop in luminance. No change in the intracellular calcium was observed in the presence of luminol and voltage, which indicated that our analysis process might not interrupt the intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Single cell analysis was performed by placing a pinhole below the electrode so that only one cell was exposed to the photomultiplier tube (PMT). Twelve single cells were analyzed individually, and a large deviation on luminance ratio observed exhibited the cell heterogeneity on the active membrane cholesterol. The smaller deviation on ACAT/HMGCoA inhibited cells than ACAT inhibited cells suggested different inhibition efficiency for sandoz 58035 and mevastatin. The new information obtained from single cell analysis might provide a new insight on the study of intracellular cholesterol trafficking.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aionic strength 3amammals 3aplasma membrane1 aZhou, Junyu1 aTian, Chunxiu1 aJiang, Dechen1 aFang, Danjun1 aChen, Hongyuan0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Apr. 16, v. 85, no. 8 p.3912-3917dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac303304r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011000158520193000268592002802198650002302226650002202249650001602271650002302287650001502310650001802325650002102343650001802364650001502382650001602397650001902413700002302432700002302455773012802478856007502606852000902681655001202690IND60768503320221118061013.0220225e20220216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076850332DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140409632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xiaoyu 10aEvaluation of Near-Infrared Reflectance and Transflectance Sensing System for Predicting Manure Nutrients  aLivestock manure is widely applied onto agriculture soil to fertilize crops and increase soil fertility. However, it is difficult to provide real-time manure nutrient data based on traditional lab analyses during application. Manure sensing using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is an innovative, rapid, and cost-effective technique for inline analysis of animal manure. This study investigated a NIR sensing system with reflectance and transflectance modes to predict N speciation in dairy cow manure using a spiking method. In this study, 20 dairy cow manure samples were collected and spiked to achieve four levels of ammoniacal nitrogen (NH₄-N) and organic nitrogen (Org-N) concentrations that resulted in 100 samples in each spiking group. All samples were scanned and analyzed using a NIR system with reflectance and transflectance sensor configurations. NIR calibration models were developed using partial least square regression analysis for NH₄-N, Org-N, total solid (TS), ash, and particle size (PS). Coefficient of determination (R²) and root mean square error (RMSE) were selected to evaluate the models. A transflectance probe with a 1 mm path length had the best performance for analyzing manure constituents among three path lengths. Reflectance mode improved the calibration accuracy for NH₄-N and Org-N, whereas transflectance mode improved the model predictability for TS, ash, and PS. Reflectance provided good prediction for NH₄-N (R² = 0.83; RMSE = 0.65 mg mL⁻¹) and approximate predictions for Org-N (R² = 0.66; RMSE = 1.18 mg mL⁻¹). Transflectance was excellent for TS predictions (R² = 0.97), and provided good quantitative predictions for ash and approximate predictions for PS. The correlations between the accuracy of NH₄-N and Org-N calibration models and other manure parameters were not observed indicating the predictions of N contents were not affected by TS, ash, and PS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aammonium nitrogen 3acalibration 3acost effectiveness 3acow manure 3aleast squares 3aorganic nitrogen 3aparticle size 3aprediction 3areflectance 3asoil fertility1 aLarson, Rebecca A.1 aDigman, Matthew F.0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Feb. 16, v. 14, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140409633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012800168300001600296520132100312592002801633650002201661650001301683650002301696650002601719650001101745650001301756650001901769650001901788650001601807650001401823650002001837650000701857650001501864650001901879653001301898653002201911653002501933653001701958700001501975700001601990700001802006700001402024700001202038700002002050773010702070856008402177852000902261655001202270IND60123389920221120201323.0150325e20140528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012338992DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2013.8245232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Zhineng10aEffects of Solution Chemistry on Bacterial Adhesion with Phyllosilicates and Goethite Explained by the Extended DLVO Theory  ap. 419-430.  aAdhesion of Bacillus subtilis on kaolinite, montmorillonite, and goethite was investigated over a wide range of ionic strength (IS) and pH using batch experiment. The related surface properties (size, zeta potential, and hydrophobicity) under varying conditions were systematically determined and the interaction energy between the cell and minerals were calculated using the extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (ExDLVO) theory. Adhesion on kaolinite and montmorillonite increased with IS at low level (< 0.01 mol L ⁻¹ MgCl ₂) but declined at high IS level. An increase in IS generally depressed bacterial adhesion on goethite. Elevated pH resulted in decreasing the adhesions on all three minerals. The IS- and pH-effects on adhesion for phyllosilicate systems followed the ExDLVO predictions. For goethite systems, this theory predicted the adhesion trend with IS and that under basic pH, but failed to explain the adhesion at low pH. Such deviation from the theory possibly resulted from chemical interactions between extracellular polymeric substances on cell surface and goethite. These results imply that bacterial adhesions on phyllosilicate s are primarily governed by the ExDLVO interactions, and those on iron oxides are mediated by the combination of ExDLVO and non-ExDLVO interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aadhesion 3abacterial adhesion 3achemical interactions 3aenergy 3agoethite 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic strength 3airon oxides 3akaolinite 3amontmorillonite 3apH 3aprediction 3azeta potential 0aadhesion 0aBacillus subtilis 0aextended DLVO theory 0asoil mineral1 aZhao, Gang1 aChen, Wenli1 aRong, Xingmin1 aCai, Peng1 aDai, Ke1 aHuang, Qiaoyun,0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2014 May 28, v. 31, no. 5 p.419-430dTaylor & Francis Groupx1521-05297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2013.8245233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245006300173300001400236520141400250592002801664650001201692650001201704650001501716650001201731650001901743650001901762650000901781650001301790653002901803653003001832653001901862653003301881653001801914700001501932773013701947856008602084852000902170655001202179IND60687090320221120175539.0200916e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068709032DNAL7 a10.2989/10220119.2020.17160722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWigley-Coetsee, C10aGrass community responses to drought in an African savanna  ap. 43-52.  aDrought is often discussed as a major perturbation in savanna ecosystems, associated with lasting shifts in savanna structure and functioning. However, historically, droughts have occurred frequently in southern African savannas, suggesting that plants might benefit from being resilient to drought. Here, we evaluate whether the 2014–2016 drought was an extreme event in terms of effects on the herbaceous vegetation and specifically on grasses. We monitored herbaceous responses, pre-, during and post-drought in the Kruger National Park and compared responses with a previous extreme drought (1991–1992). Grass biomass decreased during both droughts, but recovered quickly once rains returned, regardless of whether areas burned in the years preceding drought. However, species functional composition was slower to recover, with shifts in dominance that closely matched grass photosynthetic machinery. Species drought tolerances were best predicted by their bundle sheath morphology: species characterised by XyMS− bundle sheaths (often associated with NADP-ME photosythesis) declined in abundance consistently during drought, whereas those characterised by XyMS+ bundle sheaths (associated with PEP-ck and NAD-ME photosynthesis) either increased or were unaffected by drought. The response of grass to drought, at least in terms of productivity and functional composition, is relatively predictable.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3adrought 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3anational parks 3aphotosynthesis 3arain 3asavannas 0abundle sheath morphology 0aC4-photosynthetic subtype 0afire frequency 0afunctional grass composition 0agrass biomass1 aStaver, AC0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 37, no. 1 p.43-52dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2020.17160723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245013600161300001600297520192800313592002802241650001202269650001102281650001302292650001902305650001002324650001302334650001402347650001102361650001902372650001702391650001202408651002002420700001502440773012902455856007502584852000902659655001202668IND60481002720221120031627.0160131e19990901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048100272DNAL7 a10.7882/AZ.1999.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldingay, Ross10aDevelopment of a conservation strategy for the Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea  in the Illawarra Region of New South Wales  ap. 376-387.  aThe Green and Golden Bell Frog <i>Litoria aurea</i> is recognized in New South Wales and nationally as a species in serious decline. We surveyed its current distribution and abundance in the Illawarra region of New South Wales in order to devise a regional conservation plan for this species, based on the objective of establishing at least three isolated, viable populations. The survey was conducted during 1997-1999 across 18 sites based on historic and current records of the species, and habitat suitability. Bell frogs were detected at eight sites, four of which were on public land. The maximum number of adult frogs varied from 11 to 78 across seven sites in Port Kembla, suggesting a population of ≯ 100 adult frogs. Breeding was poor at most sites during this study but a moderate number (ca50) of juvenile frogs was observed at the BHP Steelworks site in January 1998 and at Coomaditchy Lagoon in February 1999. Bell frogs were recorded previously at Shellharbour, where a large population occurred, and at Bulli. These areas are proposed as the other regional sites for bell frog conservation because they are well isolated (≯10 km away) from Port Kembla.  A small number of bell frogs was present at Bulii, while none was found at Shellharbour. The apparent stability of bell frogs in the Port Kembla area suggests that the presence of multiple breeding sites within a relatively small area (2.5 km radius) is very important and the establishment of viable populations in other areas should consider mis situation as a model. This will require the creation of additional breeding sites at Bulli and Shellharbour, and may require translocation to Shellharbour if no occupied sites are found in the next few years. The presence of predatory fish at nine sites demonstrates the need for the conservation strategy to include activities that improve the quality of the habitat currently available to bell frogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitoria 3aadults 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3afrogs 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3apredatory fish 3apublic lands 3asurveys 3aNew South Wales1 aLewis, Ben0 tAustralian zoologist.g1999 Sept. 1, v. 31, no. 2 p.376-387dRoyal Zoological Society of NSWwJournal:19830x0067-22387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7882/AZ.1999.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010100163300002000264520145100284592002801735650001501763650002401778650001601802650001901818650002001837650003001857650001401887650002301901650001101924650001501935650002001950650001401970650001301984650001301997700002302010773012902033856008202162852000902244655001202253IND60576421520221118050319.0170804e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057642152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b029982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Rafia10aSimultaneous Site Adsorption Shift and Efficient CO Oxidation Induced by V and Co in Pt Catalyst  ap. 12807-12816.  aA complete solution for CO poisoning of Pt catalysts requires a design that entirely prevents CO adsorption on Pt atoms. Here, we explore the CO adsorption sites and oxidation capability of 3d transition metal doped small magic clusters of Pt₄. Among Pt₃M, only the Pt₃V free-standing cluster entirely eliminates the prospect of Pt poisoning by inverting the adsorption site of CO to V atom. The V d-band center lies closer to the Fermi level than that of Pt atoms, resulting in a larger number of empty d-antibonding states, thereby making V comparatively more reactive toward CO. The inversion of the CO adsorption site is also observed for larger PtₙVₘ clusters and becomes possible for PtₙCoₘ clusters for sizes larger than m + n = 12 atoms. Formation and removal of CO₂ via the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism occurs with low reaction barriers, exhibiting a high catalytic activity for the Ptₙ(V/Co)ₘ clusters. A maximum catalytic efficiency is attained for Pt₄₁V₁₄, which at room temperature gives a CO₂ turnover frequency comparable to the conventional catalysts. The oxidation of CO becomes more favorable by the Mars van Krevelan mechanism for the cluster supported on vacancy prone Li-doped MgO(100). Our results present a rationale design of Pt poisoning free fuel cells and automobile exhaust catalysts, which can be entirely protected from CO poisoning and maintain long-term high catalytic efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aautomobiles 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbon monoxide poisoning 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3afuel cells 3amagnesium oxide 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3avanadium1 aSingh, Abhishek K.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 June 15, v. 121, no. 23 p.12807-12816dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b029983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009800168500001500266520175400281592002802035650002102063650001502084650002202099650001202121650001202133650006602145650002202211650001302233650002002246653001902266653002002285653001102305653002602316700005402342773009202396856008602488852000902574655001202583IND60713127620221118182336.0201209e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071312762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1216882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilina, Y.E.10aLDI-MS scanner: Laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry-based biosensor standardization  agolden set  aAmperometric biosensors have been widely utilized for the cost-effective and rapid analysis of various bioanalytes, for example glucose. However, a lack of standardization and validation procedures remains a major limitation in biosensor development. Therefore, despite rapid advances in material science driving the development of amperometric biosensors, to date only a few biosensors, detecting a limited range of analytes, are available on the market. It is believed, once this issue is addressed, it can significantly facilitate the next step in the overall concept “go to the market” production and implementation of amprerometric biosensors for a large industrial scale.Herein, we report on the use of laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) for the standardization of amperometric biosensors, based upon a complete and non-destructive characterization and validation of layer-by-layer (LbL) biosensors at each fabrication step. We reveal that specific ionization pathways of mediators, polymers and enzymes from the biosensor surface allows for robust quality control during LbL biosensor manufacture. Furthermore, this LDI-MS approach can also be used to monitor, and therefore ensure, the encapsulation of enzymes in one-step nanobiosensors. Specifically, we show that LDI-MS can be used for the rapid chemical profiling of LbL biosensors and one-step synthesized nanobiosensors, as well as to assess their synthesis quality and to monitor for batch-to-batch and intra- and inter-day changes in their function and behavior. Our novel approach will thus contribute to the future development, improved design and fine tuning of both conventional LbL-fabricated amperometric biosensors and one-step designed nanobiosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioencapsulation 3abiosensors 3achemical analysis 3aenzymes 3aglucose 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ananobiotechnology 3apolymers 3aquality control 0aNanobiosensors 0aStandardisation 0aLDI-MS 0aBiochemical profiling1 aMorgan, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9393-10710 tTalanta.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 223 p.121688-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1216883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010700167300001600274500001900290520116700309592002801476650001701504650002801521650001901549650001601568650001601584650001401600650001201614650001301626650001701639650001701656650001301673650001201686653001601698653001301714653001501727653001601742653003901758700001401797700001501811700001801826700001401844773009201858856008301950990002302033852000902056655001202065IND60697544220221117230726.0200605e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069754422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2017.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fuxian10aIdentification of the caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis as the primary entry pathway for aquareovirus  ap. 195-207.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGrass carp reovirus (GCRV), a member of the Aquareovirus genus in the Reoviridae family, is considered the most pathogenic aquareovirus. However, its productive viral entry pathways remain largely unclear. Using a combination of quantum dot (QD)-based live-virus tracking and biochemical assays, we found that extraction of cellular membrane cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and nystatin strongly inhibited the internalization of GCRVs, and supplementation with cholesterol restored viral infection. In addition, the entry of the virus was restrained by genistein, an inhibitor known to block caveolar endocytosis. Subsequent real-time tracking experiments revealed that the QD-labeled GCRV particles were colocalized with caveolin-1, and transfection of cells with dominant-negative mutant (caveolin-1 Y14F) significantly reduced GCRV infection. In contrast, no effects on virus infection were detected when the clathrin-mediated endocytosis or the macropinocytosis inhibitors were used. Our results collectively suggest that aquareoviruses can use caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis as the primary entry pathway to initiate productive infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAquareovirus 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3acell membranes 3acholesterol 3aendocytosis 3agenistein 3amutants 3anystatin 3aquantum dots 3atransfection 3avirology 3aviruses 0aDsRNA virus 0aReovirus 0aCell entry 0aQuantum dot 0aCaveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis1 aGuo, Hong1 aZhang, Jie1 aChen, Qingxiu1 aFang, Qin0 tVirology.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 513 p.195-207dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.09.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245010800180520210100288592002802389650001302417650000802430650001102438650001902449650002002468650001602488650001502504650001602519650001502535650004302550650001102593650002402604650001902628650001802647650001102665650001302676650000902689650002302698651001302721653003702734653001902771653003002790653002102820653003502841653001602876700002102892700002202913773012002935856008803055852000903143655001203152IND60736874620221121232011.0220103e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073687462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1476662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatos, João Luís de,10aParticle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a rural background atmosphere of southwestern Europe  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of organic pollutants widely distributed in the atmosphere and well known for their carcinogenic and mutagenic properties. Over the last two decades, research about atmospheric PAHs has been focused in urban and industrial areas, while less attention has been given to rural areas. This study aims to contribute to filling this gap by analyzing the levels, sources and associated health risks of particulate PAHs in a rural coastal atmosphere of southwestern Europe (Portugal). A total of 132 PM₁₀ aerosol samples were collected over a 3-year period, from 2014 to 2016, with a high-volume sampler and analyzed for 7 PAHs by high-performance liquid chromatography. The global average of the sum of the concentrations of PAHs (ΣPAHs) was 0.320 ± 0.597 ng/m³. Benzo[b]fluoranthene was the dominant congener in the majority of aerosol samples, with an average contribution of 25% to the ΣPAHs. A seasonal trend was repeatedly observed over the study period with higher concentrations of PAHs during the autumn and winter months. The HYSPLIT model was used to examine air mass transport pathways into the sampling site, revealing that changes in the frequency of continental air mass trajectories were a key factor explaining the seasonal variation of PAHs. Model runs also indicated that fast-moving air masses were more efficient at dispersing PAHs emitted in the surrounding region than slow-moving air masses with a similar origin (marine or continental). The average concentration of benzo[a]pyrene, a powerful human carcinogen, was found to be 0.044 ± 0.098 ng/m³, approximately two orders of magnitude lower than average values previously recorded in the most polluted European atmospheres. Diagnostic ratio analysis suggested that mobile and stationary combustion sources were equally contributing to the atmospheric load of PAHs. The estimated average lifetime lung cancer risk was below the health-based guideline level, indicating a low risk of lung cancer development associated with inhalation exposure to particle-phase PAHs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aautumn 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinogenicity 3acarcinogens 3acombustion 3aenvironment 3aguidelines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ainhalation exposure 3alung neoplasms 3amass transfer 3amodels 3amutagens 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3aPortugal 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aBenzo[a]pyrene 0aParticulate matter (PM10) 0aRural atmosphere 0aBackward air mass trajectories 0aHealth risk1 aSilveira, Carlos1 aCerqueira, Mário0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 787 p.147666-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1476663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011200166520140400278592002801682650000901710650001701719650001901736650001101755650001501766650001101781650002201792650002301814650001701837651001001854653004001864653001801904653003301922653002901955653003201984700001802016700001502034773009002049856008502139852000902224655001202233IND60761141720221120155212.0220205e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076114172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1229462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jiashi10aPolicy implications of China's rural household coal governance from the perspective of the spillover effect  aChina's Rural Civilian Bulk Coal (RCBC) governance is proceeding in an orderly manner, but it is encountering some difficulties, such as the establishment of an energy guarantee mechanism, the selection of a promotion pilot, and economic cost control. This study uses the Multi-Model Comparison and Regression Optimisation of Spatio-Temporal Analysis (MMC&ROSTA) technology of RCBC consumption to analyse the provincial panel data, and it examines the time effect and spatial spillover effect on RCBC consumption to solve the governance problems. The results show that (1) RCBC has an “inverted U-shaped” income effect, and urbanisation and coal resource endowments have negative and positive effects on RCBC, respectively; (2) RCBC consumption has an inter-provincial demonstration effect, and the economic development linkage, population movement, and resource market competition will all bring about the spatial spillover of RCBC consumption; and (3) residents' energy use habits (REUH) will increase RCBC consumption and delay the change of RCBC consumption with increasing income. In summary, the governance of RCBC should adhere to the principles of inter-provincial coordination, use inner-provincial conditions as a basis to both determine governance guidelines and establish a subsidy mechanism and use resource competition to guide changes in REUH while coordinating with urbanisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acost control 3aeconomic costs 3aenergy 3agovernance 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amarket competition 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aRural civilian bulk coal governance 0aIncome effect 0aResidents' energy use habits 0aSpatial spillover effect 0aDynamic spatial panel model1 aHou, Xiaochao1 aZhang, Lei0 tEnergy.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 242 p.122946-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1229463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014900161300002000310520131500330592002801645650001101673650001401684650001401698650002301712650001301735650001501748650003401763650002101797650001701818650002201835650002401857650001501881650001401896650002201910650001601932650001301948650000901961653002001970653002501990653002102015653003202036653002502068700001702093700001502110700001802125700001802143700001702161700001702178700005502195700005302250700005402303700005302357773014102410856007802551852000902629655001202638IND60697285920221121050208.0200603e20200507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069728592DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b150392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hanlin10aHighly Effective Electrochemical Exfoliation of Ultrathin Tantalum Disulfide Nanosheets for Energy-Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis  ap. 24675-24682.  aDeveloping highly efficient transition metal dichalcogenide electrocatalysts would be significantly beneficial for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water splitting. Herein, we reported novel ultrathin tantalum disulfide nanosheets (TaS₂ NSs) prepared by electrochemically exfoliating bulk TaS₂ with an alternating voltage in an acidic electrolyte. The obtained TaS₂ NS electrocatalyst possessed an ultrathin structure with a lateral size of 2 μm and a thickness of ∼3 nm. Owing to the unique 2D structure, the achieved TaS₂ NSs displayed remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the HER by a small overpotential of 197 mV at 10 mA cm–² and a small Tafel slope of 100 mV dec–¹ in acidic solution, much lower than those of TaS₂ (>547 mV and 216 mV dec–¹, respectively) and other reported TaS₂-based HER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, highly efficient full water splitting could be realized with two electrodes in which TaS₂ NSs acted as the cathode while Ir/C served as the anode, with help of two AA size batteries or solar cells. By replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), bifunctional TaS₂ NSs enabled an energy-effective HER process in the cathode and UOR process in the anode with decreased applied potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3adisulfides 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy efficiency 3ahydrogen production 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3asolar cells 3atantalum 3aurea 0aexfoliated TaS2 0aultrathin nanosheets 0aelectrocatalysis 0aelectrochemical exfoliation 0aenergy-efficient HER1 aSi, Jincheng1 aLyu, Siliu1 aZhang, Tianyu1 aLi, Zhongjian1 aLei, Chaojun1 aLei, Lecheng1 aYuan, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7744-72521 aYang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5136-97431 aGao, Liguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5390-36631 aHou, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9795-85030 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 May 07, v. 12, no. 22 p.24675-24682dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b150393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001600186245005900202300002000261506007600281520115900357592002801516506003701544650001101581650001401592650001501606650002201621650001401643650001601657653002901673653002101702653002301723653001701746653001601763700002101779700002101800700001801821700001201839700002501851700001901876700002101895700002001916700002101936700001901957700002401976700001902000700001902019773019302038856007902231852000902310655001202319IND60178806720221207061146.0150604e20141209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017880672DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14192761112doi7 aPMC42673812pmcid7 a254224712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDashti, Ali10aTrajectories of the ribosome as a Brownian nanomachine  ap. 17492-17497.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA Brownian machine, a tiny device buffeted by the random motions of molecules in the environment, is capable of exploiting these thermal motions for many of the conformational changes in its work cycle. Such machines are now thought to be ubiquitous, with the ribosome, a molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis, increasingly regarded as prototypical. Here we present a new analytical approach capable of determining the free-energy landscape and the continuous trajectories of molecular machines from a large number of snapshots obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy. We demonstrate this approach in the context of experimental cryogenic electron microscope images of a large ensemble of nontranslating ribosomes purified from yeast cells. The free-energy landscape is seen to contain a closed path of low energy, along which the ribosome exhibits conformational changes known to be associated with the elongation cycle. Our approach allows model-free quantitative analysis of the degrees of freedom and the energy landscape underlying continuous conformational changes in nanomachines, including those important for biological function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenergy 3aequipment 3alandscapes 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomes 3atemperature 0acryo-electron microscopy 0aelongation cycle 0amanifold embedding 0ananomachines 0atranslation1 aSchwander, Peter1 aLanglois, Robert1 aFung, Russell1 aLi, Wen1 aHosseinizadeh, Ahmad1 aLiao, Hstau Y.1 aPallesen, Jesper1 aSharma, Gyanesh1 aStupina, Vera A.1 aSimon, Anne E.1 aDinman, Jonathan D.1 aFrank, Joachim1 aOurmazd, Abbas0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 9, v. 111, no. 49 p.17492-17497dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14192761113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245010000213300001800313520105200331592002801383650001301411650002501424650001601449650001001465650001101475650002001486650001601506650001401522650002101536700002101557700002901578700002001607700002201627700002101649700002301670700002201693773011901715856008701834852000901921655001201930IND60598778220221117222251.0180702e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059877822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b028442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWest, Zachary J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7671-978110aInvestigation of Water Interactions with Petroleum-Derived and Synthetic Aviation Turbine Fuels  ap. 1166-1178.  aWhile undesirable in aviation fuel systems, water is both ubiquitous and tenacious; thus, interactions between water and aviation turbine fuel occur regularly. From a fuel user perspective, it is important to know, understand, and be able to predict such fuel–water interactions, e.g., water solubility, water settling rate, and interfacial tension, for proper mitigation. We explore these interactions as well as surface tension of both petroleum-derived and alternative jet fuels to compare potential differences between product compositions on these physical interactions. Observations indicate a positive, nonlinear correlation between water solubility and both aromatic content and temperature (from 0 to 50 °C). Water settling rates appear to follow a Stokes’ law model; therefore, bulk chemical composition indirectly influences settling rates via density and viscosity. Finally, surface tension appears positively correlated to sample density, while interfacial tension is correlated to both surface tension and fuel aromatic content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaviation 3achemical composition 3acorrelation 3afuels 3amodels 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awater solubility1 aYamada, Takahiro1 aBruening, Christopher R.1 aCook, Rhonda L.1 aMueller, Susan S.1 aShafer, Linda M.1 aDeWitt, Matthew J.1 aZabarnick, Steven0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 32, no. 2 p.1166-1178dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b028443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245006800177300001600245520085800261592002801119650001301147650002701160650002501187650002101212650000901233650002101242650002001263650001001283650001401293650001001307650001201317650002101329650001501350650001601365651001801381653001801399653001401417653002801431700001801459700001901477773010501496856008401601852000901685655001201694IND60566150020221118120827.0170402e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056615002DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2014.9401142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabinof, Sylvia Smith,10aFish Consumers: Environmental Attitudes and Purchasing Behavior  ap. 267-282.  aThe objective of this study was to expand on the limited awareness of the U.S. fish consumer. Measures were tested through a Web-based national survey. The final survey consisted of 40 questions, including environmental awareness, food neophobia, fish consumption, reasons for consuming fish, and demographic variables. Correlations and t tests were used to analyze relationships between eating fish in restaurants and other variables. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to segment respondents into two groups based on their environmental awareness and neophylic/neophobic attitudes. EcoFish consumers were more likely to be male, eat fish for health and the environment, and eat fish at restaurants significantly more than the Indifferent Fish consumers. Restaurants can use these results to market to eco-friendly, health-conscious fish consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconsumer preferences 3aeating disorders 3afish 3afish consumption 3afood purchasing 3afoods 3aingestion 3amales 3amarkets 3anational surveys 3apurchasing 3arestaurants 3aUnited States 0afish consumer 0aneophobia 0aenvironmental attitudes1 aVarble, Sarah1 aSecchi, Silvia0 tJournal of food products marketing.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 23, no. 3 p.267-282dRoutledgex1540-41027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10454446.2014.9401143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013400177300001800311500001900329520115600348592002801504650001101532650001501543650001501558650001601573653003001589653003101619653002301650653001701673653004301690773015301733856008501886852000901971655001201980IND60741602020221120221045.0210616e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074160202DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2020.17632312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapodaglio, Andrea G.10aFit-for-purpose urban wastewater reuse: Analysis of issues and available technologies for sustainable multiple barrier approaches  ap. 1619-1666.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA selective approach for multiple wastewater recovery is nowadays desirable and technologically feasible, to provide water at specific quality standards for each reuse objective. This “fit-for-purpose” approach to water reuse could both save water and would reduce production cost and energy demand by eliminating unnecessary treatment and long-range conveyance, as it typically aims at local reuses. The appropriate choice of technologies for such approaches is perhaps the most critical planning and design decision when evaluating systems for implementation or refurbishing. This article examines wastewater reuse goals (direct potable use, indirect potable use, non-potable uses and industrial uses) and related requirements as relevant case studies, and issues that may arise during implementation. It then proposes an overview of current conventional and advanced technologies and their possible combination to meet foreseen uses under a multiple barrier treatment (MBT) approach, which implies a sequence of complementary processes at an increasing level of protection for both conventional and emerging pollutants according to reuse goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3atechnology 3awastewater 3awater reuse 0afit-for-purpose treatment 0amultiple barrier treatment 0amembrane processes 0adisinfection 0aadvanced oxidation reduction processes0 tCritical reviews in environmental science and technology.g2021 June 17, v. 51, no. 15 p.1619-1666dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12197x1547-65377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2020.17632313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245010600165300001400271520106600285592002801351650001201379650001601391650001201407650001701419650001101436650001501447650001201462650001801474650001901492653002301511653001801534653002101552653002401573653001701597700001901614700001801633773012301651856007801774852000901852655001201861IND60520094320221118040439.0160513e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052009432DNAL7 a10.2478/johr-2014-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoribe, Takanori10aLeaves Of Cut Rose Flower Convert Exogenously Applied Glucose To Sucrose And Translocate It To Petals  ap. 41-46.  aTo understand the role that the leaves play in the translocation of soluble carbohydrates in cut rose flowers, we first evaluated the effect of leaf removal on flower quality and the sugar content in petals. Cut rose flowers with leaves had higher soluble sugar content in petals compared with cut flower without leaves. Next, we treated cut flowers with radioactive glucose to clarify translocation routes of exogenously applied sugar. There was no significant difference between the specific radioactivity of sucrose and glucose in leaves, but specific radioactivity of sucrose in petals was much higher than that of glucose. These results suggested that most of the exogenously applied glucose first moved to the leaves, where it was converted into sucrose and then the synthesised sucrose was translocated to the petals. Our results showed that the leaves of cut rose flowers play an important role in the metabolism and transportation of exogenously applied soluble carbohydrates toward the petals, thus contributing to sustaining the post-harvest quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorolla 3acut flowers 3aglucose 3ahorticulture 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3asucrose 3asugar content 3atransportation 0aCut flower quality 0aleaf function 0asugar metabolism 0aradioactive glucose 0aRosa hybrida1 aYamaki, Shohei1 aYamada, Kunio0 tJournal of Horticultural Research.g2015 Mar. 3, v. 22, no. 2 p.41-46dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23155x2353-39787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johr-2014-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010700170300001600277520124000293592002801533650002401561650002101585650002101606650002101627650002301648650001601671650001001687650001401697650000901711650001501720651001401735653001601749653001601765653002301781653001501804653001401819700001901833700002201852700001801874773013901892856008502031852000902116655001202125IND60544219020221118230135.0190416e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054421902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2014.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenkis, Audrius10aArchaeorhizomyces borealis sp. nov. and a sequence-based classification of related soil fungal species  ap. 943-955.  aThe class Archaeorhizomycetes (Taphrinomycotina, Ascomycota) was introduced to accommodate an ancient lineage of soil-inhabiting fungi found in association with plant roots. Based on environmental sequencing data Archaeorhizomycetes may comprise a significant proportion of the total fungal community in soils. Yet the only species described and cultivated in this class is Archaeorhizomyces finlayi. In this paper, we describe a second species from a pure culture, Archaeorhizomyces borealis NS99-600T (=CBS138755ExT) based on morphological, physiological, and multi-locus molecular characterization. Archaeorhizomyces borealis was isolated from a root tip of a Pinus sylvestris seedling grown in a forest nursery in Lithuania. Analysis of Archaeorhizomycete species from environmental samples shows that it has a Eurasian distribution and is the most commonly observed species. Archaeorhizomyces borealis shows slow growth in culture and forms yellowish creamy colonies, characteristics that distinguish A. borealis from its closest relative A. finlayi. Here we also propose a sequence-based taxonomic classification of Archaeorhizomycetes and predict that approximately 500 species in this class remain to be isolated and described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaeorhizomycetes 3aPinus sylvestris 3aTaphrinomycotina 3aforest nurseries 3afungal communities 3anew species 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil fungi 3aLithuania 0aPlant roots 0aRhizosphere 0aSoil clone group 1 0aSoil fungi 0aSymbiosis1 aUrbina, Hector1 aJames, Timothy Y.1 aRosling, Anna0 tFungal biology.g2014 Dec., v. 118, no. 12 p.943-955dElsevier LtdaThe British Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2014.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245018400209300001400393520161200407592002802019596005602047596005602103596005602159596006102215596006102276596006102337596006102398650001702459650001202476650001302488650001302501650001702514650002602531650001102557650002102568651002202589651001202611700002202623700002102645700002502666773011502691856008202806852000902888655001202897IND60744655620221121040913.0210716e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074465562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12224-021-09387-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSosnovsky, Yevhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0391-350210aLeaf anatomical trends in a temperate evergreen dwarf shrub, Rhododendron myrtifolium (Ericaceae) along elevational and exposure gradients in the northeastern Carpathian Mountains  ap. 27-42.  aSpecies’ responses to climatic gradients are constrained by multiple internal (e.g. trait plasticity and genetics) and external (local habitat) factors and may vary considerably between co-occurring species. This study examines morphological trends associated with elevation and slope aspect (exposure) in the European declining species Rhododendron myrtifolium (Ericaceae) to assess its adaptive responses to spatially changing environment. Measurements of 23 leaf anatomical traits from 40 individuals sampled at 24 locations along a broad elevational range from 1,248 to 2,034 m a.s.l. in the Eastern Carpathians (Ukraine) were analysed using multivariate statistics. Significant intercorrelations between traits indicate a tendency towards leaf xeromorphy with increasing elevation. Trait shifts along a south-to-north aspect gradient parallel those observed with increasing elevation and correspond to presumed differences between the aspects in water availability. Different leaf traits display distinct clinal and non-clinal patterns of variation across elevational strata, with an overall decline in the range of variation at high elevations. Significant effects of growth form, vegetation cover and populational characteristics on leaf traits are also found. The results indicate that despite plastic response of R. myrtifolium to ecological gradients, the species appears well-adapted to a limited range of habitats (north-exposed sites at medium and high elevations) and is likely impacted by abiotic stresses and increased competition for resources at south-facing and low-elevation locations.  aPublisher supplied data  aPNS-010515cIvan Franko National University of Lviv  aPNS-010515cIvan Franko National University of Lviv  aN/113-2003cIvan Franko National University of Lviv  a116U001546cMinistry of Education and Science of Ukraine  a116U001546cMinistry of Education and Science of Ukraine  a116U001546cMinistry of Education and Science of Ukraine  a116U001546cMinistry of Education and Science of Ukraine 3aRhododendron 3adecline 3agenetics 3ahabitats 3aleaf anatomy 3amultivariate analysis 3ashrubs 3avegetation cover 3aCarpathian region 3aUkraine1 aNachychko, Viktor1 aProkopiv, Andriy1 aHoncharenko, Vitaliy0 tFolia geobotanica.g2021 Mar., v. 56, no. 1 p.27-42dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000071x1211-95207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-021-09387-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245010600179506011700285506007600402520175000478592002802228506003702256650001902293650001102312650001302323650002102336650002002357653004302377653005402420653004202474653001302516653001402529653002202543700001802565700002302583700002002606773009802626856008702724852000902811655001202820IND60745176520221207112906.0220426e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074517652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1174122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParupudi, Ranga Vihari10aLong term performance analysis of low concentrating photovoltaic (LCPV) systems for building retrofit  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLow concentrating photovoltaic (LCPV) systems offer viable solution for generating higher energy output per unit cell area compared to a typical flat PV panel, making them potential candidates for building retrofit. However, the best LCPV geometry for a given location is yet to be identified. The current study investigates the technical, economic and environmental feasibility of three geometrically equivalent LCPV designs installed at a building within Brunel University London (UK). The studied LCPV systems comprised of Asymmetric Compound Parabolic Concentrating (ACPC), Compound Parabolic Concentrating (CPC) and V-Trough optical concentrators with the post-truncation geometric concentration ratios of 1.53, 1.46, 1.40 respectively. The performances of the prototypes have been monitored every 15 min over 10 months and analyzed on hourly, daily, and monthly basis. Performance parameters such as reference yield, array yield, performance ratio, electrical conversion efficiency and the generated energy output per unit area have been derived and presented. Payback periods have been estimated in two separate scenarios. Measurements have showed that the ACPC integrated LCPV achieved the highest annual optical efficiency generating the highest amount of electrical energy per unit cell area of 246.2 kWh/m² compared to CPC-LCPV, V-Trough-LCPV and conventional flat modules which produced 224.6 kWh/m², 196.1 kWh/m² and 185.4 kWh/m² respectively. One particular conclusion of the study is that the ACPC based LCPVs perform better in locations where diffuse component of solar radiation is predominant as in the case of the UK. Consequently, ACPC based LCPV modules are recommended for the building retrofit in such locations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3ageometry 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 0aLow concentrating photovoltaics (LCPV) 0aAsymmetric Compound Parabolic Concentrator (ACPC) 0aCompound Parabolic Concentrator (CPC) 0aV-Trough 0aBuildings 0aDiffuse radiation1 aSingh, Harjit1 aKolokotroni, Maria1 aTavares, José,0 tApplied energy.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 300 p.117412-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1174123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011800174300002000292520118500312592002801497650002301525650002201548650002501570650001801595650001501613650003301628650001101661650002401672700002401696700002101720700005301741700001801794700001601812700002101828700002101849700006201870700002601932773012201958856008702080852000902167655001202176IND60598778320180802000000.0180702e20171221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059877832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b028472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrucci, Thiago10aVibrational Spectroscopy and Thermophysical Properties of Ultralow Sulfur Diesel—Alternative Fuel Binary Blends  ap. 13775-13784.  aFour alternative fuels (AF) were blended with ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) at five different proportions (10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 vol % AF) to create 20 binary mixtures in this work. Two renewable jet AFs and two renewable diesel AFs were investigated. Interactions between the components in the mixtures were analyzed by means of spectroscopy (Raman, near-infrared), thermophysical (thermal diffusivity, thermo-optic coefficient), and physical (density) techniques. Correlations among the data were investigated using principal component analysis and partial least-squares regression. Trends in Raman intensities and band positions as well as thermophysical properties showed that the AF/ULSD blends resembled two-component mixtures despite the known complexities of the constituents. Specifically, spectra combined according to the percentages of the components in each mixture; thermophysical and physical properties exhibited similar behavior. The spectra showed strong correlations with all three physical properties, creating the possibility for predicting the properties of similar AF/ULSD mixtures. These properties are governed by the chemical compositions of the fuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aalternative fuels 3achemical composition 3aleast squares 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asulfur 3athermal diffusivity1 aMichaelian, Kirk H.1 aGieleciak, Rafal1 aShen, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5922-58511 aZhou, Jianqin1 aGu, Caikang1 aNeill, W.

Hybrid cooling systems are presented as a potential solution to achieve water consumption reduction since they also avoid a high penalty of efficiency loss in the power block. In this work, a hybrid cooling pilot plant installed at Plataforma Solar de Almería is evaluated experimentally. The system has been tested under different ambient and operating conditions to analyze their influence on the water and electricity consumption. The results reveal that significant water savings were achieved in comparison with the conventional only-wet configuration. Concretely, a maximum water consumption saving of 67% was found at high ambient temperatures (between 25 and 30 °C) and for a thermal load of 80% when a hybrid configuration was used. The optimal operating strategies that achieve a tradeoff between low water and electricity consumption have been identified by two efficiency indexes: the specific electricity and water consumption. The parallel configuration was the optimal one in most of the cases. At high ambient temperatures and 80% thermal load, the electricity and water consumptions of this configuration were 0.033 kWₑ/kWₜₕ and 0.071 L/kWₜₕ, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3asolar energy 0aHybrid cooling 0aPilot plant 0aWater consumption saving 0aExperimental characterization 0aOptimal operating strategies1 aRoca, Lidia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8724-51361 aAsfand, Faisal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1928-62241 aPatchigolla, Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6350-284X0 tEnergy.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 242 p.122948-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1229483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245017800171520196200349592002802311650000802339650001502347650001402362650002702376650001902403650001702422650001602439650001102455650001502466650001902481650002302500650001702523650002702540650002102567650001502588650004302603650002802646650001502674650002902689653004302718653002002761653002202781653002102803653000802824700001202832700001802844700001702862700001702879700001702896773012002913856008803033852000903121655001203130IND60736874820221121231838.0220103e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073687482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1476682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Shengwu10aCytotoxicity, mitochondrial impairment, DNA damage and associated mechanisms induced by tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate in A549 cells  aTris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), two of the most widely applied phosphorus-containing flame retardants (PFRs), have been shown to have adverse effects in different organisms, but their underlying toxicity mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the toxicological effects of TDCPP and TBOEP on human lung carcinoma (A549) cells and their associated mechanisms were investigated at the cellular, organelle and transcriptional levels. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay results showed that TDCPP and TBOEP reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. High-content screening assays showed that both PFRs caused mitochondrial impairment at the organelle level, decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing the mitochondrial mass, and leading to increased cell cycle arrest-associated DNA damage that decreased the ratio of cells in S phase and increased the DNA content. In addition, oxidative stress was identified as a possible initial mechanistic process underlying PFR-induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial impairment, as evidenced by intracellular reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide overproduction from environmentally relevant concentrations. Furthermore, p53 activation was shown to be involved in regulating DNA damage after A549 cell exposure to TDCPP and TBOEP. Quantitative PCR analyses showed that TDCPP and TBOEP triggered p53/p21-mediated cell cycle arrest pathways, indicating that these PFRs can activate p53, and promote associated functional repair. However, the p53/bax-mediated apoptosis pathway was not activated following exposure to PFRs at specific concentrations. Our results showed that TDCPP and TBOEP can cause cytotoxicity, mitochondrial impairment and cell cycle arrest-associated DNA damage in A549 cells, suggesting that oxidative stress is the initial molecular event by which these adverse outcomes are induced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aenvironment 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3alung neoplasms 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphates 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicology 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPhosphorus-containing flame retardants 0aCellular damage 0aCell cycle arrest 0aOxidative stress 0ap531 aMa, Mei1 aZhu, Xiaoshan1 aHan, Yingnan1 aRao, Kaifeng1 aWang, Zijian0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 787 p.147668-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1476683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012300164300001600287520084400303592002801147650001701175650001001192650001001202650001001212650004501222650003301267650001601300650001401316650001401330650002901344651001001373651001001383651001801393653002001411653002501431653001501456653001401471653001601485700001501501700002001516700001601536700002101552700001301573773013701586856008501723852000901808655001201817IND60544219120221118230107.0190416e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054421912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2014.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Nan10aPolyphasic characterization of four new plant pathogenic Phyllosticta species from China, Japan, and the United States  ap. 433-446.  aThe black rot disease of Vitis species and other host genera of Vitacease is caused by Phyllosticta ampelicida and allied taxa which is considered to be a species complex.

The hydrophobic core is considered as a depot for hydrophobic molecules, and the corona-forming block acts as a stabilizing and solubilizing interface between the core and aqueous milieu. Tremendous efforts have been made to tune the hydrophobic block to increase the drug loading and stability of micelles, whereas the role of hydrophilic blocks is rarely investigated in this context, with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) being the gold standard of hydrophilic polymers. To better understand the role of the hydrophilic corona, a small library of structurally similar A–B–A-type amphiphiles based on poly(2-oxazoline)s and poly(2-oxazine)s is investigated by varying the hydrophilic block A utilizing poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (pMeOx; A) or poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (pEtOx; A*). In terms of hydrophilicity, both polymers closely resemble PEG. The more hydrophobic block B bears either a poly(2-oxazoline) and poly(2-oxazine) backbone with C3 (propyl) and C4 (butyl) side chains. Surprisingly, major differences in loading capacities from A–B–A > A*–B–A > A*–B–A* is observed for the formulation with two poorly water-soluble compounds, curcumin and paclitaxel, highlighting the importance of the hydrophilic corona of polymer micelles used for drug formulation. The formulations are also characterized by various nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods, dynamic light scattering, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and (micro) differential scanning calorimetry. Our findings suggest that the interaction between the hydrophilic block and the guest molecule should be considered an important, but previously largely ignored, factor for the rational design of polymeric micelles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acurcumin 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3ahydrophilic polymers 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apaclitaxel 3apolyethylene glycol 3asolubilization 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater solubility 0apoly(2-oxazoline)s 0aamphiphilic block copolymers 0ahydrophobic drugs 0ananoformulations 0acorona−drug interactions1 aLübtow, Michael M.1 aEndres, Sebastian1 aFörster, Stefan,1 aFlegler, Vanessa J.1 aBöttcher, Bettina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7962-48491 aAseyev, Vladimir1 aPöppler, Ann-Christin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0624-17081 aLuxenhofer, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5567-74040 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 May 07, v. 12, no. 22 p.24531-24543dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b224953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245015100206300002000357520152400377592002801901650002201929650001301951650001601964650001601980650001201996650001202008700002102020700001802041773013902059856008002198852000902278655001202287IND60672294120221120160436.0191010e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067229412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b069492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshikawa, Yoshie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4352-909710aSpherical Particle Formation Mechanism in Pulsed Laser Melting in Liquid under Controlled-Pulse-Number Irradiation using a Slit Nozzle Flow System  ap. 24934-24942.  aA detailed mechanism of pulsed laser melting in liquid (PLML) has remained a controversial issue because of the difficulty associated with tracking and observing particles irradiated with a specific number of pulses in conventional batch-style irradiation. In a previous study, we developed a flow irradiation technique with a new slit nozzle for PLML mass-production. The slit nozzle can precisely control pulse numbers irradiated onto particles flowing through the slit nozzle. In the present study, this unique feature of the slit nozzle was used to clarify the PLML mechanism by a specific pulse number irradiation. According to a numerical analysis of the flow with the slit nozzle, 79% of the particles flowing through the slit nozzle were irradiated with two or three pulses and other particles that were irradiated with three or more pulses upon one passage through the slit nozzle at a 1.1 mL s–¹ volume flow rate for a particle suspension in 60 wt % glycerol aqueous solution. Sub-micrometer-sized hollow spherical particles were formed via few-pulse irradiation of aggregates. After hollow particles were formed, the void in the hollow particles disappeared with increasing laser pulse number. Thus, an initial process of spherical particle formation and morphological transition of the particles with a specific irradiated pulse number were observed for the first time using the slit nozzle. The reduction of Fe₃O₄ particles via laser pulse irradiation was also tracked as a function of flow passage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aglycerol 3airon oxides 3airradiation 3aliquids 3amelting1 aKoshizaki, Naoto1 aSakaki, Shota0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 123, no. 40 p.24934-24942dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b069493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013100173300001600304500001500320520143400335592002801769650002601797650001701823650002001840650001901860650002901879650002701908650002201935650002001957650003101977650002402008650001502032653000802047653003502055653004302090653001502133653004002148653001702188700002702205700002002232700002702252700002202279700003002301773013902331856008502470852000902555655001202564IND60544219420221118230207.0190416e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054421942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2014.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiranda, Roxana U.10aReactive oxygen species regulate lovastatin biosynthesis in Aspergillus terreus during submerged and solid-state fermentations  ap. 979-989.  a2019-12-06  aIn a previous work we detected an important increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations during idiophase in lovastatin fermentations. Hence, the objective of the present work was to determine if ROS contributes to the regulation of lovastatin biosynthesis. Exogenous antioxidants were used to reduce ROS accumulation. The addition of N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) decreased ROS accumulation and concurrent lovastatin production. In solid-state fermentation (SSF), the addition of 100 mM of NAC lowered ROS accumulation by 53 %, together with a 79 % decrease in lovastatin biosynthesis. A similarly, situation was observed in submerged fermentation (SmF). Decreased lovastatin production was due to a lower expression of the regulatory gene lovE, and gene lovF. Moreover, the addition of H2O2 to the culture caused precocious gene expression and lovastatin biosynthesis. These results indicate that ROS accumulation in idiophase contributes to the regulation of the biosynthetic genes. It was considered that Yap1 (Atyap1) could be a transcription factor linking ROS with lovastatin biosynthesis. In a Northern analysis, Aspergillus terreus yap1 gene (Atyap1) was highly expressed during trophophase but down regulated during idiophase. Conversely, expression pattern of srrA gene, suggested that SrrA could positively control lovastatin biosynthesis, and also explaining the characteristics of the biosynthesis in SSF.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3abiosynthesis 3aregulator genes 3aacetylcysteine 3asolid state fermentation 3asubmerged fermentation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aAspergillus terreus 3alovastatin 0aROS 0aROS in lovastatin biosynthesis 0aSubmerged and solid-state fermentation 0aLovastatin 0aRegulation of secondary metabolites 0aantioxidants1 aGómez-Quiroz, Luis E.1 aMendoza, Mariel1 aPérez-Sánchez, Ailed1 aFierro, Francisco1 aBarrios-González, Javier0 tFungal biology.g2014 Dec., v. 118, no. 12 p.979-989dElsevier LtdaThe British Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2014.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245008600158300002000244520117500264592002801439650001701467650001801484650001801502650001401520650001601534653002501550653003301575653002201608653002401630653003001654700002501684700001201709700005701721700001801778700005401796773014101850856007801991852000902069655001202078IND60697286320221121040314.0200603e20200511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069728632DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b235952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Bin10aNovel Type of Synaptic Transistors Based on a Ferroelectric Semiconductor Channel  ap. 24920-24928.  aThree-terminal synaptic transistors are basic units of neuromorphic computing chips, which may overcome the bottleneck of conventional von Neumann computing. So far, most of the three-terminal synaptic transistors use the dielectric layer to change the state of the channel and mimic the synaptic behavior. For this purpose, special dielectric layers are needed, such as ionic liquids, solid electrolytes, or ferroelectric insulators, which are difficult for miniaturization and integration. Here, we report a novel type of synaptic transistors using a two-dimensional ferroelectric semiconductor, i.e., α-In₂Se₃, as the channel material to mimic the synaptic behavior for the first time. The essential synaptic behaviors, such as single-spike response, paired-spike response, and multispike response have been experimentally demonstrated. Most importantly, the conventional gate dielectric material of our transistors may facilitate the miniaturization and batch manufacture of synaptic transistors. The results indicate that the three-terminal synaptic transistors based on two-dimensional ferroelectric semiconductors are very promising for neuromorphic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3aionic liquids 3amanufacturing 3aselenides 3atransistors 0asynaptic transistors 0aferroelectric semiconductors 0aIn2Se3 nanosheets 0aneuromorphic system 0atwo-dimensional materials1 aḤussain, Ṣābir,1 aXu, Rui1 aCheng, Zhihai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4938-44901 aLiao, Jianhui1 aChen, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7919-51590 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 May 11, v. 12, no. 22 p.24920-24928dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b235953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245006000200300002000260520088900280592002801169650002301197650001501220650002601235650001601261650001601277650001201293650002301305650001701328700001501345700001401360700001901374700001901393700001201412700001401424700002901438700005101467773013901518856008001657852000901737655001201746IND60672294320200108000000.0191010e20190916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067229432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b069602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5062-563710aInvestigation of Methane Adsorption in Strained IRMOF-1  ap. 24592-24597.  aThe effect of mechanical deformation of metal–organic frameworks on guest adsorption was investigated via a combination of molecular dynamics and grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations. The volumetric uptake of methane benefited from compressive IRMOF-1, whereas deformation orientation influenced the gravimetric uptake of methane. The deformation structures of IRMOF-1 enlarged adsorption sites, which could be subsequently occupied by additional methane molecules. However, both the void fraction and internal surface area decreased in strained IRMOF-1. The rapid reduction of IRMOF-1 unit cell volume is due to its shear-collapse deformation mode, which contributed to enhanced volumetric uptake of methane in strained IRMOF-1. Hence, methane uptake in strained IRMOF-1 is expected to yield considerable benefits in engineering application of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3adeformation 3aengineering 3amethane 3amolecular dynamics 3asurface area1 aTian, Dong1 aZhang, Li1 aZheng, Xuezhao1 aLiu, Changchun1 aLu, Hai1 aChen, Jin1 aMaurin, G.q(Guillaume),1 aShi, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9298-13090 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 16, v. 123, no. 40 p.24592-24597dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b069603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245007000203300002000273506007600293520121800369592002801587506003701615650002601652650002101678650001101699650001501710650001301725653002601738653001401764653001301778653001501791653001001806700002001816700002201836700001701858700002001875700002001895700002301915700002301938700002101961773019301982856007902175852000902254655001202263IND60178807220221207061422.0150604e20141209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017880722DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14199971112doi7 aPMC42673892pmcid7 a254042892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShemesh, Tom12aA model for the generation and interconversion of ER morphologies  ap. E5243-E5251.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe peripheral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms different morphologies composed of tubules and sheets. Proteins such as the reticulons shape the ER by stabilizing the high membrane curvature in cross-sections of tubules and sheet edges. Here, we show that membrane curvature along the edge lines is also critical for ER shaping. We describe a theoretical model that explains virtually all observed ER morphologies. The model is based on two types of curvature-stabilizing proteins that generate either straight or negatively curved edge lines (R- and S-type proteins). Dependent on the concentrations of R- and S-type proteins, membrane morphologies can be generated that consist of tubules, sheets, sheet fenestrations, and sheet stacks with helicoidal connections. We propose that reticulons 4a/b are representatives of R-type proteins that favor tubules and outer edges of sheets. Lunapark is an example of S-type proteins that promote junctions between tubules and sheets. In a tubular ER network, lunapark stabilizes three-way junctions, i.e., small triangular sheets with concave edges. The model agrees with experimental observations and explains how curvature-stabilizing proteins determine ER morphology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aeukaryotic cells 3amodels 3aprediction 3aproteins 0aendoplasmic reticulum 0areticulon 0alunapark 0amorphology 0amodel1 aKlemm, Robin W.1 aRomano, Fabian B.1 aWang, Songyu1 aVaughan, Joshua1 aZhuang, Xiaowei1 aTukachinsky, Hanna1 aKozlov, Michael M.1 aRapoport, Tom A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 9, v. 111, no. 49 p.E5243-E5251dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14199971113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014900167520166500316592002801981650001002009650001902019650002302038650002202061653002002083653002102103653003002124653003002154653001502184700001502199700001402214700001802228773010102246856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60676058920221120122411.0200128e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067605892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.1052472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hanbin12aA statistics-based discrete element modeling method coupled with the strength reduction method for the stability analysis of jointed rock slopes  aThe stability of jointed rock slopes can be effectively analyzed using the discrete element method (DEM). However, the criteria for terminating the DEM iterative calculation process and determining the factor of safety (FOS) are not well defined. In this paper, a displacement-statistics-based discrete element modeling method (DSDM) is proposed to analyze the stability of jointed rock slopes by coupling with the shear strength reduction method (SRM). In the presented DSDM, two important criteria are defined: (1) a statistics-based criterion for terminating the iterative calculation process of the DEM modeling in the stability analysis of jointed rock slopes, and (2) a statistics-based criterion for determining the FOS of a jointed rock slope when coupling DEM and SRM. The novelty of the proposed DSDM is that statistical information of the global displacements around the potential slip surface of the jointed slope, rather than the local displacements of several characteristic points, are utilized to define the criteria for terminating the DEM iterative calculation process and determining the FOS. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed DSDM, the FOS of a simplified jointed rock slope is first calculated using the proposed DSDM, and then compared with the FOS obtained using the finite difference method (FDM). Moreover, the proposed DSDM is applied to analyze the stability of a real high-steep bedding rock slope. The numerical simulation results for the real rock slope are consistent with the in-situ observations. The proposed DSDM is thus capable of effectively analyzing the stability of jointed slopes with potential slip surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3arocks 3ashear strength 3astatistical models 3atopographic slope 0aSlope stability 0aFactor of safety 0aDiscrete element modeling 0aStrength reduction method 0aStatistics1 aZhang, Bin1 aMei, Gang1 aXu, Nengxiong0 tEngineering geology.g2020 Jan., v. 264 p.105247-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.1052473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008400163300001400247520100700261592002801268650001701296650002501313650001801338650002101356650001401377650001801391650001101409650001701420650001301437650002301450650001301473650002201486650000901508650001701517650002301534650002501557653003101582653001901613653001001632653001301642653001101655700002301666700001901689700002001708700002101728773012301749856007801872852000901950655001201959IND60520094820221118040220.0160513e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052009482DNAL7 a10.2478/johr-2014-00252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaugale, Valda14aThe Influence Of Cultivation System On Biochemical Content Of Strawberry Fruits  ap. 85-92.  aThree cultivars ‘Zefyr’, ‘Honoeoye’ and ‘Polka’ were grown on beds mulched with black plastic or without it, as well as in low tunnels covered by transparent polyethylene film or Agronet (Pegas agro, 17 g·m⁻²), or without covering.

This is the area of cucumber under greenhouse cultivation that should not be exceeded so that the efficiency and returns can be optimized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3acucumbers 3aeconometrics 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 0aefficiency 0aCobb–Douglas function 0avegetables 0ayield1 aMohamady Mohamady, Hady0 tInternational journal of vegetable science.g2021 July 04, v. 27, no. 4 p.347-351dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4027179x1931-52797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19315260.2020.17938703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100004700144245005100191300001500242520065400257592002800911650001300939650002300952650002000975650001300995650001101008650001701019650001501036650002201051653002401073653002601097653001201123653001701135700001801152700002401170773012401194856007801318852000901396655001201405IND60520094920221118040347.0160513e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052009492DNAL7 a10.2478/johr-2014-00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Abdel-Rahman Moustafa Abdel-Wahab14aThe History Of Genome Mapping In Fragaria Spp.  ap. 93-103.  aThis overview summarizes the research programs devoted to mapping the genomes within Fragaria genus.

In this study, using a direct sequencing approach based on a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at genomic DNA and cDNA levels, we show that CDKN1C exhibits monoallelic expression in all seven studied organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle and subcutaneous fat) in cattle. To investigate how methylation regulates imprinting of CDKN1C in cattle, allele‐specific methylation patterns in two putative differential methylation regions (DMRs), the CDKN1C DMR and KvDMR1, were analyzed in three tissues (liver, spleen and lung) using bisulfite sequencing PCR. Our results show that in the CDKN1C DMR both parental alleles were unmethylated in all three analyzed tissues. In contrast, KvDMR1 was differentially methylated between the two parental alleles in the same tissues. Statistical analysis showed that there is a significant difference in the methylation level between the two parental alleles (P < 0.01), confirming that this region is the DMR of KvDMR1 and that it may be correlated with CDKN1C imprinting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3acattle 3acomplementary DNA 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3aheart 3akidneys 3aliver 3amethylation 3amuscles 3aneoplasms 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspleen 3astatistical analysis 3asubcutaneous fat 3atissues1 aLi, Dongjie1 aZhang, Mingyue1 aYang, Wenzhi1 aCui, Yali1 aLi, Shijie0 tAnimal genetics.g2015 Aug., v. 46, no. 4 p.354-360dBlackwell Sciencex0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.122973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245015800169300001600327520118700343592002801530650001601558650002001574650002001594650002601614650001901640650001801659650001901677650001201696650001101708650001101719650002701730650001801757650001601775650001101791650001701802650000901819650001101828650001401839650001401853650001901867650002401886650001301910650001301923650001501936650001501951650001401966650000901980650001901989650002302008650002502031650001602056650001002072650001802082650000902100653001002109653003602119653001902155653002002174653002102194653001802215700001602233700001702249700001902266700002302285700001702308773012502325856007802450852000902528655001202537IND60520095020221123025237.0160513e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052009502DNAL7 a10.2478/johr-2014-00272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShukla, Sushil Kumar10aResponse Of Guava Trees (Psidium Guajava) To Soil Applications Of Mineral And Organic Fertilisers And Biofertilisers Under Conditions Of Low Fertile Soil  ap. 105-114.  aThe goal of this study was to assess the influence of different organic fertilisers - vermicompost, mulching, Azotobacter, phosphate solubilising microbes (PSM) and Trichoderma harzianum added each year to mineral fertilisers containing NPK and to farmyard manure (FYM) on leaf nutrient status, tree growth, fruit yield and quality of guava grown in low fertile soil. The results revealed that vermicompost, bio-fertilisers and organic mulching resulted in yield and fruit quality boosters, as compared to application of NPK and FYM as the only organic fertiliser. Significant differences in plant height, canopy spread and stem girth of guava plants were obtained in combination, where Azotobacter, T. harzianum, PSM and organic mulching were applied. The leaf nutrient contents (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn) were within sufficient ranges. Fruit yields and quality were highest in combination, where vermicompost, Azotobacter, T. harzianum, PSM and organic mulching was applied. Fruit quality parameters viz. soluble solid concentration, titratable acidity, total sugars and ascorbic acid showed positive correlation with the available macro- and micronutrients in the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzotobacter 3aNPK fertilizers 3aPsidium guajava 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aanimal manures 3aascorbic acid 3abiofertilizers 3acalcium 3acanopy 3acopper 3afertilizer application 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3aguavas 3ahorticulture 3airon 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amicroorganisms 3amineral fertilizers 3amulching 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asoil 3asolubilization 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3atree growth 3atrees 3avermicomposts 3azinc 0aGuava 0amineral and organic fertilisers 0abio-fertiliser 0aplant nutrition 0agrowth and yield 0afruit quality1 aAdak, Tarun1 aSingha, Atul1 aKumar, Kailash1 aSingh, Vinod Kumar1 aSingh, Achal0 tJournal of Horticultural Research.g2015 Mar. 3, v. 22, no. 2 p.105-114dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23155x2353-39787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johr-2014-00273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245012800162520140800290592002801698650002001726650001101746650001101757650001501768650001501783653002701798653002501825653002501850653002001875653003601895653002001931700001101951700001401962700001601976773009001992856008502082852000902167655001202176IND60761142520221120155416.0220205e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076114252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1229602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jie10aUsage of correlation analysis and hypothesis test in optimizing the gated recurrent unit network for wind speed forecasting  aAccurate wind speed forecasting is vital to unlocking the potential of wind energy and improving its utilization. By focusing on the input optimization of the network, this study develops a novel wind speed forecasting system based on a deep learning gated recurrent unit (GRU) network. Specifically, to begin with, the Pearson correlation, the partial correlation, and the maximum information coefficient analyses were employed to extract the necessary input variables according to the correlation coefficients with large values. Later, a t-test was used to further select the variables that had small correlation coefficients with the concerned wind speed variable. Subsequently, auto- and partial auto-correlation analyses were adopted to determine the related hyperparameters of the network. Finally, the wind speed was forecasted by incorporating the selected input variables and hyperparameters into the GRU network. To assess the performance of the proposed system, apart from the usual error criteria, we adopted two additional hypothesis test approaches, that is, the Friedman and Nemenyi tests, to qualify the forecasting performance of networks with different input settings. The forecasting performance sorting results, as well as error comparison results at different stations against three other well-known models, demonstrate that the proposed wind speed forecasting system performs well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aenergy 3at-test 3awind power 3awind speed 0aWind speed forecasting 0aGated recurrent unit 0aCorrelation analysis 0aInput selection 0aMaximum information coefficient 0aHypothesis test1 aLi, Na1 aZhao, Yan1 aWang, Jujie0 tEnergy.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 242 p.122960-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1229603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012100180300001800301520141400319592002801733650002501761650001501786650002201801650002601823650002501849650002001874650001901894650001101913650001301924650000901937653003701946653002201983653001902005653000802024653000902032653001602041653001702057653001602074653002302090700002502113700002202138700002702160700002002187700001602207700002002223700001802243700001702261700001602278700002302294700002002317700001802337700001902355700002402374773013002398856008502528852000902613655001202622IND60566150820221118120823.0170502e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056615082DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b023992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeVierno
Kreuder, Ashley12aA Method for Assessing Greener Alternatives between Chemical Products Following the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry  ap. 2927-2935.  aCompanies are interested in improving chemicals to reduce environmental impacts, also known as green chemistry. The 12 principles of green chemistry outline a framework for identifying a greener chemical or process, spanning aspects in health hazard, ecological risk, and resource efficiency across a product lifecycle. However, that framework does not detail how to measure performance. Furthermore, collecting the data required, beyond simple health hazard ratings, is resource intensive. This paper describes an approach for establishing green chemistry metrics (GCM), to evaluate chemicals and chemical processes against the 12 principles, using readily available data, such as the data compiled in compliance with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). Using the GCM, chemicals or processes can be ranked by a hierarchy of metrics: (1) scores for each of the 12 principles, (2) three category rankings between new and improved chemicals/processes (improved resource use, increased energy efficiency, and reduced human and environmental hazards), and (3) a summary comparison ranking. The GCM approach is unique in that it is robust and flexible enough to encompass a diverse product portfolio, inexpensive to implement with on-hand data, based on generally accepted industry practices, and allows meaningful communications about chemical sustainability options.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acompliance 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental hazards 3aenvironmental impact 3agreen chemistry 3ahealth hazards 3ahumans 3aindustry 3arisk 0a12 Principles of green chemistry 0aChemical products 0aSustainability 0aGHS 0aRank 0aEnvironment 0aHuman health 0aAlternative 0aSafety data sheets1 aHouse-Knight, Tamara1 aWhitford, Jeffrey1 aPonnusamy, Ettigounder1 aMiller, Patrick1 aJesse, Nick1 aRodenborn, Ryan1 aSayag, Shlomo1 aGebel, Malka1 aAped, Inbal1 aSharfstein, Israel1 aManaster, Efrat1 aErgaz, Itzhak1 aHarris, Angela1 aNelowet Grice, Lisa0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Apr. 03, v. 5, no. 4 p.2927-2935dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b023993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04334naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245017300177500001900350520254700369592002802916650002802944650001002972650001802982650001903000650000903019650001103028650001003039650001003049650001003059650001203069650001503081650001303096650003003109650001403139650001403153650001203167650003003179650001803209650001403227650002403241651000903265651001003274651001303284653002803297653001403325653002903339653001403368700001803382700006203400700002403462700002403486773014103510856008403651852000903735655001203744IND60728711020221120123620.0210708e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072871102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2021.1016182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirpourian, Seyyed Saed10aIsolation, molecular identification, and phylogenetic evaluation of Cryptococcus neoformans isolated from pigeon lofts, Psittaciformes, and Passeriformes in Ahvaz, Iran  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCryptococcus neoformans, the main pathogen in immunocompromised patients, is a ubiquitous free-living fungus that can be isolated from avian excreta, soils, and plant material. This study was carried out to determine the infection rate of pigeon lofts, Passeriformes, and Psittaciformes in Ahvaz, the capital of Khuzestan province in Iran and to determine varieties of Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans). The 80 samples were collected from pigeon lofts. Also, 163 feces of captive birds (Passeriformes and Psittaciformes) which kept in Ahvaz pet shops, and the 70 cloacal swabs of pet birds (Passeriformes and psittaciformes) referring to the department of avian medicine (the faculty of veterinary medicine of Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz) were analyzed. The samples were directly inoculated on niger seed agar (NSA) and also enriched in brain heart infusion broth and then inoculated on NSA. Dark brown colonies suspected to C. neoformans subcultured on saborouds dextrose agar and pure cultures subjected to molecular (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) diagnosis. For detection of C. neoformans, primer sets that targeting the CNLAC1 gene were selected and nested PCR was conducted. For identification of C. neoformans varieties, a primer set targeting the STR1 gene was selected. For more accurate confirmation, the purified PCR products of some isolates were also sequenced, and based on the gene sequences, all of the isolates belonged to C. neoformans variety grubii (var. grubii)(serotype A). Totally 16 out of 80 pigeon samples (20%) were contaminated with C. neoformans. The results in pigeons disclosed a 98.64% identity when compared with other strains of C. neoformans (CN1525, T4, and T1) which were previously deposited in GenBank from Italy and Thailand. Also, 21 out of 233 samples from Psittaciformes (9.01%) were contaminated with C. neoformans. The results in Psittaciformes disclosed a 99.7% identity when compared with other strains of C. neoformans (TIMM1313, IFM5882, CN1525, etc.) which were previously deposited in GenBank from Japan and Italy, etc. In the present study, the samples belonging to the passerine order were free of C. neoformans infection. According to the results, C. neoformans is prevalent in pigeon flocks and pet birds including Psittaciformes in the Ahvaz area, and should be considered by pigeon and captive bird breeders, veterinarians, and public health organizations in Ahvaz. The cryptococcus species isolated from captive birds and pigeons could be potential pathogens in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aJapan 3aPasseriformes 3aPsittaciformes 3aagar 3acloaca 3afeces 3afungi 3agenes 3aglucose 3aimmunology 3amedicine 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apigeons 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3aserotypes 3aveterinary medicine 3aIran 3aItaly 3aThailand 0aCryptococcus neoformens 0aisolation 0amolecular identification 0apet birds1 aSharifi, Neda1 aTalazadeh, Forough1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4439-039X1 aJafari, Ramezan Ali1 aGhorbanpoor, Masoud0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2021 June, v. 76 p.101618-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2021.1016183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007200171520170300243592002801946650001501974650001901989650001602008650001802024650002302042650002702065653002102092653003202113653004002145653002502185700002202210700002302232773010102255856008502356852000902441655001202450IND60676059320221120122402.0200221e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067605932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.1054092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Aritra10aSuction-controlled multistage triaxial testing on clayey silty soil  aMultistage triaxial testing offers a potentially reliable and time-saving alternative method of determining the shear strength of soils under suction-controlled conditions, while addressing the issues related to soil variability and lack of replicates. However, evidence of its suitability for testing geomaterials in unsaturated conditions is rather limited. In this work, a series of suction-controlled multistage triaxial tests were performed on compacted specimens of clayey silty soil, wherein each test was performed on the same soil specimen at a constant suction under drained condition, but at varying net confining pressures. The point of termination of the shearing stage was defined through a selection process involving either the stiffness or the volume change in monotonically sheared specimen, based on whichever prevents premature failure of the specimen. This was the first attempt where all the stages of a multistage triaxial test were compared against that from single-stage triaxial tests for validation of the approach. Moreover, the influence of errors introduced by multistage triaxial testing on the shear strength predictions of unsaturated soil was considered by constructing a three-dimensional failure envelope on p-s-τ space using a well-known relation and comparing them against those obtained from single-stage triaxial tests. It was also noted that for determining the shear strength parameters of soil, the multistage testing, reduced the testing times to half of that required by single-stage triaxial testing, which would translate into significant reduction of cost of testing, thereby making unsaturated soil testing much more appealing to the practitioners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprediction 3ashear strength 3asilty soils 3asoil analysis 3asoil heterogeneity 3aunsaturated conditions 0aUnsaturated soil 0aMultistage triaxial testing 0aSuction-controlled triaxial testing 0aCompacted silty soil1 aPuppala, Anand J.1 aHoyos, Laureano R.0 tEngineering geology.g2020 Feb., v. 265 p.105409-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.1054093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007100156300001600227520167000243592002801913650001901941650001301960650001301973650001501986650001502001650002202016650001002038651001402048651001102062651001002073700001602083700001802099700001902117700001702136700001602153773009202169856007302261852000902334655001202343IND60340883320221119062924.0150809e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034088332DNAL7 a10.1111/age.123042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyimo, C.

Sequence polymorphisms of 1256 chickens of the hypervariable region (D‐loop) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were used. Median‐joining networks were constructed to establish evolutionary relationships among mtDNA haplotypes of chickens, which included a wide range of breeds with different origin and history. Chicken breeds which have had their roots in Europe for more than 3000 years were categorized by their founding regions, encompassing Mediterranean type, East European type and Northwest European type. Breeds which were introduced to Europe from Asia since the mid‐19th century were classified as Asian type, and breeds based on crossbreeding between Asian breeds and European breeds were classified as Intermediate type. The last group, Game birds, included fighting birds from Asia. The classification of mtDNA haplotypes was based on Liu et al.'s (2006) nomenclature. Haplogroup E was the predominant clade among the European chicken breeds. The results showed, on average, the highest number of haplotypes, highest haplotype diversity, and highest nucleotide diversity for Asian type breeds, followed by Intermediate type chickens. East European and Northwest European breeds had lower haplotype and nucleotide diversity compared to Mediterranean, Intermediate, Game and Asian type breeds. Results of our study support earlier findings that chicken breeds sampled in Europe have their roots in the Indian subcontinent and East Asia. This is consistent with historical and archaeological evidence of chicken migration routes to Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicken breeds 3achickens 3acrossing 3agame birds 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aroots 3aEast Asia 3aEurope 3aIndia1 aWeigend, A.1 aMsoffe, P.

Phylogenetic and molecular analyses were conducted to characterize the genetic origins of the H11N9 strain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that eight gene segments of strain H11N9 belonged to the Eurasian lineages. Analysis of nucleotide sequence similarity of both the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes revealed the highest homology with A/duck/Kagoshima/KU57/2014 (H11N9), showing 97.70% and 98.00% nucleotide identities, respectively. Additionally, internal genes showed homology higher than 98% compared to those of other isolates derived from duck and wild birds. Both the polymerase acidic (PA) and polymerase basic 1 (PB1) genes were close to the H5N3 strain isolated in China; whereas, other internal genes were closely related to that of avian influenza virus in Japan. A single basic amino acid at the HA cleavage site (PAIASR↓GLF), the lack of a five-amino acid deletion (residue 69–73) in the stalk region of the NA gene, and E627 in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene indicated that the A/Mandarin duck/South Korea/KNU18-12/2018(H11N9) isolate was a typical low-pathogenicity avian influenza. In vitro viral replication of H11N9 showed a lower titer than H1N1 and higher than H9N2. In mice, H11N9 showed lower adaptation than H1N1. The novel A/Mandarin duck/South Korea/KNU18-12/2018(H11N9) isolate may have resulted from an unknown reassortment through the import of multiple wild birds in Japan and Korea in approximately 2016–2017, evolving to produce a different H11N9 compared to the previous H11N9 in Korea (2016). Further reassortment events of this virus occurred in PB1 and PA in China-derived strains. These results indicate that Japanese- and Chinese-derived avian influenza contributes to the genetic diversity of A/Mandarin duck/South Korea/KNU18-12/2018(H11N9) in Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAix galericulata 3aInfluenza A virus 3aamino acids 3aavian influenza 3aducks 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahemagglutinins 3aimports 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3asequence homology 3asialidase 3avirus replication 3aviruses 3awild birds 3aChina 3aJapan 3aSouth Korea1 aNguyẽ̂n, Ngọc Minh,1 aSung, Haan  Woo1 aPark, Hyun 1 aYeo, Seon-Ju 0 tViruses.g2020 Feb. 12, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120202033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100001900157245008600176300001600262500000900278520152000287592002801807650001501835650002101850650001501871650002601886700001401912700001601926773020701942852000902149856009402158655001202252IND2321189220221120180916.0191028e200001  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232118922DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900010015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, A. C.10aAssessing the Impact of Terrestrially Derived Phosphorus on Flowing Water Systems  ap. 117-124.  aepub  aRecent efforts to quantify the terrestrial inputs and cycling of P in agricultural systems are allowing management strategies to be developed to minimize the loss of P. While this approach has had clear advantages for standing waters, potential benefits for flowing freshwater systems are more difficult to predict. As a consequence of the unidirectional and dynamic nature of flow in rivers, temporal and spatial separations between the source of P and the point of potential impact arc introduced when considering a whole watershed. The ability to quantify the residence time of P within any particular part of a river system is therefore essential so that the specific contribution of individual P sources to biological demand can be determined. The smaller algal biomass productivity measured in flowing, compared with standing, waters at a similar supply rate of P indicates the need to consider the roles of other watershed factors in modifying the relationship between growth and P supply. The site-specific nature of responses to P suggests a need to develop a hierarchical classification system where individual river sections can be ranked according to their likely responsiveness to P. The ecoregion concept, combined with stream order, would integrate spatial and temporal aspects of gradient, land use, flow velocity, and water quality. For this to be successful, we must demonstrate a link between perturbations to the terrestrial P cycle, the delivery of P to flowing waters, and a biological impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphorus 3alosses from soil 3awatersheds 3abiogeochemical cycles1 aTwist, H.1 aCodd, G.

Strains of this species can be resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, leaving limited therapeutic options, also lacking in methods for accurate and prompt diagnosis. In this context, AbTJ, a novel phage that infects A. baumannii MDR-TJ, was isolated and characterized, together with its two tail fiber proteins. Morphological analysis revealed that it belongs to Podoviridae family. Its host range, growth characteristics, stability under various conditions, and genomic sequence, were systematically investigated. Bioinformatic analysis showed that AbTJ consists of a circular, double-stranded 42670-bp DNA molecule which contains 62 putative open reading frames (ORFs). Genome comparison revealed that the phage AbTJ is related to the Acinetobacter phage Ab105-1phi (No. KT588074). Tail fiber protein (TFPs) gp52 and gp53 were then identified and confirmed as species-specific proteins. By using a combination of bioluminescent methods and magnetic beads, these TFPs exhibit excellent specificity to detect A. baumannii. The findings of this study can be used to help control opportunistic infections and to provide pathogen-binding modules for further construction of engineered bacteria of diagnosis and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aDNA 3aPodoviridae 3aanti-infective agents 3abacteriophages 3abioinformatics 3abioluminescence 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3agenome 3ahost range 3amagnetism 3aopen reading frames 3aproteins 3asecondary infection 3atherapeutics 3aviral morphology1 aLi, Xiaobo 1 aKang, Guangbo 1 aBai, Liang 1 aWang, Ping 1 aHuang, He 0 tViruses.g2020 Feb. 12, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120202053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245006400208300002000272506007600292520139200368592002801760506003701788650002301825650002001848650001101868650002001879650001401899650001501913650001801928653002301946653001801969653002201987653003002009700002302039700002002062700002102082773019302103856007902296852000902375655001202384IND60178807720221207061350.0150604e20141209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017880772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14207601112doi7 aPMC42673442pmcid7 a254224722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLomas, Michael W.10aImpact of ocean phytoplankton diversity on phosphate uptake  ap. 17540-17545.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have a limited understanding of the consequences of variations in microbial biodiversity on ocean ecosystem functioning and global biogeochemical cycles. A core process is macronutrient uptake by microorganisms, as the uptake of nutrients controls ocean CO ₂ fixation rates in many regions. Here, we ask whether variations in ocean phytoplankton biodiversity lead to novel functional relationships between environmental variability and phosphate (P ᵢ) uptake. We analyzed P ᵢ uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely P ᵢ-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. P ᵢ uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability. Using an eco-evolutionary model as well as observations of in situ uptake across the region, we confirmed that differences among populations lead to previously uncharacterized relationships between ambient P ᵢ concentrations and uptake. Supported by novel theory, this work provides a robust empirical basis for describing and understanding assimilation of limiting nutrients in the oceans. Thus, it demonstrates that microbial biodiversity, beyond cell size, is important for understanding the global cycling of nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalytical methods 3abiogeochemistry 3amodels 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphytoplankton 0aphosphate kinetics 0acyanobacteria 0aadaptive dynamics 0aeco-evolutionary dynamics1 aBonachela, Juan A.1 aLevin, Simon A.1 aMartiny, Adam C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 9, v. 111, no. 49 p.17540-17545dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14207601113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100007000149245014500219500001900364520191500383592002802298650001702326650000902343650001402352650001902366650001802385650001502403650001202418650003102430650002602461650001302487650001302500650000902513650000902522650002502531650001202556650001202568650002502580650001802605651001102623653002802634653001902662653002102681700002702702700006702729700002102796773010702817856008402924852000903008655001203017IND60728711420221119152622.0210322e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072871142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2021.1049732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos Mantovanelli, Bruno1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4291-172910aGeostatistical interpolation based ternary diagrams for estimating water retention properties in soils in the Center-South regions of Brazil  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to develop ternary diagrams to estimate water retention in the soil θ₋₃₃ ₖPₐ and θ₋₁₅₀₀ ₖPₐ corresponding to the field capacity and wilting point, respectively and available soil water (ASW) using geostatistical approach. The data were extracted from the physical-water base of irrigated areas linked to the Irriga® System belonging to the Rural Engineering Department of the Federal University of Santa Maria. The database provides information regarding the physical characterization of soils in irrigated areas in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, Goiás, Mato Grosso, São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Bahia. The data included 11,193 observations covering texture (sand, silt and clay), water retention properties (θ₋₃₃ ₖPₐ and θ₋₁₅₀₀ ₖPₐ) and structural properties (bulk density and total porosity). The measured values of the water content in the soil were displayed in the ternary diagram according to the coordinates provided by the particle size distribution determined in the soil samples. Estimates of water content (cm³ cm⁻³) using the kriging method were performed using only the particle size distribution (sand, silt and clay). To obtain the spatial distribution of soil water retention values in the texture triangle, the use of the ordinary kriging estimator was proposed. The uncertainty analysis resulted in an Root mean square error (RMSE) below 0.048 cm³ cm⁻³ when comparing the interpolated water content and observed in the values of θ₋₃₃ ₖPₐ and θ₋₁₅₀₀ ₖPₐ, with the subdivisions by ranges of bulk density having the lowest uncertainties, highlighting the importance of subdividing the database by classes based on structural properties. Ternary diagrams can act as useful and simplified tools to estimate these properties just by applying the particle size distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aclay 3adatabases 3afield capacity 3ageostatistics 3airrigation 3akriging 3aparticle size distribution 3aplant available water 3aporosity 3aresearch 3asand 3asilt 3asoil water retention 3atexture 3atillage 3auncertainty analysis 3awater content 3aBrazil 0aPermanent wilting point 0aGeoestatistics 0aOrdinary kriging1 aPetry, Mirta Teresinha1 aBroetto Weiler, Elenice1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3389-42341 aCarlesso, Reimar0 tSoil & tillage research.g2021 May, v. 209 p.104973-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.1049733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009000164300001400254520139000268592002801658650002601686650001801712650001301730650001401743650001601757650001301773650001601786650002201802651001001824653002101834653001801855653002401873653001401897653001301911700001601924700002101940700002001961700001901981700001402000700001802014700001802032700001902050700001602069773013802085856008502223852000902308655001202317IND60544220320221118054217.0190416e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054422032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2014.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGui, Yang10aAgaricus section Arvenses: three new species in highland subtropical Southwest China  ap. 79-94.  aAgaricus is a genus of saprobic basidiomycetes with more than 400 species recognized worldwide, with about 50 species known in China. Our objective was to investigate three new species of section Arvenses in highland subtropical Southwest China. Agaricus guizhouensis is a new species characterized by a white pileus with yellowish squamules, small ellipsoid spores and cheilocystidia with yellowish-brown pigments; another new species, Agaricus longistipes is recognized by its slender stipe, and its elongate-ellipsoid basidiospores; the third new one, Agaricus megalocarpus is remarkable by its large size and its pileus surface covered with fine brown squamules. It is firstly reported for Guizhou Province that Agaricus abruptibulbus, Agaricus flocculosipes, and Agaricus subrufescens are illustrated. Two probable new species require further studying. A phylogenetic analyses of rDNA-ITS sequence data belonging to section Arvenses showed that the section Arvenses is monophyletic and can be subdivided in five branches, the branch of A. subrufescens and four clades (A–D). The eight species from highland subtropical Southwest China were distributed in all five branches, indicating that this highland is at the climatic crossroads. The white pileus trait and the potential interest are discussed. These data suggest a potential species richness that remains to be discovered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus subrufescens 3abasidiospores 3abranches 3amonophyly 3anew species 3apigments 3asaprophytes 3aspecies diversity 3aChina 0aEdible mushrooms 0aITS sequences 0aMedicinal mushrooms 0aPhylogeny 0aTaxonomy1 aZhu, Guo-S.1 aCallac, Philippe1 aHyde, Kevin D.,1 aParra, Luis-A.1 aChen, Jie1 aYang, Tong-J.1 aHuang, Wan-B.1 aGong, Guang-L.1 aLiu, Zuo-Y.0 tFungal biology.g2015 Mar., v. 119, no. 2-3 p.79-94dElsevier LtdaThe British Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2014.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014500159520137500304592002801679650001501707650002201722650002001744650000901764650003501773650001001808650002701818650001501845650001901860650002501879650001401904650001101918650001301929651001001942651001201952700002201964700002301986700002702009700002102036700002202057773012102079856007302200852000902273655001202282IND60704119620221119212512.0200722e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070411962DNAL7 a10.3390/v120201342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEze, Ukamaka  U10aMolecular Detection of Rabies Lyssaviruses from Dogs in Southeastern Nigeria: Evidence of TransboundaryTransmission of Rabies in West Africa  aDespite being the first country to register confirmed cases of Mokola and Lagos bat lyssaviruses (two very distant lyssaviruses), knowledge gaps, particularly on the molecular epidemiology of lyssaviruses, still exist in Nigeria. A total of 278 specimens were collected from dogs in southeastern Nigeria between October 2015 and July 2016, and 23 (8.3%) of these tested positive for lyssaviruses with the direct fluorescent antibody test (DFA). The lyssaviruses were genetically characterized by amplifying the highly conserved nucleoprotein (N) gene of the rabies lyssaviruses (RABVs) of the viral genome. Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences showed that all the RABV sequences in this study were of the Africa-2 lineage. Our results demonstrated that transboundary transmission of rabies lyssavirus is a key event, given that one of the RABV sequences (MN196576) clustered with rabies variants from neighboring Niger Republic. Furthermore, three RABVs from dogs from Anambra State clustered separately forming a novel and distinct group. Our results demonstrated that transboundary transmission of RABLVs is a key driver in the spread of rabies in West Africa. In order for the successful control of this zoonotic disease, a multinational stepwise surveillance and elimination of rabies in Africa by 2030 is probably the solution for regional elimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aRabies lyssavirus 3adisease control 3adogs 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3amolecular epidemiology 3amonitoring 3anucleoproteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3arabies 3azoonoses 3aNiger 3aNigeria1 aNgoepe, Ernest  C1 aAnene, Boniface  M1 aEzeokonkwo, Romanus  C1 aNwosuh, Chika  I1 aSabeta, Claude  T0 tViruses.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120201343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010500158300001600263520137800279592002801657650002001685650002301705650003001728650002701758650002401785650001901809650001001828650000901838650001001847650001501857651001001872700001701882700002101899700001701920700001601937700002701953700002101980700002002001700001602021773011802037856007302155852000902228655001202237IND60340883720221119063004.0150809e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034088372DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.121242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPALOMAR, A.

The presence of Anaplasma spp. in ticks from birds, as well as in Haemaphysalis punctata (Ixodida: Ixodidae) specimens collected from cattle and vegetation in northern Spain was investigated. A total of 336 ticks from birds [174 Ixodes frontalis (Ixodida: Ixodidae), 108 H. punctata, 34 Hyalomma marginatum (Ixodida: Ixodidae), 17 Ixodes ricinus (Ixodida: Ixodidae) and three Ixodes spp.], and 181 H. punctata specimens collected from cattle (n = 71) and vegetation (n = 110) were analysed. Anaplasma bovis was detected in five H. punctata, including two from birds (1.9%) and three from vegetation (2.7%). Four I. frontalis (2.3%) (one co‐infected with ‘Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii’) and one I. ricinus (5.9%) removed from birds, as well as four H. punctata (5.6%) collected from cattle showed Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection. In addition, Anaplasma centrale was found in two H. punctata, one from a cow (1.4%) and the other from vegetation (0.9%). This study represents the first evidence of the presence of A. bovis in European ticks, and reports the first detection of A. bovis and A. centrale in H. punctata, and the first finding of A. phagocytophilum and ‘Ca.

In this region, the fructification pruning is the first and one of the most influential cultural treatments of the productive cycle. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of mechanical pruning on growth, development, physiology, and yield of mango cv. Tommy Atkins grown in the tropical semiarid. An experiment was carried out in Casa Nova, Bahia, Brazil, with mangoes ‘Tommy Atkins.’ The experimental design was in randomized blocks, with two treatments (manual and mechanical pruning), evaluated in subdivided plots over time (evaluation dates), with five replications and four plants per plot. There was a significant interaction between the types of pruning and the dates of evaluation for the number of flushes emitted per branch, branch diameter, light intensity, nitrogen leaf content, leaf proline, branch proline, and branch soluble carbohydrates. Mechanical pruning increases the length of sprout and decreases the percentage of plants with symptoms of floral malformation. Mechanical pruning presented a lower production compared with manual pruning in the first evaluation cycle after continuous manual pruning, suggesting an initial impact, but with the potential for adaptation of the plants in the next productive cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aexperimental design 3afructification 3afruits 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3amangoes 3anitrogen 3aproline 3ariver valleys 3aBrazil 0aMangifera indica L. 0acultural treatments 0afloral induction 0aagricultural mechanization1 aPereira, Renan Nunes1 aSilva, Luan dos Santos1 aLobo, Jackson Teixeira1 aAraújo e Amariz, Renata1 aCavalcante, Ítalo Herbert Lucena0 tInternational journal of fruit science.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 21, no. 1 p.1059-1072dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3979069x1553-86217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15538362.2021.19893583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245017900208300001100387520178200398592002802180650001402208650001702222650001402239650002102253650001802274650002102292650000902313650001502322650001402337650001502351650002302366650001802389650001302407700002202420700001902442700001702461773012202478856008302600852000902683655001202692IND60744656820221121005039.0220421e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074465682DNAL7 a10.1186/s12711-021-00652-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheper, Carsten1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1189-229712aA variance component estimation approach to infer associations between Mendelian polledness and quantitative production and female fertility traits in German Simmental cattle  ap. 60.  aBACKGROUND: Managing beneficial Mendelian characteristics in dairy cattle breeding programs implies that the correlated genetic effects are considered to avoid possible adverse effects in selection processes. The Mendelian trait polledness in cattle is traditionally associated with the belief that the polled locus has unfavorable effects on breeding goal traits. This may be due to the inferior breeding values of former polled bulls and cows in cattle breeds, such as German Simmental, or to pleiotropic or linkage effects of the polled locus. METHODS: We focused on a variance component estimation approach that uses a marker-based numerator relationship matrix reflecting gametic relationships at the polled locus to test for direct pleiotropic or linked quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects of the polled locus on relevant traits. We applied the approach to performance, health, and female fertility traits in German Simmental cattle. RESULTS: Our results showed no evidence for any pleiotropic QTL effects of the polled locus on test-day production traits milk yield and fat percentage, on the mastitis indicator ‘somatic cell score’, and on several female fertility traits, i.e. 56 days non return rate, days open and days to first service. We detected a significant and unfavorable QTL effect accounting for 6.6% of the genetic variance for protein percentage only. CONCLUSIONS: Pleiotropy does not explain the lower breeding values and phenotypic inferiority of polled German Simmental sires and cows relative to the horned population in the breed. Thus, intensified selection in the polled population will contribute to increased selection response in breeding goal traits and genetic merit and will narrow the deficit in breeding values for production traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSimmental 3adairy cattle 3aevolution 3afemale fertility 3agenetic merit 3agenetic variance 3aloci 3amilk yield 3aphenotype 3apleiotropy 3aselection response 3asomatic cells 3avariance1 aEmmerling, Reiner1 aGötz, Kay-Uwe1 aKönig, Sven0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2021 Dec., v. 53, no. 1 p.60-60dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-021-00652-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245008000173300001600253520169400269592002801963650001601991650001502007650001802022650002602040650002702066650001202093650001802105650001602123650001502139650001702154650004402171650004802215650001502263650003702278650001302315653001702328653002602345653001302371653002002384653003302404700002002437700001702457700001902474700001702493700002202510773010602532856008702638852000902725655001202734IND60567613720221120191358.0170502e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056761372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Tzu-Hsuen10aMetabolic profiling of residents in the vicinity of a petrochemical complex  ap. 260-269.  aNo previous studies have simultaneously measured the biomarkers of environmental exposure and metabolome perturbation in residents affected by industrial pollutants. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic effects of environmental pollutants such as vanadium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on residents in the vicinity of a petrochemical complex. The study subjects were 160 residents, including 80 high-exposure subjects exposed to high levels of vanadium and PAHs and 80 age- and gender-matched low-exposure subjects living within a 40-km radius of a petrochemical complex. The exposure biomarkers vanadium and 1-hydroxypyrene and four oxidative/nitrosative stress biomarkers were measured in these subjects. Plasma samples from the study subjects were also analyzed using 1H NMR spectroscopy for metabolic profiling. The results showed that the urinary levels of vanadium and 1-hydroxypyrene in the high-exposure subjects were 40- and 20-fold higher, respectively, than those in the low-exposure subjects. Higher urinary levels of stress biomarkers, including 8-OHdG, HNE-MA, 8-isoPF2α, and 8-NO2Gua, were also observed among the high-exposure subjects compared with the low-exposure subjects. Partial least squares discriminant analysis of the plasma metabolome demonstrated a clear separation between the high- and low-exposure subjects; the intensities of amino acids and carbohydrate metabolites were lower in the high-exposure subjects compared with the low-exposure subjects. The exposure to vanadium and PAHs may cause a reduction in the levels of amino acids and carbohydrates by elevating PPAR and insulin signaling, as well as oxidative/nitrosative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abiomarkers 3acarbohydrates 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenvironmental exposure 3ainsulin 3aleast squares 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3avanadium 0aMetabolomics 0aPetrochemical complex 0aVanadium 0a1-Hydroxypyrene 0aOxidative/nitrosative stress1 aChung, Ming-Kei1 aLin, Jingyu,1 aChen, Shu-Ting1 aWu, Kuen-Yuh1 aChan, Chang-Chuan0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 548-549 p.260-269dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01799naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005700166300001600223500001400239520075700253592002801010650002001038650001501058650001801073650001101091650001401102650001101116650001701127650001501144700001601159700001801175700001701193700001601210773010901226856008101335852000901416655001201425IND60477798020221122145848.0160601e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047779802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-015-0436-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurnell, A.

The study of the Castanea flowering represents an important tool for evaluating the ecological conservation of North-Western Spain woodland and the possible changes in the chestnut distribution due to recent climatic change. The Castanea pollen production and dispersal capacity may cause hypersensitivity reactions in the sensitive human population due to the relationship between patients with chestnut pollen allergy and a potential cross reactivity risk with other pollens or plant foods. In addition to Castanea pollen's importance as a pollinosis agent, its study is also essential in North-Western Spain due to the economic impact of the industry around the chestnut tree cultivation and its beekeeping interest. The aim of this research is to develop an Artificial Neural Networks for predict the Castanea pollen concentration in the atmosphere of the North-West Spain area by means a 20years data set.It was detected an increasing trend of the total annual Castanea pollen concentrations in the atmosphere during the study period. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) implemented in this study show a great ability to predict Castanea pollen concentration one, two and three days ahead. The model to predict the Castanea pollen concentration one day ahead shows a high linear correlation coefficient of 0.784 (individual ANN) and 0.738 (multiple ANN). The results obtained improved those obtained by the classical methodology used to predict the airborne pollen concentrations such as time series analysis or other models based on the correlation of pollen levels with meteorological variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea sativa 3aapiculture 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3across reaction 3adeciduous forests 3aecology 3aeconomic impact 3aflowering 3afood industry 3afoods 3aforestry 3ahay fever 3ahuman population 3ameteorological parameters 3aneural networks 3apatients 3apollen 3arisk 3atime series analysis 3atrees 3awoodlands 3aSpain 0aCastanea pollen 0aArtificial Neural Networks 0aModelling 0aTime series analysis1 aFernández-González, M.1 aRodríguez-Rajo, F.J.1 aLópez, D.1 aMejuto, J.C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 548-549 p.110-121dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012400176300001400300500001900314520141200333592002801745650001301773650001901786650001901805650001501824650002501839650002401864650001401888650001301902650001101915650002401926650001501950653003301965653002201998653002202020653001502042653002302057700002102080700001902101700002202120700002202142700002102164700001702185700001502202700001702217700002502234773012302259856008102382852000902463655001202472IND60717975720221122155750.0201118e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071797572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2017.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuna Coronell, Johana A.14aThe Immunome of Colon Cancer: Functional In Silico Analysis of Antigenic Proteins Deduced from IgG Microarray Profiling  ap. 73-84.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCharacterization of the colon cancer immunome and its autoantibody signature from differentially-reactive antigens (DIRAGs) could provide insights into aberrant cellular mechanisms or enriched networks associated with diseases. The purpose of this study was to characterize the antibody profile of plasma samples from 32 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 32 controls using proteins isolated from 15,417 human cDNA expression clones on microarrays. 671 unique DIRAGs were identified and 632 were more highly reactive in CRC samples. Bioinformatics analyses reveal that compared to control samples, the immunoproteomic IgG profiling of CRC samples is mainly associated with cell death, survival, and proliferation pathways, especially proteins involved in EIF2 and mTOR signaling. Ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL7, RPL22, and RPL27A) and CRC-related genes such as APC, AXIN1, E2F4, MSH2, PMS2, and TP53 were highly enriched. In addition, differential pathways were observed between the CRC and control samples. Furthermore, 103 DIRAGs were reported in the SEREX antigen database, demonstrating our ability to identify known and new reactive antigens. We also found an overlap of 7 antigens with 48 “CRC genes.” These data indicate that immunomics profiling on protein microarrays is able to reveal the complexity of immune responses in cancerous diseases and faithfully reflects the underlying pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aautoantibodies 3abioinformatics 3acell death 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acomputer simulation 3adatabases 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aprotein microarrays 3aproteomics 0aAutoantibody tumor biomarker 0aCancer immunology 0aColorectal cancer 0aImmunomics 0aProtein microarray1 aSergelen, Khulan1 aHofer, Philipp1 aGyurján, István1 aBrezina, Stefanie1 aHettegger, Peter1 aLeeb, Gernot1 aMach, Karl1 aGsur, Andrea1 aWeinhäusel, Andreas0 tGenomics, proteomics & bioinformatics.g2018 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.73-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12107x1672-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2017.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011800158300001800276520156700294592002801861650002101889650002001910650003101930650001701961650001301978650001001991650001702001650001502018650001702033650002102050650001102071650001502082650001102097650002002108650003002128650001502158650002602173650001302199650002202212650001602234650001502250650000902265650003202274700001802306700001902324700001602343700001602359773012402375856007402499852000902573655001202582IND60639880620221119043252.0190503e20170621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063988062DNAL7 a10.1039/c6fo01851c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xing Yan10aMetabolic profile and underlying improved bio-activity of Fructus aurantii immaturus by human intestinal bacteria  ap. 2193-2201.  aFructus aurantii immaturus (FAI) is the dried young fruit of Citrus aurantium L. or Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the metabolic fate of FAI upon incubation with human intestinal bacteria, meanwhile to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of FAI and the transformed Fructus aurantii immaturus (TFAI). The water extract of FAI was anaerobically incubated with human intestinal bacterial suspensions for 48 h at 37 °C. Liquid chromatography-hybridised with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to identify FAI metabolites. A total of 45 compounds were identified in FAI, eleven of which were metabolized by human intestinal bacteria. Nine major metabolites were identified as eriodictyol, naringenin, hesperetin, luteolin, apigenin, chryseriol, isosakuranetin, phloretin and diosmetin. The metabolic profile of FAI was elucidated on the basis of metabolite information. We found that the concentrations of acetic, propionic and butyric acids in FAI culture were all increased during fermentation relative to those of the control. Further bioactive evaluations showed that TFAI exhibited more potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory abilities than FAI in vitro. Additionally, in vivo experiment confirmed that FAI significantly attenuated the blood endotoxin and TNF-α levels in the conventional rats compared to those of pseudo-germ-free (PGF) rats. This study revealed that metabolites may play a key role in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities of FAI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus aurantium 3aCitrus sinensis 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aapigenin 3ablood 3abutyric acid 3aendotoxins 3afermentation 3afructus aurantii 3afruits 3ahesperetin 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aliquid chromatography 3aluteolin 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3anaringenin 3arats 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aFan, Meng Lin1 aWang, Huai You1 aYu, Bo yang1 aLiu, Ji Hua0 tFood & function.g2017 June 21, v. 8, no. 6 p.2193-2201dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6fo01851c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04145naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245015500160300001800315520222400333592002802557650002602585650001302611650002702624650001902651650001202670650001602682650002102698650001802719650001502737650001802752650001802770650002202788650001102810650002202821650001402843650002102857650001402878650001202892650001402904650001202918650001802930650000902948650001302957650001502970650002802985650002403013650001003037650001403047650001803061650002103079650001803100653002003118653001603138653002203154653001403176700002703190700002503217773015303242856007903395852000903474655001203483IND60564367120221118094858.0190318e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056436712DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-117942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmanlou, H.10aEffects of rumen undegradable protein supplementation on productive performance and indicators of protein and energy metabolism in Holstein fresh cows  ap. 3628-3640.  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effects of feeding increased dietary crude protein (CP) on productive performance and indicators of protein and energy metabolism during 21 d postpartum. Thirty multiparous Holstein dairy cows were balanced by previous lactation milk yield, body condition score (BCS) at calving, and parity and randomly allocated to 1 of 3 dietary treatments from calving until 21 d postpartum. Dietary treatments were 16.0% CP with 5.0% rumen undegradable protein (RUP) based on dry matter (DM) (16CP), 18.7% CP with 7.0% RUP based on DM (19CP), and 21.4% CP with 9.0% RUP based on DM (21CP). Diets were similar in net energy for lactation (approximately 1.7 Mcal/kg of DM) and CP levels were increased with corn gluten meal and fish meal. Dry matter intake (DMI) was increased by increasing dietary CP levels from 16.0 to 19.0% of DM, but dietary CP beyond 19.0% had no effect on DMI. Milk yields were 4.7 and 6.5 kg/d greater in cows fed the 19CP and 21CP diets versus those fed the 16CP diet, whereas 4% fat-corrected milk was greater for cows fed the 21CP than the 16CP diet (36.0 vs. 31.4 kg/d). Milk protein content and yield, lactose yield, and milk urea nitrogen were elevated by increased dietary CP. Milk lactose content and fat yield were not different among dietary treatments, but milk fat content tended to decline with increasing content of CP in diets. High CP levels increased milk N secretion but decreased milk N efficiency. Apparent digestibility of DM, CP, and neutral detergent fiber was greater on the 19CP and 21CP diets compared with the 16CP diet. Cows fed the 19CP and 21CP diets lost less body condition relative to those fed the 16CP diet over 21 d postpartum. Feeding higher CP levels increased the concentrations of serum albumin, albumin to globulin ratio, and urea nitrogen and decreased aspartate aminotransferase, nonesterified fatty acids, and β-hydroxybutyrate, but had no effect on globulin, glucose, cholesterol, or triacylglycerol. These findings indicated that elevating dietary CP up to 19.0% of DM using RUP supplements improved DMI, productive performance and the indicators of protein and energy metabolism from calving to 21 d postpartum.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aHolstein 3aaspartate transaminase 3abody condition 3acalving 3acholesterol 3acorn gluten meal 3acrude protein 3adairy cows 3adairy protein 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3afish meal 3afree fatty acids 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3alactation 3alactose 3alipid content 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk yield 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aprotein supplements 3arumen 3asecretion 3aserum albumin 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea nitrogen 0adietary protein 0aperformance 0adry matter intake 0afresh cow1 aFarahani, T.

We strictly controlled the false positive rate associated with SWATH MS signals and carefully selected the target peptides coupled with SWATH and MRM. We collected 10 samples of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues paired with tumors and adjacent regions and quantified 1758 unique proteins with FDR 1% at protein level using SWATH, in which 467 proteins were abundance-dependent with ESCC. After carefully evaluating the SWATH MS signals of the up-regulated proteins, we selected 120 proteins for MRM verification. MRM analysis of the pooled and individual esophageal tissues resulted in 116 proteins that exhibited similar abundance response modes to ESCC that were acquired with SWATH. Because the ESCC-related proteins consisted of a high percentile of secreted proteins, we conducted the MRM assay on patient sera that were collected from pre- and postoperation. Of the 116 target proteins, 42 were identified in the ESCC sera, including 11 with lowered abundances postoperation. Coupling SWATH and MRM is thus feasible and efficient for the discovery and verification of cancer-related protein biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3apatients 3apeptides 3aprotein secretion 3aproteins 3aproteome 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atissues 0aSWATH 0aMRM 0aESCC 0abiomarker1 aLou, Xiaomin1 aSun, Yulin1 aXu, Shaohang1 aZi, Jin1 aWang, Quanhui1 aZhou, Baojin1 aHan, Bo1 aWu, Lin1 aZhao, Xiaohang1 aLin, Liang1 aLiu, Siqi0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 14, no. 9 p.3793-3803dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.5b004383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013500169500001900304520166000323592002801983650002102011650001702032650002102049650001902070650001202089650001802101650002102119650002102140650000902161650001302170650002902183650002002212653000902232653002102241653001102262653000802273700002202281700002502303700002402328773012002352856008202472852000902554655001202563IND60717975920221122123554.0210219e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071797592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbd.2020.1007532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodgers, Maria L.14aThe impact of salinity and dissolved oxygen regimes on transcriptomic immune responses to oil in early life stage Fundulus grandis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding the effects of oil exposure on early life stage fish species is critical to fully assessing the environmental impacts of oil spills. Oil released from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill reached habitats where estuarine fish routinely spawn. In addition, estuaries are highly dynamic environments, therefore, fish in these areas are routinely exposed to varying salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, each of which are known to modulate transcriptional responses. Fish exposed to oil often display altered immune competence, and several studies have shown that Deepwater Horizon oil in particular causes modulation of various immune functions. However, few studies have directly examined how environmental parameters may affect oil-induced immunomodulation, particularly in early life stage fishes when the immune system is still developing. To this end, we examined transcriptional patterns of immune genes and pathways in Fundulus grandis larvae to various oil (0, 15 μg/L), salinity (3, 30 ppt), and DO (2.5, 6 mg/L) regimes in a fully factorial design. Our results suggest that immune pathways are generally activated in all treatment groups with the exception of the Low Salinity/No Oil/Hypoxia treatment where immune pathways are largely suppressed, and the High Salinity/No Oil/Hypoxia treatment where pathways are unchanged. The High Salinity/Oil/Hypoxia treatment had the largest number of enriched immune pathways (44 as defined by IPA and 43 as defined by ConsensusPathDB), indicating that oil under certain environmental conditions has the potential to further modulate immune-related genes, pathways, and responses in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFundulus grandis 3abiochemistry 3adissolved oxygen 3aestuarine fish 3ahypoxia 3aimmune system 3aimmunocompetence 3aimmunomodulation 3aoils 3asalinity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 0aFish 0aEarly life stage 0aImmune 0aOil1 aSerafin, Jennifer1 aSepulveda, Maria S.,1 aGriffitt, Robert J.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Mar., v. 37 p.100753-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2020.1007533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009600169300001600265520101000281592002801291650002401319650001001343650001801353650003401371650001001405700001601415700001401431773011101445856008101556852000901637655001201646IND60438156820221117225021.0151023e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043815682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-003-0783-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-Capillas, C.10aPreservation of bulk-stored Norway lobster at 1 °C in controlled and modified atmospheres  ap. 466-470.  aThis paper examines the effect on biochemical and sensory parameters of Norway Lobster (Nephrops novergicus (L)) of two gas mixes—60/15/25 and 40/40/20 (CO₂/O₂/N₂(%))—used as modified and controlled atmospheres for bulk storage at 1 °C.The biochemical results indicate that lots stored in the atmospheres kept good for up to 21 days as compared to only 14 days for the control. The biochemical parameters in the control increased significantly throughout storage. The same parameters only began to increase in the atmosphere lots on the 14th day of storage. In no case did the TMA concentration exceed 5 mg/100 g. The only lot rejected upon inspection in the course of storage was the control at 21 days. The parameters that scored worst in all lots were colour and odour, owing to the effect of the melanosis inhibitor. The lots stored in the 60/15/25 mix scored best irrespective of atmosphere type. There were no significant differences between controlled and modified atmosphere samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNephrops norvegicus 3acolor 3afood research 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aodors1 aMorales, J.1 aMoral, A.0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2003 Dec., v. 217, no. 6 p.466-470dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-003-0783-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003700153245012100190300001600311500001500327520157100342592002801913650002001941650002101961650002401982650001602006650001302022650003302035650001902068650000902087650001402096650001302110650002302123650001802146650002502164650002202189650001202211651001102223653002202234653001302256653001602269653001102285653002002296700002402316700003702340773010602377856008702483852000902570655001202579IND60567614120221120224803.0170502e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056761412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Dener Márcio da Silva10aMolecular characterization of soil organic matter from native vegetation–pasture–sugarcane transitions in Brazil  ap. 450-462.  a2019-12-06  aReplacing pastures (PA) with sugarcane (SG) has been deemed an agronomically feasible strategy for sugarcane expansion in Brazil. However, there are some uncertainties about the environmental impacts regarding this land use change (LUC), mainly related to soil organic matter (SOM), a key factor of environmental sustainability of Brazilian ethanol. LUC-related losses of SOM can overcome the C savings from biofuels. The molecular composition of SOM was evaluated to understand the C dynamics regarding LUC from PA to SG, using native vegetation (NV) as reference. Our study area was located in the south-central region of Brazil. Soil sampling was performed at three depths (0–0.1m, 0.2–0.3m and 0.9–1m) in three representative sites with known LUC history and management practice since 1970. Pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py–GC/MS) was chosen to study SOM chemistry. Content and isotopic composition of soil organic C and N were also determined. The LUC caused decreases on C and N contents and on δ13C isotopic values. Depth was the major factor that influenced SOM composition, while the influence of LUC was mainly evident in surface soils and diminished rapidly with depth. The main difference in SOM composition undergoing the conversion PA-SG was a higher contribution from compounds associated to fresh litter inputs. The high contribution from fresh litter, having a relatively low mean residence time and increasing decomposition rates, is probably a major factor that drives C losses in areas undergoing sugarcane expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3anitrogen content 3asoil organic carbon 3auncertainty 3apastures 3aenvironmental sustainability 3achromatography 3asoil 3asugarcane 3abiofuels 3aindigenous species 3asoil sampling 3aenvironmental impact 3amass spectrometry 3aethanol 3aBrazil 0aPyrolysis–GC/MS 0aBiofuels 0aSoil carbon 0acarbon 0aLand use change1 aSchellekens, Judith1 aCerri, Carlos Eduardo Pellegrino0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 548-549 p.450-462dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01754naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008400157300002000241500001900261520078700280592002801067650001201095650002001107650001701127650001301144650001801157700001401175700001601189700001501205773012501220856007401345852000901419655001201428IND60731176820221121074914.0210318e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073117682DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra10766b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Yafeng10aPreparation of N/S doped carbon dots and their application in nitrite detection  ap. 10922-10928.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDetection of carcinogens is generally recognized to be meaningful, especially for nitrites (NO₂⁻). Here blue-green fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) were successfully synthesized by using p-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, and their surfaces were identified to be abundant in the functional groups of amino, hydroxyl, and sulfuric acid. Importantly, the sulfuric acid group and aromatic primary ammonia groups on the surfaces of CDs showed the interactions with the nitrites to cause fluorescence quenching. The novel CDs showed high sensitivity and selectivity for NO₂⁻ detection with a low detection limit of 0.03 mM in water due to the fluorescence quenching effect of the CDs.

We hypothesize that some cows are genetically less suited to cope with these metabolic needs than others, leading to adverse follow-up effects on longevity. To test this, we designed a reaction norm model in which functional lifetime was linked to the metabolic challenge in the beginning of the first lactation. As challenge variables, we used either the sum of milk yield or the accumulated fat-to-protein ratio of the first 3 test-days (<120 d in milk), pre-adjusted for herd-test-day variance. We defined a random regression sire model, in which a random slope was estimated for each sire to assess whether a bull had robust (neutral or positive slopes) or non-robust (negative slopes) daughters. We fitted the model to data of ∼580,000 daughters of ∼5,000 Brown Swiss bulls with suitable observations available (≥10 daughters per bull). To validate our proposed model and assess the reliability of the estimated (co)variance components, we conducted an extensive bootstrap approach. For both challenge variables, we found the sire variance for the slope of the random regression to be significantly different from zero, suggesting a genetic component for metabolic adaptability.

In this project, we used multi-temporal satellite images(IRS LISS-III) for the years of 2006 and 2010 and topographical map as raw data source for monitoring and assessment of land use and land cover changes. The supervised classification of both the satellite images and analytical works are carried out in ERDAS IMAGINE 9.2 and ARC GIS 9.3 softwares. LU/LC classification of temporal satellite images represent the overall change scenario of the several years and the approach of change matrix analysis is determined the overall reduction and increment of LU/LC areas. The result demonstrated that, the overall boundary area of Guwahati city has been decreased from 2006 to 2010. In that, Scrub land and Population increased rapidly, whereas, Dense vegetation class is decreased due to rapid urbanization which leads to environmental degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3acase studies 3aclassification 3aenvironmental degradation 3aexhibitions 3ageographic information systems 3aland 3aland use and land cover maps 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apaper 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3atopographic maps 3aurbanization 3avillages 3aIndia 0aIRS LISS-III 0aRemote sesing and GIS 0aLU/LC classification 0achange analysis 0aland management1 aChoudhury, M.R0 tInternational journal of environmental sciences.g2015, v. 5, no. 6 p.1061-1077dIntegrated Publishing AssociationwJournal:6151x0976-44027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.6088/ijes.20140501001003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245011000161300001600271520135200287592002801639650002101667650001101688650001301699650002001712650001901732650001401751650001001765650001401775650001501789650001101804650001901815650001301834650002201847651001001869651001601879651001501895653001501910653002101925653002101946653002301967653002601990700001902016700002002035700001202055700001502067773008802082856007802170852000902248655001202257IND60126350420221118051331.0151105e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012635042DNAL7 a10.1675/063.037.04112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong-Ping, Liu10aSatellite Tracking of Scaly-Sided Merganser (Mergus squamatus) Breeding in Lesser Xingan Mountains, China  ap. 432-438.  aThis study provides the first detailed information on the migration routes and stopover sites for the endangered Scaly-sided Merganser (Mergus squamatus) breeding in Northeast China. Scaly-sided Mergansers (n = 4) were tagged with Platform Transmitter Terminals at Dailing in the southeastern Lesser Xingan Mountains of China during the late breeding seasons of 2010 and 2011. Two Scaly-sided Mergansers completed their autumn migration across the Yellow Sea, lasting 58 and 26 days, respectively, arriving on their wintering grounds at Yuanjiang River in Hunan Province and Xiushui River in Jiangxi Province of China. Both of the Scaly-sided Mergansers stopped at four sites and travelled 2,600 km from their breeding to wintering grounds. After a stay of 120 days, one of the marked individuals departed its wintering ground and returned to Dailing on 19 April 2012 and used a similar route as that in autumn migration and stopped at two sites. Wetlands at Ryonghung Gang estuary in North Korea, Yunshui River and Chidong Lake in Hubei Province of China, and Songjiang River in Jilin Province of China were used as major stopover sites. The determination of previously unknown wintering grounds and stopover sites in China and North Korea provides opportunity to discover more populations of the Scaly-sided Merganser outside its breeding areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMergus squamatus 3aautumn 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3abreeding sites 3aestuaries 3alakes 3amountains 3apopulation 3arivers 3astopover sites 3awetlands 3awintering grounds 3aChina 3aNorth Korea 3aYellow Sea 0a—Dailing 0aMergus squamatus 0amigration routes 0asatellite tracking 0aScaly-sided Merganser1 aCheng-Quan, Li1 aGuo-Gang, Zhang1 aJun, Lu1 aGang, Chen0 tWaterbirds.g2014 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.432-438dWaterbirds Societyx1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675%2F063.037.04113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006000165520095900225592002801184650001101212650001801223650001401241653003201255653002001287653002401307653002201331700006301353700002601416700002101442700001801463700002101481773012201502856008101624852000901705655001201714IND60710659120221117105503.0211030e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071065912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1101612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMottola, Anna10aArcobacter species detection in Italian composite foods  aConsidering that composite foods are frequently involved in the transmission of foodborne diseases and given the growing public health interest around the emerging genus Arcobacter, the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of Arcobacter spp. carrying virulence-associated genes in composite foods, in order to contribute to outlining the specific risks posed by emerging pathogens. Overall, Arcobacter spp. were detected in 18/75 (24%) samples. Biomolecular assays revealed A. butzleri in 36/54 (67%) and Arcobacter spp. in 18/54 (33%) isolates. PCRs aimed at the nine putative virulence genes demonstrated widespread distribution of these genes among A. butzleri isolates, while Arcobacter spp. isolates harboured only ciaB, mviN and hecA genes.

C.10aDiagnosing problems of fine sediment delivery and transfer in a lowland catchment  ap. 95-106.  a2019-12-06  aFine sediment (here defined as fine sand, silt and clay) is a serious management problem in lowland rivers because of alterations to river channels, floodplains and the wider landscape. The multi-scale, complex and stochastic nature of sediment production, delivery and transport processes complicates the diagnosis of fine sediment sources, pathways and impacts. The hydromorphological assessment framework developed by the REFORM project offers a flexible approach to investigate fine sediment pressures. In this study, the framework was applied to a lowland river impacted by excess fine sediment (River Frome, Dorset, UK) to investigate likely sources and timing of sediment production, the segment-scale capacity of the river to transport sediment, and the reach-scale geomorphological response of the river. Land use mapping and agricultural census records suggest that intensive cultivation of cereals and high livestock numbers during the second half of the twentieth century are the probable causes of fine sediment production and that a lack of any significant riparian buffer zone facilitates delivery of fine sediment to the river network. Sediment budget modelling indicates that transport capacities for gravel and sand are low along the river, which is supported by field observations of compacted gravel/sand beds covered with algae. Analysis of historical maps reveals that the river has responded to the increase in fine sediment over the last 40–50 years with channel narrowing and an increase in sinuosity, as fine sediment is trapped and stabilised by aquatic vegetation in the channel margins. Interactions between hydrodynamic forces, sediment supply and vegetation are driving progressive adjustment of the River Frome, and are the key to its holistic future management.  aPublisher supplied data 3ariparian buffers 3arivers 3agravel 3asediment transport 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aclay 3ahydrodynamics 3alivestock 3avegetation 3asilt 3afloodplains 3agrains 3awatersheds 3asand 3aland use 3aaquatic plants 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAlgae1 aGurnell, A.

The photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectra of phosphors exhibited characteristic Eu³⁺ emissions with ⁵F₀ → ⁷Fⱼ transitions, and strong peaks occurred at the ⁵D₀ → ⁷F₂ transition. The PL and RL emissions of SrNb₂O₆:Eu³⁺ decreased over 3 mol%, while both emissions for CdNb₂O₆:Eu³⁺ and NiNb₂O₆:Eu³⁺ increased with increasing Eu³⁺ concentration. The spectral properties of phosphors were evaluated by determining Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters (Ω₂, Ω₄) from the PL emission spectrum. The quantum efficiencies (ηQE%) of MNb₂O₆:Eu³⁺ (M = Sr, Cd, Ni) phosphors with the highest emission were found as 61.87%, 41.89%, and 11.87% respectively.

However, current methods to measure effects of stressors on horizontal gene transfer have limitations and often fall short, as the estimated endpoints can be a mix of both the number of transfer events and clonal growth of transconjugants. Our aim was therefore to achieve a proper strategy for assessing the minimal concentration of a stressor (exemplified by tetracycline) that drives horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance from a complex community to a model pathogen. Conditions were optimized to improve a culture-based approach using the bacterial community of treated sewage effluent as donor, and fluorescent, traceable Escherichia coli as recipient. Reduced level of background resistance, differentiation of isolates as well as decreased risk for measuring effects of selection were achieved through the use of chromogenic medium, optimization of conjugation time as well as applying a different antibiotic for isolation of transconjugants than the one tested for its ability to drive transfer. Using this assay, we showed that a very low concentration of tetracycline, 10μg/L i.e. 150 times below the minimal inhibitory concentration of the recipient, promoted horizontal transfer of multiple antibiotic-resistance determinants. Higher concentrations favoured selection of a tetracycline-resistance phenotype along with a decline in the number of detectable transfer events. The described method can be used to evaluate different environmental conditions and factors that trigger horizontal dissemination of mobile resistance elements, eventually resulting in the formation of drug-resistant pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3aenvironmental factors 3afluorescence 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3asewage effluent 3asewage treatment 3atetracycline 0aConjugation 0aTetracycline 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aMobile genetic elements 0aSub-inhibitory concentration1 aRutgersson, Carolin1 aFlach, Carl-Fredrik1 aJoakim Larsson, D.G.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 548-549 p.131-138dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013900172520179400311592002802105650001402133650002002147650003002167650001202197650001102209650001502220650002202235650002202257650001102279650001302290650001402303650001602317650001502333650002002348650001102368650001502379651001102394653001402405653003602419653001602455653002702471653000902498653002602507700002502533700003202558700003402590773011502624856008302739852000902822655001202831IND60673135020221123025013.0200601e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1008762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, Laura Isabel10aTwo-year study of food availability, demographic structure, and genetic diversity of the most common sandhopper in southeastern Brazil  aThe most common sandhopper found in the sandy beaches of the Brazilian coast, Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis, has suffered from activities related to human recreation, which include removing the vegetal wrack from beaches. It is known that macrophyte beach deposits are the main food source of sandhoppers. The aims of the present study were to: (1) evaluate the variation in food availability as vegetal deposits at two levels of the beach, (2) understand how variations in amphipod demography are correlated to variations in beach vegetal wrack abundance, (3) evaluate how meteorological (precipitation, air temperature and humidity, solar irradiation, wind speed and direction) and biological (beach vegetal wrack and amphipod demography) parameters are correlated, and (4) evaluate the genetic composition and diversity of the amphipod population at two localities with different degrees of disturbance over a 2 year period. Seasonal and inter-annual variations were observed in beach vegetal deposits and amphipod demography. Vegetal deposits were most abundant during the summer and at the high level of the beach; they were positively correlated with air temperature and negatively correlated with air humidity. Amphipod demographic parameters (size, weight, and % juveniles) measured using active amphipods showed a significant correlation to the variation pattern of the vegetal wrack. The percentage of active juveniles was strongly correlated with air humidity. No genetic differentiation was found between amphipods for different localities and years. Demographic composition of active A. brasiliensis amphipods over time was strongly correlated with beach vegetal wrack and debris variation, suggesting the importance of beach vegetal wrack on amphipod demography and growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abeaches 3acoasts 3ademography 3afood availability 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3ahumidity 3ajuveniles 3amacrophytes 3arecreation 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3awind speed 3aBrazil 0aCrustacea 0aAtlantorchestoidea brasiliensis 0aFood source 0aBeach vegetal deposits 0amDNA 0aEnvironmental factors1 aPorto Barbosa, Thais1 aBeraldini, Nathalia Goulart1 aSilva, Viviane da Conceição0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2019 Nov., v. 32 p.100876-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1008763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245013500183520130500318592002801623650001301651650001101664650002301675650001801698650001201716650002301728650001601751650002801767650000701795650001301802650002301815650001701838650002401855653001101879653001101890653001401901653001201915653002401927700002901951700001901980700003001999700003202029700002302061700001802084700002102102700003402123773010102157856008502258852000902343655001202352IND60717976420221122224710.0220606e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071797642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1043472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Sánchez, Victor H.10aInfluence of supplemental dietary copper in high roughage rations on nutrient digestibility and methane emission in Holstein bulls  aFeed additives, chemical inhibitors, and biological approaches have been studied and used to inhibit production of enteric methane (CH₄) in ruminants by modifying methanogenic bacterial communities. However, information on the potential of micromineral supplements in this regard is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of 20 mg (control) and 40 mg Cu (from supplemental CuSO₄)/kg dietary dry matter (DM) on nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation characteristics, and enteric CH₄ emissions measured with the tracing technique of sulfur hexafluoride. Six Holstein bulls were divided into two groups of three animals and assigned to one of two experimental diets in a crossover design. Percentages of apparent digestibility of DM, neutral detergent fiber, and N did not differ (P>0.05) between treatments. Supplemental Cu decreased (P<0.001) total tract digestibility of Cu by 25%. There were no differences (P>0.05) between treatments in ruminal fluid pH or, acetate:propionate ratio. Emission of CH₄ tended (P<0.1) to decrease by 23% with supplemental Cu. This study showed that 40 mg Cu/kg dietary DM is a feasible dietary level in cattle, because supplemental Cu from CuSO₄ did not impair nutrient digestibility and tended to decrease enteric CH₄ emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acopper 3across-over studies 3adigestibility 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aneutral detergent fiber 3apH 3aroughage 3arumen fermentation 3arumen fluids 3asulfur hexafluoride 0aCopper 0aCattle 0aDigestion 0aMethane 0aSulfur hexafluoride1 aSaynes-Santillan, Vinisa1 aGere, José I.1 aCruz Monterrosa, Rosy G.,1 aJiménez Ferrer, Guillermo,1 aAstigarraga, Laura1 aLoza, Cecilia1 aPadilla, Juliana1 aRamírez-Bribiesca, J.

However, the complex synthesis of dendrimers hinders the further application of protected nanoclusters. Here we report a facile strategy to prepare an alternative material via core cross-linking of self-assembled micelles. The resulting dendrimer-like core cross-linked micelles (DCCMs) retain the main characteristics of dendrimers and avoid complex chemical synthesis. As expected, the DCCMs could easily encapsulate gold nanoparticles within their cores. The ultra-small clusters of Au₅ were prepared without the participation of external reductants. Importantly, the DCCM stabilized noble gold clusters furnish excellent catalytic activity and perfect reusability for aerobic oxidation of α-hydroxy ketones in water. Only in open air the oxidation could be repeated up to 48 times with negligible turn-over frequency change. The total turnover number (TON) of the reaction reached unexpectedly >48 000, the highest TON for metal catalysed oxidation of hydroxy ketones so far. The further mechanism study hints that the carboxylic group of substrates might be involved in the catalytic process. The simple catalyst preparation, the environmentally benign reaction conditions, and the excellent catalytic performance and durability make the novel DCCM protected gold nanocluster a green catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrosslinking 3adendrimers 3adurability 3agold 3agreen chemistry 3aketones 3amicelles 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3areducing agents 3astabilizers 3asynthesis1 aLin, Chenlu1 aLi, Bing1 aZhao, Pengxiang1 aZhang, Shiyong0 tGreen chemistry.g2016 June 13, v. 18, no. 12 p.3647-3655dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6gc00010j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01151naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007500157300001800232520035200250592002800602650002300630650000900653650002000662773013200682856007400814852000900888655001200897IND60639152220221121235030.0190501e20170502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063915222DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc02497e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorvath, J.,10aChemomechanical oscillations with a non-redox non-oscillatory reaction  ap. 4973-4976.  aPeriodic length changes, over 20%, were sustained in a pH-responsive gel by associating the methylene glycol–sulphite OH-producing clock-reaction with variations of the exchange time induced between the core of the gel and a steady chemical environment.

However, effective capture techniques for Great Egrets (Ardea alba) outside the breeding season remain elusive, particularly a method to attain robust sample sizes to investigate several aspects of biology. A handheld pneumatic net gun method was developed and successfully captured 97 Great Egrets in 121 trap days. No direct mortalities or substantial injuries occurred. The handheld pneumatic net gun was more cost-effective than commercially available or similar devices, and could prove useful for sensitive species where injury or mortality must be minimized or where the use of explosive devices is restricted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArdea alba 3abreeding season 3acost effectiveness 3ainstrumentation 3amortality 3awildlife 0aArdea alba 0acannon net 0acapture 0aGreat Egret 0anet gun 0apneumatic 0awading bird1 aCaudill, Gretchen1 aMeyer, Kenneth D.1 aKent, Gina M.1 aTarwater, Jeremy1 aButler, Emily0 tWaterbirds.g2014 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.457-461dWaterbirds Societyx1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675%2F063.037.04153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010900170300001600279520110100295592002801396650002501424650001301449650001601462650001601478650001701494650003101511650001001542650001801552650001901570650001801589650002901607653001001636653000801646653000701654653001401661653000801675653000901683653000801692653001401700653001001714653000801724653000801732653000901740653001101749653001401760653001801774653001901792653002301811700001501834700001401849700001601863700001801879773010601897856008702003852000902090655001202099IND60567614620221120224854.0170502e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056761462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zunwei10aPhytotoxicity of chiral herbicide bromacil: Enantioselectivity of photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 139-147.  aWith the wide application of chiral herbicides and the frequent detection of photosystem II (PSII) herbicides, it is of great importance to assess the direct effects of PSII herbicides on photosynthesis in an enantiomeric level. In the present study, the enantioselective phytotoxicity of bromacil (BRO), typical photosynthesis inhibition herbicide, on Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated. The results showed that S-BRO exhibited a greater inhibition of electron transmission in photosystem I (PSI) of A. thaliana than R-BRO by inhibiting the transcription of fnr 1. S-BRO also changed the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters Y (II), Y (NO), and Y (NPQ) to a greater extent than R-Bro. Transcription of genes psbO2, Lhcb3 and Lhcb6 was down-regulated in an enantioselective rhythm and S-BRO caused more serious influence, indicating that S-BRO did worse damage to the photosystem II (PSII) of A. thaliana than R-BRO. This study suggested that S-BRO disturbed the photosynthesis of plants to a larger extent than R-BRO and provided a new sight to evaluate the phytotoxicity of chiral herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abromacil 3achlorophyll 3aenantiomers 3afluorescence 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aphotosystem I 3aphotosystem II 3aphytotoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 0aANOVA 0aBRO 0aCD 0aChla/Chlb 0aETR 0aHPLC 0aLHC 0aMS Medium 0aNADPH 0aPCR 0aPSI 0aPSII 0aChiral 0aHerbicide 0aPhytotoxicity 0aPhotosynthesis 0aEnantioselectivity1 aZou, Yuqin1 aWang, Jia1 aLi, Meichao1 aWen, Yuezhong0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 548-549 p.139-147dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01631naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010600168300001800274520042400292592002800716650001700744650003600761650002300797650002300820650001300843650001300856653001400869653001700883653001200900653002200912653002400934700001700958700001600975700001800991700001901009773011201028856008401140852000901224655001201233IND60604016720221117160027.0180716e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060401672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.04.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zhiqiang10aSynthesis of 2-benzoylpyrrole derivatives via C–H functionalization adjacent to nitrogen of pyrrole  ap. 3919-3922.  aA direct transition-metal-free synthesis of 2-benzoylpyrrole derivatives from free (N–H) pyrroles and benzaldehyde has been developed.

Results of these analyses show that more juvenile males than females fledged from all three breeding populations, although none of these biases differed significantly from parity. The sex ratio of migratory adults was at parity. No parental or territory quality indicators were significantly associated with the sex of chicks fledged from one intensely studied northern Michigan population at Seney National Wildlife Refuge. A significant male bias in adult re-observation of Common Loons banded as juveniles at the wildlife refuge was not solely attributable to the modest male bias recorded at fledging, and thus suggests a pattern of female-biased post-fledging mortality and/or female-biased adult dispersal in Common Loons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGavia 3aadults 3abreeding 3achicks 3aconservation areas 3afemales 3afledglings 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amigratory behavior 3amortality 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation 3asex ratio 3aLake Huron 3aMichigan 3aWisconsin 0abotulism 0aCommon Loon 0adispersal 0aGavia immer 0aGaviidae 0amigration 0anatal philopatry 0asex-bias 0asex chromosomes 0asex ratio1 aMcCormick, Damon L.1 aKaplan, Joseph D.1 aTischler, Keren B.1 aLindsay, Alec R.0 tWaterbirds.g2014 Apr., v. 37, no. sp1 p.6-15dWaterbirds Societyx1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675%2F063.037.sp1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03857naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245012600166300001800292520212700310592002802437650001302465650001102478650002302489650001602512650001102528650001202539650001802551650001502569650001802584650002002602650002202622650001002644650001402654650000902668650002102677650001802698650001502716650001302731650002302744650001102767650001702778650001102795653000902806653002202815653002602837700001602863700001602879700001602895700001702911700001602928700002102944700001802965700001902983773015303002856007903155852000903234655001203243IND60564367920221118095217.0190318e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056436792DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-122292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChester-Jones, H.10aRelationships between early-life growth, intake, and birth season with first-lactation performance of Holstein dairy cows  ap. 3697-3704.  aThe objective was to determine the relationships between early-life parameters [including average daily gain (ADG), body weight (BW), milk replacer intake, starter intake, and birth season] and the first-lactation performance of Holstein cows. We collected data from birth years 2004 to 2012 for 2,880 Holstein animals. Calves were received from 3 commercial dairy farms and enrolled in 37 different calf research trials at the University of Minnesota Southern Research and Outreach Center from 3 to 195 d. Upon trial completion, calves were returned to their respective farms. Milk replacer options included varying protein levels and amounts fed, but in the majority of studies, calves were fed a milk replacer containing 20% crude protein and 20% fat at 0.57 kg/calf daily. Most calves (93%) were weaned at 6 wk. Milk replacer dry matter intake, starter intake, ADG, and BW at 6 wk were 21.5 ± 2.2 kg, 17.3 ± 7.3 kg, 0.53 ± 0.13 kg/d, and 62.4 ± 6.8 kg, respectively. Average age at first calving and first-lactation 305-d milk yield were 715 ± 46.5 d and 10,959 ± 1,527 kg, respectively. We conducted separate mixed-model analyses using the REML model-fitting protocol of JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to determine the effect of early-life BW or ADG, milk replacer and starter intake, and birth season on first-lactation 305-d milk, fat, and true protein yield. Greater BW and ADG at 6 wk resulted in increased first-lactation milk and milk component yields. Intake of calf starter at 8 wk had a significant positive relationship with first-lactation 305-d yield of milk and milk components. Milk replacer intake, which varied very little in this data set, had no effect on first-lactation 305-d yield of milk and milk components. Calves born in the fall and winter had greater starter intake, BW, and ADG at 8 wk. However, calves born in the summer had a higher 305-d milk yield during their first lactation than those born in the fall and winter.

On the basis of the first and second Chinese Chromosome Proteome Database (CCPD 1.0 and 2.0) studies, we developed systematic enrichment strategies to identify MPs that fell into four classes: (1) low molecular weight (LMW) proteins, (2) membrane proteins, (3) proteins that contained various post-translational modifications (PTMs), and (4) nucleic acid-associated proteins. Of 8845 proteins identified in 7 data sets, 79 proteins were classified as MPs. Among data sets derived from different enrichment strategies, data sets for LMW and PTM yielded the most novel MPs. In addition, we found that some MPs were identified in multiple-data sets, which implied that tandem enrichments methods might improve the ability to identify MPs. Moreover, low expression at the transcription level was the major cause of the “missing” of these MPs; however, MPs with higher expression level also evaded identification, most likely due to other characteristics such as LMW, high hydrophobicity and PTM. By combining a stringent manual check of the MS₂ spectra with peptides synthesis verification, we confirmed 30 MPs (neXtProt PE2 ∼ PE4) and 6 potential MPs (neXtProt PE5) with authentic MS evidence. By integrating our large-scale data sets of CCPD 2.0, the number of identified proteins has increased considerably beyond simulation saturation. Here, we show that special enrichment strategies can break through the data saturation bottleneck, which could increase the efficiency of MP identification in future C-HPP studies. All 7 data sets have been uploaded to ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD002255.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosomes 3adata collection 3adatabases 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3amembrane proteins 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3apost-translational modification 3aproteome 0achromosome-centric human proteome project 0amissing protein 0aproteome 0aenrichment strategies1 aZhang, Chengpu1 aZhang, Yao1 aWang, Zhiqiang1 aFan, Fengxu1 aZhao, Mingzhi1 aWu, Feilin1 aGao, Yuan1 aLi, Yanchang1 aChen, Lingsheng1 aTian, Miaomiao1 aZhang, Tao1 aWen, Bo1 aSensang, Na1 aXiong, Zhi1 aWu, Songfeng1 aLiu, Siqi1 aYang, Pengyuan1 aZhen, Bei1 aZhu, Yunping1 aHe, Fuchu1 aXu, Ping0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 14, no. 9 p.3680-3692dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.5b004813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164520104000280592002801320650001501348650001501363650000901378650001001387650001801397650001801415650001701433650001601450650001801466650002501484653001501509653001501524653001701539653001701556653002301573700001701596700002001613773012201633856008101755852000901836655001201845IND60710659520221117104922.0211030e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071065952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1101662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutlu, Ceren10aSome physical properties and adsorption isotherms of vacuum-dried honey powder with different carrier materials  aThis study was aimed at determining effects of different carrier materials and temperatures on water adsorption properties and net isosteric heat of vacuum-dried honey powders.

The results showed that untreated Pinus massoniana had maximum mass loss, and the decay resistance effects of this species treated with different preservatives improved with an increase in the largest mass loss of pyrolysis. The pyrolysis can be divided into primary pyrolysis and secondary pyrolysis reactions in the lower and higher temperature regions, respectively. The activation energy represents a different degree of reduction from the primary pyrolysis reaction to the secondary pyrolysis reaction. The higher the retained cellulose content, the higher the activation energy.

This paper is a review of the acoustic structure of the yodel, an aggressive warning signal only given by male Common Loons. The context in which males yodel is described along with the possible adaptive functions of this signal. The yodel is the most acoustically complex vocalization of the Common Loon and contains a wealth of information about the signaler. Suites of frequency and time elements of the yodel appear to communicate information about the identity of the signaler, which may be important for neighbor-stranger, mate, and kin recognition. The peak frequencies of the final note of the introductory phrase and repeat phrases also appear to communicate the condition-dependent fighting ability. Finally, the number of repeat phrases a male adds to its yodel appears to communicate the aggressive motivation, or the willingness a male Common Loon has to escalate a contest. Under various contexts not necessarily unique to Common Loons, these functions may be mutually beneficial to signalers and conspecific and heterospecific receivers, and evoke a number of interesting questions regarding the function of this dynamic signal. Such dynamic vocal signals are rare among waterbirds, and among ornithologists and behaviorists alike elicit questions regarding the conditions that maintain signal honesty among birds communicating fighting ability and aggressive state within the same vocal signal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGavia 3aacoustics 3akin recognition 3amales 3amotivation 3avocalization 3awater birds 0aaggression 0aCommon Loon 0aGavia immer 0avocal signals 0ayodel1 aWalcott, Charles0 tWaterbirds.g2014 Apr., v. 37, no. sp1 p.37-46dWaterbirds Societyx1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675%2F063.037.sp1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008100165300001600246520118400262592002801446650000801474650001101482650001401493650000901507650002001516650003801536650001801574650001201592650001101604650002101615650001201636650002601648650000901674650001301683650000901696650000901705650000801714650001001722700002301732700001801755773011101773856008101884852000901965655001201974IND60438157620221117225039.0151023e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043815762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-003-0786-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStørsrud, S.10aGluten contamination in oat products and products naturally free from gluten  ap. 481-485.  aSome countries now allow celiac patients to include oats in their gluten-free diet. Studies have shown that commercially available oats can be contaminated with gluten. The aim of the study was to analyse oat products and products naturally free from gluten to determine the degree of contamination. A total of 88 oat products and 22 products based on maize, rice, millet or buckwheat were analysed, using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a monoclonal antibody to gliadin. The ELISA is quantitative with a detection limit of 20 mg/kg gluten. Some of the positive samples were also analysed for the presence of DNA from wheat, barley or rye. Thirteen percent of the oat products had gluten content over 200 mg/kg. Of the products naturally free from gluten 14% had a gluten content over 200 mg/kg. There was a tendency for higher levels of contamination with increased processing. The risk of gluten contamination in oat products as well as in non-gluten cereals must be considered. The level of contamination was in most cases low. The results regarding oats can be compared to those of such cereals as maize, rice, buckwheat and millet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abarley 3abuckwheat 3acorn 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood research 3agliadin 3agluten 3agluten-free diet 3amillets 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aoats 3apatients 3arice 3arisk 3arye 3awheat1 aMalmheden Yman, I.1 aLenner, R.

However, there is still a huge challenge of controlling the release of drugs from the DCB into vessel tissue. The uncontrolled release of drugs and high drug loading amounts could potentially lead to distal embolization and mortality events. In our study, an ultralow dose paclitaxel (PTX) coated DCB appended with an outer protective sheath was designed to treat peripheral vessel stenosis. An in vitro study demonstrated that the sheath could significantly reduce the drug loss during the delivery process and the meglumine matrix could effectively promote the transfer of PTX into vessel tissue. The pharmacokinetics study in the swine model also demonstrated that the PTX amount remaining in the vessel after being treated by our DCB was comparable to similar products on market although only less than a third of the PTX was used. The safety study indicated that the DCB treatment did not have any adverse impact on the physiological function of the vessel. Therefore, our ultralow dose PTX coated DCB could provide an effective and safe treatment for PAD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3achemistry 3adrugs 3amarkets 3amortality 3apaclitaxel 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3atherapeutics1 aGuo, Gaoyang1 aYang, Li1 aWang, Yunbing0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2021 Mar. 17, v. 9, no. 10 p.2428-2435dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb02720k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012400166300001400290520178200304592002802086650001502114650001302129650002402142650002202166650002502188650001502213650001102228650001402239650001902253650001302272650002302285650001102308650001402319650002402333650002102357650000702378650001902385650001302404650001602417653002402433653001902457653002302476653001602499653002202515700002102537700002202558700001602580700001702596773010402613856008502717852000902802655001202811IND60592332920221120211603.0190516e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059233292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomiero, A.10aBiological responses of two marine organisms of ecological relevance to on-going ocean acidification and global warming  ap. 60-70.  aRecently, there has been a growing concern that climate change may rapidly and extensively alter global ecosystems with unknown consequences for terrestrial and aquatic life. While considerable emphasis has been placed on terrestrial ecology consequences, aquatic environments have received relatively little attention. Limited knowledge is available on the biological effects of increments of seawater temperature and pH decrements on key ecological species, i.e., primary producers and/or organisms representative of the basis of the trophic web. In the present study, we addressed the biological effects of global warming and ocean acidification on two model organisms, the microbenthic marine ciliate Euplotes crassus and the green alga Dunaliella tertiocleta using a suite of high level ecological endpoint tests and sub-lethal stress measures. Organisms were exposed to combinations of pH and temperature (TR1: 7.9[pH], 25.5 °C and TR2: 7.8[pH], 27,0 °C) simulating two possible environmental scenarios predicted to occur in the habitats of the selected species before the end of this century. The outcomes of the present study showed that the tested scenarios did not induce a significant increment of mortality on protozoa. Under the most severe exposure conditions, sub-lethal stress indices show that pH homeostatic mechanisms have energetic costs that divert energy from essential cellular processes and functions. The marine protozoan exhibited significant impairment of the lysosomal compartment and early signs of oxidative stress under these conditions. Similarly, significant impairment of photosynthetic efficiency and an increment in lipid peroxidation were observed in the autotroph model organism held under the most extreme exposure condition tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDunaliella 3aProtozoa 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic organisms 3abioactive properties 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3afood webs 3aglobal warming 3ahabitats 3alipid peroxidation 3amodels 3amortality 3aocean acidification 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3aseawater 3atemperature 0aOcean acidification 0aGlobal warming 0aBiological effects 0aGreen algae 0aCiliated protozoa1 aBellerby, R.G.J.1 aManca Zeichen, M.1 aBabbini, L.1 aViarengo, A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 May, v. 236 p.60-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010200169300001400271520114100285592002801426650002501454650000901479650002301488650003101511650001601542650001601558650000901574651001101583700002801594700004201622700003701664700002701701773011101728856008101839852000901920655001201929IND60477799520221122145945.0160106e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047779952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-015-0783-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNisgoski, Silvana10aPotential use of NIR spectroscopy to identify Cryptomeria japonica varieties from southern Brazil  ap. 71-80.  aCryptomeria japonica has good potential for forest plantations in southern Brazil. Plants of Japanese origin have different adaptations to cold temperatures in the initial phase, and mean annual growth is related to seed origin and the characteristics of the growing site. Because of the differences in the adaptation and growth between varieties with different origins, it is important to be able to obtain this information precisely, for which a fast method like infrared spectroscopy can be a good alternative. Needles and wood of six origins were analyzed. Infrared analyses were performed in a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere and operating in reflectance mode. There were 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm⁻¹ and a spectral range of 10,000–4000 cm⁻¹. For each variety, 30 spectra were collected. The mean spectra of the plants of different origin, obtained from needle and wood samples, showed similarity. Pre-processing data by taking the second-derivative was the most efficient, and near-infrared spectroscopy can be applied to distinguish the six C. japonica varieties based on needles and wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3acold 3aforest plantations 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3areflectance 3atemperature 3awood 3aBrazil1 aSchardosin, Felipe Zatt1 aBatista, Francielli Rodrigues Ribeiro1 ade Muñiz, Graciela Inés Bolzon1 aCarneiro, Mayara Elita0 tWood science and technology.g2016 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.71-80dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-015-0783-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04086naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245021700166300001600383520254200399592002802941650001302969650002902982650001203011650001803023650001903041650001303060650001203073650001803085650002103103650001403124650001203138650002203150653002503172653001603197653001403213653001703227653001203244653001303256653001703269653001503286653001703301700006003318773013303378856008403511852000903595655001203604IND60564368320221118093808.0190219e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056436832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2016.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCribb, Nardi10aChanges in the behavioural complexity of bottlenose dolphins along a gradient of anthropogenically-impacted environments in South Australian coastal waters: Implications for conservation and management strategies  ap. 118-127.  aThe susceptibility of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) to disturbance within South Australian coastal waters is of particular importance due to both the ever increasing impact of anthropogenic activities on these waters and their semi-enclosed nature. Currently, little is known about the ecology of dolphins in this region, in particular in relation to anthropogenically-driven disturbances. This study investigates the level of stress experienced by bottlenose dolphins from the complexity of their temporal patterns of dive durations recorded along a gradient of environment types defined as a function of the intensity of anthropogenically-driven pollution and disturbances, including urban development and recreational boating. Dive durations were opportunistically recorded from land-based stations scattered across South Australian coastal waters both in the absence of boat traffic, and the potential for boat-related disturbance was investigated when a motorized vessel was within 100m from a traveling individual to infer the effect of indirect exposure to boat disturbance. This approach fundamentally differs from more standard assessments of the behavioural effect of direct exposure to boat disturbance, for instance when dolphins chase fishing vessels, flee from motorboats or bow ride. Subsequent analyses were based on nearly 12,000 behavioural observations. No significant differences were found in dive durations measured in the absence of boats and when boats were present. In contrast, fractal analysis consistently identified significant differences in the complexity of dive duration patterns as a function of environment and exposure to disturbance. Specifically, bottlenose dolphins occurring in environments with less anthropogenic pressure exhibit a higher behavioural complexity. This complexity consistently and significantly decreases both within each environment and between environments with increasing anthropogenic pressure. These results further show that the relative changes in bottlenose dolphins' behavioural complexity increase in environments less impacted by anthropogenic activities. These results are discussed in the general context of the adaptive value of fractal behaviour, the susceptibility of bottlenose dolphins occurring in distinct environments to anthropogenic disturbance, and how behavioural properties identified with our fractal methods can be used to establish baseline information that can be used for the design and implementation of conservation and management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTursiops 3aanthropogenic activities 3aboating 3acoastal water 3adirect contact 3adolphins 3aecology 3afishing boats 3aindirect contact 3apollution 3atraffic 3aurban development 0aAnthropogenic stress 0aDisturbance 0aBehaviour 0aBoat traffic 0aHabitat 0aFractals 0aConservation 0aManagement 0aTursiops sp.1 aSeuront, Laurent1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0051-52020 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2016 Sept., v. 482 p.118-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2016.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245011000182300001800292520161600310592002801926650002301954650002501977650001502002650001002017650002102027650001102048650001002059650002502069650001302094650001502107650001302122650001502135650003502150650001202185650001802197650002002215653001002235653001202245653000802257653000802265653001002273653003102283653002502314653002502339700003502364700003402399700003702433700003002470700003202500700003602532700001902568700004002587700003402627700003202661700003602693773013402729856008702863852000902950655001202959IND60569418020221122134450.0170528e20150904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056941802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b004902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrasnov, George Sergeevich10aPPLine: An Automated Pipeline for SNP, SAP, and Splice Variant Detection in the Context of Proteogenomics  ap. 3729-3737.  aThe fundamental mission of the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) is the research of human proteome diversity, including rare variants. Liver tissues, HepG2 cells, and plasma were selected as one of the major objects for C-HPP studies. The proteogenomic approach, a recently introduced technique, is a powerful method for predicting and validating proteoforms coming from alternative splicing, mutations, and transcript editing. We developed PPLine, a Python-based proteogenomic pipeline providing automated single-amino-acid polymorphism (SAP), indel, and alternative-spliced-variants discovery based on raw transcriptome and exome sequence data, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) annotation and filtration, and the prediction of proteotypic peptides (available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ppline). In this work, we performed deep transcriptome sequencing of HepG2 cells and liver tissues using two platforms: Illumina HiSeq and Applied Biosystems SOLiD. Using PPLine, we revealed 7756 SAP and indels for HepG2 cells and liver (including 659 variants nonannotated in dbSNP). We found 17 indels in transcripts associated with the translation of alternate reading frames (ARF) longer than 300 bp. The ARF products of two genes, SLMO1 and TMEM8A, demonstrate signatures of caspase-binding domain and Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase. Alternative splicing analysis predicted novel proteoforms encoded by 203 (liver) and 475 (HepG2) genes according to both Illumina and SOLiD data. The results of the present work represent a basis for subsequent proteomic studies by the C-HPP consortium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetyltransferases 3aalternative splicing 3afiltration 3agenes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aliver 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides 3aprediction 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atissues 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aC-HPP 0aRNA-seq 0aSNP 0aSAP 0aindel 0aalternative reading frames 0aalternative splicing 0aproteotypic peptides1 aDmitriev, Alexey

Biotic and abiotic samples were collected for mercury analysis on 44 Adirondack lakes over a 2-year period (2003 to 2004). From 1998 to 2007, Common Loon blood samples were collected for mercury analysis from the 44 lakes, loon feather samples from 40 lakes, and nonviable eggs from 29 lakes. It was determined that 2.00 ng Hg/L or less in the water was small enough to prevent male Adirondack Common Loons from accumulating mercury in levels high enough to impact reproductive success and behavior, while a water sample of 1.69 ng Hg/L or less was small enough to not cause impacts to female Common Loons. These wildlife criterion values are greater than the wildlife criterion value of 1.30 ng Hg/L applied to avian species by the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative. The Common Loon-based wildlife criterion value provides a valuable estimate of the mercury thresholds associated with biotic impacts due to mercury contamination in aquatic ecosystems, enabling legislators to integrate these standards into policies that better protect environmental quality. Based on the water samples collected, it was estimated that the wildlife criterion value accurately predicted the protection of 61% of female and 73% of male Adirondack loons. More rigorous sampling of the abiotic compartment over a wider temporal and spatial scale is necessary to fully understand how water quality parameters relate to Common Loon reproductive success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGavia 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abioaccumulation 3abirds 3ablood 3aeggs 3afeathers 3afemales 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3amales 3amercury 3aviability 3awater quality 3awildlife 3aGreat Lakes 3aNew York 0aAdirondack Park 0aCommon Loon 0aGavia immer 0amercury 0awildlife criterion value1 aJackson, Allyson K.1 aDuron, Melissa1 aEvers, David C.1 aGlennon, Michale J.1 aDriscoll, Charles T.1 aYu, Xue1 aSimonin, Howard1 aSauer, Amy K.0 tWaterbirds.g2014 Apr., v. 37, no. sp1 p.76-84dWaterbirds Societyx1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675%2F063.037.sp1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245010200178300001600280520159400296592002801890650002001918650002001938650001901958650002601977650002302003650001602026650001502042651001002057653003002067653002002097653002102117653002102138700002202159700002302181700002102204700002702225700002802252773010202280856008702382852000902469655001202478IND60567615320221120161052.0170627e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056761532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Montero, R.10aLong term variations measurement of electromagnetic field exposures in Alcalá de Henares (Spain)  ap. 657-668.  aElectromagnetic radiowave exposure is a major concern in most countries due to possible adverse health effects. Over the last 10years, many technological changes (digital television, mobile technologies, wireless networks…) have led to variations in the electromagnetic field (EMF) levels.A large number of studies devoted to the analysis of EMF levels with personal dosimeters or computer models of the exposure of mobile stations have been conducted. However, the study of the exposure values, taking into account all the existing sources, and their evolution in a wide area, using measurements, has rarely been performed.In this paper, we provide a comparison of the EMF exposure levels for the city of Alcalá de Henares (Spain) over a ten-year period using a broadband isotropic probe in the range from 100kHz to 3GHz. A statistical and spatial analysis of the measurements and their variations are also presented for the study of the global and local variations.The measured values in the period from 2006 to 2015 were ranging from 0.02 to 2.05V/m. Our global results show a moderate increase from 2006 to 2010 and they are almost invariant from 2010 to 2015. Although the whole dataset does not have relevant statistical difference, we have found marked local differences. In the city areas where the population density has remained unaltered, we have measured lower exposure levels. Conversely, new urban and industrial developments have demanded new resources, which have potentially contributed to the observed increase in the measured electric field levels within these areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3adata collection 3aelectric field 3aelectromagnetic field 3apopulation density 3aradio waves 3atelevision 3aSpain 0aElectromagnetic pollution 0aExposure trends 0aRadiofrequencies 0aSpatial analysis1 aAlén-Cordero, C.1 aLópez-Espí, P.L.1 aRigelsford, J.M.1 aAguilera-Benavente, F.1 aAlpuente-Hermosilla, J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.657-668dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245004300160300001400203500001400217520072800231592002800959650000900987650002600996650001601022650001501038650001201053650001601065650001501081650001001096650001301106650000901119650001001128650001401138650001801152650001001170651001001180653000801190653001401198653001301212653002501225700001701250773014601267856007401413852000901487655001201496IND60706193120221119150823.0200908s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070619312DNAL7 a10.6088/ijes.60022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcharya, Tri Dev10aVineyard suitability analysis of Nepal  ap. 13-19.  aNAL-light  aRecent advances in technology and research have help farmers to find suitable sites for different crop productions.

In order to explore the immune response of tilapia against these two species of monogeneans, expression patterns of five immune-related genes were studied after singular G. cichlidarum or C. sclerosus infection and their coinfection. The transcription levels of IL-1β were up-regulated in the skin after G. cichlidarum infection, reaching a peak at day 5 PI, and in the gills after C. sclerosus infection (peaking at day 8 PI), with significant elevation only detected in the gills after high-dose C. sclerosus infection. A trend favoring increased gill TNF-α expression at day 8 PI of C. sclerosus infection was statistically significant only in the low-dose infection group. TNF-α expression in the skin did not change significantly after G. cichlidarum infection. TGF-β had extremely up-regulated expressions in the gills at day 8 PI after both high- and low-dose C. sclerosus infections, but its significantly promoted expression in the skin was observed only after infection of high-dose G. cichlidarum. Significantly increased expressions of HSP70 and COX-2 in the skin were detected after high-dose G. cichlidarum infections. In comparison to singular infection with either G. cichlidarum or C. sclerosus, concurrent infection resulted in significantly advanced expression of TGF-β in both skin and gills, and lower expressions at day 8 PI, and similar patterns were observed in the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α in the gills. G. cichlidarum infection on the body surface significantly down-regulated the expressions of TNF-α, TGF-β and COX-2 in the gills. In addition, the intensity of G. cichlidarum was significantly positively correlated with that of C. sclerosus (correlation index 0.922, p = 0.000) at day 2 PI under concurrent infection. These results contribute to the understanding of mucosal immunity of fish against monogenean infection, particularly when two monogenean species infect concurrently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGyrodactylus 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aectoparasites 3afinancial economics 3afish 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agills 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amixed infection 3amucosal immunity 3ashellfish 3atransforming growth factor beta 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aMonogenean infection 0aGyrodactylus cichlidarum 0aCichlidogyrus sclerosus 0aNile tilapia 0aImmunity 0aGene expression 0aCoinfection1 aXu, Xiangli1 aChen, Jinsong1 aZheng, Yingying1 aZhang, Shuai1 aPeng, Jian1 aBrown, Christopher L.1 aYang, Tingbao0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Sept., v. 80 p.397-404dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.05.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009100154520063600245592002800881650002100909650001000930650000800940650003200948650001100980650001800991650001701009650001601026650001601042650002401058650001401082650002701096700001701123700002001140700002001160700001601180700001801196700002101214700001501235773012101250856007401371852000901445655001201454IND60704096320221117180650.0200722e20200219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070409632DNAL7 a10.3390/v120202312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jia 10aMolecular Characterization of a Novel Ourmia-Like Virus Infecting Phoma matteucciicola  aHere, we report a novel (+) ssRNA mycovirus, Phoma matteucciicola ourmia-like virus 1 (PmOLV1), isolated from Phoma matteucciicola strain LG915-1.

It is shown that bistable nonlinear absorption and refraction response will appear in the strong exciton-NR coupling rme. Specifically, we plot bistability phase diagrams within the system’s parameter subspace and derive the critical conditions for optical bistability (OB), which allow one to switch precisely and efficiently OB on/off. The scheme proposed here not only provides a unique platform for measuring the coupling strength between the exciton and the NR, but also may eventually enable applications in the quantum optics and quantum information processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3ainformation processing 3ananomaterials 3aoptics 3aphysical phases1 aXia, Xiao-Shuang1 aLiao, Xing-Lan1 aLi, Jian-Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6721-07481 aZhong, Hong-Hua1 aLiang, Shan1 aXiao, Si1 aLiu, Ling-Hong1 aLuo, Jian-Hua1 aHe, Meng-Dong1 aChen, Li-Qun0 tCarbon.g2020 Feb., v. 157 p.724-730dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.10.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003200152245013300184520164500317592002801962650002401990650001702014650001402031650001902045650002102064650002502085650001702110650001402127650001002141651001002151653003302161653001202194653001402206653001702220653001802237653001702255700002902272700002602301700002802327700002602355700003702381773009802418856008702516852000902603655001202612IND60745174420221121000947.0220426e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074517442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1173332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Puratich, Harald10aBi-objective optimization of multiple agro-industrial wastes supply to a cogeneration system promoting local circular bioeconomy  aThis research analyses and proposes an optimization model for the supply of biomass to a combined heat and power (CHP) system with a supply of different biomasses at a local level under Mediterranean conditions. The research aims to quantitatively assess whether it is economical and environmentally beneficial to transport various types of biomasses to the CHP plant, instead of landfilling, determining the biomass required according to the availability of power generation for each biomass of agricultural and agro-industrial origin. To do this, a representative case study has been developed in the Maule Region, Chile to supply power and heat to public, private, and residential buildings. The main biomasses analyzed are olive pomace, fruit pits and vineyard pruning. The results demonstrate that the supply of residual biomass to the CHP plant avoids the emission of CO₂e generated by final disposal. Regarding the minimization of CO₂e emissions, pruning residues are identified as the first supply option, due to their high heating value. Regarding cost minimization, olive pomace is identified as the first option, followed by fruit pits and pruning material. Furthermore, transport is not a major contributing cost or environmental factor when biomass sources are close to the CHP system, up to a maximum supply radius of 30 km. Finally, despite seasonality of agricultural biomass supply under Mediterranean conditions, it is feasible to adequately supply a small-scale CHP plant. However, this increases the storage costs involved. Other lignocellulosic biomasses could be used to optimize costs and environmental benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abioeconomics 3abuildings 3acarbon dioxide 3acircular economy 3acogeneration systems 3aolive pomace 3aphytomass 3aseeds 3aChile 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aBiomass 0aBioenergy 0aOptimization 0aCO2 emissions 0aSupply chain1 aRebolledo-Leiva, Ricardo1 aHernández, Diógenes1 aGómez-Lagos, Javier E.1 aArmengot-Carbo, Bruno1 aOliver-Villanueva, José Vicente0 tApplied energy.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 300 p.117333-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1173333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011500176506011700291506007600408520211300484592002802597506003702625650001302662650001402675650001302689650001202702650001402714650001202728650001202740650000902752650001502761650001602776650001902792651001002811653001802821653002002839653002602859653002002885653001902905653002202924700001802946700002202964700001902986700001903005773008703024856008503111852000903196655001203205IND60761140020221207060909.0220328e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076114002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2021.1059652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadía Villas, David,10aGenesis and stability of textural pedofeatures along a soil transect in the siliceous Iberian Chain (NE Spain)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTextural features are widespread in many soils, provide pedogenetic evidence, and are fundamental in soil classification systems. The presence of these features and their conservation over time require certain processes and soil forming factors. This study investigates the genesis of textural pedofeatures, especially clay coatings, and the stressful conditions that can eventually lead to their disappearance. To achieve this goal, four profiles with clay-enriched horizons have been studied (macro- and micromorphology, physical, chemical and mineralogical properties and classification) along a transect in the siliceous Iberian Chain (NE-Spain). The profiles, which have unmistakable illuvial accumulations in various horizons (Bhs, Bt, Btk), are classified (ST/WRB) as: a Spodosol/Podzol in the headslope, two Alfisol/Luvisols in the backslope and an Alfisol/Calcisol in the footslope. For the latter soil, the apparently strong difference in their classification to the first hierarchical level is due to the weight that the WRB places on the presence of an argic recarbonated horizon on a calcic horizon. Clay illuviation was identified in all the soils, with coatings and infillings of microlaminated clay. These clayey pedofeatures are mostly mechanically fragmented or deformed, which is micromorphologically evidenced by an undulating, wavy extinction that does not run completely parallel to the surfaces they cover. Different destructive processes are identified along the soil transect; so, cryoturbation is the dominant process in the Podzol located at the highest elevation (Moncayo Massif). Instead, the clay coatings in the Btk horizon of the footslope (Calcisol) are covered and deformed by the growth of secondary calcite. The textural pedofeatures in this soil, which is very clayey, can also undergo argilloturbation processes, like in the backslope soils (Luvisols). In conclusion, several ongoing stress processes, that sometimes require different environmental conditions (polygenetic), affect most textural pedofeatures and lead to their progressive alteration and disappearance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlfisols 3aCalcisols 3aLuvisols 3aPodzols 3aSpodosols 3acalcite 3acatenas 3aclay 3aextinction 3ailluviation 3amicrostructure 3aSpain 0aClay coatings 0aClay infillings 0aDeformed pedofeatures 0aMicromorphology 0aClassification 0aPolygenetic soils1 aPoch, Rosa M.1 aLongares, Luis A.1 aYuste, Alfonso1 aBauluz, Blanca0 tCatena.g2022 Apr., v. 211 p.105965-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.1059653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011500167506010400282506007600386520189700462592002802359506003702387650001402424650001702438650001602455650001102471650002502482650001702507650002102524650002602545650001702571650000902588651001502597653001902612653001802631653002102649653002902670653002302699653002602722700001602748700002002764700002102784700002702805700002402832700002102856700001902877773009802896856008702994852000903081655001203090IND60745174520221207095635.0220426e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074517452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1173542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Shan10aEnvironmental benefit-detriment thresholds for flow battery energy storage systems: A case study in California  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnergy storage systems are critical for enabling the environmental benefits associated with capturing renewable energy to displace fossil fuel-based generation, yet producing these systems also contributes to environmental impacts through their materials use and manufacturing. As energy storage capacity is scaled up to support increasingly renewable grids, the environmental benefits from their use may scale at different rates than the environmental impacts from their production. This implies the existence of capacity thresholds beyond which installing additional storage capacity may be environmentally detrimental. Identifying such thresholds are important for ensuring that energy storage capacity selection in future grids are consistent with net emissions reduction goals, but such thresholds have not been studied in the present literature. To identify such thresholds, here we combine electric grid dispatch modeling with life cycle analysis to compare how the emissions reductions from deploying three different flow battery energy storage types on a future California grid (>80% wind and solar) compare with emissions contributions from producing such batteries as total battery capacity installed on the grid increases. Depending on the type of battery and environmental impact indicator (greenhouse gas or particulate matter emissions), we find that the marginal environmental benefits of storage begin to diminish at deployed capacities of 38–76% of the mean daily renewable generation (256–512 GWh in our California scenarios) and reach zero at 105–284% of mean daily renewable generation (700–1810 GWh). Such storage capacities are conceivable, but upstream impacts of storage must be assessed in evaluating the environmental benefits of large-scale storage deployment, or they could negate the environmental benefits of regional electricity system decarbonization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abatteries 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gases 3alife cycle assessment 3aparticulates 3awind 3aCalifornia 0aEnergy storage 0aElectric grid 0aRenewable energy 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aParticulate matter 0aEnvironmental impacts1 aHe, Haoyang1 aKendall, Alissa1 aDavis, Steven J.1 aOgunseitan, Oladele A.1 aSchoenung, Julie M.1 aSamuelsen, Scott1 aTarroja, Brian0 tApplied energy.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 300 p.117354-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1173543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245007400203300002000277506007600297520122200373592002801595506003701623650000801660650001101668650001301679653003301692653003301725653002101758700002301779700001401802700002501816700001801841773019301859856007902052852000902131655001202140IND60178805320221207053247.0150604e20141209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017880532DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14156851112doi7 aPMC42673292pmcid7 a254113142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yi-ju,10aModulation of DNA loop lifetimes by the free energy of loop formation  ap. 17396-17401.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStorage and retrieval of the genetic information in cells is a dynamic process that requires the DNA to undergo dramatic structural rearrangements. DNA looping is a prominent example of such a structural rearrangement that is essential for transcriptional regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the speed of such regulations affects the fitness of individuals. Here, we examine the in vitro looping dynamics of the classic Lac repressor gene-regulatory motif. We show that both loop association and loop dissociation at the DNA-repressor junctions depend on the elastic deformation of the DNA and protein, and that both looping and unlooping rates approximately scale with the looping J factor, which reflects the system’s deformation free energy. We explain this observation by transition state theory and model the DNA–protein complex as an effective worm-like chain with twist. We introduce a finite protein–DNA binding interaction length, in competition with the characteristic DNA deformation length scale, as the physical origin of the previously unidentified loop dissociation dynamics observed here, and discuss the robustness of this behavior to perturbations in several polymer parameters.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aenergy 3apolymers 0aprotein-mediated DNA looping 0aloop-modulated kinetic rates 0atransition state1 aJohnson, Stephanie1 aMulligan,1 aSpakowitz, Andrew J.1 aPhillips, Rob0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 9, v. 111, no. 49 p.17396-17401dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14156851113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013900166520142100305592002801726650001501754650000801769650001201777650001601789650001101805650000901816650001501825650000901840650002901849650001601878650002501894650001101919653002101930653002901951653003401980653002502014653002702039653003002066700001702096700001202113700001702125700001702142773009802159856008702257852000902344655001202353IND60745174620221121000616.0220426e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074517462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1173562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhan10aEvaluation of a trigeneration system based on adiabatic compressed air energy storage and absorption heat pump: Thermodynamic analysis  aCompressed air energy storage can be a promising application to meet diversified energy needs of cooling, heating and power supplies through mutual conversions among electrical, thermal and potential energies. A novel trigeneration system based on adiabatic compressed air energy storage is thus proposed for efficient allocation and utilization of the heat of compression. An absorption heat pump is also integrated in the system to improve the heat capacity of the proposed system. A steady state thermodynamic model of this system is then established with the focus on the energy conversion variation principle for changing key physical parameters. It is demonstrated that increasing storage pressure from 3 to 8 MPa can enhance the system round trip efficiency and exergy efficiency about 20.57–31.69% and 23.64–30.62%, respectively. Larger charge-discharge pressure difference has a negative effect on the two indicators. Minimal exergy efficiency can be found with the ratio of thermal oil allocation located at about 0.8. Lower vapor generator temperature and evaporation temperature can achieve higher system round trip efficiency and exergy. However, the influence is minor when evaporation temperature is higher than 283.15. In brief, this study represents detailed guidance for the design of the proposed system, which has a promising prospect in intermittent renewable energy storage and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair 3acooling 3aevaporation 3aexergy 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3aoils 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3athermodynamic models 3avapors 0aCombined cooling 0aHeating and power supply 0aCompressed air energy storage 0aAbsorption heat pump 0aThermodynamic analysis 0aAllocation of thermal oil1 aYang, Xuqing1 aLiu, Xu1 aWang, Wenbin1 aYang, Xiaohu0 tApplied energy.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 300 p.117356-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1173563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245009600206300001600302520127100318592002801589650002301617650001301640650002601653650001301679650001201692650001301704650001101717650001801728650001701746700002001763700005401783700001901837700005501856700001901911700005901930700005701989700005402046700005602100700001702156700005702173773008702230856008502317852000902402655001202411IND60676056220221123045000.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067605622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWon, Sejeong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4400-512110aGraphene-based crack lithography for high-throughput fabrication of terahertz metamaterials  ap. 505-512.  aTerahertz (THz) nanoantennas have significant potential for versatile applications in THz spectroscopy because of their capability for strong electromagnetic field localization. Electron-beam lithography or focused ion beam machining is typically employed to fabricate nanoantenna structures. These nanolithography methods present limitations in the widespread utilization of THz nanoantennas because of their high cost and low productivity. In this work, we proposed graphene-based crack lithography as a high throughput fabrication method for nanoantenna structures. A double-layer graphene interface was introduced to enable independent control of the nanoantenna dimensions and provide graphene-based nanoantenna structures. We analyzed the underlying mechanism of graphene-based cracking and developed an analytical model governing the geometric parameters of the fabricated nanostructures. As a vital application of the fabricated nanoantenna structures, we demonstrated the highly sensitive detection of d-Glucose molecules. Graphene-based crack lithography can provide a cost-effective method for generating nanoantenna structures with the desired characteristics and can accelerate the development of practical applications of electromagnetic metamaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3acracking 3aelectromagnetic field 3ageometry 3aglucose 3agraphene 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3aspectroscopy1 aJung, Hyun-June1 aKim, Dasom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2331-45261 aYi, Sang-hŏn,1 aVan Lam, Do1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5067-17831 aKim, Hyeon-Don1 aKim, Kwang-Seop1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4939-19731 aLee, Seung-Mo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0732-44731 aSeo, Minah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1290-97161 aKim, Dai-Sik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2331-45261 aLee, Hak-Joo1 aKim, Jae-Hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4327-29920 tCarbon.g2020 Mar., v. 158 p.505-512dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245014700166300001400313520090800327592002801235650001501263650001001278650001401288650001201302650001301314650003101327650001601358650001701374650001301391650002001404653001801424653001201442653002101454653001901475773012501494856007801619852000901697655001201706IND60520092620221122225338.0160513e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052009262DNAL7 a10.2478/johr-2014-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapczyńska, Anna10aEffect of Planting Term on Growth and Flowering of Two Cultivars of Lachenalia Produced in A Greenhouse as Potting Plants During Winter Months  ap. 29-34.  aA greenhouse experiment was carried out on lachenalia plants to determine the effect of different bulb planting terms (from October to January) on the growth and flowering of cultivars ‘Ronina’ and ‘Rupert’, in the natural light conditions. From every planted bulb emerged stems and flowers, but the time of flow–ering was dependent on the planting term and genotype. Irrespective of the planting term, plants of ‘Rupert’ were taller than those of ‘Ronina’. The planting term had an influence on the length of the inflorescence in ‘Rupert’, but did not affect in ‘Ronina’. The bulbs of ‘Rupert’ produced more than twice as many florets as ‘Ronina’ bulbs. Irrespective of the genotype, the bulbs planted the earliest produced the thinnest stems. The two tested cultivars were long-lasting flowering pot plants - their inflorescences remained decorative for over 20 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLachenalia 3abulbs 3acultivars 3aflorets 3agenotype 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3ahorticulture 3aplanting 3asolar radiation 0acape hyacinth 0aforcing 0aplant morphology 0aflower quality0 tJournal of Horticultural Research.g2014 Sept. 10, v. 22, no. 1 p.29-34dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23155x2353-39787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johr-2014-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008100166300001400247520075100261592002801012650002301040650003101063650001801094650001301112650001701125650002401142650002301166650001201189650002101201650002101222650002301243650001101266650001601277653002301293653002101316653000801337653000801345653000801353653000801361700001801369700002501387700001601412700003001428773012501458856007801583852000901661655001201670IND60520092720221122234832.0160513e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052009272DNAL7 a10.2478/johr-2014-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aM.

Henriikka10aSea level rise may contribute to the greening of Arctic coastal freshwaters – Implications from the ontogeny of Greiner Lake, Nunavut, Canada  aGlobal sea level rise and increased storm activity triggered by climate change pose a serious threat to low-lying Arctic coastal landscapes, which commonly host numerous freshwater lakes. Marine inundation of these ecosystems would result in significant ecological changes. We elucidated effects of changing levels of marine influence to lake ecosystems by exploring the ontogeny of coastal Greiner Lake in Arctic Canada. Using paleolimnological methods on a sediment core, we explored functional assemblage compositions of aquatic biota (diatoms and chironomids), biomarkers (pigments and fatty acids) and geochemistry (stable isotopes and organic matter) throughout the isolation history of the lake. The biological and geological data collectively indicated a paleoenvironmental shift from marine embayment to brackish lagoon in the Late-Holocene and to a freshwater lake ca. 500 BP. We observed that the lake was most productive during a phase of mixed freshwater and marine influence, based on higher chlorophyll-a and β,β-carotene concentrations, omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3) as well as sediment organic content. We suggest that, in addition to reorganization of aquatic communities and altered ecosystem services provided by coastal lakes, coastal freshwaters may become more productive under increasing marine influence caused by climate change. Global sea level rise may thus trigger a new pathway to increasingly greener Arctic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3abiomarkers 3acatenas 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3afreshwater lakes 3ageochemistry 3aontogeny 3aorganic matter 3apaleoecology 3asea level 3asediments 3astorms 3aArctic region 3aNunavut 0aFunctional paleoecology 0aClimate change 0aFatty acid 0aSedimentary pigment 0aStable isotope 0aVictoria Island1 aRantala, Marttiina V.1 aAntoniades, Dermot1 aLuoto, Tomi P.1 aNevalainen, Liisa1 aRautio, Milla0 tCatena.g2022 Apr., v. 211 p.105969-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.1059693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010800161300002000269520166200289592002801951650000801979650000901987650001401996650001802010650002102028650001802049650002202067650001302089650000902102650002302111650001502134650002502149700001202174700001902186700001602205700001402221700001702235700002002252700001302272700001402285700001502299700005702314773015502371856008302526852000902609655001202618IND60744653920221122134005.0220208e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074465392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13107-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qian14aThe contrasting relationships of relative humidity with influenza A and B in a humid subtropical region  ap. 36828-36836.  aInfluenza is an acute respiratory disease that seriously threatens public health. The occurrence of influenza has been proved to be related to a variety of meteorological factors. However, less attention has been paid to the effect of relative humidity (RH) on different types of influenza, especially in subtropical regions. Daily data on laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, weather variables, and air pollutants in Hefei covering the 2014–2019 period were collected. The seasonality and trend of daily influenza cases were explored by the time series seasonal decomposition method. Generalized linear model was fitted in conjunction with distributed lag nonlinear model to quantify the associations of RH with influenza A and influenza B. Subgroup analyses were conducted by sex, age (0–4, 5–17, and ≥18 years), and season (cold and warm seasons). A total of 5238 influenza cases including 2847 influenza A cases and 2391 influenza B cases were recorded. The epidemic of influenza presented a distinct seasonal pattern, and the number of daily influenza cases increased steadily since 2016. High RH was related to an increased risk of influenza A (maximum RR = 1.683, 95%CI: 1.365–2.076), especially among males, females, and school-age children. Low RH was associated with an increased risk of influenza B (maximum RR = 1.252, 95%CI: 1.169–1.340). The contrasting relationships of RH with influenza A and B remained significant in cold seasons. High RH and low RH were significantly associated with the increased risk of influenza A and B, respectively. The findings of our study may provide clues for proposing new effective interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acold 3ainfluenza 3alinear models 3anonlinear models 3apublic health 3arelative humidity 3aresearch 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3asubtropics 3atime series analysis1 aHe, Jun1 aZhang, Wen-Yan1 aZhao, Ke-Fu1 aJin, Jing1 aYu, Jun-Ling1 aChen, Qing-Qing1 aHou, Sai1 aZhu, Meng1 aXu, Zhiwei1 aPan, Hai-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8218-57470 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 July, v. 28, no. 27 p.36828-36836dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13107-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245007300188300001600261520163100277592002801908650001401936650001801950650001501968650001801983650002202001650002002023650000902043650001502052650002102067650001202088650001402100650002002114650000902134650002502143650001702168650001202185650001202197650003202209650001002241651001002251651001002261700002002271700002202291700001802313773010702331856004802438852000902486655001202495IND50070310220221119073528.0131101e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007031022DNAL7 a237937922pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-013-9714-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZannou, Ignace D.10aMites associated with stored grain commodities in Benin, West Africa  ap. 449-470.  aAfter insects, mites are the major arthropod pests that inhabit stored agricultural products worldwide. To determine the acarofauna that infests cowpea, maize, paddy rice and sorghum in Benin (West Africa), surveys were conducted in some principal markets (Dantokpa, Glazoue and Parakou) of this country. A total of 555 samples of grains and debris were collected in May and September 2011. More than 56 species belonging to 24 mite families were recorded in the four products. These mite species included predators, parasites, fungivorous, phytophagous and other groups whose feeding habits are not well known. The family Cheyletidae was the most prevalent and the most diverse predatory mite family encountered, in which Cheyletus malaccensis Oudemans was the most abundant species. Several families of mite pests and mites responsible for allergies (Acaridae, Glycyphagidae, Pyroglyphidae, Pyemotidae and Saproglyphidae) were also detected. The three most dominant and frequent species were C. malaccensis, Suidasia nesbitti (Hughes) and Suidasia sp. Statistical analysis showed that densities of these three mite species were higher in Parakou than in Glazoue and Dantokpa, on one hand, and higher in debris than in grains, on the other hand. The densities of S. nesbitti and Suidasia sp. decreased significantly during the dry season, whereas C. malaccensis remained stable throughout the two samplings. Of all grains, sorghum was the least infested with mites. This study shows that in Benin mites are present in stored agricultural products to which they cause serious damage, and may cause various allergies to people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheyletus 3aGlycyphagidae 3aPyemotidae 3aPyroglyphidae 3aSuidasia nesbitti 3aarthropod pests 3acorn 3adry season 3ahypersensitivity 3amarkets 3aparasites 3apredatory mites 3arice 3astatistical analysis 3astored grain 3asurveys 2aAnimals 2aEdible Grainxparasitology. 2aMites 3aBenin 0aBenin1 aAdebo, Habib O.1 aZannou, Elisabeth1 aHell, Kerstin0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2013 Dec., v. 61, no. 4 p.449-470dSpringer-Verlagx0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-013-9714-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245011100174300001300285500001400298520100700312592002801319650002401347650001501371650001201386650001101398650001601409650001701425650001301442650001201455651001301467651001701480653001901497653001201516653002001528653001101548653001501559653001701574653001101591653001301602773009201615856008101707852000901788655001201797IND60699229320221117030745.0210117e20130306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069922932DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.276.42332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaddad, Charles Richard12aA revision of the continental species of Copa Simon, 1885 (Araneae, Corinnidae) in the Afrotropical Region  ap. 1-37.  aNAL-light  aThe cryptic ground-dwelling castianeirine genus Copa Simon, 1885 (Araneae: Corinnidae) is revised in the continental Afrotropical Region. The type species of the genus, Copa flavoplumosa Simon, 1885, is redescribed and considered a senior synonym of Copa benina Strand, 1916 syn. n. and Copa benina nigra Lessert, 1933 syn. n. It is widespread throughout the Afrotropical Region but has not been introduced to any of the associated regional islands. A new species, Copa kei sp. n., is described from South Africa. Copa agelenina Simon, 1910, originally described from a subadult female from southern Botswana, is considered a nomen dubium. Copa flavoplumosa is a characteristic species of leaf litter spider assemblages and is particularly prevalent in savanna habitats on the continent, but also occurs in various forest types, grasslands, fynbos and semi-arid Nama Karoo habitats. In contrast, Copa kei sp. n. has only been recorded from Afromontane and coastal forests in south-eastern South Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrotropical region 3aCorinnidae 3afemales 3afynbos 3anew species 3aplant litter 3asavannas 3aspiders 3aBotswana 3aSouth Africa 0aCastianeirinae 0acryptic 0aground-dwelling 0alitter 0alycosiform 0anomen dubium 0aspider 0ataxonomy0 tZooKeys.g2013 Mar. 6, v. 276 p.1-37dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.276.42333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245017200176300001300348520198200361592002802343650003002371650002602401650001602427650001302443650001902456650002202475650001002497650002702507650002202534653002002556653001802576653002602594653002902620773011502649856008302764852000902847655001202856IND60552753720221122093605.0190405e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055275372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2016.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeite de Souza, Evandro14aThe effects of sublethal doses of essential oils and their constituents on antimicrobial susceptibility and antibiotic resistance among food-related bacteria: A review  ap. 1-12.  aEssential oils (EOs) and their individual constituents (ICs) have demonstrated strong and wide-spectrum antimicrobial activities against food-related bacteria. Frequently, the concentrations of EOs or ICs required to inhibit bacteria in foods are higher than those that are organoleptically acceptable, and their use at sublethal concentrations in combination with other preservation technologies has been proposed.Bacteria have the capacity to develop physiological responses to sublethal growth conditions, which can lead to decreased susceptibility toward the same or other stressing agents, including resistance to antibiotics. Despite this knowledge, studies regarding the efficacy of EOs and ICs have mostly focused on doses that inactivate target bacteria in laboratorial media or in real foods, while less is known about the implications of their use at sublethal concentrations on bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobials, physical processes and antibiotic resistance. This review presents the available studies focused on the effects of the exposure of food-related bacteria to EOs or ICs at sublethal concentrations on alterations in susceptibility to homologous or heterologous stressing agents, including antibiotic-resistance, and related physiological responses in bacteria experiencing these stresses.The findings of the available studies show that changes in susceptibility to antimicrobials and physical procedures as well as in antibiotic resistance vary with the target bacterium and the applied stress condition. Moreover, the observed stress-induced physiological responses have been varied. Notably, for the majority of the studies, the exposure of food-related bacteria to these stresses has not resulted in relevant changes in the sensitivity of the bacteria to antimicrobials, physical processes or antibiotics, which indicate that changes in bacterial sensitivity are not a major problem when considering the use of EOs or ICs in food preservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-infective properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3aessential oils 3afood preservation 3afoods 3aphysiological response 3asublethal effects 0aPlant compounds 0aPreservatives 0aBacterial sensitivity 0aStress-related responses0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2016 Oct., v. 56 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2016.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008200167300001600249520149300265592002801758650002301786650001501809650001601824650003201840650002001872650001101892650002401903650002501927650001101952650000701963650001501970650003301985650001602018650001602034653003002050653001502080653002202095653002102117653001102138700001902149700001802168700001602186700002302202773011002225856008302335852000902418655001202427IND60553542320221119065912.0180831e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055354232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.12.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaliyan, Anjli10aLong period fiber grating based sensor for the detection of triacylglycerides  ap. 693-700.  aIn this paper, stable, label free enzyme based sensor using long period fiber grating (LPG) is described for the detection of triacylglycerides. A stable covalent binding technique for lipase enzyme immobilization on an optical fiber is reported. An active and stable attachment of the functional group of the enzyme on the fiber surface is achieved using this method. Enzyme immobilization is confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Raman Spectroscopy. The stability is confirmed by lipase p-nitrophenyl palmitate (PNP) assay. In contrast to widely used amperometric based biosensor, where a number of enzymes are required, only one enzyme, namely, lipase is required in our sensor. The sensor shows optimum response within one minute at a temperature of 37°C and pH of 7.4. The sensor is based on the shift in resonance wavelength of the LPG transmission spectrum due to the interaction of triacylglycerides with the enzyme. The biosensor is highly specific towards triacylglycerides and is unaffected by the presence of many other interfering substances in serum. Interaction between the bio-molecules and the long period grating surface is also modeled theoretically using a four layer model for the LPG fiber with the bio-recognition layer and the results obtained are consistent with experimentally obtained results. The sensor shows a high sensitivity of 0.5nm/mM and a low detection limit of 17.71mg/dl for the physiological range of triacylglycerides in human blood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aliquid petroleum gas 3amodels 3apH 3apalmitates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awavelengths 0aLong period fiber grating 0aBiosensing 0aTriacylglycerides 0aCovalent binding 0aLipase1 aSital, Shivani1 aTiwari, Umesh1 aGupta, Rani1 aSharma, Enakshi K.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 May 15, v. 79 p.693-700dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.12.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245004900162500001900211520179900230592002802029650002702057650001302084650001202097650002002109650001202129650001102141650001102152650001002163650001402173650001002187650002302197653004102220653002402261653001802285700005702303700005802360700005602418700001302474700001602487700001702503700001602520700001802536700005602554700005802610700001902668700001902687773011202706856008402818852000902902655001202911IND60722488720221119220904.0210226e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072248872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e014312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jin10aScent communication behavior by giant pandas  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBehavioral strategies used in scent communication can reflect the adaptive capacity of animals. Signal detection theory and the principle of least effort posit that scent marking must be efficient and energy maximizing. The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a solitary species that relies heavily on scent communication. There have been few studies on scent communication of wild pandas due to their elusive nature. To deepen the understanding of scent communication in this vulnerable species, we analyze a novel dataset obtained from integrating transect surveys on scent marked trees with infrared camera trapping of wild giant pandas performing scent marking and scent investigation behaviors. We found that pandas selected large coniferous trees for scent marking relative to what was available. Of the scent marked trees, trees that were more frequently marked than others were those of preferred species, high elevation, at topographical aspects conducive for odor transmission, with larger surrounding trees, and at gentle slopes. There were three peaks in the frequency of scent communication throughout the year in October, December, and March, the third period overlapping with the mating season. Scent communication occurred mainly during daytime hours, peaking at dusk (18:00–20:00). Frequency of anogenital gland secretion (AGS) markings were significantly greater than urine markings during the mating season but not during other times of year, which may reflect their stronger capacity to convey estrus state of females during mating season. The findings enrich the understanding of giant panda scent communication, and more broadly emphasize the importance of considering scent communication for conservation efforts such as corridor design for this vulnerable species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAiluropoda melanoleuca 3aaltitude 3acameras 3adata collection 3aecology 3aenergy 3aestrus 3aodors 3asecretion 3aurine 3avulnerable species 0aGiant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) 0aScent communication 0aScent marking1 aHull, Vanessa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7530-56721 aConnor, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7630-51561 aYang, Hongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5935-65951 aGao, Jie1 aZhao, Faqin1 aLiao, Yushan1 aChen, Shiyu1 aHuang, Jinyan1 aZeng, Yichao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5004-87801 aZhou, Shiqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5537-32051 aZhou, Xiaoping1 aZhang, Jindong0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Jan., v. 25 p.e01431-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e014313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245009700163500001900260520185800279592002802137650002002165650001602185650002902201650002102230650001502251650001502266650001502281650001202296650001502308650001502323651001002338700001402348700001602362700001602378773012802394856007402522852000902596655001202605IND60726441120221121023914.0210205e20210126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072644112DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130304212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Chengcheng 12aA New Method to Predict Gully Head Erosion in the Loess Plateau of China Based on SBAS-InSAR  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGully head erosion causes serious land degradation in semiarid regions. The existing studies on gully head erosion are mainly based on measuring the gully volume in small-scale catchments, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming approach. Therefore, it is necessary to explore an accurate method quantitatively over large areas and long periods. The objective of this study was to develop a model to assess gully head erosion in the Loess Plateau of China using a method based on the SBAS-InSAR technique. The gully heads were extracted from the digital elevation model and validated by field investigation and aerial images. The surface deformation was estimated with SBAS-InSAR and 22 descending ALOS PALSAR datasets from 2007 to 2011. A gully head erosion model was developed; this model can incorporate terrain factors and soil types, as well as provides erosion rate predictions consistent with the SBAS-InSAR measurements (R² = 0.889). The results show that gully head erosion significantly depends on the slope angle above the gully head, slope length, topographic wetness index, and catchment area. The relationship between these factors and the gully head erosion rate is a power function, and the average rate of gully head erosion is 7.5 m³/m²/year, indicating the high erosional vulnerability of the area. The accuracy of the model can be further improved by considering other factors, such as the stream power factor, curvature, and slope aspect. This study indicates that the erosion rate of gully heads is almost unaffected by soil type in the research area. An advantage of this model is that the gully head area and surface deformation can be easily extracted and measured from satellite images, which is effective for assessing gully head erosion at a large scale in combination with SBAS-InSAR results and terrain attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adeformation 3adigital elevation models 3aland degradation 3alandscapes 3asatellites 3asoil types 3astreams 3atopography 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aFan, Wen 1 aYu, Ningyu 1 aNan, Yalin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130304213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05010naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005600188245011700244300001600361506007600377520267700453592002803130596004103158506003703199650004403236650002103280650002603301650002503327650002003352650003003372650002903402650001003431650002903441650002903470650001603499650001303515650000903528650001803537650002303555650001103578650001103589650001403600650002203614650001003636650001403646650001603660650002203676650002003698650002403718650002503742650002703767650001203794650001903806650001703825650003203842650001003874650001403884650001103898700003103909700002003940700002603960700003203986700002604018773010604044856008104150961001204231852000904243655001204252IND60611678120221207060010.0180904e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061167812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-018-1164-62doi7 aPMC61325002pmcid7 a295260222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTasin, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7379-495410aVolatiles of Grape Inoculated with Microorganisms: Modulation of Grapevine Moth Oviposition and Field Attraction  ap. 751-761.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSemiochemicals released by plant-microbe associations are used by herbivorous insects to access and evaluate food resources and oviposition sites. Adult insects may utilize microbial-derived nutrients to prolong their lifespan, promote egg development, and offer a high nutritional substrate to their offspring. Here, we examined the behavioral role of semiochemicals from grape-microbe interactions on oviposition and field attraction of the grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller). The volatile constituents released by grape inoculated with yeasts (Hanseniaspora uvarum (Niehaus), Metschnikowia pulcherrima (Pitt.) M.W. Miller, Pichia anomala, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Meyen ex E.C. Hansen, and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (Boutroux) Yarrow), sour rot bacteria (Acetobacter aceti (Pasteur) Beijerinck and Gluconobacter oxydans (Henneberg) De Ley), and a fungal pathogen (Botrytis cinerea Pers.) all endemic of the vineyard were sampled by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and ethyl acetate were the most common volatiles released from all microbe-inoculated grapes. In addition, acetic acid was released at a substantial amount following bacteria inoculation and in a three-way inoculation with yeasts and the fungus. 2-phenylethanol, a compound reported to attract tortricid moths when used in combination with acetic acid, was found at a relatively low level in all microbial combinations as well as in the control grape. While grapes inoculated with a consortium of yeasts stimulated oviposition in comparison with uninoculated berries, the phytopathogenic fungus deterred egg-laying. Nonetheless, the highest preference to lay eggs was measured when the yeasts were co-inoculated with the fungus. The lowest preference was obtained when grapes were inoculated with sour rot bacteria and their binary co-inoculation with yeasts and the fungus. Interestingly, oviposition on berries simultaneously inoculated with all the three microbial groups was unaffected. Lures loaded with either acetic acid or 2-phenylethanol were not attractive when placed in traps as single component in vineyards, but a binary blend attracted both sexes of grapevine moth in significant numbers. Further addition of the three most common volatiles released by infected berries (ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and ethyl acetate) did not significantly increase moth catch with this binary blend. The ecological implications of the grape-microorganism and grapevine moth interaction as well as the possibility to develop a pest monitoring system based on microbial volatiles are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  a934cSvenska Forskningsrådet Formas0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcetobacter (subgen.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of native strain to degrade impranil DLN. In this study, yeast strains were isolated from different areas and purified in minimal medium containing 1% impranil. Isolate NS-10 was selected as the superior strain capable of degrading impranil and identified through PCR and ITS gene. Esterase, urease and protease assays were carried out for the superior strain. Finally, the biodegradation of impranil was investigated. In total, 40 yeast strains were isolated and isolate NS-10 was selected as a superior strain based on impranil removal assay. NS-10 strain was identified as Sarocladium kiliense with 100% homology. Enzymatic assays showed that the S.kiliense could produce esterase, urease and protease. In addition, it could produce significant clear zones on impranil plates. Degradation rate for impranil was 100% for 10 g/l within 14 days. Finally, S.kiliense was taken to medium containing pure polyurethane film and the capacity of degradation was investigated by the scanning electron microscopy. Our results indicated that S.kiliense is capable of degrading impranil. These results could contribute to a better insight into the mechanism of plastic biodegradation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSarocladium 3abiodegradation 3aesterases 3afabrics 3agenes 3apolyurethanes 3aproteinases 3aurease 3ayeasts 0abioremediation 0aenzymatic activity 0aplastic 0apolyurethane 0ascanning electron microscopy1 aMoghimi, Hamid0 tYāftah/hā-yi nuvīn dar ̒ulūm-i zīstī.g2019 May, v. 6, no. 1 p.20-29dKharazmi UniversitywJournal:27935x2476-71157nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245013000167300001600297520088900313592002801202650001601230650002101246650002301267650001401290650001201304650001601316650002001332650002301352650001701375650001301392653002601405653003601431653003001467653002901497700002801526700002001554773011901574856007801693852000901771655001201780IND60522492420221117163431.0190128e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052249242DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2015-00932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Shaieb, Kamal M.10a4,15-Diamino[2.2]paracyclophane as a useful precursor for the synthesis of novel pseudo-geminal [2.2]paracyclophane compounds  ap. 843-850.  aNew reactions of 4,15-diamino[2.2]paracyclophane (1) are described.

The linear range of detection for NIC using the new Nano-TiO2 Modified Carbon Paste sensor (NTMCP) was detected using diffrential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique and it was found between 2×10⁻⁶M and 5.4×10⁻⁴M with a detection limit of 1.34×10⁻⁸M. The obtained results clarified the simplicity, high sensitivity and selectivity of the new NTMCPE for nicotine determination in real cigarettes and urine samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3acigarettes 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3anicotine 3aoxidation 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aurine 0aNicotine 0aNano-TiO2 0aCyclic voltammetry 0aScanning electron microscope1 aAzab, S.M.1 aFekry, A.M.1 aAmeer, M.A.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 May 15, v. 79 p.589-592dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.12.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245012400210500001900334520126600353592002801619650002801647650002001675650001901695650001501714650001601729650002501745650002001770650002101790650001501811650001101826650001401837650000901851650001301860653002501873653000901898653001901907653001901926700005901945700005702004773011202061856008402173852000902257655001202266IND60722488820221119220720.0210226e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072248882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e014332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, Desiree1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0690-868810aPredicting global climatic suitability for the four most invasive anuran species using ecological niche factor analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInvasive species have a massive impact on their environment and predicting geographical zones at risk of invasion is paramount to the control of further invasions. Invasive anurans are particularly detrimental to native amphibian species, other vertebrates, and even aquaculture through competition, predation, disease transmission, toxicity, or a combination of these. Four species have been designated as the worst anuran invaders worldwide: Duttaphrynus melanostictus, Rhinella marina, Lithobates catesbeianus and Xenopus laevis. In this study, we modelled global habitat suitability for all four species using ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) to predict the most susceptible areas to invasion. Models showed suitable climatic conditions for all four species expanded beyond their current native and invasive ranges. Tropical, subtropical, and island biomes around the world were among the areas with the highest ENFA suitability for all four species. Further, marginality statistics indicate niche expansion in D. melanostictus, and generalism in the three other species. As only climatic variables were used in the modelling, these results show the ultimate distributions if all landscape conditions are met without significant barriers to invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3aRhinella marina 3aXenopus laevis 3aamphibians 3aaquaculture 3adisease transmission 3afactor analysis 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3aniches 3apredation 3arisk 3atoxicity 0aEcological modelling 0aENFA 0aInvasive frogs 0aInvasive toads1 aBorzée, Amaël1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1093-677X1 aJang, Yikweon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7213-73190 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Jan., v. 25 p.e01433-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e014333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03865naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245010600177300001500283520231000298592002802608650002302636650001402659650002602673650001402699650001902713650001502732650002602747650002302773650001402796650001802810650001102828650001302839650001402852650001502866650002402881650001602905650002202921651001102943653002302954653001502977653001602992653001003008653001503018700002103033700003103054700002203085700001803107773010403125856008503229852000903314655001203323IND60612197320221119005603.0190411e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061219732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2015.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Montaudouin, Xavier10aCockle infection by Himasthla quissetensis – I. From cercariae emergence to metacercariae infection  ap. 99-107.  aThe European cockle (Cerastoderma edule) is an exploited bivalve along the North-Eastern Atlantic semi-sheltered ecosystems. Its population dynamics are driven by numerous environmental factors, including parasitism, particularly by trematodes. The complex life cycle of trematodes includes a free living stage (cercaria) between the first (a mollusk) and the second (an invertebrate or a vertebrate) intermediate hosts. Taking the example of Himasthla quissetensis, a dominant trematode in Arcachon Bay (France) utilizing Nassarius reticulatus as first intermediate host and the cockle as second intermediate host, we investigated the correlation between cockle infection and cercariae emergence by N. reticulatus, including the role of water temperature and light. Experimental and field data provided evidence that cercariae emergence from N. reticulatus took place during the night and for water temperature comprised between 15°C and 22°C (optimum at 20°C). The lifespan of cercariae did not exceed 48h and 50% of them were no more infectious after 7h. A model was designed (emergence=f(water temperature)) in order to calculate an average monthly cercarial emergence rate according to water temperature that was daily recorded for 5years (1998–2002). Concomitantly, non-infected cockles were transplanted each of these years in order to assess the infection rate by H. quissetensis. Infection occurred strictly for the same water temperatures (and dates) as those expected for cercariae emergence. Within each year, there was often (but not always) a good correlation between the predicted number of emerging cercariae and the observed number of cercariae transformed into metacercariae in cockles. However, the among-years variability of cockle infection (×4.4 range) was not explained by the predicted annual number of emerging cercariae. This study highlights the importance of water temperature and light in stimulating cercariae emergence which is closely related to the occurrence of cockle infection. Accordingly, climate change would be expected to alter certain parasite transmission traits. Conversely, the lack of correlation between the total number of metacercariae in cockles and the expected number of cercariae suggests that other factors contribute to infestation variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCerastoderma edule 3aHimasthla 3aNassarius reticulatus 3acercariae 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aintermediate hosts 3alongevity 3ametacercariae 3amodels 3amolluscs 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3apopulation dynamics 3avertebrates 3awater temperature 3aFrance 0aCerastoderma edule 0aTrematodes 0aTemperature 0aLight 0aParasitism1 aBlanchet, Hugues1 aDesclaux-Marchand, Céline1 aLavesque, Nicolas1 aBachelet, Guy0 tJournal of sea research.g2016 July, v. 113 p.99-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2015.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01582naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245012300161300001600284520046700300592002800767650001700795650002600812650001200838650001700850650001400867650001100881650002100892653001800913653001700931653001800948653003200966700001600998773011901014856007801133852000901211655001201220IND60522492620221117163419.0190128e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052249262DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2015-00862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Chun-Hua10aHelical chain Ag(I) complexes with a tridentate N-donor ligand: syntheses, structural characterization, and properties  ap. 851-856.  aThe tridentate N-donor ligand 2,6-di(2-oxazolyl)pyridine (L) reacts with AgClO₄ and AgPF₆ to yield two new complexes, {[Ag₅(L)₅](ClO₄)₅}ₙ (1) and {[Ag₅(L)₅](PF₆)₅}ₙ (2), which have been characterized by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffractions, IR spectroscopy, and elemental and thermogravimetric analyses.

Larrabee12aA Climate Hyperspectral Infrared Radiance Product (CHIRP) Combining the AIRS and CrIS Satellite Sounding Record  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA Climate Hyperspectral Infrared Radiance Product (CHIRP) is introduced combining data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on NASA’s EOS-AQUA platform, the Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) sounder on NASA’s SNPP platform, and continuing with CRIS sounders on the NOAA/NASA Joint Polar Satellite Series (JPSS) of polar satellites. The CHIRP product converts the parent instrument’s radiances to a common Spectral Response Function (SRF) and removes inter-satellite biases, providing a consistent inter-satellite radiance record. The CHIRP record starts in September 2002 with AIRS, followed by CrIS SNPP and the JPSS series of CrIS instruments. The CHIRP record should continue until the mid-2040’s as additional JPSS satellites are launched. These sensors, in CHIRP format, provide the climate community with a homogeneous sensor record covering much of the infrared. We give an overview of the conversion of AIRS and CrIS to CHIRP, and define the SRF for common CHIRP format. Considerable attention is paid to removing static bias offsets among these three sensors. The CrIS instrument on NASA’s SNPP satellite is used as the calibration standard. Simultaneous Nadir Overpasses (SNOs) as well as large statistical samplings of radiances from these three satellites are used to derive the instrument bias offsets and estimate the bias offset accuracy, which is ~0.03 K. In addition, possible scene-dependent calibration differences between CHIRP derived from AIRS and CHIRP derived from CrIS on the SNPP platform are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3aclimate 3asatellites1 aHepplewhite, Chris 1 aMotteler, Howard 1 aBuczkowski, Steven 1 aDeSouza-Machado, Sergio 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130304183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009200172300001600264520090600280592002801186650001501214650002101229650001701250650002001267650001301287650000901300650000701309650001101316650001001327650001901337653001901356653001301375653002001388653001501408653002001423700001801443700001301461700001701474773013401491856008601625852000901711655001201720IND60552754120221122093558.0170607e20140105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055275412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiebentritt, M.10aAdsorption and electroreduction of hematite particles on steel in strong alkaline media  ap. 197-201.  aThe aim of this work was to use various electrokinetic measurement techniques, from which zeta potential values were obtained, in order to investigate the behavior of the surface charge of hematite particles in highly concentrated electrolytes (up to 10M) and to correlate these results with the electrochemical reduction of hematite in a strong alkaline media at 110°C. Electrochemistry experiments showed that adsorption of hematite onto steel in this strong media was possible although weak, thus the electroreduction of hematite into elemental iron was observed. At alkaline pH, zeta potential measurements by electrophoresis in diluted media yielded coherent results, and in high concentration electrolytes, electroacoustic measurements allowed proving that over a concentration in [Na+] of 0.1M, a charge reversal occurs. Zeta potential then remains slightly positive in the range of 0.1–10M.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrophoresis 3ahematite 3airon 3apH 3asodium 3asteel 3azeta potential 0aZeta potential 0aHematite 0aAcoustophoresis 0aAdsorption 0aCharge reversal1 aVolovitch, P.1 aOgle, K.1 aLefèvre, G.0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Jan. 05, v. 440 p.197-201dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245012500169500001400294520168800308592002801996650002002024650002102044650002602065650001602091650001202107650001002119650001102129650001002140650001702150650001702167650001302184650002502197650002102222650001002243650001102253650001902264650001302283650001202296653001102308653001702319653001902336653001702355653001702372653002502389700001402414700001702428700001402445700001702459700001402476700002702490773009102517856009002608852000902698655001202707IND60706731820221118045608.0201209e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070673182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1279182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jie10aColonization and performance of a pyrene-degrading bacterium Mycolicibacterium sp. Pyr9 on root surfaces of white clover  aNAL-light  aSome rhizosphere bacteria could colonize on the root surface of plants, or even form biofilm to promote plant growth, enhance plant resistance to harsh external environments and block the soil contamination. In this study, to explore the effects of pyrene-degrading bacterium on root surface on plant uptake of pyrene, a pyrene-degrading bacterium Mycolicibacterium sp. Pyr9 was isolated from the root surface of Eleusine indica L. Gaertn. in PAH-contaminated fields; after antibiotic labeling, it was colonized onto the root surface of white clover (Trifolium repens L.), and its distribution and performance were monitored under different levels of pyrene contamination. Strain Pyr9 could degrade 98% of pyrene (with an initial concentration of 50 mg L⁻¹) in culture solution within 8 d; it also owns a variety of plant growth promoting characteristics and appreciable tolerance to harsh environments. The transcription of pyrene catabolic genes in Pyr9 enhanced obviously when induced by pyrene. Pyr9 colonized and grew well on the root surface of white clover via root inoculation; some cells could even enter into the root tissues and move to the shoots. Compared with the Pyr9-free treatment, the pyrene contents in the roots and shoots of Pyr9-inoculated white clover decreased by 25%–30% and 33%–42%, respectively. Correspondingly, the pyrene accumulation and translocation factors in white clover decreased as well. These results indicate that Pyr9 would be a good potential to circumvent plant pyrene pollution. This research may provide a theoretical basis and technical support for the safety of agricultural products and human health in PAH-contaminated sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleusine indica 3aTrifolium repens 3aagricultural products 3aantibiotics 3abiofilm 3acells 3afields 3agenes 3ahuman health 3aplant growth 3aresearch 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aroot inoculation 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil pollution 3asurfaces 3atissues 0aPyrene 0aPlant uptake 0aBiodegradation 0aColonization 0aRoot surface 0aMycolicibacterium sp1 aGu, Yujun1 aChen, Zhigao1 aSong, Yao1 aSun, Fengfei1 aLiu, Juan1 aWaigi, Michael Gatheru0 tChemosphere.g2021 Jan., v. 263 p.127918-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1279183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012500163300001500288500001400303520111700317592002801434650001601462650002101478650001101499650001301510650000901523650001001532650001601542650001101558650001201569650001501581651001501596651001401611651001601625651001601641653001301657653001501670653001301685700002401698700001801722700002401740773009401764856008101858852000901939655001201948IND60699229820221117030911.0200617e20130308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069922982DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.276.41072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuran, Davut10aAlburnoides manyasensis (Actinopterygii, Cyprinidae), a new species of cyprinid fish from Manyas Lake basin, Turkey  ap. 85-102.  aNAL-light  aAlburnoides manyasensis, sp. n., is described from the Koca Stream (Lake Manyas drainage, Marmara Sea basin) in Anatolia.

The porous shell of the particle is treated as a solvent-permeable and ion-penetrable surface layer of finite thickness, in which hydrodynamic frictional segments with fixed charges distribute uniformly. A unit cell model that allows the overlap of the electric double layers of adjacent particles is employed to account for the effect of particle interactions. When the system is slightly distorted from equilibrium, the electrokinetic equations governing the electric potential, ion concentration, and fluid velocity distributions are linearized and solved using a perturbation method with the fixed charge densities of the core surface and porous layer of each soft sphere as the small parameters. Explicit formulas for the sedimentation velocity and potential in the suspension are obtained to the second orders of these fixed charge densities with the relaxation effect of the double layers included. The sedimentation velocity and potential are not necessarily monotonic functions of the volume fraction of the particles; the particle concentration effects are significant, even in dilute suspensions. In the limiting cases, the analytical solutions of the sedimentation velocity and potential for charged soft spheres reduce to those for charged rigid spheres and charged porous spheres. It is shown that a suspension of charged but neutral soft spheres can produce sedimentation potential, and their sedimentation velocity differs from that of the uncharged soft spheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 0aSedimentation velocity 0aSedimentation potential 0aElectrophoretic mobility 0aSoft sphere 0aParticle interaction effect1 aKeh, Huan J.0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Jan. 05, v. 440 p.185-196dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.08.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013600175300001600311520200600327592002802333650002102361650001402382650001102396650001702407650001902424650002202443650000902465650001902474650001102493650001402504650000702518650001102525650002602536650001502562650002502577653003302602653002102635653001902656653003102675653002802706700006502734700002202799700006002821700001802881700005602899700005902955700001903014773009703033856008503130852000903215655001203224IND60612943520221123042456.0181127e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061294352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorentino, Antonino10aDisinfection of urban wastewater by a new photo-Fenton like process using Cu-iminodisuccinic acid complex as catalyst at neutral pH  ap. 206-215.  aPhoto-Fenton process is among the most effective advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in urban wastewater treatment and disinfection, but its application as tertiary treatment at full scale has not been a feasible/attractive option so far because optimum conditions are typically achieved under acidic pH. In this work a new photo Fenton like process (UV-C/H2O2/IDS-Cu) using iminodisuccinic acid (IDS)-Cu complex as catalyst, was compared to other processes (UV-C/H2O2/Cu, UV-C/H2O2/Fe, H2O2 and UV-C) in urban wastewater disinfection. Since this is the first time that IDS-Cu complex was isolated and used as catalyst, preliminary tests to evaluate the mineralization of a model compound (phenol, 25 mg L−1 initial concentration) in water by UV-C/H2O2/IDS-Cu were carried out. Almost complete mineralization of phenol (95%) was observed after 60 min treatment, being the process more effective than all other investigated AOPs (Fenton and photo-Fenton processes). This process was also proven to be more effective in the inactivation of E. coli (complete inactivation (3.5 log units) in 10 min) at natural pH (7.8 ± 0.5) in real wastewater, than the other processes investigated. Unlike of what observed for E. coli inactivation, the investigated processes only partially inactivated total bacterial population (from 18% for UV-C to 43% for UV-C/H2O2/Cu), according to flow cytometry measurements. In particular, Cu based photo-Fenton processes resulted in the higher percentage of inactivated total cells, thus being consistent with the results of E. coli inactivation. It is worthy to note that, as H2O2 was decreased, UV-C/H2O2/Cu-IDS was more effective than UV-C/H2O2/Cu process. Moreover, the formation of small and large clusters decreased in the presence of Cu and Cu-IDS complex, and process efficiency improved accordingly; these results show that Cu based AOPs can more effectively disaggregate clusters, thus making disinfection process more effective than Fe based AOPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acatalysts 3acopper 3adisinfection 3aflow cytometry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amineralization 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphenol 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAdvanced oxidation processes 0aEscherichia coli 0aFlow cytometry 0aHomogeneous photocatalysis 0aWastewater disinfection1 aCucciniello, Raffaele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3291-72731 aDi Cesare, Andrea1 aFontaneto, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5770-03531 aPrete, Prisco1 aRizzo, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1449-91161 aCorno, Gianluca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7423-87971 aProto, Antonio0 tWater research.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 146 p.206-215dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03667naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016300172300001400335520203600349592002802385650002202413650001902435650001102454650001102465650001002476650001902486650001102505650001702516650001002533650001502543650001502558650000902573650001802582650001502600650001302615650001002628650001102638650001202649650001402661651001502675653001702690653001402707653003302721653002902754653001802783653001502801700001802816700001802834700002002852700002002872773010302892856008502995852000903080655001203089IND60612197620221119005443.0190411e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061219762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2015.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehnert, Kristina10aHeartworm (Acanthocheilonema spirocauda) and seal louse (Echinophthirius horridus) infections in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) from the North and Baltic Seas  ap. 65-72.  aThe seal louse (Echinophthirius [E.] horridus) and the heartworm (Acanthocheilonema [A.] spirocauda) are parasites of harbour seal (Phoca vitulina). Little is known about the role of the seal louse as a potential vector and its role for the development and transmission of heartworm larvae to their final host, the harbour seal. The life-cycle of the heartworm is still not fully understood. For the presented study, findings of 1191 stranded harbour seals collected along the North- and Baltic Sea coast between 1996 and 2013 were examined. 4.4% (n=53) of these harbour seals were infected with adult heartworms and 3.4% (n=40) harbour seals carried seal lice. The highest prevalence and level of infection with adult heartworms (A. spirocauda) (9.3%) and seal lice (E. horridus) (8.9%) were found on yearling harbour seals (7–18months) compared to neonate and adult seals. Investigating seal lice (n=35) for larval heartworm stages one larvae was encountered in an ethanol-fixated seal louse. During a health monitoring survey of live harbour seals, 109 animals were captured and examined during spring and autumn between 2008 and 2014. Blood samples were taken and microfilariae were discovered in blood smears in 41% (n=45) of the examined harbour seals. Yearling seals (n=21) showed higher prevalence (86%) and level of infection with microfilariae than adults. Microfilariae were identified as A. spirocauda by sequencing the species-specific COI gene in 24 blood samples. The high prevalence of microfilariae of A. spirocauda in blood samples (41%) is in contrast to the low prevalence of mature infections/adult specimens in stranded seals (4.4%) investigated. Although rare parasites of seals, the recent increase in prevalence of heartworm and seal lice in stranded seals and the relatively high occurrence of microfilaria in the free-ranging population underscore the importance of further studies investigating the immunology of infections and their transmission pathways, as well as the epidemiology of both species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocheilonema 3aPhoca vitulina 3aadults 3aautumn 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acoasts 3aepidemiology 3agenes 3aheartworms 3aimmunology 3alice 3amicrofilariae 3amonitoring 3aneonates 3aseals 3aspring 3asurveys 3ayearlings 3aBaltic Sea 0aHarbour seal 0aParasites 0aAcanthocheilonema spirocauda 0aEchinophthirius horridus 0aMicrofilariae 0aLife-cycle1 aSchwanke, Eva1 aHahn, Kerstin1 aWohlsein, Peter1 aSiebert, Ursula0 tJournal of sea research.g2016 July, v. 113 p.65-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2015.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245010100162300001600263500001900279520160800298592002801906650002501934650001701959650002501976650001602001650001702017650002202034650001002056650001602066650001802082650002002100650003202120653001602152653002302168653002502191653002302216653001302239700001902252700002702271773011302298856007102411852000902482655001202491IND60705377920221119195630.0200804s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070537792DNAL7 a10.1071/FP193432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirzahosseini, Zahra10aLED lights increase an antioxidant capacity of Arabidopsis thaliana under wound-induced stresses  ap. 853-864.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA comparison among four light emitting diode (LED) lights including red LED (R), blue LED (B), red (70%) + blue (30%) LED (RB) and white LED (W) as well as fluorescent (F) light was made on antioxidative capacity of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. in response to wounding. Under wound-stress condition, LED-exposed plants, especially RB-irradiated plants, maintained significantly higher shoot dry weight and antioxidant enzymes activities compared with those irradiated with fluorescent lights. The highest amounts of both chlorophyll a and b were observed in the leaves treated with B light. Also, the concentration of H2O2 was higher under the condition of RB and B lights compared with the other light environments. The highest amount of malondialdehyde was measured in plants exposed to F and B lights. Similarly, wounded leaves under F and B light conditions showed the maximum lipoxygenase activity, whereas R-exposed leaves had the lowest lipoxygenase activity. In contrast, the highest level of phenolic compounds was found in R and RB exposed leaves in response to wounding. Among the five light treatments, RB and B lights were more effective in stimulating anthocyanin synthesis; however, RB-exposed plants were more efficient in the late-induction of the PAL gene (phenylalanine ammonia lyase catalyses the first step of the general phenylpropanoid pathway). Collectively, we reasoned that RB light condition gives a superior capacity to Arabidopsis thaliana to tolerate wound-stress. Also, we propose the probable signalling role of ROS in light-stimulated wound responses in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3afluorescent lamps 3agenes 3airradiation 3alipoxygenases 3amalondialdehyde 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 0aanthocyanin 0aantioxidant enzyme 0alight emitting diode 0aphenolic compounds 0awounding1 aShabani, Leila1 aSabzalian, Mohammad R.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2020, v. 47, no. 9 p.853-864dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP193433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100001900197245011200216506007600328506003100404520218400435592002802619596000902647506003702656650001202693650001302705650002002718650002702738650001602765650002002781650001302801650001702814651001502831653003402846653001702880653002902897653002702926653001402953653001902967700002202986700001903008700002403027700001703051700002203068773011903090856008803209852000903297655001203306IND60775471420221207095601.0220606e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077547142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1552402chorus7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1552402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStid, Jacob T.10aSolar array placement, electricity generation, and cropland displacement across California's Central Valley  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aUnderstanding agriculturally co-located solar photovoltaic (PV) installation capacity, practices, and preferences is imperative to foster a future where solar power and agriculture co-exist with limited impacts on food production. Crops and PV panels are often co-located as they have similar ideal conditions for maximum yield. The recent boom in solar photovoltaics is displacing a significant amount of cropland. The literature on agriculturally co-located PV array installations lacks important spatiotemporal details that could help inform future array installations and improve associated policies and incentive programs. This study used imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program for object-based analysis (within eCognition Developer), and from Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI for temporal analysis (using LandTrendr) to identify and characterize non-residential ground-mounted PV arrays in California's Central Valley installed between 2008 and 2018. This dataset includes over 210,000 individually identified panels grouped by mount and installation year into 1006 PV arrays (69% are agriculturally co-located). The most common type of mounting system is fixed-axis, and individual co-located systems tend to be small (0.34 MW). There were fewer single-axis tracking arrays, although the average capacity per system is nearly four times higher (1.20 MW). In total, the mapped arrays accounted for 3.6 GW of capacity and generated a cumulative of 32,700 GWh within the Central Valley during the study period. For the 694 identified agriculturally co-located arrays (2.1 GW), significantly sub-optimal installation practices were observed in the spacing and spatial field placement of the arrays. In terms of crop conversion preferences, commodity crops (pastureland) dominated the total cumulative area converted although specialty crops (orchards) also contributed to a large number of solar installations on cropland. These results provide important details of current PV placement practices; understanding these can help to inform future practices and guide future regulations that might promote solar installations while preserving agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data  cNIFA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLandsat 3acropland 3adata collection 3aelectricity generation 3aenvironment 3afood production 3apastures 3asolar energy 3aCalifornia 0aSpatiotemporal identification 0aPhotovoltaic 0aAgricultural co-location 0aInstallation practices 0aCrop loss 0aPacking factor1 aShukla, Siddharth1 aAnctil, Annick1 aKendall, Anthony D.1 aRapp, Jeremy1 aHyndman, David W.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 835 p.155240-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1552403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03660naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006900153245010600222500001900328520239000347592002802737650001102765650002002776650002102796650001602817650001902833650001402852650000902866650002002875650002602895650001702921650001202938700002602950700002802976700005403004773011903058856008803177852000903265655001203274IND60706732020221118045656.0201025e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070673202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchillopoulou, Dimitra V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7780-267210aMonitoring of transport infrastructure exposed to multiple hazards: a roadmap for building resilience  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMonitoring-enhanced resilience in transport management is emerging together with the new technologies and digital data, however have not been fully explored yet. Digital technologies have the potential to provide rapid resilience assessments in a quantifiable and engineered manner for transport infrastructure, which is exposed to multiple natural and human-induced hazards and diverse loads throughout their life-cycle. Physical damage and disruption of networks and interdependent systems may cause tremendous socioeconomic impact, affecting world economies and societies. Nowadays, transport infrastructure stakeholders have shifted the requirements in risk and resilience assessment. The expectation is that risk is estimated efficiently, almost in real-time with high accuracy, aiming at maximising the functionality and minimising losses. Nevertheless, no integrated framework exists for quantifying resilience to diverse hazards, based on structural and functionality monitoring (SHFM) data, and this is the main capability gap that this paper envisages filling. Monitoring systems have been used widely in transport infrastructure and have been studied extensively in the literature. Data can facilitate prognosis of the asset condition and the functionality of the network, informing computer-based asset and traffic models, which can assist in defining actionable performance indicators, for diagnosis and for defining risk and loss expediently and accurately. Evidence exists that SHFM is an enabler of resilience. However, strategies are absent in support of monitoring-based resilience assessment in transport infrastructure management. In response to the above challenge, this paper puts forward for the first time in the international literature, a roadmap for monitoring-based quantification of resilience for transport infrastructure, based on a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art. It is a holistic asset management roadmap, which identifies the interactions among the design, monitoring, risk assessment and quantification of resilience to multiple hazards. Monitoring is embraced as a vital component, providing expedient feedback for recovery measures, accelerating decision-making for adaptation of changing ecosystems and built environments, utilising emerging technologies, to continuously deliver safer and resilient transport infrastructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3adecision making 3adigital database 3aenvironment 3ainfrastructure 3aprognosis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asocioeconomic factors 3astakeholders 3atraffic1 aMitoulis, Stergios A.1 aArgyroudis, Sotirios A.1 aWang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1572-63330 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 746 p.141001-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007800165300001400243520140300257592002801660650001801688650001501706650002001721650001101741650002601752650001301778650001601791650001501807650001001822651001201832653001601844653001501860653001401875653001601889653001201905653001301917700002501930700002901955773009401984856008102078852000902159655001202168IND60699230020221120055243.0210117e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069923002DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.277.46842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernadou, Abel12aA preliminary checklist of the ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) of Andorra  ap. 13-23.  aWithin the last decade, checklists of the ant fauna of several European countries have been published or updated. Nevertheless, no ant checklists have hitherto been published for the principality of Andorra, a small landlocked country located in the eastern part of the Pyrenees. This work presents a critical list of the ant species of Andorra based on a review of the literature and on the biological material we collected during several field campaigns conducted in Andorra since the year 2005. Seventy-five species belonging to 21 genera of Formicidae were recorded. Nine species were recorded for the first time in Andorra: Aphaenogaster gibbosa (Latreille, 1798), Camponotus lateralis (Olivier, 1792), Camponotus piceus (Leach, 1825), Formica exsecta Nylander, 1846, Lasius piliferus Seifert, 1992, Tapinoma madeirense Forel, 1895, Temnothorax lichtensteini (Bondroit, 1918), Temnothorax niger (Forel, 1894), Temnothorax nigriceps (Mayr, 1855). The most speciose genera were Formica Linnaeus, 1758 and Temnothorax Forel, 1890 with 14 and 12 species, respectively. The ant fauna of Andorra is mostly dominated by Central European species (some are typical cold climate specialists); however species belonging to the Mediterranean ant fauna were also found. This can be explained by the particular geographic situation of Andorra which is characterized by a high mountain Mediterranean climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphaenogaster 3aCamponotus 3aFormica exsecta 3aLasius 3aMediterranean climate 3aTapinoma 3aTemnothorax 3acold zones 3afauna 3aAndorra 0aHymenoptera 0aFormicidae 0achecklist 0anew records 0aAndorra 0aPyrenees1 aFourcassié, Vincent1 aEspadaler, X.q(Xavier),0 tZooKeys.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 277 p.13-23dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.277.46843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012400171300001600295520147100311592002801782596008001810650001001890650004601900650001001946650002001956650002001976650003001996650002402026650001102050650002302061650001702084650001502101650002602116650001502142650001902157650002102176650002602197700002402223700002002247700001702267700001902284700002102303773010602324856008102430852000902511655001202520IND60611678620221122105803.0180904e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061167862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-018-1175-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReceveur, Joseph P.10aChanges in Larval Mosquito Microbiota Reveal Non-target Effects of Insecticide Treatments in Hurricane-Created Habitats  ap. 719-728.  aEphemeral aquatic habitats and their associated microbial communities (microbiomes) play important roles in the growth and development of numerous aquatic insects, including mosquitoes (Diptera). Biological control agents, such as Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) or insect growth regulators (e.g., methoprene), are commonly used to control mosquitoes in these habitats. However, it is unknown how commonly used control compounds affect the mosquito internal microbiome and potentially alter their life history traits. The objectives of this study were threefold: characterize the internal microbiota of Aedes larvae (Culicidae) in ephemeral forested mosquito habitat using high-throughput amplicon based sequencing, assess how mosquito control treatments affect the internal microbial communities of larval mosquitoes, and determine if changes to the microbiome resulted from direct or indirect treatment effects. The larval microbiome varied in community composition and diversity with development stage and treatment, suggesting potential effects of control compounds on insect microbial ecology. While microbial community differences due to Bti treatment were a result of indirect effects on larval development, methoprene had significant impacts on bacterial and algal taxa that could not be explained by indirect treatment effects. These results provide new information on the interactions between pesticide treatments and insect microbial communities.  aPublisher supplied data  a6032305751cHunterdon County Vector Control Program (HCVCP) black fly grant 3aAedes 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis 3aalgae 3aaquatic habitat 3aaquatic insects 3abiological control agents 3acommunity structure 3alarvae 3alarval development 3alife history 3amethoprene 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3amosquito control 3apesticide application1 aPechal, Jennifer L.1 aBenbow, M.

As such, artificial grasslands created with species suited to the geographical area present a popular alternative. However, species that are both native and suitable for creating artificial grasslands are rare, especially in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China. In this study, we performed two experiments respectively with varied temperature and water potential, to evaluate the cold and drought resistance of 13 local Poa L. species in the Qinghai Province of China. Within the range of 0–20 °C, our results showed that increase in temperature increased the germination indices of all 13 species, with some species germinating even at 5 °C, demonstrating relatively cold-resistant species in our study. Similarly, decrease in moisture levels decreased the germination percentages of all species in this experiment, with several species germinating at even −1.2 MPa, which were considered as relatively higher drought-resistant species in this study. Among the 13 species, P. malaca, P. paucifolia, and P. sphondylodes exhibited relatively strong cold-resistance, while P. poophagorum, P. pratensis var. anceps Gaud. cv. Qinghai, and P. pratensis cv. Qinghai showed relatively high drought resistance. Overall, the results indicated that all the 13 native grass species evaluated in the study were suitable for planting and cultivation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. This study could provide insights into identifying suitable species for plant breeding in Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and establish a protocol for germplasm evaluation of local Poa L. species. Further, these findings can help evaluate and identify more native species suited for the restoration of degraded grasslands, especially under the scenario of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa 3aclimate change 3acold 3adrought tolerance 3aecology 3agermplasm evaluation 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3aprotocols 3aseed germination 3atemperature 3awater potential 3aChina 0aPoa spp 0aGermination indices 0aCold-tolerance 0aDrought-tolerance 0aQinghai-TibetanPlateau 0aGrassland restoration1 aZhang, Chunping1 aDong, Quanmin1 aYang, Zengzeng1 aZhu, Hui,1 aYu, Yang1 aYang, Xiaoxia0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Jan., v. 25 p.e01442-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e014423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012000160500001900280520212400299592002802423650001302451650001202464650001902476650001302495650001302508650001402521650001902535650001602554650001202570651001002582651002102592700001502613700001902628700001502647700001602662700002002678773012802698856007402826852000902900655001202909IND60726441820221120134248.0210205e20210126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072644182DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130304252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zhongming 10aSpatiotemporal Variability in the Glacier Snowline Altitude across High Mountain Asia and Potential Driving Factors  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe glacier snowline altitude (SLA) at the end of the melt season is an indicator of the glacier equilibrium line altitude and can be used to estimate glacier mass balance and reconstruct past climate. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variability in glacier SLA across High Mountain Asia, including the Altai Mountains, Karakoram Mountains, Western Himalayas, Gongga Mountains, Tian Shan, and Nyainqentanglha Mountains, over the past 30 years (1989–2019) to better elucidate the state of these mountain glaciers. Remote-sensing data are processed to delineate the glacier SLA across these mountainous regions, and nearby weather station data are incorporated to determine the potential relationships between SLA and temperature/precipitation. The mean SLAs across the Altai and Karakoram mountains ranged from 2860 ± 169 m to 3200 ± 152 m and from 5120 ± 159 m to 5320 ± 240 m, respectively, with both regions experiencing an average increase of up to 137 m over the past 30 years. Furthermore, the mean glacier SLAs across the Western Himalayas and Gongga Mountains increased by 190–282 m over the past 30 years, with both regions experiencing large fluctuations. In particular, the mean glacier SLA across the Western Himalayas varied from 4910 ± 190 m in 1989 to 5380 ± 164 m in 2000, and that across the Gongga Mountains varied from 4960 ± 70 m in 1989 to 5330 ± 100 m in 2012. Correlation analyses between glacier SLA and temperature/precipitation suggest that temperature is the primary factor influencing glacier SLA across these High Mountain Asia glaciers. There is a broad increase in glacier SLA from the Altai Mountains to the Karakoram Mountains, with a decrease in glacier SLA with decreasing latitude across the Himalayas; the maximum SLA occurs near the northern slopes of the Western Himalayas. The glacier SLA is lower on the eastern side of the Tibetan Plateau and exhibits a longitudinal distribution pattern. These results are expected to provide useful information for evaluating the state of High Mountain Asia glaciers, as well as their response and feedback to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aglaciers 3alatitude 3amountains 3aremote sensing 3atemperature 3aweather 3aChina 3aHimalayan region1 aGeng, Lei 1 aShen, Baoshou 1 aWu, Yuwei 1 aChen, Anan 1 aWang, Ninglian 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130304253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245012200158300001600280500001900296520199100315592002802306650001602334650002002350650001702370650002002387650001002407650001602417650002502433650003902458650005202497650003802549650001602587650001202603650001502615650001802630650001402648653001502662653002502677653001002702653001102712700002102723700001602744700002002760773011302780856007102893852000902964655001202973IND60705378120221119195315.0200804s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070537812DNAL7 a10.1071/FP200852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasouli, Fatemeh10aDeveloping and validating protocols for mechanical isolation of guard-cell enriched epidermal peels for omics studies  ap. 803-814.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStomata, which are microscopic valves on the leaf surface formed by two guard cells (GC), play a critical role in the regulation of leaf water and gas exchange and, hence, determine plant adaptive potential. However, little data is available on GC biochemistry, protein abundance and gene expression, mainly due to technical difficulties and challenges in isolating sufficient amounts of high-quality pure GC. In the present study we applied some modifications to the mechanical isolation of guard-cell to generalise this method for diverse growth conditions as well as plant species. Epidermal peel fragments enriched in guard cells were mechanically isolated from quinoa, spinach and sugar beet leaves grown at two conditions (normal and salt stress). Multiple analysis was performed to confirm the suitability and superiority of the modified technique to the original method. At the first step, the viability and purity of GC-enriched epidermal fragments were assessed under the microscope. Then, the RNA integrity, gene expression, and 1D SDS-PAGE tests were performed to validate the suitability of this technique for omics studies. The data revealed a wide range of proteins as well as a high integrity of RNA extracted from guard cell samples. The expression level of several GC-specific genes and mesophyll-dominant genes were investigated using a comparative analysis of transcriptome datasets of GC and whole-leaf samples. We found that Rubisco and photosynthesis-related proteins such as chlorophyll a/b binding protein were substantially higher in the whole leaf compared with the GCs. More importantly, GC-specific genes such as OST1, SLAC1, MYB60, FAMA and HT1 were highly expressed in the GCs, confirming that our guard cell preparation was highly enriched in GC gene transcripts. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR further confirmed the efficacy of the GC isolation technique for exploring responses of GC to diverse types of stress at the molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3adata collection 3agas exchange 3agene expression 3agenes 3aguard cells 3aisolation techniques 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3asalt stress 3aspinach 3asugar beet 3atranscriptome 3aviability 0aguard cell 0amechanical isolation 0aomics 0aquinoa1 aKiani-Pouya, Ali1 aZhang, Heng1 aShabala, Sergey0 tFunctional plant biology.g2020, v. 47, no. 9 p.803-814dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP200853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01418naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245019800167300001400365500001400379520039100393592002800784650001700812650001200829650001600841650001900857651001300876651001400889700002100903773009300924856007801017852000901095655001201104IND60693343420221121225500.0200506e20091009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069334342DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.24.2422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNearns, Eugenio H.12aA new species of Plectromerus Haldeman from Central America and description of the female of Plectromerus dezayasi Nearns & Branham, 2008 (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae, Cerambycinae, Plectromerini)  ap. 55-62.  aNAL-light  aA new species, Plectromerus roncavei (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae, Cerambycinae, Plectromerini), from Honduras and Nicaragua is described and illustrated.

S75.  aThe objective is to develop methods to adapt an in-person urban medical clinic-based intervention to a telehealth modality serving Native Americans in a rural setting where health disparities are more pronounced. The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education (EFNEP) program intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory and adult learning strategies. The adaptation methods are driven by the community-based participatory implementation science framework. Native American families residing in rural California communities. Parents with young children are referred by physicians to attend an intervention (8-weekly sessions) delivered via telehealth by EFNEP educators. The intervention is focused on obesity prevention utilizing Guided Goal Setting, obesity risk assessments, storytelling, and food-related parenting topics. Meetings (n = 4) were convened over a four month period to develop a multi-phased community-based participatory approach to adapt the intervention. Members included the State EFNEP Director and County Program Advisors (n = 2), EFNEP educator, Indian Health Center Outreach Director, Pediatric Endocrinologist, Public Health Nurse, Nutrition Education Professor, Nutrition Specialist, and Human Development Specialist with over half having experience working with rural and Native American communities (n = 6). A three-phased approach was identified: formative, capacity bridging, and referral model implementation with each rooted in community-based participation. Community asset mapping will be conducted in the formative phase to outline healthcare partners serving Native American communities. A community advisory board consisting of Native American elders, Tribal chairs, parents, educators, and health care providers will be created for consultation on all phases including intervention content modification, identification of community/tribal health clinic partners, and inform referral and telehealth delivery strategies. Adapting an intervention to a different target audience, location, and modality necessitates a thorough process to ensure relevance and sustainability. A three-phased approach with community-based participation was developed that can be used by other programs. NIFA  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acognition 3ahealth services 3ahuman development 3amedical facilities 3anutrition education 3anutritionists 3aobesity 3aoutreach 3apublic health 3arisk 3ateachers 3atelemedicine 3aCalifornia1 aOntai, Lenna1 aStyne, Dennis1 aShively, Vicki1 aEspinoza, Dorina1 aPressman, Jona1 aRodriguez, Sonia1 aDiaz Rios, Karina0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2022 July, v. 54, no. 7 p.S75-S75dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2022.04.1613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013500168300001100303520182800314592002802142650002402170650002202194650002402216650002002240650001602260650002402276650001202300650004102312650001002353650001202363650001002375650001202385650002702397650001902424650001002443650001002453650002302463700002302486700002002509700002302529700002302552773010602575856008102681852000902762655001202771IND60518190820221118004517.0160614e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051819082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-016-1361-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreene, Lydia K.10aReproductive endocrine patterns and volatile urinary compounds of Arctictis binturong: discovering why bearcats smell like popcorn  ap. 37.  aMembers of the order Carnivora rely on urinary scent signaling, particularly for communicating about reproductive parameters. Here, we describe reproductive endocrine patterns in relation to urinary olfactory cues in a vulnerable and relatively unknown viverrid—the binturong (Arctictis binturong). Female binturongs are larger than and dominate males, and both sexes engage in glandular and urinary scent marking. Using a large (n = 33), captive population, we collected serum samples to measure circulating sex steroids via enzyme immunoassay and urine samples to assay volatile chemicals via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Male binturongs had expectedly greater androgen concentrations than did females but, more unusually, had equal estrogen concentrations, which may be linked to male deference. Males also expressed a significantly richer array of volatile chemical compounds than did females. A subset of these volatile chemicals resisted decay at ambient temperatures, potentially indicating their importance as long-lasting semiochemicals. Among these compounds was 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP), which is typically produced at high temperatures by the Maillard reaction and is likely to be responsible for the binturong’s characteristic popcorn aroma. 2-AP, the only compound expressed by all of the subjects, was found in greater abundance in males than females and was significantly and positively related to circulating androstenedione concentrations in both sexes. This unusual compound may have a more significant role in mammalian semiochemistry than previously appreciated. Based on these novel data, we suggest that hormonal action and potentially complex chemical reactions mediate communication of the binturong’s signature scent and convey information about sex and reproductive state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctictis binturong 3aMaillard reaction 3aambient temperature 3aandrostenedione 3ablood serum 3aenzyme immunoassays 3afemales 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amales 3amammals 3aodors 3apopcorn 3ascent marking behavior 3asemiochemicals 3asmell 3aurine 3avolatile compounds1 aWallen, Timothy W.1 aMoresco, Anneke1 aGoodwin, Thomas E.1 aDrea, Christine M.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2016 June, v. 103, no. 5-6 p.37-37dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-016-1361-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012500165520119300290592002801483650002301511650005201534650001301586650001001599650001701609650002401626650001501650650001401665650001301679700002001692700002301712700002201735700002201757700002301779773012301802856008201925852000902007655001202016IND60784162720221123003621.0220726e20220720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078416272DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110708152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAno, Satoshi 12aA Ruptured Left Gastric Artery Aneurysm That Neoplasticized during the Course of Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Case Report  aCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 and is known to cause respiratory and systemic symptoms. A SARS-CoV-2 infection is involved in aneurysm formation, enlargement, and rupture in medium-sized vessels, such as the cerebral and coronary arteries and the aorta. In contrast, its involvement in forming aneurysms in medium-sized vessels other than the cerebral and coronary arteries has not been reported. An 84-year-old Japanese man with COVID-19 was admitted to our hospital. The treatment course was favorable, and the COVID-19 treatment was completed by the 10th day. On day 14, pancreatic enzymes increased mildly. An abdominal computed tomography revealed a ruptured left gastric aneurysm after spontaneous hemostasis. Arterial embolization was performed. In this patient, a new left gastric aneurysm was suspected of having formed and ruptured during the course of the COVID-19 treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of abdominal visceral aneurysm formation caused by COVID-19 in a medium-sized vessel, and it is necessary to remember that aneurysms can be formed at any site when treating this syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aaneurysm 3aaorta 3acase studies 3acomputed tomography 3ahemostasis 3ahospitals 3apatients1 aShinkura, Yuto 1 aKenzaka, Tsuneaki 1 aKusunoki, Naoaki 1 aKawasaki, Satoru 1 aNishisaki, Hogara 0 tPathogens.g2022 July 20, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110708153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03669naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100007400155245012700229520209600356592002802452650002102480650002202501650002102523650001502544650001702559650001302576650001802589650002002607650001702627650001602644653002602660653001902686653001902705653002002724653002202744700005902766700001902825700002902844700007002873700005902943700002103002773009003023856008903113852000903202655001203211IND60767086520221116224418.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076708652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahim, Siti Aqilah Nadhirah Md1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2514-228910aActivated carbon-based electrodes for two-steps catalytic/ electrocatalytic reduction of glycerol in Amberlyst-15 mediator  aRedox mediators supply an effective way to promote electrons (and protons) transport between the electrode and substrate without being in direct physical contact with the electrode. Here, the carbon-based electrodes with Amberlyst-15 as the redox mediator were used in the electrocatalytic reduction to investigate their ability to indirectly convert glycerol into 1,2-propanediol. The process aims to study the influence of different activated carbon compositions (60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% of total weight) in the activated carbon composite (ACC) electrodes on the electrochemical properties, reaction mechanisms, and selectivity of the yielded products. Their electrochemical behavior and physicochemical properties were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA), followed by FESEM-EDX for the selected ACC electrode. Electroactive surface area (EASA) plays a role in glycerol mass transport and electrons transfer. EASA of 60ACC, 70ACC, 80ACC, and 90ACC (geometrical surface area of 0.50 cm²) were 19.62, 24.50, 36.74 and 30.83 cm², respectively. With the highest EASA, 80ACC enhanced the mass transport and electrons transfer process that eventually improved its electrocatalytic activity. It outperformed other ACC electrodes by generating Amberlyst-15 radicals (A-15•⁻) with high current density at low potential (−0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl). A-15•⁻ served as the electron-donor for the homogeneous redox reaction with glycerol in delivering highly reactive glycerol radical for further intermediates development and generated 1,2-propanediol at −2.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (current density of −0.2018 A cm⁻²). High activated carbon content portrayed a dominant role in controlling EASA and favored consecutive acetol-1,2-propanediol production through the C–O bond breakage. From the galvanostatic electrolysis, 1,2-propanediol selectivity was higher on 80ACC (88.6%) compared to 60ACC (61.4%), 70ACC (70.4%) and 90ACC (72.5%). Diethylene glycol formation was found to be the side reaction but preferred low activated carbon percentage in 60ACC and 70ACC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3adiethylene glycol 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3aglycerol 3amass transfer 3aredox reactions 3asurface area 3avoltammetry 0aIndirect electrolysis 0aRedox mediator 0aHydroxyacetone 0a1,2-Propanediol 0aMechanism pathway1 aLee, Ching Shya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5358-90131 aAbnisa, Faisal1 aWan Daud, Wan Mohd Ashri1 aAroua, Mohamed Kheireddine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9388-54391 aCognet, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9646-25651 aPérès, Yolande0 tChemosphere.g2022 May, v. 295 p.133949-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04684naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006200141245017800203300001800381520196900399592002802368596009502396596008902491596006602580596012102646596006302767596004902830650001402879650001302893650002502906650001102931650002002942650002702962650002102989650001203010650001403022650002003036650002503056650003103081650001303112650001903125653001903144653002103163653001603184653004803200700005903248700002203307700002303329700002103352700002303373700002403396700003203420700005603452700006003508700005803568700005803626700001803684700002203702700005703724773014503781856007503926852000904001655001204010IND60672570320221117222205.0191016e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067257032DNAL7 a10.1093/ajcn/nqz0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunaratne, Anoja W1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6767-614X10aDocosahexaenoic acid supplementation of preterm infants and parent-reported symptoms of allergic disease at 7 years corrected age: follow-up of a randomized controlled trial  ap. 1600-1610.  aDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n–3) supplementation in the prenatal period is associated with a reduction in the incidence of some symptoms of allergic disease. Infants born preterm are at increased risk of allergic disease, but it is unknown if DHA supplementation reduces the risk of childhood allergies. The aim of this study was to determine if supplementation of infants born at <33 wk gestation with high-DHA compared with standard-DHA enteral feeds decreases the incidence and severity of parent-reported allergic disease symptoms at a corrected age (CA) of 7 y. This study was a follow-up of an Australian multicenter randomized controlled trial. Infants were given high-DHA (∼1% total fatty acids) or standard-DHA (∼0.3% total fatty acids) enteral feeds from 2–4 d of postnatal age until 40 wk postmenstrual age. Parent-reported incidence of respiratory allergic disease symptoms including wheeze and rhinitis at 7 y CA were the main outcomes. Other outcomes included the incidence of eczema symptoms; severity of any symptoms; and the incidence of wheeze, rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema from birth to 7 y CA. Data were available for 569 of 657 (87%) children originally randomized. Symptoms of wheeze or rhinitis at 7 y CA did not differ between high- and standard-DHA groups [wheeze: RR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.65; P = 0.66; rhinitis: RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.46; P = 0.59]. There was no difference in other allergic disease symptoms at 7 y CA or in the severity of symptoms.

An important aspect of the success of an anti-cancer drug is low hepatotoxicity, which will reduce, if not eliminate entirely the undesirable side effects of treatment. Previously we have shown that ribonuclease from Bacillus intermedius (binase) exhibits high antitumor and antimetastatic activity in tumor models of different histological origin. In this work we studied hepatotoxic action of binase using mouse tumor model of Lewis lung carcinoma. Binase at doses of 0.1–1 mg/kg which produced effective suppression of tumor growth and metastasis, showed positive effect on the liver of tumor-bearing mice expressed in a significant reduction in the volume of destructive changes in the liver parenchyma and return to the normal level of the liver regenerative potential impaired due to endogenous intoxication and tumor burden.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus intermedius 3aadverse effects 3aantineoplastic agents 3ahepatotoxicity 3aliver 3alung neoplasms 3ametastasis 3amice 3amodels 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3apoisoning 3aribonucleases 3atherapeutics 0aRNase 0aDestructive changes of the liver 0aMurine tumor model 0aRegeneration potential of the liver 0aCancer 0aLLC 0aRNase 0abinase1 aMironova, N.L.1 aPatutina, O.A.1 aMitkevich, V.A.1 aMarkov, O.V.1 aPetrushanko, I.Y.1 aBurnysheva, K.M.1 aZenkova, M.A.1 aMakarov, A.A.0 tBiochimie.g2014 June, v. 101 p.256-259dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2014.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006200155245013300217506011700350506007600467520171100543592002802254506003702282650001902319650002002338650001002358650001302368650001102381650000902392650002002401650001602421650001702437650001402454650001402468650000902482650002902491650001502520650001902535650001402554653001302568653001602581653001902597653003302616653001802649653001402667700005802681700002602739700005802765700002202823700005702845700005902902773009102961856009003052852000903142655001203151IND60767086620221207084013.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076708662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDriesen, Charlotte1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1442-287210aAccumulation and decontamination kinetics of PCBs and PCDD/Fs from grass silage and soil in a transgenerational cow-calf setting  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) are bioaccumulative pollutants that endanger bovine food safety. Bioaccumulation depends, among others, on the physiological dynamics of the cow's reproductive cycle. However, recent studies have focused only on near steady-state situations. Thus, the effects of animal physiology on PCB + PCDD/F transfer from grass silage and soil to cows' blood, adipose tissue, and milk and subsequently to suckling calves during gestation and lactation were investigated. In the exposed group, nine cows ate a grass silage/contaminated soil mixture (6.6 ± 0.8 μg iPCBs and 2.6 ± 0.4 ng dlPCB + PCDD/F TEQ kgDM⁻¹) for 109 days prepartum until 288 days in milk (DIM). Four of these cows underwent decontamination after DIM164, receiving the same clean grass silage as the four control cows during the experiment. Calves were fed the milk of their respective mothers. In the exposed group, transgenerational bioaccumulation occurred until DIM164, with calf blood and adipose tissue PCB + PCDD/F concentrations reaching levels twice as high as those in their respective mothers. Transfer rates from oral intake to milk ranged from 0.1 up to 42%, depending on pollutant congener, dietary treatment, and reproductive parity of the cow. Congener and parity also influenced the decontamination half-lives of milk. In decontaminated calves, declines in adipose tissue PCB + PCDD/F concentrations coincided with increases in body fat mass. Therefore, it is essential to know the physiological characteristics of cattle, exposure dose and duration, and physicochemical compound properties to perform reliable transfer assessments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipose tissue 3abioaccumulation 3ablood 3abody fat 3acalves 3acows 3adecontamination 3afood safety 3agrass silage 3ahalf life 3alactation 3amilk 3anutritional intervention 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3apregnancy 0aMilk fat 0aBlood serum 0aAdipose tissue 0aPersistent organic pollutant 0aTransfer rate 0aHalf-life1 aLerch, Sylvain1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0957-80121 aSiegenthaler, Raphael1 aSilacci, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7541-19611 aHess, Hans Dieter1 aNowack, Bernd1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5676-112X1 aZennegg, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2665-88660 tChemosphere.g2022 June, v. 296 p.133951-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005000167520098100217592002801198650001501226650003501241650002301276650001501299650001001314650001001324650002001334650001601354650001701370650001601387700002401403700002201427773012301449856008201572852000901654655001201663IND60784163020221122232329.0220726e20220721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078416302DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110708182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImbert, Fergan 10aSUMOylation and Viral Infections of the Brain  aThe small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) system regulates numerous biological processes, including protein localization, stability and/or activity, transcription, and DNA repair. SUMO also plays critical roles in innate immunity and antiviral defense by mediating interferon (IFN) synthesis and signaling, as well as the expression and function of IFN-stimulated gene products. Viruses including human immunodeficiency virus-1, Zika virus, herpesviruses, and coronaviruses have evolved to exploit the host SUMOylation system to counteract the antiviral activities of SUMO proteins and to modify their own proteins for viral persistence and pathogenesis. Understanding the exploitation of SUMO is necessary for the development of effective antiviral therapies. This review summarizes the interplay between viruses and the host SUMOylation system, with a special emphasis on viruses with neuro-invasive properties that have pathogenic consequences on the central nervous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3aZika virus 3abrain 3agenes 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferons 3apathogenesis 3asumoylation1 aLeavitt, Gabrielle 1 aLangford, Dianne 0 tPathogens.g2022 July 21, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110708183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04054naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245017400170520189100344592002802235650001902263650001102282650001902293650001902312650001302331650001502344650002502359653002502384653002202409653002302431653001202454653000902466653000802475653000802483653000802491653000802499653000702507653000802514653000802522653000802530653000802538653000802546653000702554653000802561653000802569653000702577653001102584653000902595653000902604653000902613653000702622653000802629653000902637653001202646653001302658653001002671653000802681653000902689653001002698653000802708653000902716653000702725653000802732653000802740653000802748653000702756653000902763653000802772653000802780653000702788653000802795653001002803653000702813700005402820700002702874700006002901700001402961773009002975856009003065852000903155655001203164IND60767086720221116224641.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076708672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Zhikun10aInsight into integration of photocatalytic and microbial wastewater treatment technologies for recalcitrant organic pollutants: From sequential to simultaneous reactions  aThe more and more stringent environmental standards for recalcitrant organic pollutants pushed forward the development of integration of photocatalytic and microbial wastewater treatment technologies. The past studies proposed mainly two typical integration ways: a) Independent sequence of photocatalysis and biodegradation (ISPB) conducting the sequential reactions; b) Intimate coupling of photocatalysis and biodegradation (ICPB) conducting the simultaneous reactions. Although ICPB has received more attraction recently due to its novelty, ISPB gives an edge in certain cases. The article reviews the state-of-the-art ISPB and ICPB studies to comprehensively compare the two systems. The strengths and weaknesses of ISPB and ICPB regarding the treatment efficiency, cost, toxicity endurance and flexibility are contradistinguished. The reactor set-ups, photocatalysts, microbial characteristics of ISPB and ICPB are summarized. The applications for different kinds of recalcitrant compounds are elaborated to give a holistic view of the removal efficiencies and transformation pathways by the two technologies. Currently, in-depth understandings about the interference among mixed pollutants, co-existing components and key parameters in realistic wastewater are urgently needed. The long-term and large-scale application cases of the integration technologies are still rare. Overall, we conclude that both ISPB and ICPB technologies are reaching maturity while challenges still exist for two systems especially regarding the reliability, economy and generalization for realistic wastewater treatment plants. Future research should not only manage to reduce the cost and energy consumption by upgrading reactors and developing novel catalysts, but also attach importance to the cocktail effects of wastewater during the sequential or simultaneous photocatalysis and biodegradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3aenergy 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aIndependent sequence 0aIntimate coupling 0aRemoval efficiency 0aReactor 0a4-CP 0aAMO 0aAOB 0aBOD 0aCAS 0aCB 0aCOD 0aCPR 0aCBT 0aDOC 0aDOM 0aDO 0aEPS 0aHRT 0ah+ 0a•HO2 0aIPBR 0aISPB 0aICPB 0aMF 0aMBR 0aMLSS 0aNH3–N 0a•O2− 0a•OH 0aPMR 0aPAHs 0aPCBBR 0aPHE 0aPhOH 0aUF 0aROS 0aSBR 0aSRT 0aSS 0aSMPs 0aTCP 0aTCL 0aTP 0aTYL 0aWWTPs 0aVB1 aXu, Yifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1739-060X1 aAkbari, Mohammad Zahir1 aLiang, Chuanzhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9529-49261 aPeng, Lai0 tChemosphere.g2022 May, v. 295 p.133952-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006400165300001200229520215800241592002802399650002302427650005002450650002302500650002202523650002302545650001102568650001702579650002402596650002202620650001202642650002602654650001002680651001402690700001902704700001802723700002102741773013402762856008302896852000902979655001202988IND60781919520221116175236.0220706e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078191952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2022.04.1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuller, Lisa10aP124 Nutrition Education Videos for SNAP-Ed and EFNEP Youth  ap. S77.  aEngaging 3rd-5th graders for nutrition education in both in-person and remote settings Social Ecological Model Youth grades 3-5 from limited-resource families who are eligible for SNAP-Ed or EFNEP. The Tennessee Nutrition and Consumer Education Program (UT SNAP-Ed: TNCEP) and Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) offers nutrition education classes to youth, which are often delivered in schools during class time. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many elementary schools began delivering education online resulting in barriers for TNCEP and EFNEP educators to reach youth. During listening sessions, county educators identified the need for youth videos to complement existing nutrition curricula in conjunction with a remote class or to be shown separately by teachers to reinforce nutrition messages taught by nutrition educators. Topic needs identified included increasing fruit and vegetable intake, reducing sugar intake, increasing physical activity and proper handwashing. TNCEP and ENFEP contracted a production company to create four videos. The state team worked with the company to create videos to be educational, engaging and appropriate for youth. Online surveys were conducted with county educators to determine usage, reach, appropriateness and acceptability by youth. The survey yielded 22 responses. Educators reported disseminating videos through remote classrooms, in-person classrooms, providing to teachers to show in class and sharing via social media. Of those who responded, 60% indicated the videos were very useful and 71% indicated the videos were very well received by youth. Educators reported reaching over 8,000 students with videos utilizing the methods above.

Improved crops that acquire and use P more efficiently are a sustainable solution to increase crop yield in these systems. This study determined the contribution of P acquisition efficiency (PAE) and P utilization efficiency (PUTE) in determining P use efficiency (PUE) of 20 maize accessions from the Purhepecha Plateau, Michoacan, grown on a P-deficient Andisol, at two locations with low (23kgP2O5ha−1) and high (97kgP2O5ha−1) P fertilization under rain-fed conditions. Under P deficiency conditions in the acid soil, both PAE and PUTE were important factors explaining the variation in P use efficiency at both P levels. Greater P use efficiency was related to an improved distribution of dry matter in the plants and a lower absorbed P allocated in the grain. Low grain P concentrations at maturity were not associated with reductions in grain yield, nor were they significantly correlated to HI, suggesting that exploiting genotypic variation for this trait may be productive. The study identified genetic variation among maize landraces in their response of PUTE. On a P-deficient acidic soil, accessions CB-2, DP×Tromba, HV313×DEM, Macho III-04, and CIMMYT-1, were categorized as the most P efficient and the most responsive to increased P availability. In contrast, late maturing P-efficient accessions SHUI-2, CB-2, AS-4, and ZR-6 showed the greatest variation for P uptake under low P conditions. Late maturity improved growth and yield in low P soils. These accessions expressed the desired traits for PUE, which may be exploited in breeding efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndisols 3aacid soils 3abreeding 3acorn 3acrops 3adry matter partitioning 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3ahighlands 3alandraces 3aphosphorus 3aplateaus 3aproduction technology 0aZea mays L. 0aAcid soil 0aP acquisition efficiency 0aP utilization efficiency1 aOchoa-Cadavid, Iván0 tField crops research.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 156 p.123-134dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2013.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013100171300001800302520134600320592002801666650002901694650001701723650001501740650004301755650001001798651001001808651001201818700001801830700002001848700001901868773009601887856008101983852000902064655001202073IND60120736620221118011414.0150210e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012073662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-013-2518-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherübl, Rosmarie10aComparison of HPLC Versus HPTLC-Densitometry for the Quantification of Chromone Glucosides in Saposhnikoviae divaricatae Radix  ap. 1537-1543.  aA HPLC and a HPTLC-densitometric method were developed for the quantification of prim-O-glucosylcimifugin and 4′-O-β-D-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol the major chromone glucosides in the roots of Saposhnikovia divaricata. The validation of both methods resulted in comparable parameters regarding stability, specificity, linearity, robustness, precision and recovery, whereas complementary advantages were obtained concerning LOD and LOQ. The HPTLC-based densitometry revealed a lower LOD (1.11 versus 4.37 μg mL⁻¹in HPLC) and LOQ (3.36 versus 13.24 μg mL⁻¹in HPLC) for prim-O-glucosylcimifugin, whereas the HPLC resulted in a lower LOD (1.00 versus 4.10 μg mL⁻¹in HPTLC-densitometry) and LOQ (3.04 versus 12.46 μg mL⁻¹in HPTLC-densitometry) for 4′-O-β-D-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol. Both methods revealed nearly matching contents of the chromones after analysis of different commercially available batches of Saposhnikoviae divaricatae radix with a total content for both chromone glycosides in the range from 0.31 ± 0.011 to 0.56 ± 0.021 % determined by HPLC and between 0.34 ± 0.011 and 0.61 ± 0.009 % determined by HPTLC. The plant material cultivated in Germany showed a very similar content and ratio of both chromone glucosides in comparison to the standard batches originating from China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaposhnikovia divaricata 3adensitometry 3aglucosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aroots 3aChina 3aGermany1 aManns, Detlef1 aHeilmann, Jörg1 aFranz, Gerhard0 tChromatographia.g2013 Nov., v. 76, no. 21-22 p.1537-1543dSpringer-Verlagx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-013-2518-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245009700164520156400261592002801825650002101853650001601874650001101890650001701901650001301918650001701931650003001948650001201978650001401990650001402004650002402018650001502042650001402057651001502071700002302086700001902109700002402128773011902152856007302271961001202344852000902356655001202365IND60648999820221122041337.0190702e20190525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064899982DNAL7 a10.3390/f100504552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlaton, Michèle  R.10aWhitebark Pine Recruitment in Sierra Nevada Driven by Range Position and Disturbance History  aEffective restoration of whitebark pine populations will require a solid understanding of factors affecting seedling recruitment success, which may vary by site and biogeographic region. We examined the relationship between whitebark pine seedling recruitment, disturbance history, and range position in three independent studies in the southern Sierra Nevada, California (CA), USA. In 66 plots broadly distributed across watersheds, we found that whitebark pine seedling density and proportion were greatest at upper elevations, and where canopy cover of whitebark pine was higher (density ranged 0&ndash;383 seedlings/ha; x &macr; = 4, &sigma;<inf>X</inf> = 1). Seedling density and proportion were also greater in plots that had recently experienced loss of canopy cover from insects, avalanche, windthrow, or other disturbance effects. In a second study conducted in popular recreational areas, including campgrounds and trailheads, the response of whitebark pine recruitment to disturbance was strongly dependent on the relative position of stands within the range, or proximity to other forest types. Both studies indicated that low to moderate levels of disturbance enhanced whitebark pine recruitment, especially at its range edge, a finding consistent with the early seral status of whitebark observed in previous studies conducted elsewhere in North America. In our third study, a case study at the June Mt. Ski Area, we demonstrate the potential for a downward shift in the whitebark-lodgepole pine ecotone as a result of insect-caused disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus albicaulis 3acampgrounds 3acanopy 3acase studies 3aecotones 3aforest types 3ageographical distribution 3ainsects 3amountains 3aseedlings 3aspecies recruitment 3awatersheds 3awindthrow 3aCalifornia1 aMacKenzie, Martin 1 aKohler, Tanya 1 aRamirez, Carlos  M.0 tForests.g2019 May 25, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100504553Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015800155300001600313520140600329592002801735650003401763650002201797650001501819650001501834650001401849650001901863650002201882650001501904650002101919650001301940700002001953700001201973700001701985700001802002700001202020700002502032700002002057700001202077700001702089700001702106700001402123700002402137700002402161700001402185700001902199700002302218700001402241700001602255700001502271773013802286856007402424852000902498655001202507IND60680099920221120043654.0200104e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068009992DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta09750c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tianyi10aIn situ and operando investigation of the dynamic morphological and phase changes of a selenium-doped germanium electrode during (de)lithiation processes  ap. 750-759.  aTo understand the effect of selenium doping on the good cycling performance and rate capability of a Ge₀.₉Se₀.₁ electrode, the dynamic morphological and phase changes of the Ge₀.₉Se₀.₁ electrode were investigated by synchrotron-based operando transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) imaging, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The TXM results show that the Ge₀.₉Se₀.₁ particle retains its original shape after a large volume change induced by (de)lithiation and undergoes a more sudden morphological and optical density change than pure Ge. The difference between Ge₀.₉Se₀.₁ and Ge is attributed to a super-ionically conductive Li–Se–Ge network formed inside Ge₀.₉Se₀.₁ particles, which contributes to fast Li-ion pathways into the particle and nano-structuring of Ge as well as buffering the volume change of Ge. The XRD and XAS results confirm the formation of a Li–Se–Ge network and reveal that the Li–Se–Ge phase forms during the early stages of lithiation and is an inactive phase. The Li–Se–Ge network also can suppress the formation of the crystalline Li₁₅Ge₄ phase. These in situ and operando results reveal the effect of the in situ formed, super-ionically conductive, and inactive network on the cycling performance of Li-ion batteries and shed light on the design of high capacity electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorbance 3aelectrodes 3agermanium 3aimage analysis 3alithium batteries 3amicroscopy 3aphase transition 3aselenium1 aLim, Cheolwoong1 aCui, Yi1 aZhou, Xinwei1 aKang, Huixiao1 aYan, Bo1 aMeyerson, Melissa L.1 aWeeks, Jason A.1 aLiu, Qi1 aGuo, Fangmin1 aKou, Ronghui1 aLiu, Yuzi1 aDe Andrade, Vincent1 aDe Carlo, Francesco1 aRen, Yang1 aSun, Cheng-Jun1 aMullins, C.

Despite difficulties, greenhouse cultivation allows ripening long before that in the open field. Nonetheless, for harvesting “Flame Seedless” in the most profitable periods, a cultural practices timetable has to be established. In this context, an estimation of development rate as a function of temperature becomes essential. This work puts forward a procedure to determine “Flame Seedless” threshold temperatures and heat requirements from bud break to ripening. “Flame Seedless” required an average of 1633 growing degree days (GDD) in the open field with a base temperature of 5 °C and an upper threshold temperature of 30 °C. Strikingly, only 1542 GDD were required within the greenhouse. This procedure forecast “Flame Seedless” ripening with an accuracy of three and six days in the open field and greenhouse, improving predictions based on the average number of days between bud break and ripening. The procedure to predict oncoming harvest date was found satisfactory, just four days earlier than the real date. If we used the typical meteorological year instead of the average year, then the prediction was greatly improved since harvest was forecast just one day before its occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aair temperature 3abudbreak 3achilling requirement 3agreenhouse production 3aharvest date 3aheat sums 3aplant cultural practices 3aprediction 3aripening 3atable grapes1 aChiamolera, Fernando  M.1 aHueso, Juan  J.1 aGonzález, Mónica,1 aCuevas, Julián 0 tPlants.g2021 Apr. 30, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100509043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012500168300001600293520154800309592002801857650001901885650001201904650001601916650002201932650002601954650001401980650000901994650001602003650001902019650002202038650000902060650002202069650001602091653000902107653001402116653000902130653001902139653001402158653001902172700001402191700001602205700001702221773010802238856008202346852000902428655001202437IND60533479720221118123409.0190403e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053347972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2013.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Oort, P.A.J.12aA simple model for simulating heat induced sterility in rice as a function of flowering time and transpirational cooling  ap. 303-312.  aRice spikelets become sterile when exposed to high temperatures during flowering. Recent experimental studies have shown that transpirational cooling and flowering time (within the day) are important factors determining sterility. Extrapolation of the results from these experimental studies to other environments requires an integrated approach through incorporating such effects on spikelet fertility in a crop growth model. Here we review existing fertility functions (fertility as a function of panicle temperature) in different studies, and propose a simple new model that incorporates insights on diurnal patterns of temperature and relative humidity, recent studies on the relation between panicle temperature and sterility, and studies on how flowering time depends on environmental conditions. We illustrate the model for a typical arid and typical humid climate. There was a large difference between the existing fertility functions, and simulated fertility was very sensitive to differences in fertility functions, causing differences in simulated fertility of up to 59%. Ignoring transpirational cooling led to overestimation of sterility of 14–73%. Shifting flowering times from 12:00 to 9:00 led to a 7–35% reduction in sterility. Within day flowering duration had only a marginal impact (max 2%). We conclude that any climate change impact simulation is highly dependent on the choice of the fertility function, and identification of causes of differences between reported fertility functions deserves further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acooling 3acrop models 3adiurnal variation 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3aheat 3ahumid zones 3ainflorescences 3arelative humidity 3arice 3asimulation models 3atemperature 0aRice 0aSterility 0aHeat 0aClimate change 0aFlowering 0aCrop modelling1 aSaito, K.1 aZwart, S.J.1 aShrestha, S.0 tField crops research.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 156 p.303-312dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2013.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013400170300001800304520125900322592002801581596010201609650002101711650002401732650001201756650001901768650001701787650000901804650001801813650001301831650000701844650003301851650001501884650001801899650002001917650002901937650000901966700001701975773013401992856008102126852000902207655001202216IND60620759420221120125906.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062075942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-018-9849-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShilpashree, B.

In the present investigation whey protein concentrate (a major commercial source for WP) was selected to evaluate its extent of iron/zinc (mineral) binding ability up on succinylation using ultrafiltration technique. The obtained protein–mineral complexes were also characterized for their physicochemical properties. Maximum mineral binding ability of succinylated WP (SWP) was observed at 5.6 and 5.0 mM for iron and zinc concentration, respectively. Most of the succinic acid was removed from the SWP–mineral complexes during diafiltration, which was also confirmed from the micrographs of scanning electron microscopy. Physicochemical characteristics such as chromatographic behaviour and fluorescence intensity confirmed the structural modification of SWP. SWP-mineral complexes showed improved solubility at 6–10 pH values and less solubility at ≤ 4 pH values.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject No: SERB/MOFPI/0040/2013cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology 3abinding capacity 3abioactive compounds 3acations 3achromatography 3afluorescence 3airon 3amilk proteins 3aminerals 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3asuccinic acid 3aultrafiltration 3awhey protein concentrate 3azinc1 aArora, Sumit0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2018 Dec., v. 12, no. 4 p.2324-2338dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-018-9849-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001500191245007700206300001400283506007600297520129700373592002801670506003701698650000801735650002701743650001701770650002301787650003001810650001701840650002401857650000901881650001501890653001401905653001701919653002201936653000801958653002101966700002101987700002502008700002202033700002202055700002502077773007402102856008402176852000902260655001202269IND60552205020221207130549.0161020e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055220502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2014.02.0112doi7 aPMC40471712pmcid7 a245828332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Gaofei10aBinding studies of a large antiviral polyamide to a natural HPV sequence  ap. 83-91.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPA1 is a large hairpin polyamide (dImPyPy-β-PyPyPy-γ-PyPy-β-PyPyPyPy-β-Ta; Py = pyrrole, Im = imidazole, β = beta alanine) that targets the sequence 5′-WWGWWWWWWW-3′ (W = A or T) and is effective in eliminating HPV16 in cell culture (Edwards, T. G., Koeller, K. J., Slomczynska, U., Fok, K., Helmus, M., Bashkin, J. K., Fisher, C., Antiviral Res. 91 (2011) 177–186). Described here are its DNA binding properties toward a natural DNA, a 523 bp portion of HPV16 (2150–2672) containing three predicted perfect match sites. Strategies for obtaining binding data on large fragments using capillary electrophoresis are also described. Using an Fe EDTA conjugate of PA1, 19 affinity cleavage (AC) patterns were detected for this fragment. In many cases, there are multiple possible binding sequences (perfect, single and double mismatch sites) consistent with the AC data. Quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis indicates that perfect and most single mismatch sites bind PA1 with Kds between 0.7 and 4 nM, indicating excellent tolerance for the latter. Double mismatch sites exhibit Kds between 12 and 62 nM. A large fraction of the accessible sequence is susceptible to PA1 binding, much larger than predicted based on the literature of polyamide-DNA recognition rules.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3abeta-alanine 3abinding properties 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acell culture 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3airon 3apolyamides 0aPolyamide 0aFootprinting 0aAffinity cleavage 0aHPV 0aBinding constant1 aVasilieva, Elena1 aHarris, George Davis1 aKoeller, Kevin J.1 aBashkin, James K.1 aDupureur, Cynthia M.0 tBiochimie.g2014 July, v. 102 p.83-91dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2014.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245006100177300001600238520104800254592002801302650001801330650001901348650002201367650001801389650001501407650001901422650001001441650002201451650002001473650001701493650001501510650001401525650001701539650002201556653001901578653003301597653000901630653001701639653002301656700002301679700002601702700007301728700002401801700006201825773011501887856008502002852000902087655001202096IND60550763720221120134620.0190412e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055076372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2016.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Amanda P.14aThe role of CCR5 in Chagas disease - a systematic review  ap. 132-137.  aChagas disease is an infection caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. The clinical manifestations result from the chronic forms of the disease: indeterminate, cardiac, digestive or mixed. The pathogenesis of this disease is related to the genetic variability of both the parasite and the host with polymorphisms of genes involved in immune response possibly being involved in the variable clinical course. Cytokines play a key role in regulating immune response, in particular chemokines exert a crucial role in the control of leukocyte migration during the host's response to infectious processes. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been implicated in the generation of inflammatory infiltrates and tissue damage. The involvement of the CC Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5) in leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation has been elucidated and this receptor has been investigated in Chagas disease. Here we review the role of CCR5 in T. cruzi infection as well as its importance in the pathogenesis of the Chagas disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCCR5 receptor 3aChagas disease 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3acell movement 3achemokines 3adisease course 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3asystematic review 0aChagas disease 0aChronic Chagas heart disease 0aCCR5 0aPolymorphism 0aChemokine receptor1 aAyo, Christiane M.1 aBestetti, Reinaldo B.1 aBrandão de Mattos, Cinara C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4836-31131 aCavasini, Carlos E.1 ade Mattos, Luiz C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8572-81770 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 Nov., v. 45 p.132-137dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245019200163300001800355520180700373592002802180596007002208650001802278650002502296650001702321650001702338650001402355650001502369650002102384650002602405650002002431650003102451650001102482650001102493650001802504650001502522650001102537650002302548650001502571650002102586651001002607651002102617700002002638700006402658700002102722700002202743700001902765773013402784856008102918852000902999655001203008IND60620759620221120130013.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062075962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-018-9892-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCan, Aygül14aThe potential of near and mid-infrared spectroscopy for rapid quantification of oleuropein, total phenolics, total flavonoids and antioxidant activity in olive tree (Olea europaea) leaves  ap. 2747-2757.  aNatural foods and food-related antioxidants such as phenolic phytochemicals are of great interest due to their preventive properties against oxidative damage. Olive tree leaves contain high quality and amount of phenolic compounds including oleuropein and therefore considered as nutraceutically valuable materials. The composition of olive leaves, its phenolics and antioxidant power are influenced by numerous factors causing great variation among samples. Additionally, traditional analytical methods performed to quantify these parameters in each product entail long and complicated sample preparation procedures, the use of toxic chemicals, skilled labors, instrumentation and sophisticated laboratory conditions. One appealing alternative is the use of infrared spectroscopy since it gives information about the food composition quickly and it is a multi-parametric and environmentally friendly choice. Therefore, we investigated the oleuropein, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and antioxidant activity levels of 23 common cultivars of olive leaves harvested from Turkey and Italy using traditional reference methods and also developed near and mid-infrared based partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to predict these parameters without the need of sample preparation. Internal validations of the PLSR calibration models were done using full cross-validation and yielded very high correlation coefficients (≥ 0.95) and low errors in predictions (% standard error of cross-validation for parameters were lower than 7.54%). The levels of all the parameters of interest could be successfully predicted using both NIR and MIR instrumentation within seconds. Overall, infrared spectroscopy along with chemometrics exhibited great potential for future olive leave studies.  aPublisher supplied data  aBAP Project # FLY-2016-958cÇanakkale Onsekiz Mart Üniversitesi 3aOlea europaea 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achemometrics 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3afood composition 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ainstrumentation 3alaboratory experimentation 3aleaves 3amodels 3anatural foods 3aoleuropein 3aolives 3aphenolic compounds 3aprediction 3atoxic substances 3aItaly 3aTurkey (country)1 aAyvaz, Hüseyin1 aPala, Çiğdem Uysal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1784-91341 aCondelli, Nicola1 aGalgano, Fernanda1 aTolve, Roberta0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2018 Dec., v. 12, no. 4 p.2747-2757dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-018-9892-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013600169300001500305520166000320592002801980650001502008650002102023650003502044650002802079650002602107650001002133650001202143650001002155650001302165650001302178651000902191653002002200653001402220653001402234653002302248653001602271653002002287700001802307700002002325700002902345700002002374700002702394700002002421700002302441700001902464700002202483700001802505700002002523700002302543773007502566856008402641852000902725655001202734IND60552205220221118003336.0161020e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055220522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2014.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShadrina, Olga10aConsensus HIV-1 subtype A integrase and its raltegravir-resistant variants: Design and characterization of the enzymatic properties  ap. 92-101.  aModel studies of the subtype B and non-subtype B integrases are still required to compare their susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs, evaluate the significance of resistance mutations and identify the impact of natural polymorphisms on the level of enzymatic reactivity. We have therefore designed the consensus integrase of the HIV-1 subtype A strain circulating in the former Soviet Union territory (FSU-A) and two of its variants with mutations of resistance to the strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir. Their genes were synthesized, and expressed in E coli; corresponding His-tagged proteins were purified using the affinity chromatography. The enzymatic properties of the consensus integrases and their sensitivity to raltegravir were examined in a series of standard in vitro reactions and compared to the properties of the integrase of HIV-1 subtype B strain HXB2. The consensus enzyme demonstrated similar DNA-binding properties, but was significantly more active than HXB-2 integrase in the reactions of DNA cleavage and integration. All integrases were equally susceptible to inhibition by raltegravir and elvitegravir, indicating that the sporadic polymorphisms inherent to the HXB-2 enzyme have little effect on its susceptibility to drugs. Insensitivity of the mutated enzymes to the inhibitors of strand transfer occurred at a cost of a 30–90% loss of the efficacies of both 3′-processing and strand transfer. This is the first study to describe the enzymatic properties of the consensus integrase of HIV-1 clade A and the effects of the resistance mutations when the complex actions of sporadic sequence polymorphisms are excluded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aEscherichia coli 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aaffinity chromatography 3aantiretroviral agents 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3agenes 3amutation 3aproteins 3aUSSR 0aHIV-1 integrase 0aSubtype A 0aConsensus 0aCatalytic activity 0aRaltegravir 0aDrug resistance1 aKrotova, Olga1 aAgapkina, Julia1 aKnyazhanskaya, Ekaterina1 aKorolev, Sergey1 aStarodubova, Elizaveta1 aViklund, Alecia1 aLukashov, Vladimir1 aMagnani, Mauro1 aMedstrand, Patrik1 aKarpov, Vadim1 aGottikh, Marina1 aIsaguliants, Maria0 tBiochimie.g2014 July, v. 102 p.92-101dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2014.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013000167300001800297520121000315592002801525596005401553650003401607650001401641650002501655650001701680650001101697650002701708650001801735650001501753650004101768650001801809650001301827650001501840650001401855650001401869650001601883650001801899651001301917651001101930651001201941651000901953700006601962700003302028700002802061700003002089773013402119856008102253852000902334655001202343IND60620759720221120125957.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062075972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-018-9898-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViafara, Derwin10aChemical characterisation and antioxidant activity of Aphandra natalia mesocarp and its oil from the Amazon region of Ecuador  ap. 2835-2843.  aThe Aphandra natalia palm is a species of monotypic genus Aphandra belonging to the Arecaceae family and is native to South America, mainly in the western part of the Amazon basin in Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil. In this study, we determined the physicochemical characteristics of A. natalia fruit mesocarp, as well as its fatty acid composition, the total polyphenol content (TPC), lipophilic antioxidant compounds and total antioxidant capacity. The fatty acids profile was determined using GC–MS analysis and TPC and antioxidant activity by Folin Ciocalteu’s reagent method and by radical scavenging activity (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical [DPPH]), respectively regarding their oil. A high value of 57.92% of total lipids was obtained, thus it can be considered as new source of vegetable oil. The oil extracted from A. natalia mesocarp had a high oleic acid content (71.92%), which is a characteristic closer to the composition of olive oil than traditional palm oil. TPC value (83.57 ± 1.84 mg GAE kg⁻¹ of oil) obtained from A. natalia fruit pulp oil is similar to some olive oil varieties. However, its oil presents smaller antioxidant activity than olive oils usually have.  aPublisher supplied data  aVET.JMA.17.05, 2017cUniversidad de Las Américas 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aArecaceae 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abasins 3afatty acid composition 3afree radicals 3afruit pulp 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3alipophilicity 3amesocarp 3aoleic acid 3aolive oil 3apalm oils 3apolyphenols 3avegetable oil 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 3aEcuador 3aPeru1 aAbreu-Naranjo, Reinier1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1048-71261 aAlvarez-Suarez, José Miguel1 aReyes-Mera, Jorge Julio1 aBarreno Ayala, Magdalena,0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2018 Dec., v. 12, no. 4 p.2835-2843dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-018-9898-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012100170300001800291500001100309520222900320592002802549650002002577650002002597650002002617650001902637650001802656650001102674650002302685650001502708650002602723650002702749650001202776650002202788650001102810650002702821650001502848650002602863650002302889650001502912700002502927773013402952856008103086852000903167655001203176IND60620759820221120125927.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062075982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-018-9893-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Satyam10aData processing approaches and strategies for non-destructive fruits quality inspection and authentication: a review  ap. 2758-2794.  aReview  aFruit quality inspection and authentication instruments are the essential requirement at the different stages of fruit processing industries from harvesting to market. In recent years, various intelligent analytical methods such as electronic nose, gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy, UV–Vis–NIR spectroscopy, machine vision, hyperspectral imaging and many more have been evolved to access the fruit quality at different stages such as maturity judgement of an on-tree fruit, shelf life measurement of harvested fruit, other quality parameters measurement of various fruit products at processing industries etc. Information extracted from various analytical methods needs to be processed using different data processing approaches and strategies, which plays the major role to bring the intelligence in the analytical instruments. Although, highly promising results have been reported to process data acquired from similar type of sensory panel (gas sensor array in electronic nose) and single sensing technique (impedance measurement) but still there are several challenges to process data acquired from multiple sensing techniques fusion (similar or complementary in nature) to predict better informative results. Recently, there is a growing interest in the direction of multiple sensing techniques fusion to extract better information from fruit samples in a reliable manner and also in less time. This paper presents an extensive review of classical and modern data processing approaches and strategies that have been used for single and multiple non-destructive sensing methods in the area of fruit quality inspection and authentication. Various approaches and strategies for preprocessing, data fusion, feature extraction, model design, multi-modal data processing, training, testing and validation for single and multiple sensing techniques have been briefly explained in the presented review. The presented review also discusses the need, scope, and challenges of data processing methods for multiple sensing techniques fusion. Different commercially available handheld and lab level analytical instruments also have been reviewed based on their intelligence, complexity and quality parameters prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer vision 3adata collection 3aelectronic nose 3afruit products 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agas chromatography 3aharvesting 3ahyperspectral imagery 3ainformation processing 3amarkets 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3anondestructive methods 3aprediction 3aprocessing technology 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life1 aSadistap, Shashikant0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2018 Dec., v. 12, no. 4 p.2758-2794dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-018-9893-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013900165300001600304520150600320592002801826650002201854650001201876650001201888650002001900650002301920650002101943650001101964650001501975650002001990650000902010650001702019650002802036651001102064653004802075653002202123653001702145653002102162653001702183653001302200700001502213700001602228700001402244700001402258700001402272700002102286700001702307700001702324773010802341856008202449852000902531655001202540IND60533480020221118053216.0190403e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053348002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2013.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSansoulet, J.10aComparing the performance of the STICS, DNDC, and DayCent models for predicting N uptake and biomass of spring wheat in Eastern Canada  ap. 135-150.  aModelling the production and N uptake of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) according to climate and N fertilization in Eastern Canada is important for estimating efficient N application rates and evaluating the sustainability of agricultural practices. The objective of this paper was to examine the response of observed yield, biomass, and plant N to fertilization rates and climate variations and to compare the performance of the STICS (Simulateur mulTIdisciplinaire pour des Cultures Standard), DNDC (DeNitrification and DeComposition), and DayCent (daily version of CENTURY) models for predicting these outcomes. The results indicate that when rainfall was near normal and the recommended N application rates were applied, the three models had good predictions, especially STICS and DNDC (average relative error<10%, root mean square error<24%). Under lower N rates, STICS and DayCent were less effective for predicting biomass, whereas for rainfall excess, DNDC and DayCent overestimated plant N. For simulating plant N, the STICS model was more sensitive to the quantity and timing of water available to the crop. The models showed that mild rainfall deficit or excess early in the season had a negative impact on estimates of biomass and plant N as well as on yield and protein content, and the impact of the N application rate tended to disappear. When rainfall was near normal and close to measured evapotranspiration, the effect of N rates on biomass and plant N was accurately predicted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiomass 3aclimate 3adenitrification 3aevapotranspiration 3afertilizer rates 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprotein content 3arain 3aspring wheat 3asustainable agriculture 3aCanada 0aRainfed spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) 0aClimate variation 0aWater stress 0aN dilution curve 0aWater budget 0aN budget1 aPattey, E.1 aKröbel, R.1 aGrant, B.1 aSmith, W.1 aJégo, G.1 aDesjardins, R.L.1 aTremblay, N.1 aTremblay, G.0 tField crops research.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 156 p.135-150dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2013.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245009600167520146400263592002801727650002801755650001901783650002501802650002401827650002201851650002301873650001001896650001901906650001001925650001801935650001901953650001001972651001201982700002601994700002502020700001802045700002802063773011902091856007302210852000902283655001202292IND60649000420221120131032.0190702e20190530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064900042DNAL7 a10.3390/f100604712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes Queiroz, Gustavo 10aMapping Coarse Woody Debris with Random Forest Classification of Centimetric Aerial Imagery  aCoarse woody debris (CWD; large parts of dead trees) is a vital element of forest ecosystems, playing an important role in nutrient cycling, carbon storage, fire fuel, microhabitats, and overall forest structure. However, there is a lack of effective tools for identifying and mapping both standing (snags) and downed (logs) CWD in complex natural settings. We applied a random forest machine learning classifier to detect CWD in centimetric aerial imagery acquired over a 270-hectare study area in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. We used a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach in the classification with spectral, spatial, and LiDAR (light detection and ranging)-derived height predictor variables. We found CWD to be detected with great accuracy (93.4 &plusmn; 4.2% completeness and 94.5 &plusmn; 3.2% correctness) when training samples were located within the application area, and with very good accuracy (84.2 &plusmn; 5.2% completeness and 92.2 &plusmn; 3.2% correctness) when training samples were located outside the application area. The addition of LiDAR-derived variables did not increase the accuracy of CWD detection overall (<2%), but aided significantly (p < 0.001) in the distinction between logs and snags. Foresters and researchers interested in CWD can take advantage of these novel methods to produce accurate maps of logs and snags, which will contribute to the understanding and management of forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aboreal forests 3acarbon sequestration 3acoarse woody debris 3aforest ecosystems 3aforestry equipment 3afuels 3aimage analysis 3alidar 3amicrohabitats 3aremote sensing 3asnags 3aAlberta1 aMcDermid, Gregory  J.1 aCastilla, Guillermo 1 aLinke, Julia 1 aRahman, Mir  Mustafizur0 tForests.g2019 May 30, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100604713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005800166300001800224520100200242592002801244650001401272650001501286650004301301650001401344650000701358700002301365700001801388700001401406700002401420773009601444856008101540852000901621655001201630IND60120737320221118011434.0150210e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012073732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-013-2440-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanchaert, B.10aAssay of Kanamycin A by HPLC with Direct UV Detection  ap. 1505-1512.  aThe development of a simple reversed phase ion pair liquid chromatographic method for the assay of kanamycin A has been described. Because of the lack of a UV chromophore in the structure of kanamycin A, borate complexation was used to allow direct UV detection at 205 nm. Three columns were evaluated in this study: Zorbax Extend C18 (4.6 mm × 250 mm; 5 μm), XBridge C18 (4.6 mm × 250 mm; 5 μm) and apHera C18 (4.6 mm × 250 mm; 5 μm). The mobile phase was a mixture of 0.1 M disodium tetraborate (pH 9.0) and water (20:80, v/v) supplemented with 0.5 g L⁻¹sodium octanesulphonate. Final chromatographic conditions were achieved on the XBridge column at 50 °C. The method was validated according to ICH guidelines and applied to a commercially available sample. It is much faster and more specific than the current microbiological assay prescribed in the European Pharmacopoeia. No expensive equipment is necessary to perform this assay making it a viable replacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3aguidelines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akanamycin 3apH1 aPoderós Jorge, E.1 aJankovics, P.1 aAdams, E.1 aSchepdael, Ann Van,0 tChromatographia.g2013 Nov., v. 76, no. 21-22 p.1505-1512dSpringer-Verlagx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-013-2440-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016400166300001800330520131900348592002801667650002401695650001801719650001701737650002201754650001801776650001701794650001001811650001601821650001201837650003401849650001601883650000701899650002301906650002001929650001601949700001801965700002001983700001802003700002002021700001602041700002002057773012602077856008102203852000902284655001202293IND60518192120221118004504.0160408e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051819212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-7235-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhen-Yuan10aInfluence of fermentation conditions on polysaccharide production and the activities of enzymes involved in the polysaccharide synthesis of Cordyceps militaris  ap. 3909-3921.  aThe influence of different fermentation conditions on intracellular polysaccharide (IPS) production and activities of the phosphoglucomutase (PGM), UDPG-pyrophosphorylase (UGP), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), UDPG-dehydrogenase (UGD), and glucokinase (GK) implicated in metabolite synthesis in Cordyceps militaris was evaluated. The highest IPS production (327.57 ± 6.27 mg/100 mL) was obtained when the strain was grown in the optimal medium containing glucose (40 g · L⁻¹), beef extract (10 g · L⁻¹), and CaCO₃ (0.5 g · L⁻¹), and the initial pH and temperature were 7 and 25 °C, respectively. The activities of PGM, UGP, and PGI were proved to be influenced by the fermentation conditions. A strong correlation between the activities of these enzymes and the production of IPS was found. The transcription level of the pgm gene (encoding PGM) was 1.049 times and 1.467 times compared to the ugp gene and pgi gene (encoding UGP and PGI), respectively, in the optimal culture medium. This result indicated that PGM might be the highly key enzyme to regulate the biosynthesis of IPS of C. militaris in a liquid-submerged culture. Our study might be helpful for further research on the pathway of polysaccharide biosynthesis aimed to improve the IPS production of C. militaris.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps militaris 3abeef extracts 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium carbonate 3aculture media 3afermentation 3agenes 3aglucokinase 3aglucose 3aglucose-6-phosphate isomerase 3ametabolites 3apH 3aphosphoglucomutase 3apolysaccharides 3atemperature1 aLiu, Xiao-Cui1 aDong, Feng-Ying1 aGuo, Ming-Zhu1 aWang, Xiao-Ting1 aWang, Zheng1 aZhang, Yong-Min0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 May, v. 100, no. 9 p.3909-3921dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7235-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04376naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100001900182245013100201300001800332506007600350520210700426592002802533596003702561506003702598650001502635650001802650650001902668650003102687650001902718650002302737650001202760650002802772650001202800650002302812650002202835650001502857650001202872650000802884650001502892650002402907650001102931650001002942653003702952653001602989653001203005653000903017653002303026700001803049700005303067700005603120700001703176700001503193700002003208700001703228700001903245700005903264700002903323700002303352700001703375700001603392700001703408773014503425856007503570852000903645655001203654IND60672571320221207100635.0191016e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067257132DNAL7 a10.1093/ajcn/nqz0242doi7 aPMC69004942pmcid7 a310059732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, Shih-Lung10aEffects of branched-chain amino acids on glucose metabolism in obese, prediabetic men and women: a randomized, crossover study  ap. 1569-1577.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies have shown that circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are elevated in obese, insulin-resistant individuals. However, it is not known if supplementation of additional BCAAs will further impair glucose metabolism. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the effects of BCAA supplementation on glucose metabolism in obese, prediabetic individuals. This is a randomized crossover study involving 12 obese individuals with prediabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a daily supplement containing either 20 g BCAA or protein low in BCAAs for 4 wk with a 2-wk washout in between. At each visit, an oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. Collected blood samples were used to measure glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance–associated biomarkers. BCAA supplementation tended to decrease the plasma glucose area under the curve (AUC) measured by the OGTT (AUC percentage change from supplementation baseline, BCAA: −3.3% ± 3%; low-BCAA: 10.0% ± 6%; P = 0.08). However, BCAA supplementation did not affect plasma insulin during OGTT challenge (BCAA: −3.9% ± 8%; low-BCAA: 14.8% ± 10%; P = 0.28). The plasma concentrations of nerve growth factor (BCAA: 4.0 ± 1 pg/mL; low-BCAA: 5.7 ± 1 pg/mL; P = 0.01) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (BCAA: −0.4% ± 9%; low-BCAA: 29.0% ± 18%; P = 0.02) were significantly lowered by BCAA supplementation compared to low-BCAA control. Plasma interleukin 1β was significantly elevated by BCAA supplementation (BCAA: 231.4% ± 187%; low-BCAA: 20.6% ± 33%; P = 0.05). BCAA supplementation did not affect the circulating concentrations of the BCAAs leucine (BCAA: 9.0% ± 12%; low-BCAA: 9.2% ± 11%), valine (BCAA: 9.1% ± 11%; low-BCAA: 12.0% ± 13%), or isoleucine (BCAA: 2.5% ± 11%; low-BCAA: 7.3% ± 11%). Our data suggest that BCAA supplementation did not impair glucose metabolism in obese, prediabetic subjects. Further studies are needed to confirm the results seen in the present study.

However, the biting Diptera species in the Caribbean region have been poorly documented. During 2021, CDC downdraft suction traps with UV light were employed to assess both the species occurrence and blood meal sources across three different habitats in the Dominican Republic. Eighteen species of mosquitoes (n = 274), six species of Culicoides (n = 803), two black fly species (n = 2), and one species of muscid fly (n = 25) were identified at species-level by morphology and/or molecular phylogenetic approaches based on the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI). Engorged mosquito (n = 5) and Culicoides (n = 28) females showed host preferences derived exclusively from mammals (cows and pigs), except Culex species containing the blood of chickens. Our study provides new records of the Diptera Dominican catalogue (Culex salinarius for the Greater Antilles, Culicoides jamaicensis for Hispaniola, and Culicoides haitiensis and Culicoides borinqueni for the Dominican Republic), the first available COI DNA sequences of different Diptera in the GenBank, some pictures of diagnostic features of closely related specimens, spatial distribution across the habitats studied, and new insights on their feeding preferences in the Caribbean region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex salinarius 3aCulicoides 3aDNA 3aSimuliidae 3ablood 3ablood meal 3ahabitats 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3aultraviolet radiation 3aCaribbean 3aDominican Republic1 aBravo-Barriga, Daniel 1 aRodríguez-Sosa, María Altagracia1 aRueda, Juan de,dactive 1691,1 aFrontera, Eva 1 aAlarcón-Elbal, Pedro María0 tPathogens.g2022 June 21, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110707143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245008200169520228700251592002802538650001502566650001802581650005802599650001802657650001102675650001702686650002002703650002002723650002302743650002402766650001202790650001502802650001502817650001102832650001802843650002402861650001102885650001502896650001602911650001702927651001002944700001902954700002502973700002802998773011903026856007303145852000903218655001203227IND60649000620221120141359.0190702e20190530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064900062DNAL7 a10.3390/f100604732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez-Garreton, Camila 14aThe Impacts of Native Forests and Forest Plantations on Water Supply in Chile  aOver the past 40 years, south-central Chile has experienced important land-use-induced land cover changes, with massive conversion from native forests (NF) to Pinus radiata D.Don and Eucalyptus spp. exotic forest plantations (FP). Several case studies have related this conversion to a reduction in water supply within small catchments (<100 ha). In this work, we explore the impacts of NF and FP on streamflow by using a large-sample catchment dataset recently developed for Chile. We select 25 large forested catchments (>20,000 ha) in south-central Chile (35&deg; S&ndash;41&deg; S), analyze their land cover and precipitation spatial distributions, and fit a regression model to quantify the influence of NF, FP, grassland (GRA) and shrubland (SHR) partitions on annual runoff. To assess potential effects of land cover changes on water supply, we use the fitted model (R2 = 0.84) in synthetic experiments where NF, GRA and SHR covers within the catchments are replaced by patches of FP. We show that annual runoff consistently decreases with increments of FP, although the magnitude of the change (ranging from 2.2% to 7.2% mean annual runoff decrease for 10,000 ha increment in FP) depends on several factors, including the initial land cover partition within the basin, the replaced land cover class, the area of the catchment, and the type of catchment (drier or humid). Finally, in the context of the mitigation strategies pledged in the Chilean NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions defined after the Paris Agreement), which include the afforestation of 100,000 ha (mainly native forest) by 2030, we quantify the impacts on water supply due to the afforestation of 100,000 ha with different combinations of NF and FP. We show that annual runoff is highly sensitive to the relative area of FP to NF: ratios of FP to NF areas of 10%, 50% and 90% would lead to 3%, &minus;18% and &minus;40% changes in mean annual runoff, respectively. Our results can be used in the discussion of public policies and decision-making involving forests and land cover changes, as they provide scientifically-based tools to quantify expected impacts on water resources. In particular, this knowledge is relevant for decision making regarding mitigation strategies pledged in the Chilean NDC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aPinus radiata 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aafforestation 3abasins 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aforest plantations 3aforested watersheds 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aland cover 3amodels 3apublic policy 3aregression analysis 3arunoff 3ashrublands 3astream flow 3awater supply 3aChile1 aLara, Antonio 1 aBoisier, Juan  Pablo1 aGalleguillos, Mauricio 0 tForests.g2019 May 30, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100604733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008900173300001800262520120400280592002801484650001801512650001201530650001201542650002001554650002201574650004301596650001301639650001101652650000701663650001501670650001801685650001301703700001701716700002501733700002701758773009601785856008101881852000901962655001201971IND60120737520221118011353.0150210e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012073752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-013-2446-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadea, Irinel Adriana10aSimultaneous Determination of Some Analgesic Drugs Using Mixed Mode Stationary Phase  ap. 1459-1465.  aA new HPLC method based on a mixed mode stationary phase Hypersil Duet C18/SAX was developed and applied for the simultaneous determination of acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid and codeine. Parameters, such as the composition of the mobile phase, the nature of the organic modifier, the buffer type and the flow rate were investigated to optimize the separation. The results obtained show that the new HPLC method is rapid, highly efficient and selective. The studied compounds are separated in 10 min, by means of a mobile phase containing phosphate buffer (pH 7.50) and methanol (65:35 v v⁻¹). The retention mechanisms of each analyte were investigated using both the linear solvent strength theory and stoichiometric displacement model. The method was fully validated and showed good linearity for each compound for a concentration ranging between 2.0 and 40 μg mL⁻¹. The limits of detection and quantification were determined and they are lower than 0.1 μg mL⁻¹. The precision (RSD) of the method does not exceed 2 % for all studied compounds. The method was successfully applied for the assay of acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid and codeine in pharmaceutical formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aaspirin 3acodeine 3adetection limit 3adrug formulations 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3amodels 3apH 3aphosphates 3arapid methods 3asolvents1 aVitan, Ioana1 aVlădescu, Luminiţa1 aAboul-Enein, Hassan Y.0 tChromatographia.g2013 Nov., v. 76, no. 21-22 p.1459-1465dSpringer-Verlagx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-013-2446-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245011000209300001800319520102200337592002801359596008501387650001301472650001401485650002801499650001401527650001601541650001801557700002501575700002101600773013401621856008101755852000901836655001201845IND60620760120221120202317.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062076012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-018-9897-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurtulmuş, Ferhat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7862-690610aClassification of chestnuts according to moisture levels using impact sound analysis and machine learning  ap. 2819-2834.  aIn this study, a prototype system was designed, built and tested to classify chestnuts using impact sound signals and machine learning methods according to moisture contents. Briefly, the system consisted of a shotgun microphone, a sliding platform, an impact surface, a triggering system, a sound device and a computer. Sound signal data were acquired from 2028 chestnut samples with three different moisture levels. Acoustic signals from chestnut samples were filtered to alleviate negative effects of unwanted noise. Four machine learning classifiers using three different feature sets obtained from two feature groups applying feature reduction methods were trained and tested to classify pairs of chestnut moisture group categories as 35% versus 45%, 35% versus 55%, 45% versus 55% (classification with two outputs) and 35% versus 45% versus 55% (classification with three outputs), respectively.

These viruses are a threat not only for animal health but also public health due to their zoonotic potential. The domestic duck plays a major role in the epidemiological cycle of influenza virus subtypes H5 but little is known concerning host/pathogen interactions during influenza infection in duck species. In this study, a subtracted library from duck trachea (a primary site of influenza virus infection) was constructed to analyse and compare the host response after a highly or low pathogenic (LP) H5N1-infection. RESULTS: Here, we show that more than 200 different genes were differentially expressed in infected duck trachea to a significant degree. In addition, significant differentially expressed genes between LPAI- and HPAI-infected tracheas were observed. Gene ontology annotation was used and specific signalling pathways were identified. These pathways were different for LPAI and HPAI-infected tracheas, except for the CXCR4 signalling pathway which is implicated in immune response. A different modulation of genes in the CXCR4 signalling pathway and TRIM33 was induced in duck tracheas infected with a HPAI- or a LPAI-H5N1. CONCLUSION: First, this study indicates that Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) is an alternative approach to gain insights into the pathogenesis of influenza infection in ducks. Secondly, the results indicate that cellular gene expression in the duck trachea was differently modulated after infection with a LPAI-H5N1 or after infection with a HPAI-H5N1 virus. Such difference found in infected trachea, a primary infection site, could precede continuation of infection and could explain appearance of respiratory symptoms or not.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCXCR4 receptor 3aInfluenza A virus 3aanimal health 3aavian influenza 3adisease outbreaks 3aducks 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune response 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apublic health 3asignal transduction 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3aviruses1 aDeleage, Claire1 aOger, Aurélie1 aBriand, François-Xavier1 aQuenault, Hélène1 aBlanchard, Yannick0 tVirology journal.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.279-279dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-10-2793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100002300182245008200205300001800287506007600305520186400381592002802245506003702273650001602310650001402326650001002340650001402350650002402364650001902388650001002407650001302417650001802430650001602448650001402464650002602478650001902504650001502523650001902538650002402557650001702581650002202598650001702620650001002637651001802647653000902665653001402674653001702688653002302705700006102728700002102789700002102810700001402831700001102845700002102856773014502877856007503022852000903097655001203106IND60672571520221207104719.0191016e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067257152DNAL7 a10.1093/ajcn/nqz0262doi7 aPMC69004952pmcid7 a311366552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortune, Natalie C10aDietary intake and cognitive function: evidence from the Bogalusa Heart Study  ap. 1656-1663.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDementia and late-life cognitive decline are leading causes of death and disability in the United States. Prevention of these diseases, by maintaining brain health throughout the life course, is essential. Diet and lifestyle changes are the chief strategies aimed at primary prevention for many of the risk factors of cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to examine the potential impact of dietary factors on cognitive function. This prospective cohort study followed 516 young adults through midlife. The Youth/Adolescent Questionnaire was used to collect habitual nutrition data (mean age: 32.03 ± 5.96 y) at baseline. Scores from a neurocognitive battery were used to assess cognitive function (mean age: 49.03 ± 4.86 y) at follow-up and were transformed to z scores. Separate multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were fitted. The trend across quintiles for each dietary variable was assessed. Vitamin B-6, whole grains, processed meats, and foods fried at home all displayed significant linear trends in their relation with cognitive function. Dietary intake of vitamin B-6 and whole grains was directly associated with better cognitive function after adjustment for age, race, sex, and total calorie intake (β coefficient from linear regression and SE: 1.755 ± 0.621, P = 0.005, and 0.001 ± 0.000, P = 0.018, respectively). Processed meat and foods fried at home consistently displayed inverse associations with cognitive function across crude and adjusted models (linear trend P values were 0.05 and <0.0001, respectively). Our findings suggest that dietary consumption in young adulthood may affect cognitive function in midlife. Strong associations between dietary intake and cognition were observed in our analysis, but as with all observational studies, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be excluded.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3abatteries 3abrain 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acohort studies 3adeath 3adementia 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3alifestyle 3aobservational studies 3aprocessed meat 3apyridoxine 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3awhole grain foods 3ayoung adults 3ayouth 3aUnited States 0adiet 0anutrition 0abrain health 0acognitive function1 aHarville, Emily W1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0319-09221 aGuralnik, Jack M1 aGustat, Jeanette1 aChen, Wei1 aQi, Lu1 aBazzano, Lydia A0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2019 June 01, v. 109, no. 6 p.1656-1663dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqz0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245006900208300001800277520150100295592002801796650002201824650001701846650002401863650002201887650001901909650002301928650001901951650001901970650001901989650002002008650001502028650001602043650002202059651001102081700002302092700001902115773013402134856008102268852000902349655001202358IND60620760220221120190958.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062076022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-018-9894-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCautela, Domenico1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4894-029910aThermal inactivation of pectin methylesterase in pineapple juice  ap. 2795-2800.  aThermal processing is usually used by the fruit juice industry for enzyme and microbial inactivation, thus limiting organoleptic changes that affect shelf life and quality of products. Mainly the inactivation of enzymes is necessary to avoid quality changes related to cloud loss, using mild temperature that allows minor alterations in product’s sensory as well as in nutritive traits. Pineapple juice, a product obtained by diluting the concentrate juice and pasteurizing afterword shipped to Europe, has a high residual pectin methylesterase (PME) activity. In this view, the present work provides a detailed kinetic study of the effect of pasteurization on inactivation of PME in pineapple juice. The fresh juice was treated with temperatures ranging from 70 to 95 °C, for various times, until the complete denaturation of PME occurred. Results of thermal stabilization treatments showed that enzyme inactivation behaviour follows a first-order kinetic process, in the studied temperature range. Moreover, the reaction rate constants for denaturation of PME were determined; in particular, activation energy (Ea), decimal reduction time (Dᵣₑf), and z value (z), were 78.2 ± 4.5 kJ/mol, 16 s (at reference temperature of 106 °C) and 36 ± 3 °C, respectively. Based on the thermal resistance data here reported to inactivate PME, a treatment of 106 °C with a mean holding time of 1 min should be employed in order to preserve cloudiness of pasteurized pineapple juice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3adenaturation 3aenzyme inactivation 3aheat inactivation 3aheat tolerance 3ajuice concentrates 3ajuice industry 3apasteurization 3apectinesterase 3apineapple juice 3ashelf life 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aEurope1 aCastaldo, Domenico1 aLaratta, Bruna0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2018 Dec., v. 12, no. 4 p.2795-2800dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-018-9894-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01448naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003000143245010700173300001800280520039100298592002800689650002200717650002400739650002300763653001200786653002300798653003100821653002200852700001700874773015700891856007701048852000901125655001201134IND60522489720221120065515.0170410e20150319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052248972DNAL7 a10.5560/znb.2014-41602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBöttcher, Hans-Christian10aConvenient Synthesis and Molecular Structure of the Cyclometallated Complex [IrCl(H)(C6H4PPh2)(PPh3)2]  ap. 1237-1240.  aThe reaction of [{Ir(μ-Cl)(coe)₂}₂] (coe=cis-cyclooctene) with triphenylphosphane (molar ratio of Ir to P=1 : 3) in dichloromethane at room temperature afforded after a short reaction time the cyclometallated complex [IrCl(H)(C₆H₄PPh₂)(PPh₃)₂] (1) in almost quantitative yield.

This work investigates abiotic degradation pathways of a particular PPCP, ibuprofen, in the presence of a major mineral component of soil (kaolinite clay), as well as the health effects of the primary compound and its degradation products. Results from these studies showed that the rate and extent of ibuprofen degradation is greatly influenced by the presence of clay particles and solar radiation. In the absence of solar radiation, the dominant reaction mechanism was observed to be the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay surface where surface silanol groups play a key role. In contrast, under solar radiation and in the presence of clay particles, ibuprofen breaks down to several fractions. The decay rates were at least 6-fold higher for irradiated samples compared to those of dark conditions. Toxicity of primary ibuprofen and its secondary residues were tested on three microorganisms: Bacillus megaterium, Pseudoaltermonas atlantica; and algae from the Chlorella genus. The results from the biological assays show that primary PPCP is more toxic than the mixture of secondary products. Overall, however, biological assays carried out using only 4-acetylbenzoic acid, the most abundant secondary product, show a higher toxic effect on algae compared to its parent compound.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus megaterium 3aChlorella 3aadsorption 3aalgae 3abioassays 3aclay 3aecotoxicology 3ahuman population 3aibuprofen 3airradiation 3akaolinite 3amicroorganisms 3apersonal care products 3areaction mechanisms 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3atoxicity 0aPharmaceuticals 0aPhoto-enhanced toxicology 0aAbiotic transformation 0aPersonal care products 0aPhoto degradation 0aSecondary products1 aGurung, Rubi1 aRijal, Hom1 aMaldonado-Torres, Sabino1 aChan, Andrew1 aAcharya, Shishir1 aRogelj, Snezna1 aPiyasena, Menake0 tWater research.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 131 p.22-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245019400153300001600347500002000363520187600383592002802259650001502287650001202302650001602314650001802330650001902348650001102367650001602378650001202394650003802406650002202444650002802466650002002494650001702514650001202531650002402543650001002567650001902577650001102596650002502607700001602632700002202648700001602670700001602686700001602702773015002718856007302868852000902941655001202950IND60593933320221121043011.0180508e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059393332DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.128722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiani, A.10aInteraction between the sequence of feeding of hay and concentrate, and boiling of barley on feed intake, the activity of hydrolytic enzymes and fermentation in the hindgut of Arabian mares  ap. 810-817.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe interaction between the sequence of feeding of hay and concentrate and the hydrothermal processing of barley in alleviating concentrate effects on intake, and hindgut fermentation in horses was tested. Six Arabian mares (4–10 years of age, 410 ± 35 kg body weight) were used to evaluate the effects of feeding sequence (FS) and type of barley (TB) on intake, and faecal volatile fatty acids (VFA), activities of α‐amylase (AA: EC 3.2.1.1), carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase: EC 3.2.1.4), microcrystalline cellulase (MCCase: EC 3.2.1.91) and general filter paper degrading activity (FPD). Mares were offered a ration of air‐dried alfalfa and concentrate (70:30 as‐fed) in four subsequent periods of 14 days including 8 days of adaptation and 6 days of sampling. In each period and each meal, mares received concentrate either 30 min after (HC) or 30 min before (CH) alfalfa hay. Barley was either milled or boiled in water. Rectal samples were grabbed directly from rectum once per period. Mares subjected to CH had higher dry matter intakes than mares under HC regime. The acetate:propionate ratio (A:P ratio) in rectal content was higher with CH than HC. The AA activity was higher under CH than under HC. Mares fed boiled barley had lower rectal concentrations of VFA and propionate and a higher A:P ratio than mares fed milled barley. Furthermore, the rectal content showed a higher MCCase activity but a lower AA activity when mares were fed boiled compared with milled barley. Interactions between FS and TB were observed with respect to CMCase activity, and concentrations of propionate and valerate. In conclusion, the present results suggest that both, feeding concentrate before hay and boiling the barley, might improve the hindgut environment in Arabian mares, and that the two measures were mostly additive and sometimes even synergistic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3aalfalfa 3aalfalfa hay 3aalpha-amylase 3aanimal feeding 3abarley 3abody weight 3aboiling 3acellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase 3adry matter intake 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3ahindgut 3ahot water treatment 3amares 3apropionic acid 3arectum 3avolatile fatty acids1 aHoseini, F.1 aGhorbaninejad, P.1 aAzarfar, A.1 aKreuzer, M.1 aĂzizi, A.,0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2018 June, v. 102, no. 3 p.810-817dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.128723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007200158500001900230520189100249592002802140650001602168650002202184650001502206650001302221650001902234650000902253650001602262650000902278650001502287650002002302651001002322700002002332700001902352773012802371856007402499852000902573655001202582IND60726438820221117225810.0210205e20210124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072643882DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130303982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Vinay 10aProportional Trends of Continuous Rainfall in Indian Summer Monsoon  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA comprehensive study on the Indian summer monsoonal rainfall (ISMR) is performed in the light of decadal changes in the continuous rainfall events and the number of rainy days using 68 years (1951–2018) of gridded rain gauge data. Non-parametric Mann–Kendall’s test is applied on total rainfall amount, the number of rainy days, number of continuous rainfall events, and rainfall magnitude to find trends over different climatic zones of India for the two periods, 1951–1984 and 1985–2018. Our results found a decreasing trend for more than 4-days of continuous rainfall events during the recent 34 years (1985–2018) compared to 1951–1984. The rate of increase/decrease in extreme/continuous rainfall events does not follow a similar trend in number of continuous rainfall events and magnitude. Moreover, the rainfall is shifted towards a lesser number of continuous rainfall days with higher magnitudes during 1985–2018. During the crop’s sow season (i.e., the first 45 days from the onset date of Indian monsoon), the total number of rainy days decreased by a half day during the last 34 years. Over the Central and North East regions of India, the number of rainfall days decreased by ~0.1 days/yr and ~0.3 days/yr, respectively, during 1985–2018. Overall, the decreasing trends in continuous rainfall days may escalate water scarcity and lead to lower soil moisture over rain-fed irrigated land. Additionally, an upsurge in heavy rainfall episodes will lead to an unexpected floods. On a daily scale, rainfall correlates with soil moisture and evaporation up to 0.87 over various land cover and land use regions of India. Continuous light-moderate rainfall seems to be a controlling factor for replenishing soil moisture in upper levels. A change in rainfall characteristics may force the monsoon-fed rice cultivation period to adopt changing rainfall patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3airrigated farming 3aland cover 3aland use 3amonsoon season 3arain 3arain gauges 3arice 3asoil water 3awater shortages 3aIndia1 aSunilkumar, K. 1 aSinha, Tushar 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 24, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130303983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01618naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003300146245009500179300001400274500001400288520055900302592002800861650001400889650001500903650001700918650001600935651001100951653001600962653001100978653001600989653001801005700002001023700002901043773009401072856008101166852000901247655001201256IND60699227120221117031534.0210117e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069922712DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.269.42552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Renato José Pires,10aNew continental record and new species of Austromerope (Mecoptera, Meropeidae) from Brazil  ap. 51-65.  aNAL-light  aA new species of Meropeidae (Mecoptera) from Brazil, Austromerope brasiliensis sp. n., is described, representing only the 3rd extant species described in this family and the 1st record of the family from the Neotropical region.

However, PCR reactions targeting P35S do not distinguish between GMOs and naturally occurring CaMV introduced by infection or contamination, resulting in false positives. Initial attempts at specific CaMV detection were based on a limited number of CAMV sequences. To account for the broad variability in the viral genome, we designed a new real-time PCR assay based on the genomic sequences of 96 CaMV isolates collected worldwide. This system amplified a 112 bp fragment of ORFV in the double-stranded genome, with complete sequence homology to the primer and probe targets of the tested genomes. Tests on a CaMV isolate collection and GMOs revealed improved specificity compared to previously published methods as well as high sensitivity, with limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of three copies of CaMV.  aPublisher supplied data  aS3-VG-15-048cState Office for Occupational Safety, Consumer Protection and Health, Brandenburg, Germany 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3adetection limit 3afood crops 3afood research 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenome 3apromoter regions 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asequence homology1 aUlrich, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3854-96080 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 Oct., v. 244, no. 10 p.1861-1871dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-018-3099-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01809naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245008300166300001800249520060700267592002800874650001400902650001200916650002200928650004400950650001300994650001401007653001901021653001301040653001301053653001301066653001401079700002301093700001201116700003201128700002101160773014401181856007701325852000901402655001201411IND60522490020221117184024.0170410e20150319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052249002DNAL7 a10.5560/znb.2014-41642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilhelmi, Caroline12aA Novel Bifunctional Ligand for the Synthesis of Polynuclear Alkynyl Complexes  ap. 1290-1298.  aThe synthesis of 2-(1-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine is presented.

Two platinum alkynyl complexes were structurally characterized, and a trinuclear Ru2Pt complex was indentified by means of NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3achelation 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplatinum 3apyridines 0aAlkynyl Ligand 0aPyrazole 0aPyridine 0aPlatinum 0aRuthenium1 aGaffga, Maximilian1 aSun, Yu1 aNiedner-Schatteburg, Gereon1 aThiel, Werner R.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2015 Mar. 19, v. 69, no. 11-12 p.1290-1298dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5560/znb.2014-41643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012100170300001600291520167800307592002801985650001902013650001402032650002402046650001602070650001302086650001902099650001102118650001202129650002002141650001802161650001502179700002602194700001902220700001902239700001602258700002202274700002002296700001802316700001502334773009302349856008102442852000902523655001202532IND50074313420221120120221.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007431342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-013-9895-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeppell, Catherine10aInterpreting spatial patterns in redox and coupled water–nitrogen fluxes in the streambed of a gaining river reach  ap. 491-509.  aWater pathways through permeable riverbeds are multi-dimensional, including lateral hyporheic exchange flows as well as vertical (upwelling and downwelling) fluxes. The influence of different pathways of water on solute patterns and the supply of nitrate and other redox-sensitive chemical species in the riverbed is poorly understood but could be environmentally significant. For example, nitrate-rich upwelling water in the gaining reaches of groundwater-fed rivers has the potential to supply significant quantities of nitrate through the riverbed to surface waters, constraining opportunities to deliver the goals of the EU Water Framework Directive to achieve ‘good ecological status’. We show that patterns in porewater chemistry in the armoured river bed of a gaining reach (River Leith, Cumbria) reflect the spatial variability in different sources of water; oxic conditions being associated with preferential discharge from groundwater and reducing conditions with longitudinal and lateral fluxes of water due to water movement from riparian zones and/or hyporheic exchange flows. Our findings demonstrate the important control of both vertical and lateral water fluxes on patterns of redox-sensitive chemical species in the river bed. Furthermore, under stable, baseflow conditions (<Q₉₀) a zone of preferential discharge, comprising 20 % of the reach by area contributes 4–9 % of the total nitrate being transported through the reach in surface water, highlighting the need to understand the spatial distribution of such preferential discharge locations at the catchment scale to establish their importance for nitrate delivery to the stream channel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abase flow 3achemical speciation 3agroundwater 3anitrates 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asolutes 3astream channels 3asurface water 3awatersheds1 aLouise Heathwaite, A.1 aBinley, Andrew1 aByrne, Patrick1 aUllah, Sami1 aLansdown, Katrina1 aKeenan, Patrick1 aTrimmer, Mark1 aZhang, Hao0 tBiogeochemistry.g2014 Mar., v. 117, no. 2-3 p.491-509dSpringer-Verlagx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-013-9895-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007300169300001600242520058800258592002800846653002900874653002700903653001700930653001700947653001000964653001100974653003900985653003201024653001801056653001601074653001001090653001501100700001301115700002301128700001701151700001701168700002001185700001501205773010501220856008401325852000901409655001201418IND60552751020221122093551.0161021e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055275102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.immbio.2013.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustamante, J.10aPrédisposition génétique aux maladies infectieuses chez l’homme  ap. 208-215.  aClassical primary immunodeficiencies confer predisposition to multiple or recurrent infectious diseases.

The subsequent prolonged decline in ruminal pH can lead to subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Accumulation of short-chain fatty acids can cause proliferation of rumen papillae to increase absorption surface, subsequently leading to a thickening of the rumen mucosa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of continuous measurements of the rumen mucosa thickness (RMT) as a diagnostic tool for SARA in dairy cows compared with continuous measurements of ruminal pH. The study used 6 lactating Simmental cows switched from a moderate-grain (MG) diet with 40% concentrate (dry matter basis) for 1 wk to a high-grain (HG) diet with 60% concentrate (dry matter basis) for 4 wk. Reticuloruminal pH was recorded with indwelling sensors throughout the trial. Rumen mucosa thickness was measured by transabdominal ultrasound at 4 d during the MG diet and 23 d during the HG diet. Mean RMT increased from 4.7 ± 0.19 mm in the MG diet to 5.3 ± 0.17 mm in the HG diet, whereas daily mean reticular pH decreased from 6.8 ± 0.01 in the MG diet to 6.5 ± 0.01 in the HG diet. Older cows (>3 lactations) had increased RMT, associated with higher reticular pH throughout the experiment. The higher RMT and pH level in older cows underlines their lesser susceptibility to SARA during high-grain feeding. In conclusion, RMT can successfully be measured using linear ultrasound probes, commonly used by veterinary practitioners as rectal probes. By combining noninvasive RMT measurements with the lactation number of the individual cows in a herd, this study suggests that RMT is a viable option for diagnosing SARA. Further research, using a larger number of cows with different lactations numbers, is needed to establish a cut-off RMT indicating the risk of SARA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSimmental 3aabsorption 3adairy cows 3adiagnostic techniques 3adiet 3aherds 3alactation 3alactation number 3amucosa 3apH 3arisk 3arumen epithelium 3aruminal acidosis 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aveterinarians 0adairy cow 0ahigh-grain diet 0arumen mucosa 0aruminal acidosis 0atransabdominal ultrasound1 aHumer, E.1 aKröger, I.1 aMeißl, A.1 aReisinger, N.1 aZebeli, Q.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Mar., v. 101, no. 3 p.2650-2654dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-136823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012800163300001600291520153600307592002801843650002601871650002601897650001601923650002001939650001201959650001201971650001501983650001201998650001802010650001302028650002202041650002502063650002502088650001102113651001202124651001402136700002002150700002202170773009302192856008102285852000902366655001202375IND50074313520221120140047.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007431352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-013-9897-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaas, Peter10aBenthic primary production and nitrogen cycling in Spartina alterniflora marshes: effect of restoration after acute dieback  ap. 511-524.  aThe sudden and massive Spartina alterniflora dieback at the turn of the millennium generated numerous unanswered questions regarding its mechanistic causes and consequences. This study, conducted during 2007–2008, aimed to elucidate mechanisms of recovery and determine whether recovery was accelerated by replanting efforts. The onset of a severe drought during the summer of 2007, however, provided a potential glimpse into the mechanisms driving dieback events. Study sites were established in two of the hardest hit states, Georgia and Louisiana. Each site had a replicated block design consisting of the following four treatments: reference, dieback, dieback with low density replanting (90 cm spacing), and dieback with high density replanting (30 cm spacing). To assess biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem functioning, we quantified rates of nitrogen fixation, potential nitrification, potential denitrification, and benthic production biannually. All measured process rates decreased following the drought year of 2007. Nitrogen fixation was positively correlated with benthic production rates in Louisiana, while denitrification was positively correlated with benthic production rates in Georgia and Louisiana. The lack of decreased benthic production during the 2007 drought could indicate that benthic microphytes cope with better with drought than plants, but may be outcompeted during non-drought years. Replanting efforts significantly increased ecosystem recovery in Louisiana and to a lesser extent in Georgia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina alterniflora 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acorrelation 3adenitrification 3adieback 3adrought 3aecosystems 3amarshes 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aprimary productivity 3aspatial distribution 3asummer 3aGeorgia 3aLouisiana1 aHester, Mark W.1 aJoye, Samantha B.0 tBiogeochemistry.g2014 Mar., v. 117, no. 2-3 p.511-524dSpringer-Verlagx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-013-9897-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009400164300001600258500001900274520153100293592002801824650002501852650002101877650001601898650002101914650001301935650002501948650002801973650002402001650001102025650001302036650001902049651001202068653003902080653002402119653002502143700002302168700002402191700002002215700002302235773013002258856008102388852000902469655001202478IND60705375420221119072623.0200804e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070537542DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTTECH04480-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalpa, Laura10aApparent Recovery and Efficiency of Nitrogen Fertilization in Tomato Grown on Sandy Soils  ap. 204-211.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUse efficiency of applied nitrogen (N) is estimated typically to be <50% in most crops. In sandy soils and warmer climates particularly, leaching and volatilization may be primary pathways for environmental loss of applied N. To determine the effect of N fertilization rate on the N use efficiency (NUE) and apparent recovery of N fertilizer (APR), a replicated field study with ‘BHN 602’ tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) grown in sandy soils under a fertigated plastic-mulched bed system was conducted using ammonium nitrate as the N source at four different rates (0, 150, 200, and 250 lb/acre). Spring tomato was followed by fall tomato in the same field, a typical cropping sequence in north Florida. Fertigation of N fertilizer was applied weekly in 13 equal doses for both seasons. The highest NUE was 12.05% (spring) and 32.38% (fall), and the highest APR was 6.11% (spring) for the lowest rate of N applied (150 lb/acre). In the fall, APR was unaffected by fertilizer N rates and ranged from 12.88% to 19.39%. Nitrogen accumulation in tomato plants were similar among the three N fertilizer rates applied (150, 200, and 250 lb/acre), though compared with no N fertilizer application, significant increases occurred. Whole plant N accumulation, NUE, and APR declined or remained similar when N rates increased above 150 lb/acre. Additionally, a regression analysis and derivative of the quadratic fresh yield data showed that yields were maximized at 162 and 233 lb/acre N in the spring and fall seasons, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aammonium nitrate 3afertigation 3afertilizer rates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aregression analysis 3aspring 3atomatoes 3avolatilization 3aFlorida 0afertilization management practices 0anutrient management 0avegetable production1 aMylavarapu, Rao S.1 aHochmuth, George J.1 aWright, Alan L.1 avan Santen, Edzard0 tHortTechnology.g2020 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.204-211dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH04480-193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008900166300001800255520157800273592002801851650001501879650002501894650001401919650001101933650001101944650002101955650001301976650000901989650001001998650001802008650001002026650001002036650001102046650001802057650000902075650001702084650002202101650003002123650001202153650001002165650001002175700002502185700001702210700001802227700002002245700003002265700002102295700002102316700001802337700002102355773014302376856008102519852000902600655001202609IND60611676220221120044722.0180904e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061167622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-018-3083-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShayan, Parviz13aAn innovative reverse line blot for simultaneous detection of animal species in food  ap. 1711-1717.  aAnimal products play a significant role in human consumption. Therefore, identifying the food fraud is of great importance. We describe a simple but an innovative method for the simultaneous detection of meat sources from different animal species (cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat, horse, camel, pig, dog, cat, rabbit, chicken, wild duck and turkey) and human as a control DNA was extracted from samples prepared from human and above-mentioned animals and amplified using a common primer pair derived from a region of the mitochondrial DNA. The PCR products were subsequently hybridized with the species-specific DNA probes covalently bonded to a Biodyne C blotting membrane. The results showed that the PCR products generated from mammalian reacted as expected, to catch-all probes, mammalian catch-all probes and the corresponding species specific DNA probes but not with bird catch-all probes. The avian PCR product reacted also as expected, to catch-all probes, bird catch-all probes and the corresponding species-specific DNA probes, and not with the mammalian catch-all probes. These results showed that the used detection system could discriminate simultaneously, each animal species from the others. To determine the sensitivity of the presented hybridization method, the meat samples from 2 to 6 animals were mixed and the extracted DNA was analyzed. Interestingly, the species-specific reaction could be detected in all mixtures consisting of different species. Furthermore, it could be shown that the mixed meat DNA ratio 1/100 also could be detected simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA probes 3aadulterated products 3abuffaloes 3acamels 3acattle 3achemical bonding 3achickens 3adogs 3aducks 3afood research 3afraud 3agoats 3ahorses 3ahybridization 3ameat 3ameat protein 3amitochondrial DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3asheep 3aswine1 aAl-taghlubee, Dhakam1 aMisaghi, Ali1 aShayan, David1 aGandomi, Hassan1 aBasti, Afshin Akhondzadeh1 aAlghassab, Taraq1 aKamkar, Abolfasl1 aKhanjari, Ali1 aEckert, Brigitte0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 Oct., v. 244, no. 10 p.1711-1717dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-018-3083-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245018000154300001600334500002000350520170900370592002802079650001302107650001602120650002102136650002502157650002302182650001602205650001002221650002002231650000902251650002002260650002002280650002302300650000902323650001602332650001802348650001202366650001602378650001002394650002002404650001802424650001902442650002502461650001202486650003602498650001002534700001102544700001602555700001302571773015002584856007302734852000902807655001202816IND60593933720221121042947.0180508e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059393372DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.128392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, H.

Four hundred 28‐day‐old male Ross 308 broilers were randomly assigned into four groups, with 10 replicates per group and 10 broilers per replicate. The broilers in the normal (NOR) group were kept at 22 ± 1°C and fed the basal diet, and each of the other three groups were treated with cyclic heat (33 ± 1°C from 0800 to 1800 and 22 ± 1°C from 1800 to 0800) and fed the basal diet with 0 (HT), 1 (CT1) or 2 (CT2) g of CT/kg of diet. The experiment lasted for 14 days. Compared with the HT group, broilers in the NOR and CT2 groups had higher (p < .05) average daily gain and villus height in the jejunum and lower serum d‐lactate (p < .001) and diamine oxidase (p < .01) levels. The addition of 2 g CT/kg of diet increased the total antioxidant capacity (p < .001) and superoxide dismutase activities (p < .05) and zonula occludens‐1 mRNA expression level (p < .05) and decreased the malondialdehyde concentration (p < .01) and mRNA expression levels of interleukin‐6 (p < .001) and nuclear factor kappa B (p < .001) in the jejunal mucosa of heat‐stressed broilers. The populations of Escherichia coli and Clostridium in the jejunum (p < .01) and caecum (p < .05) of broilers in the HT group were higher than those in the NOR and CT2 groups. In conclusion, the addition of 2 g CT/kg of diet seemed to be a feasible means of alleviating the negative effects of heat stress on the growth performance and intestinal function of broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aClostridium 3aEscherichia coli 3aantioxidant activity 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood serum 3acecum 3adiamine oxidase 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ainterleukin-6 3ajejunum 3alactic acid 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3amicroorganisms 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atannins 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3avilli1 aLi, K.1 aZhao, J.

Today, the CDT is the more specific and pertinent marker of alcohol intake preceding the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) markers. Our study was based on work-related medical examination of 1205 patients from whom 1259 samples were analyzed by HPLC, then split into three groups depending on the initial level of CDT. Age, sex, weight, alcohol intake, current treatment or possible pathology declared by the patients themselves were taken into account. The triad CDT-MCV-GGT in association with tri or asialotransferrin renewed interest in this marker in clinical and biological studies allowing early detection of alcohol misuse and developing preventive and assertive tracking on various alcohol use disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCDT 0aAlcoholism 0aMisuse 0aTracking 0aAddiction 0aMCV 0aGGT 0aHPLC 0aCarbohydrate deficient transferrin 0aDesialylated transferrin 0aCDT 0aAlcoolisme 0aMésusage 0aRepérage 0aAddiction 0aVGM 0aGGT 0aCLHP 0aTransferrine carbohydrate deficiente 0aTransferrine désialylée0 tImmuno-analyse et biologie spécialisée.g2013 Aug., v. 28 p.183-190dElsevier SASx0923-25327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.immbio.2013.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245015500173300001600328520091800344592002801262650002301290650001401313650002501327650001501352650002201367650003301389650001401422653001101436653001501447653001701462653002101479653002501500653002001525653000901545653002601554653002401580653002701604653000701631653000701638653000901645653000701654653000701661653000701668653000701675653000801682653001001690653000801700653000901708700005701717700002301774700005601797700002001853700001901873773012501892856008302017852000902100655001202109IND60719313720221117231808.0210820e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071931372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.11.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvati Manni, Livia10aEnzymatic hydrolysis of monoacylglycerols and their cyclopropanated derivatives: Molecular structure and nanostructure determine the rate of digestion  ap. 767-775.  aColloidal lipidic particles with different space groups and geometries (mesosomes) are employed in the development of new nanosystems for the oral delivery of drugs and nutrients. Understanding of the enzymatic digestion rate of these particles is key to the development of novel formulations. In this work, the molecular structure of the lipids has been systematically tuned to examine the effect on their self-assembly and digestion rate. The kinetic and phase changes during the lipase-catalysed hydrolysis of mesosomes formed by four synthetic cyclopropanated lipids and their cis-unsaturated analogues were monitored by dynamic small angle X-ray scattering and acid/base titration. It was established that both the phase behaviour and kinetics of the hydrolysis are greatly affected by small changes in the molecular structure of the lipid as well as by the internal nanostructure of the colloidal particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3adigestion 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahydrolysis 3amonoacylglycerols 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3atitration 0aLipids 0aMesophases 0aCubic phases 0aHexagonal phases 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aPhase behaviour 0aSAXS 0aNanostructured lipids 0aLipid nanoparticles 0aCyclopropanated lipids 0aPT 0aMO 0aSAXS 0aSI 0aMP 0aML 0aMV 0aMDS 0aDCPML 0aMLB 0aCPMP1 aDuss, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9086-38591 aAssenza, Salvatore1 aBoyd, Ben J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5434-590X1 aLandau, Ehud M.1 aFong, Wye-Khay0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 588 p.767-775dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.11.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03983naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003400135040001800169100002400187245018800211300001400399500001400413506007600427520241200503592002802915506003702943650001302980650001502993650000903008650000903017650002003026650000903046650001103055650001503066650001803081650001603099650001203115651002303127651001203150653001803162653001703180653003203197700002403229700001603253700002503269773009303294856008103387852000903468655001203477IND60693340420221207131242.0210116e20120405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069334042DNAL7 aPMC33320092pmcid7 a225399062pmid7 a10.3897/zookeys.180.21272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogutskaya, Nina G.10aTwo new freshwater fish species of the genus Telestes (Actinopterygii, Cyprinidae) from karst poljes in Eastern Herzegovina and Dubrovnik littoral (Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia)  ap. 53-80.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo new species, Telestes dabar and Telestes miloradi, are described on the basis of morphological comparisons of isolated geographical populations of fishes identified earlier as Telestes metohiensis. A lectotype is designated for Telestes metohiensis, whose range is shown to include waters of Gatačko, Cerničko, and Nevesinjsko poljes in Eastern Herzegovina. Telestes dabar from Dabarsko Polje (Eastern Herzegovina) and Telestes miloradi from Konavosko Polje (south Croatia) share with Telestes metohiensis the following combination of characters that distinguish them from the rest of the genus Telestes: pharyngeal teeth in one row, usually 5–4; preoperculo-mandibular canal not communicating with the infraorbital canal; mouth subterminal, the tip of the mouth cleft on or below the level of the ventral margin of the eye; postcleithrum minute or absent; ventral portion of the trunk with a dark stripe on a pale background; and dorsal portion of trunk uniformly dark and bordered ventrally by a dark midlateral stripe. Telestes dabar and Telestes miloradi are distinguishable from Telestes metohiensis in usually having 8½ branched dorsal-fin rays (vs. usually 7½), 9 or 10 gill rakers (vs. 7–10, usually 8), and the dark stripe on the ventral portion of the trunk below the main pigmented area of the back narrow and usually not reaching posteriorly to the caudal peduncle (vs. dark stripe wide and extending posteriorly to the caudal peduncle). Telestes dabar is distinguished from Telestes miloradi by having scales on most of the body situated close to one another and overlapping in a region behind the pectoral girdle and usually on the caudal peduncle (vs. overlapping scales on most of the body); the lateral line usually incomplete and interrupted, with 24–69, usually 54–65, total scales (vs. lateral line usually complete, with 55–67 total scales); scales above and below the lateral line slightly smaller than lateral-line scales (vs. of about equal size); head width 43–52% HL (vs. 48–58% HL); and lower jaw length 10–12% SL or 36–41% HL (vs. 8–10% SL or 33–38% HL). Telestes miloradi, a very local endemic species,is known only by historical samples. Telestes dabar is an abundant fish in Dabarsko Polje, but its range is critically restricted during the dry season by a few permanent sources. Nothing is known about its occurrence in underground karst waters.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTelestes 3adry season 3aeyes 3afins 3afreshwater fish 3ahead 3akarsts 3alectotypes 3alittoral zone 3anew species 3apharynx 3aBosnia-Herzegovina 3aCroatia 0aCypriniformes 0aWest Balkans 0aAlpha Taxonomy and new taxa1 aZupančič, Primož1 aBogut, Ivan1 aNaseka, Alexander M.0 tZooKeys.g2012 Apr. 5, v. 180 p.53-80dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.180.21273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245014300161300001800304520068600322592002801008650002201036650001501058650001201073650002201085650001301107650001301120650002301133650002001156650002201176650001601198653001401214653001901228653002001247653002201267700002401289700002101313700002001334700002401354700002401378700002401402700002601426773015701452856007701609852000901686655001201695IND60522490220221117172805.0170410e20150319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052249022DNAL7 a10.5560/znb.2014-41662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhshita, Joji10aDistibylation of Acetylenes with Ph2Sb–SbPh2: Synthesis, Crystal Structures and Phosphorescence Properties of Bis(diphenylstibyl)ethenes  ap. 1181-1187.  aTreatment of tetraphenyldistibine (1) with terminal arylacetylenes, XC₆H₅C≡CH (2a-c, X=H, F, OMe), gave the corresponding anti-addition products (E)-aryl-1,2-bis(diphenylstibyl)ethenes 3a-c in 11 - 17% yields.

This paper summarizes researches on the removal of fluoride from aqueous solutions using newly developed or improved biomass materials and biomass-like organic materials in recent years. These biomass materials are classified into chitosan, microorganisms, lignocellulose plant materials, animal attribute materials, biological carbonized materials and biomass-like organic materials, which are explained and analyzed. By comparing adsorption performance and mechanism of adsorbents for removing fluoride, it is found that carbonizing materials and modifying adsorbents with metal ions are more beneficial to improving adsorption efficiency and the adsorption mechanisms are various. The adsorption capacities are still considerable after regeneration. This paper not only reviews the properties of these materials for fluoride removal, but also focuses on the comparison of materials performance and fluoride removal mechanism.

Peptide sequences were derived from the BIOPEP-UWM database of sensory peptides and amino acids. Descriptors defining the physicochemical properties of amino acids forming the analyzed peptides were study variables. They were derived from ProtScale program and Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank. Finally, PCA was carried out for 51 dipeptides/12 variables, and 51 tripeptides/18 variables using STATISTICA®13.1 software. PCA allowed reducing the input datasets to 4 principal components (PCs) for dipeptides and to 5 PCs for tripeptides. The impact of the following properties on the bitterness of peptides was observed: relatively high molecular weight, bulkiness, increasing number of carbon and hydrogen atoms of amino acids forming the sequences. These properties characterized the N- (negative correlations) and C-terminal residue (positive correlations) of both di- and tripeptides. An additional property affecting peptide bitterness was amino acids’ hydrophobicity. Our results were consistent with scientific reports on structure–bitterness of peptides. Thus, we find PCA a chemometric approach helpful in broadening the knowledge about the function of peptides resulting from their chemical nature.  aPublisher supplied data  a17.610.014-300cWarmia and Mazury University in Olsztyn 3aamino acids 3abitterness 3acarbon 3achemometrics 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adietary protein 3adipeptides 3afood research 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3amagnetism 3amolecular weight 3aprincipal component analysis 3atripeptides1 aHrynkiewicz, Monika1 aBucholska, Justyna1 aDarewicz, Małgorzata1 aMinkiewicz, Piotr0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 Oct., v. 244, no. 10 p.1751-1758dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-018-3087-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04316naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013600161300001800297520236400315592002802679650003502707650003002742650002902772650001302801650001302814650001602827650001302843650001602856650002002872650001502892650001202907650001202919650001802931650002002949650001302969650001402982650001502996650000903011650003603020650001603056650001403072650001603086650001503102650002003117650001603137650001403153650001403167650001003181653001403191653001203205653004303217653001403260700001703274700001403291700002003305700001303325700001703338700001903355700001503374773015403389856007803543852000903621655001203630IND60631099520221118050407.0190219e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063109952DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-137372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodney, R.M.10aEffects of prepartum dietary cation-anion difference and source of vitamin D in dairy cows: Vitamin D, mineral, and bone metabolism  ap. 2519-2543.  aPregnant Holstein cows, 28 nulliparous and 51 parous, were blocked by parity and milk yield and randomly allocated to receive diets that differed in dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD), +130 or −130 mEq/kg, and supplemented with either calcidiol or cholecalciferol at 3 mg/11 kg of dry matter from 255 d of gestation until parturition. Blood was sampled thrice weekly prepartum, and on d 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 postpartum to evaluate effects of the diets on vitamin D, mineral and bone metabolism, and acid-base status. Blood pH and concentrations of minerals, vitamin D metabolites, and bone-related hormones were determined, as were mineral concentrations and losses in urine and colostrum. Supplementing with calcidiol increased plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 3-epi 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 compared with supplementing with cholecalciferol. Cows fed the diet with negative DCAD had lesser concentrations of vitamin D metabolites before and after calving than cows fed the diet with positive DCAD, except for 25-hydroxyvitamin D2. Feeding the diet with negative DCAD induced a compensated metabolic acidosis that attenuated the decline in blood ionized Ca (iCa) and serum total Ca (tCa) around calving, particularly in parous cows, whereas cows fed the diet with positive DCAD and supplemented with calcidiol had the greatest 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations and the lowest iCa and tCa concentrations on d 1 and 2 postpartum. The acidogenic diet or calcidiol markedly increased urinary losses of tCa and tMg, and feeding calcidiol tended to increase colostrum yield and increased losses of tCa and tMg in colostrum. Cows fed the diet with negative DCAD had increased concentrations of serotonin and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen prepartum compared with cows fed the diet with positive DCAD. Concentrations of undercarboxylated and carboxylated osteocalcin and those of adiponectin did not differ with treatment. These results provide evidence that dietary manipulations can induce metabolic adaptations that improve mineral homeostasis with the onset of lactation that might explain some of the improvements observed in health and production when cows are fed diets with negative DCAD or supplemented with calcidiol.  aPublisher supplied data 3a24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3a25-hydroxyergocalciferol 3aHolstein 3aacidosis 3aadiponectin 3ablood pH 3ablood serum 3abone metabolism 3acalcitriol 3acalcium 3acalving 3acarboxylation 3acholecalciferol 3acollagen 3acolostrum 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adietary cation anion difference 3ahomeostasis 3alactation 3ametabolites 3amilk yield 3amineral content 3aosteocalcin 3apregnancy 3aserotonin 3aurine 0acalcidiol 0acalcium 0adietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) 0avitamin D1 aMartinez, N.1 aBlock, E.1 aHernandez, L.L.1 aCeli, P.1 aNelson, C.D.1 aSantos, J.E.P.1 aLean, I.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Mar., v. 101, no. 3 p.2519-2543dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-137373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010400166300001600270500001500286520164500301592002801946650001501974650001001989650003501999650001202034650002402046650001302070650001502083653001302098653001502111653002102126653000902147653002402156653001902180653001402199700002102213700001902234700001802253773011002271856008302381852000902464655001202473IND60553540520221119065753.0180831e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055354052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.12.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNederpelt, I.10aPersistent GnRH receptor activation in pituitary αT3-1 cells analyzed with a label-free technology  ap. 721-727.  a2019-12-06  aThe gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor is a drug target for certain hormone-dependent diseases such as prostate cancer. In this study, we examined the activation profiles of the endogenous ligand, GnRH and a well-known marketed analog, buserelin using a label-free assay in pituitary αT3-1 cells with endogenous GnRH receptor expression. This whole cell impedance-based technology allows for the real-time measurement of morphological cellular changes. Both agonists dose-dependently decreased the impedance as a result of GnRH receptor activation with potencies of 9.3±0.1 (pEC50 value, buserelin) and 7.8±0.06 (pEC50 value, GnRH). Subsequently, GnRH receptor activation was completely abolished with a selective Gαq inhibitor, thereby confirming the Gαq-coupling of the GnRH receptor in pituitary αT3-1 cells. Additionally, we observed continued responses after agonist stimulation of αT3-1 cells indicating long-lasting cellular effects. Wash-out experiments demonstrated that the long-lasting effects induced by GnRH were most likely caused by rebinding since over 70% of the original response was abolished after wash-out. In contrast, a long receptor residence time was responsible for the prolonged effects caused by buserelin, with over 70% of the original response remaining after wash-out.In summary, we validated that impedance-based label-free technology is suited for studying receptor-mediated activation in cell lines endogenously expressing the target of interest. Moreover, this real-time monitoring allows the examination of binding kinetics and its influence on receptor activation at a cellular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3amonitoring 3adrugs 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aligands 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aagonists 3abiosensors 0aWash-out 0aLabel-free 0aBinding kinetics 0aGnRH 0aReceptor activation 0aResidence time 0aimpedance1 aVergroesen, R.D.1 aIJzerman, A.P.1 aHeitman, L.H.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 May 15, v. 79 p.721-727dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.12.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003300145245010800178300001600286506002800302520187900330592002802209506003702237650002602274650002502300650001802325650001102343650001302354650002102367650002302388650001602411650002302427650001302450650001902463650001302482650001802495650001702513700001502530700002402545700002602569700002702595700002202622773013502644856008002779852000902859655001202868IND60784870420221207093752.0150830e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078487042DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha.43.1.96682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAHMADI, Seyed Ahmad KALANTAR10aEffects of Irrigation Deficit and Application of Some Growth Regulators on Defense Mechanisms of Canola  ap. 124-130.  aResource is Open Access  a<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A split-plot experiment arranged in a randomized complete blocks design with three replications was carried out in Safiabad Agricultural Research Center of Dezful in order to investigate the effects of foliar applications of ascorbic acid (AsA), salicylic acid (SA) and methanol (Me), under deficit irrigation conditions, in canola; there were 3 levels of irrigation as the main factor (irrigation after <st1:metricconverter ProductID="70 mm" w:st="on">70 mm</st1:metricconverter> evaporation from the pan as control, cessation of irrigation at the flowering stage and cessation of irrigation at the appearance of siliques) and 10 levels of foliar applications as sub-factor (100, 200 and 300 mg.l<sup>-1</sup>AsA; 100, 200 and 300 µM SA; 10, 20 and 30% (w/v) methanol; and foliar application of distilled water as control). Foliar applications were made during both budding and initiation of flowering stages. Results indicated that antioxidant enzymes showed different responses to deficit irrigation and foliar application treatments. Maximum catalase (CAT) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities were observed under cessation of irrigation at flowering stage and foliar application of 300 µM SA, while ascorbate peroxidase (APX) reached its maximum activity under the same irrigation conditions and foliar application of 300 mg.l<sup>-1</sup>AsA. SA had more influence to increase in CAT and PPO activity under cessation of irrigation at flowering stage. The relative water content (RWC) was also decreased due to the drought stress caused by the cessation of irrigation.

For the prevention and surveillance of cholera, it is crucial to rapidly and precisely detect and identify the etiological causes, such as V. cholerae and/or its toxin. In the present work, we propose the use of a hybrid double biomolecular marker (DBM) microarray containing 16S rRNA-based DNA capture probe to genotypically identify V. cholerae and GM1 pentasaccharide capture probe to phenotypically detect cholera toxin. We employed a simple sample preparation method to directly obtain genomic DNA and secreted cholera toxin as target materials from bacterial cells. By utilizing the constructed DBM microarray and prepared samples, V. cholerae and cholera toxin were detected successfully, selectively, and simultaneously; the DBM microarray was able to analyze the pathogenicity of the identified V. cholerae regardless of whether the bacteria produces toxin. Therefore, our proposed DBM microarray is a new effective platform for identifying bacteria and analyzing bacterial pathogenicity simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aVibrio cholerae 3abacteria 3abiosensors 3acholera 3acholera toxin 3adiarrhea 3aetiology 3afood contamination 3agenetic markers 3amicroarray technology 3amonitoring 3apathogenicity 3aphenotype 0aDouble biomolecular markers 0aDNA probe 0aCarbohydrate probe 0aVibrio cholerae 0aCholera toxin 0aPathogenicity1 aSeo, Jeong Hyun1 aKim, Chang Sup1 aHwang, Byeong Hee1 aCha, Hyung Joon0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 May 15, v. 79 p.398-405dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.12.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008400162300001800246520078700264592002801051650001601079650001101095650001301106650001101119650001001130650001301140650001201153650001301165650001301178653001501191653001001206653001301216653001001229653001201239700002601251773015701277856007701434852000901511655001201520IND60522490420221117172841.0170410e20150319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052249042DNAL7 a10.5560/znb.2014-41682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWade, Casey R.10aCyanide and Azide Anion Complexation by a Bidentate Stibonium-Borane Lewis Acid  ap. 1199-1205.  aOur ongoing interest in the chemistry of polyfunctional Lewis acids has led us to investigate the reaction of the stibonium-borane [o-(Ph₂MeSb)(Mes₂B)C₆H₄]⁺ (1⁺) with cyanide and azide, two toxic anions. Both anions react with 1⁺ to afford the corresponding neutral complexes 1-CN and 1-N₃. Structural and computational studies show that the coordinated anion interacts with both the boron and antimony atoms of the bidentate Lewis acid. While the azide complex features a typical κ²N¹ : N¹ bridging azide ligand, the cyanide complex possesses a cyanoborate moiety whose cyanide interacts side-on with the stibonium center. The Lewis acid-anion interactions observed in these complexes have also been studied computationally using the Natural Bond Orbital method  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aanions 3aantimony 3aazides 3aboron 3acyanides 3aligands 3amoieties 3atoxicity 0aLewis Acid 0aBoron 0aAntimony 0aAzide 0aCyanide1 aGabbaï, François P.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2015 Mar. 19, v. 69, no. 11-12 p.1199-1205dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5560/znb.2014-41683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015200167300001600319520170500335592002802040650001202068650001302080650003302093650001202126650002002138650001102158650003902169650001202208650001302220650002402233650001302257650001302270650002102283650001402304650001802318650002202336650002502358653002102383653004502404653001202449653002902461653001502490700005202505700001402557700001402571700001702585773009702602856008502699852000902784655001202793IND60612941820221120102025.0190131e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061294182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Guo-Jun10aAchieving high-level nitrogen removal in mainstream by coupling anammox with denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation in a membrane biofilm reactor  ap. 196-204.  aTo achieve energy neutral wastewater treatment, mainstream anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) has attracted extensive attention in the past decade. However, the relatively high effluent nitrogen concentration (>10 mg N L-1) remains a significant barrier hindering its practical implementation. A novel technology integrating the anammox and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) reactions in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) was developed in this study to enhance the mainstream anammox process. With the hydraulic retention time (HRT) progressively decreased from 12 to 4 h, the total nitrogen (TN) removal rate increased stepwise from 0.09 to 0.28 kg N m−3 d−1, with an effluent TN concentration below 3.0 mg N L-1 achieved. Mass balance analysis showed that 30–60% of the nitrate produced by the anammox reaction was reduced back to nitrite by DAMO archaea, and the anammox and DAMO bacteria were jointly responsible for nitrite removal with contributions of >90% and <10%, respectively. Additionally, the established MBfR was robust and achieved consistently high effluent quality with >90% TN removal when the influent nitrite to ammonium molar ratio varied in the range of 1.17−1.55. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that anammox bacteria, DAMO bacteria and DAMO archaea jointly dominated the biofilm, and were likely the key contributors to nitrogen removal. This is the first study that a high nitrogen removal rate (>0.2 kg N m−3 d−1) and satisfactory effluent quality (∼3 mg TN L-1) were achieved simultaneously by integrating anammox and DAMO reactions in mainstream wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aammonium 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abiofilm 3adenitrification 3aenergy 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3amethane 3anitrates 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxidation 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3awastewater treatment 0aNitrogen removal 0aDenitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation 0aAnammox 0aMembrane biofilm reactor 0aMainstream1 aLiu, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7673-747X1 aCai, Chen1 aHu, Shihu1 aYuan, Zhiguo0 tWater research.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 131 p.196-204dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002100165245010600186300001600292500001500308520103400323592002801357650001701385650000901402650003901411650001801450650001201468650003901480650000901519650003301528650000901561650002201570650004901592650006601641650001401707650002501721653001501746700002501761700003001786700002101816773012401837852000901961856008301970655001202053IND4414270720221120024800.0181127e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441427072DNAL7 a185557192pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2008.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranger, Nicolas10aIdiopathic polyradiculoneuropathy in a Bengal cat: electrophysiological findings and 1 year follow-up  ap. 603-607.  a2019-12-04  aThis report describes a rapidly progressive loss of motor function in a 16-month-old male neutered Bengal cat, beginning in the pelvic limbs and progressing to involve all limbs and rendering the cat non-ambulatory. The neurological examination revealed flaccid tetraparesis with decreased spinal reflexes but preserved conscious proprioception and skin sensation. Extensive electrophysiological tests were conducted including electromyography, motor and sensory peripheral nerves potential recordings and ‘late’ potentials, defining the electrodiagnostic characteristics of this disease. Based on the electrophysiological findings, a generalised proximal and predominantly axonal neuropathy affecting the ventral (motor) nerve roots was suspected. As no aetiology was identified, this disease was classified as idiopathic polyradiculoneuropathy. Over a year, the cat presented three separate episodes of tetraparesis, each with a spontaneous complete recovery, consistent with the reportedly good prognosis for this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acats 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3amotor neurons 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxdiagnosisxetiology. 2aCats 2aElectromyographyxveterinary 2aMale 2aNeural Conduction 2aParaplegiaxdiagnosisxetiologyxveterinary. 2aPolyradiculoneuropathyxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aPrognosis 2aRecovery of Function 0aneuropathy1 aStalin, Catherine E.1 aBrown, Thomas B.

So FUO is a challenging medical problem. Clinical evaluation remains the basis of the initial evaluation of the patient with FUO.

A molecular-level understanding of the interactions between Sb(III) and organic ligands at the solid-liquid interface is of paramount importance in deciphering the effect of these organic ligands. Herein, we identified and characterized Sb(III)-organic ligand complexes in solution and at the goethite-water interface using complementary techniques. The FT-ICR MS, XANES, and DFT calculations show that organic ligands bind Sb(III) through nucleophilic functional groups, such as –COO–, –OH and –HS. The formation of surface ternary Sb(III)-bridging complexes retarded the Sb(III) surface precipitation starting from 3.8 mg-Sb/L to a much higher level at 8.3–13.5 mg-Sb/L. The strong bond between Sb(III) and organic ligands is the key factor to inhibit Sb(III) adsorption, surface precipitation and oxidation under sunlight irradiation. Our results showed the chemical basis for the multifaceted functions of organic ligands in stabilizing trace metalloids such as Sb(III) in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aantimony 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental fate 3airradiation 3aligands 3aliquid-solid interface 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3asolar radiation 0aAntimonite 0aOrganic ligands 0aComplexation structure 0aAdsorption 0aSurface precipitation1 aYin, Zhipeng1 aWang, Liying1 aYan, Li1 aJing, Chuanyong0 tChemosphere.g2022 Aug., v. 301 p.134682-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1346823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245005800165300001600223500001400239520124500253592002801498650001701526650001201543650001601555650001501571650001401586650000901600650001701609650002101626650001801647650001601665650001201681650001001693650001001703650001901713650001501732650001301747700001901760773009501779856007801874852000901952655001201961IND60693340820221120065129.0200506e20091228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069334082DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.31.1712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Marinis, Anna10aMammalian fauna of the Temessos National Park, Turkey  ap. 221-228.  aNAL-light  aThe National Park of Termessos, Southern Turkey, is one of the Turkey&rsquo;s biggest national park not only with its archeological richness but also with its great natural wild life. We provided a checklist of the mammalian fauna of the park on the base of direct observations, interviews and a comparative analysis of the available literature. Sixteen species have been reported in the park. Hedgehogs, hares, porcupines and Persian squirrels and, among flying mammals, Egyptian rousette and Mouse-eared bat have been recorded. Carnivores are represented by Golden jackal, Wolf, Red fox, Stone marten, Badger, Otter and Wild cat. Very recently (2005) the presence of the Caracal in the park has been confirmed, whereas no signs of the presence of the Lynx were detected. The last Anatolian leopards seems to have definitively disappeared from the region. The occurrence in the area of striped hyaenas and brown bears is documented up to a few decades ago. The Park is regarded as the only geographical range in the whole world where the European or Common fallow deer has persisted as a native form. Other ungulates too, such as Wild goat and Wild boar are dispersed within the boundary of the park. Management implications are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis aureus 3aCaracal 3aCervus dama 3aChiroptera 3aHyaenidae 3aLynx 3aMartes foina 3aTurkey (country) 3aVulpes vulpes 3aarchaeology 3abadgers 3afauna 3agoats 3anational parks 3awild boars 3awildlife1 aMasseti, Marco0 tZooKeys.g2009 Dec. 28, v. 31 p.221-228dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.31.1713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009500164300001800259520158500277592002801862650001901890650001701909650001301926650001601939650001001955650001201965650002701977650001602004650001702020650002102037650000902058650002202067650001602089650001202105650002202117650002002139650001802159650001902177653002702196653001202223653001202235653001602247653002802263700002302291700001502314700001702329700001702346700001302363700001902376700001702395700001502412700001602427700001702443700001802460700001702478700001702495773016202512856008102674852000902755655001202764IND60722487020221119220659.0211009e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072248702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2020.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chuanji10aMutation of the PHYTOENE DESATURASE 3 gene causes yellowish-white petals in Brassica napus  ap. 1124-1134.  aOilseed rape (Brassica napus) with yellow flowers is an attractive ornamental landscape plant during the flowering period, and the development of different petal colors has become a breeding objective. Although yellowish flower color is a common variant observed in field-grown oilseed rape, the genetics behind this variation remains unclear. We obtained a yellowish-white flower (ywf) mutant from Zhongshuang 9 (ZS9) by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis (EMS) treatment. Compared with ZS9, ywf exhibited a lower carotenoid content with a reduced and defective chromoplast ultrastructure in the petals. Genetic analysis revealed that the yellowish-white trait was controlled by a single recessive gene. Using bulked-segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-seq) and kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP), we performed map-based cloning of the ywf locus on chromosome A08 and found that ywf harbored a C-to-T substitution in the coding region, resulting in a premature translation termination. YWF, encoding phytoene desaturase 3 (PDS3), was highly expressed in oilseed rape petals and involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. Pathway enrichment analysis of the transcriptome profiles from ZS9 and ywf indicated the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway to be highly enriched. Further analyses of differentially expressed genes and carotenoid components revealed that the truncated BnaA08.PDS3 resulted in decreased carotenoid biosynthesis in the mutant. These results contribute to an understanding of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and manipulation of flower-color variation in B. napus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3acorolla 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3aexhibitions 3aflower color 3agenetic analysis 3aloci 3amolecular cloning 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aornamental plants 3arecessive genes 3atranscriptome 3aultrastructure 0aYellowish-white flower 0aBSA-seq 0aRNA-seq 0aBnaA08.PDS3 0aCarotenoid biosynthesis1 aSafdar, Luqman Bin1 aXie, Meili1 aShi, Meijuan1 aDong, Zhixue1 aYang, Li1 aCheng, Xiaohui1 aLiu, Yueying1 aBai, Zetao1 aXiang, Yang1 aTong, Chaobo1 aHuang, Junyan1 aLiu, Lijiang1 aLiu, Shengyi0 tcrop journal.g2021 Oct., v. 9, no. 5 p.1124-1134dElsevier B.V.aCrop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop SciencewJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2020.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011000164300001800274520155700292592002801849650001601877650002201893650001701915650001701932650001801949650001001967650002601977650001202003650001702015650001202032650002402044650001002068650001602078650001202094650001302106650001102119650002602130650001702156650000902173650001602182650001802198650001102216653004702227653002702274653001902301653001602320653002702336700001602363700001702379700001702396773016202413856008102575852000902656655001202665IND60734971720221121003357.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073497172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2021.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Weidan10aRice Glucose 6-Phosphate/Phosphate Translocator 1 is required for tapetum function and pollen development  ap. 1278-1290.  aIn plants, non-green plastids in heterotrophic tissues are sites for starch and fatty acids biosynthesis, which are essential for plant development and reproduction. Distinct from chloroplasts, the metabolites for these processes in non-green plastids have to be imported through specific transporters. Glucose 6-Phosphate/Phosphate Translocator 1 is required for the uptake of cytosolic Glucose 6-Phosphate into non-green plastids. In Arabidopsis, GPT1 has been demonstrated to play essential roles in male, female gametophyte and embryo development. However, the roles of GPTs in other species are yet largely unknown. Here, we reported that rice OsGPT1 is indispensable for normal tapetal degeneration and pollen exine formation during anther and pollen development. OsGPT1 is localized in the plastid and distributed in the anther wall layers and late-stage pollen grains. Different from the gametic defects caused by mutation in AtGPT1, disruption of OsGPT1 does not affect male and female gamete transmission as well as embryo development. On the contrary, osgpt1 mutant exhibits delayed tapetum degeneration, decreased Ubisch bodies formation and thinner pollen exine, leading to pollen abortion at the mature stage. Furthermore, the expression of several genes involved in tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and sporopollenin formation is decreased in osgpt1. Our study suggests that OsGPT1 coordinates the development of anther sporophytic tissues and the male gametophyte by integrating carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism in the plastid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabortion (plants) 3abiosynthesis 3achloroplasts 3aembryogenesis 3aexine 3afatty acid metabolism 3afemales 3agametophytes 3aglucose 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3amales 3ametabolites 3amutants 3amutation 3apollen 3aprogrammed cell death 3areproduction 3arice 3asporophytes 3asporopollenin 3astarch 0aGlucose-6-Phosphate/Phosphate Translocator 0aHeterotrophic plastids 0aMale fertility 0aTapetal PCD 0aPollen exine formation1 aLi, Huanjun1 aXue, Feiyang1 aLiang, Wanqi0 tcrop journal.g2021 Dec., v. 9, no. 6 p.1278-1290dElsevier B.V.aCrop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop SciencewJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2021.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012800166300001600294520138100310592002801691650001101719650001101730650002801741650002201769650001401791650001301805650001501818650002201833653002501855653001401880653003501894653001401929653003101943700001601974700001901990700001602009700001802025773012502043856008302168852000902251655001202260IND60719314220221117231745.0210820e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071931422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.11.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wenjuan10aTemplate-free fabrication of 1D core-shell MoO2@MoS2/nitrogen-doped carbon nanorods for enhanced lithium/sodium-ion storage  ap. 804-812.  aA universal anode material of 1D core-shell MoO₂@MoS₂/nitrogen-doped carbon (MoO₂@MoS₂/NC) nanorods has been elaborately synthesized via a facile fabrication route for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), in which MoO₂ core not only acts as a conductive backbone for efficient electron transport, but creates structural disorders in MoS₂ nanosheets to prevent aggregation and expose more active sites for alkali-ions. Meanwhile, the MoO₂ core is tightly encapsulated by the parallelly aligned MoS₂ nanosheets to constrain the size of crystals, which greatly shortens the ionic diffusion path and accelerates diffusion rate, thus ensuring fast reaction kinetics. Additionally, the resilient and conductive N-doped carbon matrix in the hybrid could maintain the structural integrity and enhance the electrical conductivity of the electrodes, improving the rate capability and life span. The flexible 1D nanorods could contract freely during the charge/discharge process, further assuring the structural stability of the electrodes. Benefiting from the above-mentioned advantages, the MoO₂@MoS₂/NC electrodes still remains a specific capacity of 583.5 mA h g⁻¹ after 1500 cycles at a high current density up to 10 A g⁻¹ in LIBs, and a capacity of 419.8 mA h g⁻¹ is steadily kept over 800 cycles at 2 A g⁻¹ in SIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectron transfer 3alongevity 3ananorods 3ananosheets 3areaction kinetics 0aCore-shell structure 0aMoO2@MoS2 0aNitrogen-doped carbon nanorods 0aBatteries 0aElectrochemical properties1 aHan, Lijing1 aLiu, Xingjiang1 aHong, Lvyin1 aWei, Mingdeng0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 588 p.804-812dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.11.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245016700171520132500338592002801663650003701691650001801728650001301746650001501759650001801774650001901792650001601811650001001827650001901837650001901856650002501875653004401900653001401944653002201958653002301980653003902003700001702042700001302059700001702072700001502089700001802104700001702122700001502139700002002154700005602174773009102230856009002321852000902411655001202420IND60775469720221123012139.0220606e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077546972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1346842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhihong10aStep-doped disulfide vacancies and functional groups synergistically enhance photocatalytic activity of S-scheme Cu3SnS4/L-BiOBr towards ciprofloxacin degradation  aDevelopment of efficient photocatalysts for efficient recalcitrant organic pollutants degradation is of great significance. Herein, the step-doped disulfide vacancies S-scheme Cu₃SnS₄/L-BiOBr (CTS/L-BiOBr) heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared for ciprofloxacin (CIP) degradation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis, band structure and dominant radicals’ identification together verified that the transfer of photogenerated carriers conformed to the S-scheme mechanism. Benefited from the interfacial electric field (IEF) of the S-scheme heterojunction and incorporation of L-cysteine with introducing S-vacancies and surface functional groups (-NH₂, -COO⁻), photogenerated charges generation and separation of the CTS/L-BiOBr₍₁₀₎ were greatly improved. With ·OH and h⁺ as dominant reactive species, CIP removal reached 93% using CTS/L-BiOBr₍₁₀₎ within 180 min of visible light irradiation, which was 3.5 times and 2.6 times of pristine Cu₃SnS₄ and L-BiOBr, respectively. Moreover, possible CIP degradation pathways were proposed and the degradation intermediates ecotoxicity were evaluated. This study could provide reference for designing efficient S-scheme photocatalysts for recalcitrant wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aciprofloxacin 3acysteine 3adisulfides 3aecotoxicology 3aelectric field 3airradiation 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3awastewater treatment 0aS-scheme Cu3SnS4/L-BiOBr heterojunction 0aS-vacancy 0aFunctional groups 0aCarriers' transfer 0aCiprofloxacin degradation pathways1 aLan, Danquan1 aLi, Zuji1 aSun, Jiangli1 aChen, Shuo1 aYang, Jinhang1 aWei, Jingwen1 aYu, Zebing1 aWang, Shuangfei1 aHou, Yanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3830-28510 tChemosphere.g2022 Aug., v. 301 p.134684-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1346843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003600113040001800149100002200167245009100189300001000280500000900290520118000299592002801479650002201507650001301529650001801542650002201560650002001582650002101602650003001623650002801653650002401681650001501705650001801720650002301738650002201761651001001783700002201793700002201815773010901837852000901946856011201955856008302067961001302150655001202163IND4412260620221118022143.0191122e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441226062DNAL7 a10113/211872hdl7 a10.1094/CM-2008-0912-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalloran, John M.14aThe Economic Impacts of Disease Suppressive Rotations in Maine Potato Cropping Systems  ap. 0.  aepub  aSoil borne diseases can greatly reduce marketable yields and are a major concern to Maine potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) producers. Control of these organisms is difficult as they can persist in the soil for several years and symptoms typically worsen each year. Depending on the specific pathogen, different mechanisms for moderating soil borne disease can be employed, such as breaking the host-pathogen cycle, stimulating beneficial microbial activity, and direct inhibition of the pathogens. Current research at the USDA-ARS New England Plant, Soil, and Water Laboratory is investigating the effect of rotation crops and rotation sequences on the incidence and severity of soil-borne diseases in the following potato crop. These results (incidence, severity, and potato yield) are incorporated into an economic simulation model to determine the impact of rotations on profitability, level of income risk, and probability of economic loss for different rotation sequences and rotation lengths. The results show that several rotation sequences can increase profitability and reduce economic risk when compared to continuous potato or to the standard barley-potato rotations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3acrop rotation 3acropping sequence 3adisease control 3acultural control 3afungal diseases of plants 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3asoil-borne diseases 3acrop yield 3aprofitability 3aeconometric models 3asimulation models 3aMaine1 aLarkin, Robert P.1 aHoneycutt, Wayne,0 tCrop management.g2008 Sept., v. 7, no. 1 p.0-0dPlant Management NetworkwJournal:6161x1543-78337nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/211873Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CM-2008-0912-01-RS3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02702naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007100147245008200218300001800300520117700318592002801495596011001523650003401633650002101667650002501688650001101713650002001724650001101744650001801755650001801773650001801791650001901809650002101828650001501849650001601864650001801880650001401898650001001912650001201922650001101934700006601945773014302011856008102154852000902235655001202244IND60611676820221120084412.0180904e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061167682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-018-3094-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez Madrera, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3726-454X10aCharacterization of apple seeds and their oils from the cider-making industry  ap. 1821-1827.  aApple seeds and their oils from an agro-food waste, derived from the cider industry protected by the Designation of Origin “Sidra de Asturias”, were chemically characterized. The average oil yield was 19.7%. The major fatty acids in apple seed oils are unsaturated fatty acids (90.3 ± 0.3%) belonging to the ω-3, ω-6 and ω-9 series (linolenic acid, 1.2 ± 0.1%; linoleic acid, 55.3 ± 1.2%; oleic acid, 33.4 ± 0.8%). Oils also showed an important antioxidant activity and high levels of tocopherols (total tocopherols 1280 ± 104.8 mg/kg oil) with β-tocopherol (794.5 ± 62.2 mg/kg oil) being most abundant in all cases followed by α-tocopherol (439.2 ± 34.5 mg/kg oil) and these compounds correlate with DPPH radical activity (r = 0.937). In the defatted apple seeds, protein (37.5 ± 1.8%) and fibre (20.3 ± 0.4%) were the major nutritional components detected and other interesting constituents, such as extractable polyphenols and hydrolysable tannins, were also relevant.

The coconut flour level up to 40% produced the highest score on biscuit flavor, biscuit odor, crumbliness, hardness, and overall acceptance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3acoconuts 3aconsumer acceptance 3aculinary science 3adietary fiber 3aflavor 3aflour 3aodors 3aroughness 3atechnology 3atexture 3awater activity 3awater content 0aCoconut flour 0abiscuit product 0afiber1 aRoskhrua, Piyanuch1 aAttiwittayaporn, Suriya0 tJournal of culinary science & technology.g2022 May 04, v. 20, no. 3 p.278-292dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000102x1542-80447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15428052.2021.19783623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014400169300001600313520100800329536010401337592002801441596011001469650001401579650001701593650002501610650003001635650001101665650001801676650001501694650001501709650001701724650001501741651001101756653001501767653001901782653002401801653002001825653001401845773011001859856008501969852000902054655001202063IND60691462720221121035016.0200430e20200314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069146272DNAL7 a10.1080/15528014.2019.16828852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yi-Chieh10aSustainable food, ethical consumption and responsible innovation: insights from the slow food and “low carbon food” movements in Taiwan  ap. 155-172.  aThis paper examines two food initiatives in Taiwan that address broad social concerns that have informed changes in activists’ perceptions of food citizenship in relation to globalization. Drawing on participant observation and in-depth interviews with stakeholders in two food movements, this ethnographic study contextualizes the motivations and meaning of “local” from the perspectives of social activists and food businesses in Taiwan. It investigates the strategies by which stakeholders engage consumers with the concept of local food as well as the limitations of that engagement, situating the concept of “local food” within sustainable consumption and local traditions. The findings illuminate how activists leverage global discourses on food movements and adapt them to local settings, blending with the vernaculars of local beliefs and traditional values. The study also discusses the potential and limits of this strategy and the use of new media technology in local food activism.  aThis work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST103-2511-S-004-010].  aPublisher supplied data  aMOST103-2511-S-004-010cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663 3aactivists 3aanthropology 3abusiness enterprises 3acommunications technology 3aethics 3aglobalization 3ainterviews 3amotivation 3astakeholders 3atraditions 3aTaiwan 0aLocal food 0asustainability 0aethical consumption 0alow-carbon food 0aslow food0 tFood, culture, & society.g2020 Mar. 14, v. 23, no. 2 p.155-172dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15528014.2019.16828853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245012800186300001600314520116600330592002801496650002201524650001301546650001401559650000901573650002001582650001601602650001801618650001101636650002601647650004301673650001401716650005201730650001101782700001701793700001301810700001501823700001601838700001901854700001401873700001701887773010901904856008102013852000902094655001202103IND50089389620221120120540.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008938962DNAL7 a246434692pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-014-9938-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jianying10aDownregulation of TLR4 and 7 mRNA Expression Levels in Broiler’s Spleen Caused by Diets Supplemented with Nickel Chloride  ap. 353-358.  aToll-like receptors (TLRs) are important immune receptors in discriminating self from nonself and in initiating the innate and adaptive immune response. TLR4 and TLR7 have been proven to be highly expressed in chicken’s spleen. Thus, this study was to evaluate the TLR4 and TLR7 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels in the spleen of broilers fed diets supplemented with nickel chloride (NiCl₂) using the methods of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Two hundred forty-one-day-old avian broilers were equally divided into 4 groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same basal diet supplemented with 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg of NiCl₂for 42 days. Results showed that TLR4 and TLR7 mRNA expression levels in the spleen were lower (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg groups than those in the control group. It was concluded that dietary NiCl₂in excess of 300 mg/kg could lower TLR4 and TLR7 mRNA expression levels in the spleen of broilers, implying that NiCl₂could impair the innate and adaptive immunity in spleen by injuring immunocytes and/or decreasing the content of cytokines through TLRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive immunity 3achickens 3acytokines 3adiet 3agene expression 3aimmunocytes 3amessenger RNA 3anickel 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen1 aCui, Hengmin1 aPeng, Xi1 aFang, Jing1 aZuo, Zhicai1 aDeng, Junliang1 aWang, Xun1 aWu, Bangyuan0 tBiological trace element research.g2014 June, v. 158, no. 3 p.353-358dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-014-9938-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300001600288520137500304592002801679650001901707650001901726650001001745650001401755650001101769650001501780650003101795650001101826650001001837650001101847650001601858650001801874650001401892651001001906653001001916653002201926653001601948653002101964700001401985700001701999700001602016700001302032773014402045856007402189852000902263655001202272IND60679847220221118233042.0200102e20151026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067984722DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tov3132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFornasiero, D.10aRelative Infestation Level and Sensitivity of Grapevine Cultivars to the Leafhopper Empoasca vitis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae)  ap. 416-425.  aThe leafhopper Empoasca vitis (Göthe) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) feeds on veins of grapevine leaves, mainly on the phloem, causing physiological injury, color change and drying of leaf margins, yield and sugar content reduction. The relative infestation level (i.e., the probability that a plant is attacked by herbivores) of E. vitis on different grapevine cultivars and their sensitivity (i.e., the incidence of symptoms expression in response to herbivore feeding or other stimuli) to this pest were studied over four years in two vineyards located in northeastern Italy. Some cultivars (e.g., Carménère and Sauvignon Blanc) were usually more infested than others (e.g., Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Gris), although some differences were observed among years and sites. The sensitivity varied among cultivars, i.e., some of them showed more symptoms than expected on the basis of infestation levels (e.g., Carménère and Merlot), in contrast with others (e.g., Rhine Riesling and Chardonnay). Information obtained can be used within the framework of integrated pest management in vineyards. Action thresholds should differ on the basis of sensitivity. Sampling must first be carried out on the most susceptible cultivar and, if the action threshold is exceeded, it should be extended to the remaining cultivars based on their decreasing relative infestation level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmpoasca vitis 3aVitis vinifera 3acolor 3acultivars 3adrying 3aherbivores 3aintegrated pest management 3aleaves 3apests 3aphloem 3aprobability 3asugar content 3avineyards 3aItaly 0agrape 0ainfestation level 0asensitivity 0aaction threshold1 aPavan, F.1 aPozzebon, A.1 aPicotti, P.1 aDuso, C.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Oct. 26, v. 109, no. 1 p.416-425dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov3133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010100168500001900269520151400288592002801802650001101830650001901841650001601860650002301876650001101899650002401910651001001934653002301944653002201967653003601989653002102025653002402046700001902070773011802089856008802207852000902295655001202304IND60724159720221121223235.0210820e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072415972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1447072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ruirui10aAssessing market efficiency and liquidity: Evidence from China's emissions trading scheme pilots  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDifferent from the previous studies that evaluated the degrees of carbon market efficiency as constant, the novelty of this work is to capture degrees of market efficiency that are time-varying over time and its static and dynamic relationship with liquidity in China's five emissions trading system (ETS) pilots (Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hubei) from January 2017 to June 2019. For this purpose, this work employs the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity in mean (GARCH(1,1)-M) model with state space time-varying parameter (Kalman filter), Modified Amihud illiquidity ratio, fixed effect variable intercept panel regression model and panel impulse response analysis. The empirical results are as follows: (1) Shenzhen pilot is the best performer for the market efficiency, followed by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Hubei; although the other four except the Shenzhen pilot are inconsistent with weak-form efficiency, the market efficiency of Beijing pilot has improved and the Hubei pilot has the lowest market efficiency; (2) there are the positively long-term equilibrium relationship between market efficiency and market liquidity of pilots; and (3) market liquidity can positively affect the market efficiency of pilots lasting three months. These findings suggest that the market participation ability, linkages between carbon markets, speculation of low market efficiency and carbon derivatives tools can be considered by unified China's national carbon market.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3aenvironment 3aheteroskedasticity 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aChina 0aChina's ETS pilots 0aMarket efficiency 0aGARCH(1,1)-M with Kalman filter 0aMarket liquidity 0aPanel data analysis1 aQin, Zhongfeng0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 May 15, v. 769 p.144707-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1447073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245017700157300002000334520068700354592002801041650001301069650000901082650001801091650001901109650001601128700001501144700001601159700001401175700001801189700001701207773012401224856007401348852000901422655001201431IND60664576420221120033843.0190912e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066457642DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42631a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Qifeng10aSynthesis, characterization and ethylene polymerization behavior of binuclear iron complexes bearing N,N′-bis(1-(6-(1-(arylimino)ethyl) pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene)benzidines  ap. 26184-26193.  aA series of N,N′-bis(1-(6-(1-(arylimino)ethyl)pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene)benzidines and the bi-metallic iron complexes thereof have been synthesized and fully characterized.

Reliability of wind turbine is crucial in extracting the maximum amount of energy from the wind. Early fault detection, isolation and successful controller reconfiguration can considerably increase the performance in faulty conditions and prevent failures in the system. Along the same vein, fault diagnosis of wind turbine systems has received much attention in recent years. Fault detection methods based on time and frequency domain signal analysis without explicit mathematical model are state-of-the-art in complex processes. This paper investigates data-driven fault detection and isolation (FDI) design based on fusion of several classifiers for a wind turbine benchmark -second challenge. The proposed method is robust against different operational conditions and measurement errors. In fact, we develop a new data-driven FDI scheme, via analytical redundancy. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers are implemented in parallel, and fused together. Feature extraction from measurement signals enriches the information about wind turbine condition and improves decision making of proposed FDI scheme. Simulation results and Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aClassification 0aFault detection and isolation 0aFeature extraction 0aWind turbine1 aSalmasi, Farzad R.1 aAraabi, Babak N.0 tRenewable energy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013100158300001600289520151800305592002801823650001601851650002401867650003301891650001101924650001501935650002401950650001601974650001001990650002302000650001102023650001802034650000902052650001302061650002102074651000902095651001202104653001202116700001802128700001902146773014402165856007402309852000902383655001202392IND60679847320221118232957.0200102e20151028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067984732DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tov3142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlount, J.

Since its discovery in Georgia in 2009, its distribution has increased to 13 southern and eastern states. In the United States, M. cribraria is bivoltine and has two primary developmental hosts, kudzu and soybean. Here, we evaluated the yield response of soybean to M. cribraria feeding injury in relation to planting date and soybean maturity group. The study contained four replicated trials in Griffin, Tifton, and Midville, GA, in 2012 and 2013. Four planting dates from April to July, served as the whole plot of a split-plot design with maturity group five and seven soybean and insecticide (lambda-cyhalothrin) randomized within planting date. Egg masses, nymphs, and adults were enumerated weekly to biweekly until soybean reached maturity. Two generations were observed in April and May plantings, but only one generation was evident in June and July soybean plantings. Insecticide-protected plots had consistently higher yields than unprotected plots. Grain yield was greatest in the May planting and lowest in the July planting. Season-long feeding by M. cribraria reduced grain yield in April, May, and June plantings but not in the July planting. Maturity group and planting date had significant effects on yield components in most comparisons.

Initially, glucose molecules are loaded into the pores of the MSNs, the pores are then capped with Pb²⁺-specific DNAzymes. Upon target introduction, the molecular gates open, resulting in release of the cargo from the pores. The released glucose can be quantitatively monitored using a portable PGM. Under optimal conditions, the as-prepared sensing platform presents good analytical properties for the determination of the target Pb²⁺ ions, and allows detection of Pb²⁺ at concentrations as low as 1.0 pM. Importantly, the portable sensing platform has the advantages of simple, on-site, user-friendly and low-cost assessment and has tremendous potential for quantitative detection of non-glucose targets by the public.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglucose 3aheavy metals 3alead 3ametal ions 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3aporous media 3asilica1 aZhuang, Junyang1 aLai, Wenqiang1 aQue, Xiaohua1 aLu, Minghua1 aTang, Dianping0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2013 Oct. 23, v. 1, no. 44 p.6123-6128dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21155j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245011400214300001600328520168500344592002802029650001802057650001002075650002102085650001302106650001402119650001902133650001102152650001502163650002802178650002602206650001102232650002602243650001402269650001002283650001602293653002102309653001502330653001702345653002202362653001702384653002602401700002502427700005802452700002802510700003302538700003702571700002802608700002602636700003002662700003102692773011702723856008602840852000902926655001202935IND60612089320221118132828.0190705e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061208932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.05.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanis, Luiz Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7600-753010aPiper ovatum (Piperaceae) extract/starch-cellulose films to control Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae  ap. 148-155.  aMost of the botanical extract which showed larvicidal properties against Aedes aegypti present low residual activity. Thus, we included Piper ovatum extract in a hydrophilic, biodegradable polymeric base to increase the time of action of these larvicides. Standardized extract of P. ovatum roots was tested against Ae. aegypti larvae in order to investigate some external morphological modification in the larvae body and histological effects in their midgut. Two films called FSEPO5 and FSEPO12 containing 5 and 12% of P. ovatum extract were incorporated into biodegradable starch-cellulose films. Loss of weight and mechanical properties were evaluated. The larvae mortality was investigated through immersion of different pieces with known width into the plastic flask containing 200 mL of water and Ae. aegypti larvae. After 48 h of exposure, the mortality was checked and new larvae were added. The experiment was conducted until no more larvae mortality was observed. The effect of the surface area-to-volume ratio over larval mortality was assessed as well. The LC50 and LC99 of P. ovatum extracts were 2.57 ppm and 3.80 ppm, respectively. The inclusion of the extract in to the film decrease the elastic modulus, increase the elongation at break and promote higher erosion. The residual activity of the films was achieved for more than 700 h (29 days). The increase in surface-to-volume ratio of the film increased the larvicidal activity. Starch-cellulose films containing standardized extract of P. ovatum is a suitable alternative to prevent mosquito breeding in places with potential water accumulation. They can provide industrial larvicide in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aPiper 3abiodegradability 3abreeding 3ahistology 3ahydrophilicity 3alarvae 3alarvicides 3alethal concentration 50 3amechanical properties 3amidgut 3amodulus of elasticity 3amortality 3aroots 3aweight loss 0aStarch-cellulose 0aLarvicidal 0aPiper ovatum 0aResidual activity 0aSlow release 0aMechanical properties1 aRabelo, Bruna Daniel1 aMoterle, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9383-42951 aCustódio, Kauê Muller1 ade Oliveira, Joice Guilherme1 ade Lemos, Alessandra Bittencourt1 ada Silva, Onilda Santos1 aZepon, Karine Modolon1 aMagnago, Rachel Faverzani1 aProphiro, Josiane Somariva0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 122 p.148-155dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.05.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013200167300001600299520116100315592002801476650004401504650002201548650001201570650001601582650002201598650002501620650001801645650001501663650002801678650001801706650001901724650004401743650003301787650001401820653002801834653003101862653001501893653002601908700005301934700001801987700001402005700001702019700001602036773011702052856008602169852000902255655001202264IND60612089420221118132830.0190705e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061208942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xiaohui10aEffects of ionic liquid/water mixture pretreatment on the composition, the structure and the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stalk  ap. 142-147.  aRecently, pretreatment of lignocellulose by ionic liquids have attracted considerable attention due to their excellent pretreatment effects and their environmental sustainable properties. However, because of the high cost and viscosity, their industrial application are restricted. In this study, water was introduced to 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4) to reduce both the viscosity and the cost of using pure ionic liquid. The [Bmim]BF4/water system was proved to be effective for improving the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stalk, and the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency (81.68%) obtained was much higher than that found with the pure ionic liquid under the same conditions (14.46%). The findings obtained from the characterization studies were in accordance with the enhancement of the hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic biomass. After pretreated by [Bmim]BF4-H2O, the formation of a porous structure, destruction of the lignin-polysaccharide interactions, and deacetylation of hemicellulose were achieved as suggested by SEM, FTIR and 13C NMR, respectively, but the crystalline structure was not damaged indicated by XRD results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiomass 3acorn stover 3acrystal structure 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3aindustrial applications 3aionic liquids 3alignocellulose 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aviscosity 0aEnzymatic digestibility 0aIonic liquid/water mixture 0aCorn stalk 0aHydrolysis efficiency1 aCheng, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6249-70031 aGu, Zhengbiao1 aHong, Yan1 aLi, Zhaofeng1 aLi, Caiming0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 122 p.142-147dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010700173300001600280520154800296592002801844650002801872650001501900650001201915650001801927650001401945650002601959650002701985650001002012650002102022650001702043650000902060650002002069650001302089650002402102650001302126650001302139650002102152650000902173653002602182653001702208653001502225653001402240653002402254700002702278700002102305700002802326700002002354773010902374856008602483852000902569655001202578IND60581116820221120154527.0190319e20171118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058111682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.07.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabadán, Adrián10aSuitability of Spanish almond cultivars for the industrial production of almond oil and defatted flour  ap. 539-546.  aThe combined evaluation of almond oils and flours obtained by cold pressing provides a comprehensive approach about the nutritional and industrial interest of Spanish almond cultivars for these production purposes. Almonds of ten different cultivars were collected from the same plot to remove the environmental and agricultural management effects on almond chemical traits. Results show that oil yield was similar for all the selected cultivars, however, obtained oils showed significant differences in their fatty acid profile, including essential fatty acids of main nutritional interest. According to the triglyceride profile, significant differences were found for main tri-unsaturated triglycerides (mainly, OOO and OLL) but not for OLO. The concentration of minor components with health promoting properties also was different in the oil obtained from different cultivars. For the selection of the optimal cultivar for oil production, three parameters are proposed as main parameters to consider: iodine value, oxidative stability and oil yield. According to these parameters, the varieties Guara, Ferragnes and Belona would be the most appropriate cultivars for almond oil production. Regarding almond flours obtained, large differences were found in the content of available carbohydrates (276.4–156.1g/kg) and proteins (581.3–379.4g/kg) resulting in flours with different potential uses. The total mineral content in flours and the presence of specific minerals (as Fe and Zn) also showed significant differences among cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3aalmond oil 3aalmonds 3acarbohydrates 3acultivars 3aessential fatty acids 3afatty acid composition 3aflour 3ahealth promotion 3aiodine value 3airon 3amineral content 3aminerals 3aoxidative stability 3apressing 3aproteins 3atriacylglycerols 3azinc 0aIndustrial production 0aAlmond flour 0aAlmond oil 0aCultivars 0aOxidative stability1 aÁlvarez-Ortí, Manuel1 aGómez, Ricardo,1 aPardo-Giménez, Arturo,1 aPardo, José E.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2017 Nov. 18, v. 225 p.539-546dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2017.07.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012700161520155700288592002801845650001901873650001601892650001401908650001401922650001601936650001801952650002001970650001901990650002302009650001602032650001902048650002102067650001002088700002602098700002002124700002902144773012102173856007902294852000902373655001202382IND60784180920221122180013.0220726e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078418092DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111418532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdi, Neila 10aSalicylic Acid Improves Growth and Physiological Attributes and Salt Tolerance Differentially in Two Bread Wheat Cultivars  aAbiotic constraints such as salinity stress reduce cereal production. Salicylic acid is an elicitor of abiotic stress tolerance in plants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of salicylic acid on two bread wheat cultivars (SST806 and PAN3497) grown under salt stress (100 and 200 mM NaCl) in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM salicylic acid. The highest salt concentration (200 mM), in both PAN3497 and SST806, increased the days to germination and reduced the coleoptile and radicle dry weights. The shoot dry weight was reduced by 75 and 39%, root dry weight by 73 and 37%, spike number of both by 50%, spike weight by 73 and 54%, grain number by 62 and 15%, grain weight per spike by 80 and 45%, and 1000 grain weight by 9 and 29% for 200 and 100 mM NaCl, respectively. Salicylic acid in combination with 100 mM and 200 mM NaCl increased the shoot, root, and yield attributes. Salicylic acid increased the grain protein content, especially at 200 mM NaCl, and the increase was higher in SST806 than PAN3497. The macro-mineral concentration was markedly increased by an increase of NaCl. This was further increased by salicylic acid treatment for both SST806 and PAN3497. Regarding micro-minerals, Na was increased more than the other minerals in both cultivars. Mn, Zn, Fe, and Cu were increased under 100 mM and 200 Mm of salt, and salicylic acid application increased these elements further in both cultivars. These results suggested that salicylic acid application improved the salt tolerance of these two bread wheat cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3acoleoptiles 3acultivars 3aelicitors 3agermination 3agrain protein 3aprotein content 3asalicylic acid 3asalt concentration 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3astress tolerance 3awheat1 aVan Biljon, Angeline 1 aSteyn, Chrisna 1 aLabuschagne, Maryke Tine0 tPlants.g2022 July 15, v. 11, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111418533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245018800175300001600363520150600379592002801885650002401913650001201937650000901949650001401958650001501972650001501987650001902002650001602021650001002037650001202047650001602059650000902075650001402084650001802098653001402116653001502130653000902145653001002154653001302164700002102177700002702198700002502225773014302250856008402393852000902477655001202486IND60598556020221119022431.0190426e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059855602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anres.2018.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGongruttananun, Nirat10aEffects of a short-term molt using cassava meal, broken rice, or corn meal on plasma thyroxin concentrations, organ weights and intestinal histopathology in older (95 wk) laying hens  ap. 526-531.  aThe effects of a nonfasting induced molt were determined on the thyroxin concentration, organ weight and intestinal histopathology in 95-wk-old hens. Hens (60 birds each treatment) were randomly assigned to four treatments for 14 d: 1) molted by feeding broken rice (BRO), 2) fed corn (COR), 3) fed cassava (CAS), or 4) a non-molt control (NON). During the molt period, the BRO, COR and CAS groups were exposed to an 8 h light: 16 h dark photoperiod, whereas the control hens were fed a layer ration and provided with 16 h of light per day. The body weight loss in the CAS hens was 21.90% which was significantly higher than those of the BRO (6.01%) or COR hens (9.30%). The CAS hens completely stopped laying on d 7, whereas the BRO and COR birds exhibited reductions but continued laying. The egg weight of the COR treatment was significantly lower than those of the BRO and CAS treatments. At the end of the molt period, the hematocrit values of the BRO and CAS hens were significantly higher than those of the COR hens. The plasma thyroxin concentrations of the CAS treatment were significantly higher than those of the COR treatment, whereas the BRO hens had a value intermediate between the two groups. The CAS and COR hens had reduced liver weights compared with the BRO hens. However, the thyroid weights of the CAS and COR hens were significantly greater than those of the BRO hens. No inflammatory evidence was observed in any treatment from the examination of intestinal histopathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight changes 3acassava 3acorn 3acorn meal 3aegg weight 3ahematocrit 3ahistopathology 3alaying hens 3aliver 3amolting 3aphotoperiod 3arice 3athyroxine 3atissue weight 0aIntestine 0aLaying hen 0aMolt 0aOrgan 0aThyroxin1 aGuntapa, Panaput1 aSaengkudrua, Kanokporn1 aBoonkaewwan, Chaiwat0 tAgriculture and natural resources.g2017 Dec., v. 51, no. 6 p.526-531dElsevier B.V.aKasetsart UniversitywJournal:23308x2452-316X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anres.2018.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245020400153300001600357520164600373592002802019650002802047650001502075650001102090650001302101650001202114650001502126650001902141650000902160650002702169650001202196650001002208650001202218650001202230650003102242650002302273650001102296650001602307650002002323650001002343650001802353650001602371651001002387653002702397653001102424653001502435653002702450653003002477700001202507700001402519700001602533700001602549773014402565856007402709852000902783655001202792IND60679847620221118232609.0200102e20151113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067984762DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tov3192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Zui10aLaboratory Rearing of Thitarodes armoricanus and Thitarodes jianchuanensis (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae), Hosts of the Chinese Medicinal Fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Hypocreales: Ophiocordycipitaceae)  ap. 176-181.  aOphiocordyceps sinensis (Ophiocordycipitaceae) is an entomopathogenic fungus endemic to the Tibetan Plateau, at elevations ranging between 3,000 and 5,000 m. The fungus-insect complex is useful in healthcare but limited in the field, so there is an urgent need to develop an artificial rearing system of both the fungus and its insect hosts. Large-scale artificial rearing of the Thitarodes insect hosts is crucial. This paper reports results of the artificial cultivation and complete life tables of two host species of O. sinensis, Thitarodes armoricanus and Thitarodes jianchuanensis (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae), under low-altitude laboratory conditions. The larvae were reared on carrots in plastic containers at 9–13°C and 50–80% RH. Both experimental insect species had long and unusual life cycle; it took 263–494 and 443–780 d for T. jianchuanensis and T. armoricanus, respectively, to complete a developmental cycle, including egg, larval instars L1-L9, pupa, and adult. The larvae did develop into pupae from the L7, L8, or L9 instar larvae. Although the total survival rates of both insect species were low (12.0% for T. jianchuanensis and 1.6% for T. armoricanus), the experimental populations successfully developed into the next generation owing to high egg production by fertilized females (averages of 703 and 355 eggs per female in the Yunnan and Sichuan species, respectively). Successful artificial rearing of host insect species for O. sinensis under low temperature conditions will allow the cultivation of this important fungus-insect complex to ensure its protection as a bio-resource and for commercial supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3aThitarodes 3aadults 3aaltitude 3acarrots 3acontainers 3aegg production 3aeggs 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afemales 3ahosts 3ainsects 3ainstars 3alaboratory experimentation 3alaboratory rearing 3alarvae 3alife tables 3amedicinal fungi 3apupae 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3aChina 0aartificial cultivation 0ainsect 0alife table 0aThitarodes armoricanus 0aThitarodes jianchuanensis1 aCao, Li1 aZhang, Yi1 aYe, Yunshou1 aHan, Richou0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Nov. 13, v. 109, no. 1 p.176-181dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov3193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011400165300001600279506007600295520106100371592002801432506003701460650002001497650001701517650001101534650001701545650001401562650001301576650003101589650001801620650001001638650001301648650001201661650001901673650001301692650002201705650001501727650002601742650001801768653001001786653001201796653003501808653001201843653002601855700001801881700001701899700001601916700001701932700001401949700001801963700002301981700002602004700001602030700001802046700001702064773009702081856008402178852000902262655001202271IND60713940320221207123557.0220706e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071394032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNawaz, Iqra10aRNA-Seq profiling reveals the plant hormones and molecular mechanisms stimulating the early ripening in apple  ap. 493-502.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFruit development and ripening are essential components of human and animal diets. Fruit ripening is also a vital plant trait for plant shelf life at the commercial level. In the present study, two apple cultivars, Hanfu wild (HC) and Hanfu mutant (HM), were employed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) to explore the genes involved in fruit ripening. We retrieved 2642 genes, differentially expressed in HC and HM apple cultivars. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed the 569 categories, significantly enriched in biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. KEGG analysis exhibited the plant hormone transduction and flavonoid-anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways, might be involved in the fruit ripening and anthocyanin biosynthesis mechanism. A cluster of 13 and 26 DEGs was retrieved, representing the plant hormones and transcription factors, respectively, that may be important for early ripening in HM genotype. This transcriptome study would be useful for researchers to functionally characterize the DEGs responsible for early ripening.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMalus domestica 3aanthocyanins 3aapples 3abiosynthesis 3acultivars 3afruiting 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agenotype 3amutants 3aplant hormones 3aripening 3asequence analysis 3ashelf life 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 0aApple 0aRNA-Seq 0aEarly ripening, plant hormones 0aPathway 0aTranscription factors1 aTariq, Rezwan1 aNazir, Talha1 aKhan, Imran1 aBasit, Abdul1 aGul, Hera1 aAnwar, Tauqir1 aAwan, Samrah Afzal1 aBacha, Syed Asim Shah1 aZhang, Liyi1 aZhang, Caixia1 aCong, Peihua0 tGenomics.g2021 Jan., v. 113, no. 1 p.493-502dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.09.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011800167300001400285520136600299592002801665650004401693650003701737650002301774650001701797650002301814650001601837650001801853650001201871650003301883650002001916650002101936650001901957650001501976653003101991653001502022653001602037653003102053700001602084700001302100700001202113700001902125773011502144856008602259852000902345655001202354IND60612089620221118133057.0190705e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061208962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.05.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Hongjie10aFabrication of flexible wood flour/thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer composites using fused deposition molding  ap. 76-84.  aUsing three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, the wood flour (WF)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composites with different contents of WF and different modifiers were prepared by TPU/WF composite filaments. These filaments were fabricated through the melt-blending and melt-extrusion of TPU and WF. The mechanical properties, microtopography and chemical structures of the 3D printing products were examined by the mechanical testing machine, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and rheological property tester. The results showed that the tear elongation decreased gradually as the WF content increased, and the tensile strength firstly decreased and then increased. SEM and FTIR results revealed a good compatibility between TPU and WF after the modification with EPDM-g-MAH. The XPS results indicated that the diphenylmethyl propane diisocyanate (MDI) and EPDM-g-MAH modification positively affected the interfacial bonding property between WF and TPU. The examination of rheological properties of the TPU/WF composites indicated that the storage modulus, loss modulus and complex viscosity were significantly increased after the modification with EPDM-g-MAH. The tensile properties of the TPU/WF composites were also greatly increased after the modification with EPDM-g-MAH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical structure 3aloss modulus 3amechanical testing 3amicrorelief 3apolyurethanes 3apropane 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astorage modulus 3atensile strength 3athermoplastics 3awood flour 0aThermoplastic polyurethane 0aWood flour 0aFlexibility 0aThree-dimensional printing1 aRen, Zechun1 aGuo, Rui1 aXu, Min1 aSong, Yongming0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 122 p.76-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.05.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245011400166520164700280592002801927650001901955650003001974650001602004650001802020650001702038650003102055650002102086651001002107653004102117653002902158653000902187653001602196700001702212700001502229700001302244700001402257700001702271700001402288700001702302773011802319856008802437852000902525655001202534IND60724160220221120053918.0220103e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072416022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1447532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lu10aAcute effects of fine particulate matter constituents on cardiopulmonary function in a panel of COPD patients  aExposure to fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) has been linked with adverse cardiorespiratory health conditions. However, evidence for PM₂.₅ constituents is still scarce, especially among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).To investigate the associations of short-term exposure to different chemical constituents of PM₂.₅ with measures of cardiac and lung function in COPD patients.We conducted a retrospective panel study among 100 COPD patients who received repeated measures of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁), forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in Shanghai, China from August 2014 to September 2019. Daily PM₂.₅ and PM₂.₅ constituents were obtained from fixed-site monitoring station. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the associations of PM₂.₅.We found water-soluble ions of PM₂.₅, mainly NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻, and NH₄⁺ were robustly associated with reduced LVEF, and the reductions in LVEF associated with an IQR increase of them ranged from 1.8% to 2.0% (lag 1 d). Metal constituents such as Cu and As were associated with FEV₁, FVC and PEF. The corresponding reductions in lung function parameters for an IQR increase of them ranged from 1.4% to 2.3% (lag 0 or 1 d). These associations remained relatively robust after adjusting for total PM₂.₅ mass and gaseous pollutants.Our results suggest that water-soluble ions and several metal/metalloid elements might be important constituents in PM₂.₅ that were associated with reduced cardiorespiratory function among COPD patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute exposure 3acardiorespiratory fitness 3aenvironment 3alung function 3aparticulates 3arespiratory tract diseases 3awater solubility 3aChina 0aFine particulate matter constituents 0aCardiopulmonary function 0aCOPD 0aPanel study1 aTao, Yingmin1 aLi, Huichu1 aNiu, Yue1 aLi, Liang1 aKan, Haidong1 aXie, Juan1 aChen, Renjie0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 May 20, v. 770 p.144753-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1447533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245012400190300001400314500001500328520134100343592002801684650001701712650001601729650002301745650001101768650001301779650001301792650001501805650003401820650002901854650002001883650002601903650001801929650002301947650002401970650001201994650002702006650001502033650002102048650005202069650004702121650002102168650002802189650002402217650002502241650006302266650001102329650001102340650004402351650002902395650003402424650003002458653001702488653002602505653001802531700001902549700001502568773009502583856008402678990002302762852000902785655001202794IND60092057120221120113517.0141103e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009205712DNAL7 a209342452pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2010.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Soon Young10aCelastrol inhibits the growth of estrogen positive human breast cancer cells through modulation of estrogen receptor α  ap. 57-65.  a2019-12-06  aHuman estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a nuclear transcription factor that displays a major therapeutic target for breast cancer. The transcriptional activity of ERα can be regulated by particular estrogen receptor modulators. Celastrol, a quinine methide triterpene extracted from a Chinese medicine (Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F.), has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy against various cancer cells, including prostate cancer, leukemia, and melanoma cells. However, ERα regulation by Celastrol has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the effects of Celastrol on the growth of breast cancer cells. We observed that Celastrol decreased expression of ERα at both the mRNA and the protein levels in MCF7 and T47D human breast cancer cells. Results from a luciferase assay showed that Celastrol decreased the transcriptional activity of ERα. Also, Celastrol treatment inhibited ERα target gene expression, including expressions of cyclin D₁, progesterone receptor (PR), and c-Myb leading to cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. We propose that Celastrol, an anti-cancer drug extracted from natural sources, induces inhibition of cell growth through modulation of ERα in estrogen positive breast cancer cells and is a candidate for use in cancer chemotherapy for human breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3acell growth 3aestrogen receptors 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3amelanoma 3aluciferase 3aOriental traditional medicine 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aantineoplastic agents 3atriterpenoids 3agrowth retardation 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aquinine 3aprogesterone receptors 3acell cycle 3abreast neoplasms 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxpharmacology 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Nucleusxchemistry 2aCyclin D1xanalysis 2aCytoplasmxchemistry 2aEstrogen Receptor alphaxanalysisxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-mybxanalysis 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReceptors, Estrogenxanalysis 2aTriterpenesxpharmacology 0achemotherapy 0atranscription factors 0agrowth arrest1 aJang, Sung-Wuk1 aKo, Jesang0 tCancer letters.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 300, no. 1 p.57-65dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2010.09.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011900164300001600283520147000299592002801769650003801797650002401835650001301859650002301872650001901895650001601914650001401930650001801944651001201962653002001974653001201994653002102006653001102027700002702038700002002065700002102085773014302106856007402249961001302323852000902336655001202345IND60679847720221118232517.0200102e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067984772DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tov3202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott Armstrong, J.14aThe Discovery of Resistant Sources of Spring Barley, Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum, and Unique Greenbug Biotypes  ap. 434-438.  aThe genetic sources for host-plant resistance to the greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) in barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum) are limited in that only two single dominant genes Rsg1 and Rsg2 are available for the complex of greenbug biotypes. We evaluated four new barley lines from the Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC) that previously showed potential for greenbug resistance. Three of those entries, WBDC 53, WBDC 117, WBDC 336, exhibited very dominant sources of resistance to older known biotypes B, C, E, F, H, I, and TX1, which also add to the host-plant differentials used to separate these greenbug biotypes. We also re-evaluated the earlier known set of greenbug biotypes that have been in culture for several years against the known host-plant differentials, and included seven newer greenbug isolates collected from Wyoming to the full complement of small grain differentials. This resulted in the discovery of five new greenbug biotypes, WY10 MC, WY81, WY10 B, WY12 MC, and WY86. Wyoming isolates WY4 A and WY4 B were identical in their phenotypic profile, and should be combined as a single unique greenbug biotype. These barley trials resulted in finding new sources of host-plant resistance, although more research needs to be conducted on what type of resistance was found, and how it can be used. We also document that the Wheatland, Wyoming area serves as a very conducive environment for the development of new greenbug biotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum 3aSchizaphis graminum 3abiotypes 3adisease resistance 3adominant genes 3ahost plants 3aphenotype 3aspring barley 3aWyoming 0aHordeum vulgare 0abiotype 0aplant resistance 0abarley1 aMornhinweg, Dolores W.1 aPayton, Mark E.1 aPuterka, Gary J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Nov. 1, v. 109, no. 1 p.434-438dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov3203Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245009700134300001400231520106600245592002801311653001601339653001701355653002401372653001001396653002701406700002301433700002101456700002501477700002101502700002101523773009801544852000901642655001201651IND60125312920221120205437.0151124e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012531292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeh, Kelvin S.-H.10aUp in the Clouds: Is Sustainable use of Tropical Montane Cloud Forests Possible in Malaysia?  ap. 27-38.  aPerched atop misty mountains, tropical montane cloud forests are one of Earth's most imperiled and neglected ecosystems. More than half of these forests occur in Southeast Asia; those in Malaysia are considered some of the best studied in the region. Malaysia has numerous mountains that are exceptionally rich in biodiversity and sustain numerous locally endemic species, but they are also threatened by expanding forestry, agriculture, infrastructure, and global warming. Malaysia serves as an excellent case study to illustrate the issues and challenges associated with tropical cloud forest conservation. We critically assess the current status of Malaysia's cloud forests——focusing on their biological uniqueness and prospects for long-term survival——and propose conservation strategies for agricultural, forestry, tourism, and policy sectors to help conserve these endangered ecosystems. It is our hope that decisionmakers around the region can use our review to evaluate and improve their national strategies related to cloud forest conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aagriculture 0abiodiversity 0acommercial forestry 0aroads 0aSoutheast Asia tourism1 aSoh, Malcolm C.

This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between hair mineral concentrations and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). A total of 456 subjects (161 patients with MS and 295 subjects without MS) were reviewed, and fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, homeostasis assessment model-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and hair mineral concentrations were analyzed. While hair sodium and potassium concentrations were significantly higher, the hair calcium, magnesium, and zinc concentrations were lower in the MS group than in the control group. Regarding toxic element measurements, the hair arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) concentrations were higher in the MS group than in the control group. The results of multiple regression analysis, after adjusting for age, showed significant relationships between the Na/Mg and Ca/P ratios and HOMA-IR (R² = 0.109, p < 0.05). The Ca, Na, K, and B concentrations were also associated with HOMA-IR (R² = 0.116, p < 0.05). The hair Na concentration was significantly associated with MS, even after adjusting for age, visceral adipose tissue, and HOMA-IR (OR 1.020; 95 % CI 1.001–1.040; p = 0.036). Our findings suggest that hair mineral concentrations, such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, sodium, and potassium concentrations, may play a role in the development of insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aarsenic 3ablood glucose 3acalcium 3afasting 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alead 3amagnesium 3ametabolic syndrome 3amineral content 3anutrient deficiencies 3apatients 3apotassium 3aregression analysis 3asodium 3atoxicity 3atriacylglycerols 3azinc1 aKim, Se-hong,1 aChung, Ju-Hye0 tBiological trace element research.g2014 June, v. 158, no. 3 p.323-329dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-014-9946-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245008000167300002000247520097100267592002801238650001301266650001201279650001401291650001201305650001301317650001501330650001801345650001201363650001901375650001801394650001501412650001201427650001601439650002501455700002101480700002501501773012401526856007401650852000901724655001201733IND60664577220221117155929.0190912e20131016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066457722DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42640h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, El-Sayed R.

The conversion of biomass to biofuels begins with pretreatment to produce amorphous cellulose which can be hydrolysed to sugars. The use of ionic liquids has been described as a new potentially viable development in this area. Nevertheless, phase equilibria with biomass-derived compounds and also sugars, is still lacking in the literature. To overcome the lack of experimental data on phase equilibria of biomass carbohydrates in ionic liquids, the solubility of fructose, sucrose and lactose in ionic liquids was measured within a temperature range from 280 K to 390 K. Solubility data were successfully correlated using NRTL and UNIQUAC thermodynamic models. In this work, the possibility of extracting carbohydrates from ionic liquids using ethanol has also been evaluated. Results indicate that ethanol could be used as an antisolvent to separate sugars from ionic liquids.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acellulose 3aethanol 3afructose 3ahydrolysis 3aionic liquids 3alactose 3alignocellulose 3araw materials 3asolubility 3asucrose 3atemperature 3athermodynamic models1 aMutelet, Fabrice1 aMoïse, Jean-Charles0 tRSC advances.g2013 Oct. 16, v. 3, no. 43 p.20219-20226dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra42640h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011300165300001600278520106000294592002801354653002001382653003401402653002101436653001001457653001401467700002201481700002401503773010101527856008401628852000901712655001201721IND60125313120221120205455.0151103e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012531312DNAL7 a10.1525/bio.2011.61.10.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBois, Sarah T.10aInvasive Plant Atlas of New England: The Role of Citizens in the Science of Invasive Alien Species Detection  ap. 763-770.  aIn response to the global threat of invasive alien species, there has been a proliferation of volunteer-based monitoring programs. The valuable data sets collected through these programs facilitate large-scale, baseline population monitoring. The Invasive Plant Atlas of New England, created in 2001, was the first such regional database and is the only one in which both presence and true absence data have been collected. Building on the success of volunteer atlas projects for other taxa, the Web-based network uses trained volunteers, along with experts, to collect distribution data and detailed environmental information. The incorporation of true absence data allows for the building of robust statistical models, which contributes significantly to the invasive species literature. This collaborative database allows citizen science data to be used by the general public and as a data source for researchers and policymakers. As a template for other invasive plant projects, we highlight the need for more collaborative efforts in invasion ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 0acitizen science 0aspecies distribution database 0ainvasive species 0aIPANE 0anull data1 aSilander, John A.1 aMehrhoff, Leslie J.0 tBioScience.g2011 Oct., v. 61, no. 10 p.763-770dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525/bio.2011.61.10.63Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245008700164520120700251592002801458650001901486650002101505650001601526650001001542650002101552650001001573650001101583650003101594650002101625650001301646700002401659700002601683700002001709773012101729856007901850852000901929655001201938IND60784181320221122055216.0220726e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078418132DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111418562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiofini, Alice 10aManagement of Post-Harvest Anthracnose: Current Approaches and Future Perspectives  aAnthracnose is a severe disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. on several crop species. Fungal infections can occur both in the field and at the post-harvest stage causing severe lesions on fruits and economic losses. Physical treatments and synthetic fungicides have traditionally been the preferred means to control anthracnose adverse effects; however, the urgent need to decrease the use of toxic chemicals led to the investigation of innovative and sustainable protection techniques. Evidence for the efficacy of biological agents and vegetal derivates has been reported; however, their introduction into actual crop protection strategies requires the solutions of several critical issues. Biotechnology-based approaches have also been explored, revealing the opportunity to develop innovative and safe methods for anthracnose management through genome editing and RNA interference technologies. Nevertheless, besides the number of advantages related to their use, e.g., the putative absence of adverse effects due to their high specificity, a number of aspects remain to be clarified to enable their introduction into Integrated Pest Management (IPM) protocols against Colletotrichum spp. disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aRNA interference 3aanthracnose 3acrops 3adisease severity 3afungi 3agenome 3aintegrated pest management 3aplant protection 3atoxicity1 aNegrini, Francesca 1 aBaroncelli, Riccardo 1 aBaraldi, Elena 0 tPlants.g2022 July 15, v. 11, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111418563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245007200186300001600258520068600274592002800960650001400988650001401002650001901016650001001035650001701045650001201062650002601074650002601100650001101126650003701137650003601174700001301210700001701223700001201240700001601252773009801268856008401366990002301450852000901473655001201482IND60092057420221120113418.0141103e20110128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009205742DNAL7 a210364692pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2010.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jun-jie10aTargeting apoptotic and autophagic pathways for cancer therapeutics  ap. 105-114.  aApoptosis and autophagy are genetically regulated, evolutionarily-conserved processes that regulate cell fate; however, apoptosis invariably contributes to cancer cell death, whereas autophagy plays the Janus role of cancer cell survival and death.

Additionally, we demonstrate that some autophagic pathways play dual roles in cancer, and further elucidate the intricate relationship between apoptosis and autophagy.

Habitat destruction and fragmentation have a major impact on landscapes and may also affect ecosystems, populations, and species. The ongoing anthropogenic process can result in habitat loss for some species, habitat creation for others, reduced patch size, and increased distance between patches, which may lead to local extinction. We analyzed the effects of patch size and isolation on lichens in Quercus pubescens woods surrounding the city of Potenza (south Italy). We randomly sampled 11 forest patches with homogeneous environmental variables using circular plots with a 10 m radius; the patches ranged from 0.3 to 30 ha. For each plot, we collected data about presence and abundance of epiphytic lichens. We performed the analyses at the patch level using linear regression and multivariate analysis, searching for effects on species richness, life forms, and community compositions. Multivariate analyses were used to study the effect of fragmentation on the structure of lichen vegetation. We investigated the main predictor of lichen species richness in habitat fragmentations and concluded that patch area per se is an important (positive) driver of lichen species richness in Mediterranean peri-urban forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus pubescens 3acase studies 3aepiphytes 3aextinction 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alichens 3aregression analysis 3aspecies richness 3aItaly1 aGerardi, Gianluca 1 aFascetti, Simonetta 1 aRosati, Leonardo 0 tPlants.g2022 July 15, v. 11, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111418583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245008700135300001600222520132900238592002801567653001901595653002101614653001301635653001501648700002501663700001501688773010101703852000901804655001201813IND60125313320221120205529.0151103e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012531332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnight, Tiffany M.10aWill the use of Less Fecund Cultivars Reduce the Invasiveness of Perennial Plants?  ap. 816-822.  aMany invasive species were originally introduced for horticultural purposes, and several continue to be profitable for the green (nursery, horticulture, and landscape) industry. Recently, some plant suppliers have marketed less fecund cultivars of several invasive species, including glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), burning bush (Euonymus alatus), and Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii), as “safe” alternatives to invasive relatives. We use published matrix population models to simulate the effect of reducing fecundity on the population growth rates of invasive species. We show that large changes in fecundity result in relatively small changes to the population growth rates of long-lived species, which suggests that less fecund cultivars may still provide an invasive threat. Furthermore, many cultivars are clonal selections, and if crossed with other cultivars or selfed, they produce offspring with traits and fecundities that do not resemble the parent plant. On the basis of these two lines of evidence, we suggest that only female sterile cultivars that cannot reproduce asexually should be considered “safe” and noninvasive. Marketing less fecund cultivars as “safe” is premature at this time, and further research is necessary to determine the potential invasiveness of different cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 0ainvasive plant 0aornamental plant 0acultivar 0ademography1 aHavens-Young, Kayri,1 aVitt, Pati0 tBioScience.g2011 Oct., v. 61, no. 10 p.816-822dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001300185245009500198500002000293506007600313520143600389592002801825506003701853650002201890650000801912650002001920650001401940650001601954650002801970650001801998650001602016650001502032650001002047650001702057650001502074650001402089650002402103650000902127700001702136700001902153700001502172700001602187700001902203700001702222773014002239856007802379852000902457655001202466IND60598556620221207065900.0180629e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059855662DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2018001552doi7 aPMC63449302pmcid7 a296447912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Li10aEpigenome‐Wide Association Study of Dietary Fiber Intake in African American Adolescents  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSCOPE: Low fiber intake is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Two hypotheses are tested: 1) dietary fiber would be associated with DNA methylation levels; 2) those DNA methylation changes would be associated with visceral adiposity and inflammation. Also the possibility that the associations between fiber and DNA methylation levels might be confounded with folic acid intake as sensitivity analysis are explored. METHODS AND RESULTS: An epigenome‐wide association study is conducted using Illumina 450K Bead‐Chip on leukocyte DNA in 284 African American adolescents. Linear regression is performed to identify differentially methylated CpG sites associated with fiber. The methylation levels of 3 CpG sites (cg15200711, cg19462022, and cg07035602) in LPCAT1 and RASA3 genes are associated with fiber (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) after adjustment for covariates including folic acid. The methylation levels of cg07035602 and cg19462022 are also associated with visceral adiposity and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that DNA methylation levels at LPCAT1 and RASA3 genes are associated with dietary fiber intake as well as with adiposity and inflammation. Future studies are warranted to determine whether epigenetic regulation may underlie the beneficial effects of fiber intake on adiposity and inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aadiposity 3aadolescents 3acardiovascular diseases 3adietary fiber 3aepigenetics 3afolic acid 3agenes 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3aneoplasms 3aregression analysis 3arisk1 aDong, Yanbin1 aWang, Xiaoling1 aHao, Guang1 aHuang, Ying1 aGutin, Bernard1 aZhu, Haidong0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2018 June, v. 62, no. 12 p.e1800155-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2018001553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01341naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008300161300001800244520037800262592002800640650001300668650002000681650001400701650001700715700001400732700002100746700002600767700001700793773013300810856007500943852000901018655001201027IND60777773120221119021055.0220521e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077777312DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cc01337a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaniguchi, Tohru10aStereostructural analysis of flexible oxidized fatty acids by VCD spectroscopy  ap. 6116-6119.  aOxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids produces various oxidized lipids whose absolute configuration (AC) and conformations are difficult to analyze due to their flexibility.

Thus there is a need to develop broad-spectrum therapies that are effective while not leading to unacceptably long antibiotic withdrawal times. The effects of the CH4-inhibitors nitroethane (2 mg/mL), 2-nitro-1-propanol (2 mg/mL), lauric acid (5 mg/mL), the commercial product Lauricidin R (5 mg/mL), and a finely ground product of the Hawaiian marine algae, Chaetoceros (10 mg/mL), were compared in pure cultures of Streptococcus agalactia, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus bovis, and in a mixed lactic acid rumen bacterial culture. Lauricidin R and lauric acid exhibited the most bactericidal acidity against all bacteria. These results suggest potential animal health benefits from supplementing cattle diets with lauric acid or Lauricidin® to improve the health of the rumen and help prevent shedding of human pathogens. 3adiet 3adodecanoic acid 3amastitis 3arumen 3aantibiotics 3aStreptococcus bovis 3alactic acid 3aEnterococcus faecium 3alactic acid bacteria 3atherapeutics 3aanimal health 3acows 3aChaetoceros 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3arumen bacteria 3aantibacterial properties 0ashedding1 aAnderson, Robin C.1 aRicke, Steven C.1 aCrandall, Philip G.1 aO'Bryan, Corliss0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012, v. 47, no. 4 p.269-274x1532-41097nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/572203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2012.638883  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Comparison%20of%20nitroethane%2C%202-nitro-1-propanol%2C%20lauric%20acid%2C%20Lauricidin%20and%20the%20Hawaiian%20marine%20algae%2C%20Chaetoceros%2C%20for%20potential%20borad-spectrum%20control%20of%20anaerobically%20grown%20lactic%20acid%20bacteria.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245013200183300001600315520082100331592002801152650002101180650001901201650001701220650001901237650001101256650002501267650001401292650001101306650001201317650001801329650003101347650001401378650003701392650001501429650001501444650006301459650003401522650001101556650006501567650006901632700002001701700001701721700002001738773009501758856008101853852000901934655001201943IND50074572420221122064655.0150214e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007457242DNAL7 a245570702pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-013-1442-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yingwei10aSodium butyrate enhances the acidic isoform content of recombinant human erythropoietin produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells  ap. 907-911.  aSodium butyrate is commonly used in mammalian cell cultures to increase the productivity of recombinant proteins. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line producing recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) was cultured in commercial medium. Addition of 0.5 mM butyrate inhibited the over-growth of the cells after the medium was changed from serum-added medium to serum-free medium. At the 6th day, the addition of butyrate lowered the transcriptional level of sialidases I, II, and III compared to that of control groups by 56, 87, and 59 %, respectively. Extracellular sialidase activity was decreased by 53 % by addition of butyrate. The inhibition of cell over-growth and the decrease of extracellular sialidase activity helped to increase the acidic isoform content of rhEPO expressed by this CHO cell strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aanimal ovaries 3acell culture 3aerythropoietin 3ahumans 3arecombinant proteins 3asialidase 3asodium 2aAnimals 2aBiotechnology 2aButyric Acidxpharmacology 2aCHO Cells 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aErythropoietinxanalysisxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aProtein Isoformsxanalysisxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxanalysisxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aZhou, Xiangshan1 aSong, Zhiwei1 aZhang, Yuanxing0 tBiotechnology letters.g2014 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.907-911dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-013-1442-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245016300169300001600332520141300348592002801761650002501789650002201814650001501836650002601851650001801877650002201895650002001917650001901937650003301956650001901989650002102008650001302029650002102042650001702063700005702080773012102137856008302258852000902341655001202350IND60729776620221118003052.0210711e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072977662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-021-02598-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhashayary, Sara10aEvaluation of Physico-mechanical and Antifungal Properties Of Gluten-based Film Incorporated with Vanillin, Salicylic Acid, and Montmorillonite (Cloisite 15A)  ap. 665-678.  aA novel wheat gluten (WG) film was developed by adding vanillin, salicylic acid, and montmorillonite cloisite 15A (MMT). Some physico-mechanical properties, including thickness, tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (E), yellowness index (YI), whiteness index (WI), and water solubility (SWF) of the film were investigated using response surface methodology. Results revealed that maximum tensile strength occurred at the highest level of MMT and salicylic acid, and that the effect of MMT on elongation at break was considerable. The YI and WI of the composite films increased respectively, while the WI value and increment of MMT reduced. Moreover, the water solubility was raised with an increasing amount of MMT, vanillin, and salicylic content in the films. The optimum level of the variables obtained by the software was 0.92% vanillin, 0.94% salicylic acid, and 1.92% MMT (% w/w). The intensity and shifting of some absorption peaks in the FTIR spectra pattern confirmed the interaction of functional groups of additive and gluten chain. SEM images revealed an even distribution of the particles with no evidence of particle agglomeration in WG/vanillin/salicylic acid/MMT. Inhibition zone around the nanocomposite films against Aspergillus niger and Alternaria alternate strains indicated antifungal activity of WG nanocomposite films, which was more considerably observed for Aspergillus niger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aAspergillus niger 3aabsorption 3aantifungal properties 3abioprocessing 3acomputer software 3amontmorillonite 3ananocomposites 3aresponse surface methodology 3asalicylic acid 3atensile strength 3avanillin 3awater solubility 3awheat gluten1 aAarabi, Aazam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1495-83540 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2021 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.665-678dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4235020x1935-51307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-021-02598-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003400152245009200186300001400278520064100292592002800933650001700961650001500978650001300993650001301006650001801019650001501037650001301052650001901065650000901084650001401093650001801107650001301125650002201138650001101160651001701171653001901188653002201207653002301229653002501252653001301277773010601290856008601396852000901482655001201491IND60691463920221121023833.0200430e20000401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069146392DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2000.114071882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeckley, L.

Juveniles of more transient Indo-Pacific species recruited primarily during the summer months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthuridae 3aBlenniidae 3aGobiidae 3aLabridae 3aPomacentridae 3aSerranidae 3aSparidae 3aTripterygiidae 3afish 3ajuveniles 3alittoral zone 3arotenone 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3aSouth Africa 0alow shore pool 0aspecies abundance 0aseasonal abundance 0aseasonal recruitment 0ateleosts0 tAfrican zoology.g2000 Apr. 1, v. 35, no. 1 p.29-34dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2000.114071883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011200172300001600284520141500300592002801715650002201743650002201765650001201787650001201799650001301811650001401824650001301838650002801851650002401879650001501903650001101918650001101929650002601940650001901966650002301985700001802008700002402026700002102050700005702071773008702128856008502215852000902300655001202309IND60628081020221122025502.0200419e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062808102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDysart, Arthur D.10aRoom and elevated temperature lithium-ion storage in structurally submicron carbon spheres with mechanistic  ap. 334-344.  aLithium-ion storage in monodisperse submicron carbon spheres (SCS) depends on the inert atmosphere thermal treatment of sonochemically formed polymeric precursors. Battery electrodes of SCS present great initial capacity up to 861 and 1111 A h kg⁻¹ at ambient temperatures 27 and 50 °C, respectively, when cycled at specific current 25 A h kg⁻¹. Beyond initial formation cycles, interestingly, the gravimetric capacity of SCS increases by up to 58% after cycle 50 if cycled up to 3.0 V. Furthermore, capacity change becomes more intense until failure when cycled at 50 °C due to enhanced lithium kinetics. During the first 30 cycles, in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy illustrates capacity evolution is coincident with changing capacitive behavior. Subsequently, a model is proposed to relate evolving specific capacity to morphological changes before and during galvanostatic cycling. Further mechanistic support is provided by quantitative characterization of nano-crystallites and phase disorder by X-ray powder diffraction (Scherrer equation) and Raman spectroscopy (peak fitting), elemental composition by organic elemental analysis, and textural properties by isothermal nitrogen sorption. This work provides valuable insight on pertinent ex situ and in situ factors influencing extended voltage applications of synthetic carbons in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3alithium batteries 3aX-ray diffraction 3alithium 3atexture 3anitrogen 3aequations 3asorption 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aelectrodes 3amodels 3acarbon 3aelemental composition 3aheat treatment 3aRaman spectroscopy1 aPhuah, Xin Li1 aShrestha, Lok Kumar1 aAriga, Katsuhiko1 aPol, Vilas G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4866-117X0 tCarbon.g2018 Aug., v. 134 p.334-344dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245016300189300001600352520069000368592002801058650001401086650001201100650001601112650001301128650001201141650001301153650002201166650002401188650001201212650004001224650002801264650001501292650002201307650002101329650003701350650005501387650003901442650001101481650006301492650000901555650001301564650003801577650003001615650003001645650004001675650002801715700001801743700002201761700002001783700002401803700002001827700001701847700001801864700002201882700001901904700002001923700002501943773009801968856008402066990002302150852000902173655001202182IND60092057720221120113431.0141103e20110128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009205772DNAL7 a210410182pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2010.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrado, Chiara10aCarboxyamidotriazole inhibits cell growth of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukaemia cells including T315I Bcr–Abl mutant by a redox-mediated mechanism  ap. 205-214.  aMutation of the Bcr–Abl oncoprotein is one of most frequent mechanisms by which chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells become resistant to imatinib.

Moreover, we show that CAI acts by increasing intracellular ROS.

The T-graphene was synthesized using low cost NaSH as a reducing agent to reduce graphene oxide. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies reveal that NaSH is an effective reducing agent in removing oxygen containing groups from graphene oxide. The highly reduced T-graphene with a C/O ratio of 28 was used as the supercapacitor electrode material. At a current density of 2.5 Ag⁻¹, the T-graphene supercapacitor exhibited an electrochemical capacitance of 195 Fg⁻¹, a power density of 4.3 kWkg⁻¹and an energy density of 83.4 Whkg⁻¹. The time required to discharge 83.4Whkg⁻¹ at 2.5 Ag⁻¹ is around 69 s. At a current density of 7.5 Ag⁻¹, the cell exhibited a specific capacitance of about 137 Fg⁻¹ and retained 98% of its initial capacitance value after 10,000 cycles. This superior performance of supercapacitor can be ascribed to highly reduced and porous T-graphene with minimum restacking due to its crumpled nature. The resulting supercapacitors having stable performance at high current density are suitable for fast charging-discharging applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3agraphene oxide 3aoxygen 3areducing agents1 aYang, Hao1 aKaliyappan, Karthikeyan1 aManian, Rajesh Kumar1 aSamuthira Pandian, Amaresh1 aLee, Yun Sung1 aJang, Jae-Hyung1 aLu, Wu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6776-90820 tCarbon.g2018 Aug., v. 134 p.326-333dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.02.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245015500133300001600288520138300304592002801687653002401715653002101739653002401760653001401784653001801798700002201816700002301838773010101861852000901962655001201971IND60125313920221120205423.0151103e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012531392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooke, Steven J.10aSustainable “Seafood” Ecolabeling and Awareness Initiatives in the Context of Inland Fisheries: Increasing Food Security and Protecting Ecosystems  ap. 911-918.  aThe sustainable seafood movement has adopted a variety of certification and ecolabeling systems, as well as seafood-awareness campaigns, to influence industry and help consumers make informed decisions regarding their seafood consumption. However, a review of these programs revealed that the majority are focused on marine and coastal fisheries. Globally, freshwaters and their fish assemblages represent some of the most threatened systems and taxa because of multiple anthropogenic stressors. There is an urgent need to harness the momentum of the sustainable seafood movement for marine systems to benefit all aquatic systems, including freshwater. Moreover, given that freshwater systems are at particular risk in developing countries in which small-scale fisheries dominate, it is essential to expand awareness campaigns, through grassroots initiatives that differ significantly from current awareness campaigns that are global in focus, involve industrialized large-scale fisheries, and assume significant exports of seafood. Addressing the limitations of marine campaigns is a logical first step before launching new programs aimed at inland fisheries. In the long term, failure of the sustainable seafood movement to incorporate freshwater fisheries will lead to public perception that these fisheries are not in peril and may allow unsustainable practices to continue.  aPublisher supplied data 0asustainable seafood 0ainland fisheries 0aawareness campaigns 0aecolabels 0acertification1 aMurchie, Karen J.1 aDanylchuk, Andy J.0 tBioScience.g2011 Nov., v. 61, no. 11 p.911-918dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003000112245008800142300001600230520167600246592002801922650001201950650001701962650001201979650001201991650001502003650002102018650001002039650001402049650001102063650001502074650002402089653001702113653001602130653002002146653001902166653001902185653002302204700003202227773008502259852000902344655001202353IND60516527320221118040023.0160326e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051652732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBISIGATO, ALEJANDRO JORGE10aSeedling recruitment of perennial grasses in degraded areas of the Patagonian Monte  ap. 191-196.  aThe recruitment of perennial grass seedlings in degraded areas of the Patagonian Monte was analyzed. Recolonization of large bare-soil areas by dwarf shrubs or perennial grasses was hypothesized to create favorable microsites for grass seedling recruitment. Under natural field conditions, soil moisture (0–20 cm), root biomass (0–20 cm), the soil seed bank of perennial grasses, and density of perennial grass seedlings in the center of large bare soil areas and in microsites neighboring isolated plants of perennial grasses and dwarf shrubs were assessed. A manipulative experiment was conducted to evaluate seedling recruitment at the 3 microsites with identical density of seed addition of perennial grasses, under situations of root exclusion, and water addition.Under natural field conditions, root biomass did not differ among microsites. Soil moisture, seed density, and seedling density of perennial grasses were higher near perennial grasses than in bare soil or next to dwarf shrubs. Recruitment of perennial grass seedlings did not differ among microsites when the density of seeds did not vary among them or roots of the established plants were excluded. Water increased perennial grass seedling recruitment at all microsites. In degraded areas of the Patagonian Monte the spatial distribution of the soil seed bank followed by water availability are the main limiting factors of seedling recruitment of perennial grasses. Managerial practices oriented to maintain and increase the soil seed bank of perennial grasses, such as grazing exclusion during the grass reproductive period, might contribute to promote the re-establishment of perennial grasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aburied seeds 3agrasses 3agrazing 3aperennials 3arange management 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3asoil water 3aspecies recruitment 0afacilitation 0acompetition 0aarid ecosystems 0asoil seed bank 0apatch dynamics 0awater availability1 aBertiller, Mónica Beatriz,0 tJournal of Range Management.g2004 Mar., v. 57, no. 2 p.191-196x2162-27287nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013400162300001600296520131800312592002801630650001201658650001101670650001101681650001901692650002401711650002001735650002901755650002101784650002601805650000901831650001001840650000901850650001401859650001701873650001001890700001401900700002001914700002101934773012301955856007402078852000902152655001202161IND60683806520221119095837.0200211e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068380652DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc03746b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez-Diaz, A.14aThe potential of decarbonising rice and wheat by incorporating carbon capture, utilisation and storage into fertiliser production  ap. 882-894.  aThis paper aims to evaluate the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of rice and wheat and their supply chains by incorporating carbon capture, utilisation and storage into fertiliser production mainly from the ammonia process, which is a part of the fertiliser that produces most of the carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gas emissions of these grains without carbon capture, utilisation and storage are provided from the results of life cycle assessment in the literature. After that, carbon dioxide emission from fertiliser production is quantified. The alternative considered for utilisation is enhanced oil recovery and it is compared with the conventional way of oil production. The effects of carbon capture, utilisation, and storage on greenhouse gas reduction are presented in terms of the supply chains of rice and wheat to make people conscious about the use and optimisation of food. The reduction of greenhouse gas is around 6–7% in the rice supply chain e.g. rice milk, spoons of uncooked rice and 14–16% in the wheat supply chain e.g. pasta, one slice of bread. Although the alternative for carbon dioxide storage demonstrates marginally higher greenhouse gas reduction, enhanced oil recovery may offer an economic incentive from additional oil production that could reduce the cost of rice and wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abreads 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic incentives 3agreen chemistry 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3alife cycle assessment 3aoils 3apasta 3arice 3arice milk 3asupply chain 3awheat1 aJiang, L.1 aRoskilly, A.

Previous studies have focused on the magnitude of and the temporal and spatial variations in the flux of atmospheric deposition, and the composition of atmospheric deposition on a local scale. However, there have been no comprehensive studies of atmospheric deposition on a regional scale and its ecological effects in arid Asia. The temporal and spatial patterns, composition of atmospheric deposition, and its potential effects on regional ecosystems in arid Asia are investigated in this study. The results show that the annual deposition flux is high on the Turan Plain, Aral Sea Desert, and Tarim Basin. The seasonal deposition flux also varies remarkably among different regions. The Tarim Basin shows higher deposition flux in both spring and summer, southern Mongolian Plateau has a higher deposition flux in spring, and the deposition flux of Iran Plateau is higher in summer. Multiple sources of elements in deposited particles are identified. Calcium, iron, aluminum, and magnesium are mainly derived from remote regions, while zinc, copper and lead have predominantly anthropogenic sources. Atmospheric deposition can provide abundant nutrients to vegetation and consequently play a role in the succession of regional ecosystems by affecting the structure, function, diversity, and primary production of the vegetation, especially the exotic or short-lived opportunistic species in arid Asia. Nevertheless, there is not much evidence of the ecological effects of atmospheric deposition on the regional and local scale. The present results may help in further understanding the mechanism of atmospheric deposition as well as providing a motivation for the protection of the ecological environment in arid Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric deposition 3abasins 3acalcium 3aclimate change 3acopper 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3anutrients 3aprimary productivity 3aspring 3asummer 3avegetation 3azinc 3aCentral Asia 3aIran 0aDustfall 0aSpatiotemporal variation 0aDeposition flux 0aComposition 0aEcosystem response 0aArid Asia1 aWang, Xunming1 aLi, Danfeng0 tAeolian research.g2018 June, v. 32 p.71-91dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12141x1875-96377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2018.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003200112245010600144300001600250520135800266592002801624650003801652650001201690650001101702650001601713650001801729650001601747650002501763650002601788650001101814650002201825650001901847650002301866650001401889650002101903650001501924650001101939651001101950651002501961653002101986653001102007653001202018653001502030653001102045700002302056700002302079700001902102773008502121852000902206655001202215IND60516527420221118040244.0160326e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051652742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEL-SHATNAWI, MOH'D KHAIR J.10aManagement optimization of dual-purpose barley (Hordeum spontaneum C.

It is used to establish permanent pasture because it has a brittle rachis. Crude protein, crude fiber contents, and responses of dual-purpose barley to time of defoliation were investigated in the northern mountains of Jordan. Field trials were conducted in the 1999–2000 and 2000–2001 growing seasons in Samta (32° 23′N, 35°50′E) at an elevation of 1043 m. The highest protein contents (P ≤ 0.05) of 25% were recorded in February 2001. Protein content declined gradually and reached the lowest values (2.5%) at maturity. Clipping produced shorter plants, but did not impact tillering.Clipping individual plants on 28 February (14.3 and 10.2 g plant⁻¹, respectively in 2000 and 2001) and 15 March (10.3 and 9.2 g plant⁻¹, respectively in 2000 and 2001) did not reduce the plant shoot weight. Forage production from plants clipped on 28 February (2902 and 1274 kg ha⁻¹, respective years), 15 March (1793 and 1394 kg ha⁻¹, respectively in 2000 and 2001) and 15 April (1554 and 994 kg h⁻¹, respectively in 2000 and 2001) were similar to forage production from unclipped plants. Clipping on 15 April inhibited seed production. Defoliation during early growth stages optimized seed yield and forage quantity and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum 3aannuals 3abarley 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3adefoliation 3adevelopmental stages 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3aforage production 3agrowing season 3aindigenous species 3amountains 3arange management 3aseed yield 3awinter 3aJordan 3aMediterranean region 0aDefoliation time 0aJordan 0aprotein 0aspontaneum 0atiller1 aAL-QURRAN, LOUY Z.1 aEREIFEJ, KHALIL I.1 aSAOUB, HANI M.0 tJournal of Range Management.g2004 Mar., v. 57, no. 2 p.197-202x2162-27287nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245008600162300001600248500001900264520160500283592002801888650001901916650001201935650001801947650001601965650001501981653001801996653001702014653002602031653001302057653001902070700001702089700001402106700001202120700001602132773009902148856008502247852000902332655001202341IND60736327620221117182748.0210527e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073632762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.04.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Li10aFluidization dynamics of wet Geldart D particles by pressure fluctuation analysis  ap. 450-461.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe increase of liquid saturation badly affects the fluidization dynamics, even resulting in the failure of fluidization. Nevertheless, few researches focus on characterizing the flow pattern transition of wet particles. In this work, we discuss the effects of the liquid saturation, gas velocity and the particle size on the global fluidization dynamics of Geldart D particles by analyzing the pressure fluctuations in the fluidized bed. The results show that the bubble dynamics is intensified with the increasing liquid saturation and decreasing particle size. When the superficial gas velocity increases, the fluidization regimes change from expanding regime, to multi-bubbling regime and slugging. During the normal fluidization and slugging, the liquid bridge forces prevent the growth of large bubbles and promote the probability of bubble break-up. Thus, the average bubble size decreases and the number of bubbles increases, which lead to the intense bubble behavior. With the decreasing particle size, the effect of liquid bridge forces is enhanced, contributing to the intensified bubble dynamics, including fast rising, frequent coalescence and eruption of a large number of bubbles. Compared to dry particles, wet particles are easily to cause defluidization when the gas velocity is small. The PSD patterns have the sharp narrow peaks at frequency lower than 0.8 Hz. When the liquid saturation is increased to 30%, a gas channel forms in the bed, which resists the normal works of the fluidized bed. Basically, reducing the liquid saturation is a reasonable way to avoid defluidization.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluidized beds 3aliquids 3aparticle size 3aprobability 3atechnology 0aWet particles 0aFluidization 0aPressure fluctuations 0aSlugging 0aDefluidization1 aYuan, Zhulin1 aGuan, Lei1 aWu, Kai1 aGu, Conghui0 tPowder technology.g2021 Aug., v. 388 p.450-461dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.04.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245007100208300001500279520107300294592002801367650001701395650001701412650001701429650001501446650002401461650001401485650000901499650001901508651001001527651001701537653001701554653001701571653003401588653002401622653001601646700001701662700001701679700001501696700001601711700005201727700001501779700001401794700001801808700002001826700001401846773009601860856008401956852000902040655001202049IND60635269120221120085527.0190328e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063526912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aeolia.2018.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xingchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5768-581910aProvenance of aeolian sands in the Hetao Plain, northwestern China  ap. 92-101.  aPatches of aeolian sand are distributed throughout the Hetao Plain, which pose threats to farming and agriculture. Identification of the provenance of the aeolian sands may help with efforts to alleviate ecological stress in Inner Mongolia and in the paleoenvironmental interpretation of sandy sequences. This study uses geochemical data to determine the provenance of aeolian sands from the Hetao Plain. Provenance discrimination diagrams revealed that the aeolian sands were mainly derived from mixed source felsic granites and granodiorites, which have undergone weak sedimentary recycling. The chemical index of alteration and A–CN–K data indicated that the aeolian sediments were transported over a short distance. Comparison of trace element and rare earth element (REE) ratios of the aeolian sands with rock samples from potential source areas has revealed that aeolian sand deposits in the Hetao Plain were mainly derived from Sertengshan and Yellow River sediments. The Langshan and Ordos Plateau may represent additional sand sources for the Hetao Plain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeolian sands 3agranodiorite 3apaleoecology 3aprovenance 3arare earth elements 3arecycling 3asand 3atrace elements 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aAeolian sand 0aGeochemistry 0aTrace and rare earth elements 0aSediment provenance 0aHetao Plain1 aCai, Maotang1 aYe, Peisheng1 aYe, Mengni1 aLi, Chenglu1 aWu, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6709-23981 aLü, Jing,1 aWang, Tao1 aZhao, Zhirong1 aLuzhou, Yangfan1 aLiu, Chao0 tAeolian research.g2018 June, v. 32 p.92-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12141x1875-96377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2018.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024003700112040001800149100001500167245008500182300001600267500026300283500001500546520213200561592002802693650001802721650002802739650002302767650001302790650001602803650001902819650000902838650003002847650000902877650001302886650001202899650001202911650001702923650001902940650002402959651000902983653002902992700001903021700001903040700002203059773012003081852000903201856011103210856008403321961001303405655001203418IND4395702520221120075245.0181002e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439570252DNAL7 a10113/70462hdl7 a10.1097/ss.0b013e3180471c722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaur, Anju10aSurface and subsurface solute transport properties at row and interrow positions  ap. 419-431.  aAffiliations: 1Dept. of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011. 2USDA-ARS, National Soil Tilth Laboratory, 2150 Pammel Dr., Ames, IA 50011.

A field experiment was carried out to evaluate surface and subsurface solute transport properties in plant row, nontrafficked interrow, and trafficked interrow positions. For this purpose, a plot of 14 × 14 m in a strip-cropped field with soybean (Glycine max L. Merr), corn (Zea mays L.), and oat (Avena L.) was selected. After harvesting the crops, surface (top 2 cm) electrical conductivity measurements were made by time domain reflectometry at 45 locations during a chloride pulse leaching experiment. At the conclusion of the pulse leaching experiment, 120-cm deep soil cores were collected at the 45 locations to measure the soil profile chemical distributions. No crop or row position effects were observed for surface-determined pore water velocities (v), whereas profile-determined v was greater in plant row versus interrow positions when averaged over all crops. Overall, the profile-determined v was slightly greater than the surface determined v, probably because of lower effective or mobile water contents. The profile-determined dispersion coefficient (D) was smaller in row positions than interrow positions in soybean and corn, perhaps because of surface ponding in the interrow positions of the crops resulting in macropore flow. Profile-determined D was greater in the interrow positions of soybean than oat, again reflecting possible macropore flow. Overall, the mean soil profile dispersivity (λ = 2.97 cm) was larger than the surface soil (λ = 1.02 cm). The local surface solute transport varied by row positions, whereas profile solute transport was affected by both row position and crop, perhaps due to surface ponding producing macropore flow in the trafficked and nontrafficked interrows of soybean and the trafficked interrows of corn. Thus, a one-dimensional solute transport model with a spatially distributed flux or potential controlled upper boundary condition must be used to model this system.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil profiles 3aelectrical conductivity 3aagricultural soils 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3amacropore flow 3aoats 3atime domain reflectometry 3acorn 3asoybeans 3asolutes 3atopsoil 3aAvena sativa 3astrip cropping 3asoil water movement 3aIowa 0asoil transport processes1 aJaynes, Dan B.1 aHorton, Robert1 aOchsner, Tyson E.0 tSoil science.g2007 June, v. 172, no. 6 p.419-431dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/70463Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ss.0b013e3180471c723Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01774naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010100156300002000257520062300277592002800900650002000928650001400948650002300962650000900985650001400994650001301008650001401021650001401035650001601049650002101065700001501086700001501101700001501116700001901131700001901150773012401169856007401293852000901367655001201376IND60667126520221120053913.0190919e20150121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066712652DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra14133d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ping10aPromoting effects of lanthanum on the catalytic activity of Au/TiO₂ nanotubes for CO oxidation  ap. 11989-11995.  aLanthanum-modified TiO₂ nanotube (NT) supported gold catalysts were prepared.

The catalytic activity of Au/TiO₂-NTs could be improved by modification with lanthanum.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agold 3alanthanum 3ananogold 3ananotubes 3aoxidation 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aGuo, Jiuli1 aZhao, Peng1 aZhu, Bolin1 aHuang, Weiping1 aZhang, Shoumin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 21, v. 5, no. 16 p.11989-11995dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra14133d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001300197245008300210300001400293506007600307520107700383592002801460506003701488650001001525650001301535650002501548650001101573650003001584650001301614650000901627650001601636650000901652650002301661650001801684650002301702653002501725653003501750653001601785653002001801653002301821700002101844700002001865700001501885773009101900856009101991852000902082655001202091IND60630917620221207123120.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063091762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.0092doi7 aPMC60771052pmcid7 a294561642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Hui10aPluripotent stem cells as a source of osteoblasts for bone tissue regeneration  ap. 31-45.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAppropriate and abundant sources of bone-forming osteoblasts are essential for bone tissue engineering. Pluripotent stem cells can self-renew and thereby offer a potentially unlimited supply of osteoblasts, a significant advantage over other cell sources. We generated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from transgenic mice expressing rat 2.3 kb type I collagen promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (Col2.3GFP), a reporter of the osteoblast lineage. We demonstrated that Col2.3GFP ESCs and iPSCs can be successfully differentiated to osteoblast lineage cells that express Col2.3GFP in vitro. We harvested GFP+ osteoblasts differentiated from ESCs. Genome wide gene expression profiles validated that ESC- and iPSC-derived osteoblasts resemble calvarial osteoblasts, and that Col2.3GFP expression serves as a marker for mature osteoblasts. Our results confirm the cell identity of ESC- and iPSC-derived osteoblasts and highlight the potential of pluripotent stem cells as a source of osteoblasts for regenerative medicine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abones 3acollagen 3aembryonic stem cells 3agenome 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amedicine 3amice 3aosteoblasts 3arats 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 3atransgenic animals 0aEmbryonic stem cells 0aInduced pluripotent stem cells 0aOsteoblasts 0aDifferentiation 0aTissue engineering1 aKimura, Takaharu1 aSwami, Srilatha1 aWu, Joy Y.0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Mar., v. 196 p.31-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011800166520110500284592002801389650001301417650001501430650002201445650001201467650001301479650001301492653001301505653002701518653004601545653002101591653002701612700001601639700001501655700001801670700001801688700001401706700001901720700001501739773010801754856008601862852000901948655001201957IND60770048920221123014034.0220531e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077004892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1193352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhao10aChitosan and carboxymethyl chitosan mimic biomineralization and promote microbially induced calcium precipitation  aThis research aimed to evaluate chitosan (CTS) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) as polysaccharides that could mimic the role of bacterial extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in the biomineralization process through bionic experiments. The introduction of COOH resulted in higher calcium precipitation efficiency of CMCS (65.07%) than CTS (55.66%). CaCO₃ nucleation on the surface of CTS and CMCS was triggered through the binding of Ca²⁺ to NH₂, OH, COOH and NHCOCH₃ groups. Moreover, the experiment of polysaccharides mediated biomineralization was conducted. The maximum calcium precipitation efficiency reached 96.07% with the addition of 0.15% CMCS. Combining the characterization results, the synergetic mineralization mechanisms between polysaccharides and bacteria were proposed. Among them, bacterial metabolic by-products (alkalinity), active groups and adhesion of polysaccharides played a significant role. This work provides a reference for further understanding of the biomineralization mechanism, and gives a new insight into the intensified strategies of MICP technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalkalinity 3abiomineralization 3acalcium 3achitosan 3apolymers 0aChitosan 0aCarboxymethyl chitosan 0aMicrobially induced calcium precipitation 0aNucleation sites 0aIntensified strategies1 aSu, Junfeng1 aAli, Amjad1 aYang, Wenshuo1 aZhang, Ruijie1 aLi, Yifei1 aZhang, Lingfei1 aLi, Jiawei0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 July 01, v. 287 p.119335-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1193353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01607naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013400156300002000290520050900310592002800819650001200847650001200859650001200871650001700883650002200900650001300922700001600935700001800951700001700969700001800986700001801004700001601022773012401038856007401162852000901236655001201245IND60667126620221120053934.0190919e20150211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066712662DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra14134b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yuan10aWater–ethanol solvent mixtures: a promising liquid environment for high quality positively-charged CdTe nanocrystal preparation  ap. 18379-18383.  aIn this work, the record for a photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of positively-charged CdTe nanocrystals (NCs) was brought up to 31%, by using a water–ethanol mixture as a new medium for NC synthesis.

After treatment, the mycological control examination and follow-up were performed two times: the first one within ten days after the completion of antifungal treatment, and the second one three months after the treatment initialization.A total of 120 patients finished the study: 80 from the SG and 40 from the CG. At the first mycological control examination of SG patients stools, we noted satisfactory antifungal and symptomatic effect in 56 out of 80 (70.0%) patients and 29 out of 40 (72.5%) in CG, with no statistically significant difference. However, at the second control stool examination, significantly higher percent (85%) of cured patients was recorded after three months of the recommended diet comparing with CG–17 out of 40 (42.5%).Results of this pilot study showed that patients who adhered to diet modification during and after treatment with nystatin had better outcomes of ICOG and strongly suggest the need for diet modification in these patients which recommendation could reduce excessive prescription of antifungals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3adiet 3afecal examination 3aintestines 3anystatin 0aIntestinal candidosis 0aAntifungal treatment 0aDietary modification1 aMomčilović, S.1 aPetrović, M.1 aRadulović, O.1 aStojanović, N.M.1 aArsić-Arsenijević, V.0 tJournal de mycologie médicale.g2018 Dec., v. 28, no. 4 p.623-627dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:12455x1156-52337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04293naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017100158300001800329520148800347592002801835596010601863596009601969596004202065596005702107596008102164596005602245596003502301596006002336596005502396596005902451596005502510596004502565596007902610650002502689650002302714650002002737650002602757650002602783650001802809650001702827650001602844650001702860650001702877650002002894650001002914650002302924650002602947650001202973650001602985653002603001653003303027653002603060700002303086700002003109700002903129700002503158700002303183700002403206700002803230700002403258700002103282700002203303700002103325773013003346856007403476852000903550655001203559IND60673745820221118112102.0191019e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067374582DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcy1612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeda, Yōko,10aLoss of CG Methylation in Marchantia polymorpha Causes Disorganization of Cell Division and Reveals Unique DNA Methylation Regulatory Mechanisms of Non-CG Methylation  ap. 2421-2431.  aDNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that ensures silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and affects gene expression in many organisms. The function of different DNA methylation regulatory pathways has been largely characterized in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, far less is known about DNA methylation regulation and functions in basal land plants. Here we focus on the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, an emerging model species that represents a basal lineage of land plants. We identified MpMET, the M. polymorpha ortholog of the METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) gene required for maintenance of methylation at CG sites in angiosperms. We generated Mpmet mutants using the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein9) system, which showed a significant loss of CG methylation and severe morphological changes and developmental defects. The mutants developed many adventitious shoot-like structures, suggesting that MpMET is required for maintaining differentiated cellular identities in the gametophyte. Even though numerous TEs were up-regulated, non-CG methylation was generally highly increased at TEs in the Mpmet mutants. Closer inspection of CHG methylation revealed features unique to M. polymorpha. Methylation of CCG sites in M. polymorpha does not depend on MET1, unlike in A. thaliana and Physcomitrella patens. Our results highlight the diversity of non-CG methylation regulatory mechanisms in plants.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001700  a15K18578cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  cWesco Scientific Promotion Foundation  a658900cMarie Sklodowska-Curie individual fellowship  a16-425cNational Institute for Basic Biology Collaborative Research Programs  aCB158550cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  aCA-UVER-234cCuerpo Académico  cAgropolis Fondationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007599  aNA150181cRoyal Society Newton Advanced Fellowship  aRG79985 to M.A.A.V.cRoyal Society Research Fellowship  a(629316)cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologí  cUniversité Clermont Auvergne and INSERM  aI2ST 260742cEuropean Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010663 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aDNA methylation 3aMarchantia polymorpha 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3acell division 3aembryophytes 3aepigenetics 3agametophytes 3agene editing 3agene expression 3agenes 3amethyltransferases 3amosses and liverworts 3amutants 3atransposons 0aDNA methyltransferase 0aRNA-directed DNA methylation 0aTransposable elements1 aNishihama, Ryuichi1 aYamaoka, Shohei1 aArteaga-Vazquez, Mario A1 aAguilar-Cruz, Adolfo1 aGrimanelli, Daniel1 aPogorelcnik, Romain1 aMartienssen, Robert A.,1 aYamato, Katsuyuki T1 aKohchi, Takayuki1 aHirayama, Takashi1 aMathieu, Olivier0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 59, no. 12 p.2421-2431dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcy1613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100005500143245010900198300001600307520131300323592002801636650002201664650001501686650001501701650002301716650001701739650001801756650001701774650001101791650001701802650001301819653002501832653001701857653002101874653001801895700001301913700001101926700001601937700001301953773014101966856007802107852000902185655001202194IND60778484420221118121321.0220528e20220524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077848442DNAL7 a10.3920/JIFF2021.00812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, J.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2867-187210aEffects of antibiotics on the development and intestinal bacterial diversity of black soldier fly larvae  ap. 495-508.  aThe effects of four antibiotics (metronidazole (M) levofloxacin (L), sodium ampicillin (A), and streptomycin sulphate (S)) and their pair-wise combinations at three doses on the development and intestinal bacterial diversity of the black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens) larvae were studied. At a low dose M and L were able to inhibit larval growth. At a high dose, all antibiotics were shown to inhibit larval growth. However, the pair-wise combinational use of the antibiotics did not effectively enhance the inhibitory effect. The gut bacterial diversity of the normal control (NC) was significantly higher than the antibiotic-treated groups with 737 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the larval guts of NC, compared to 305 and 227 from ML and AS. The number of anaerobic bacteria in ML was significantly lower than in NC and AS, with the relative abundance of OTUs from larval guts of ML being only about 0.01, compared to 0.4 for NC and 0.15 for AS. These results indicated that antibiotics at the experimental concentration did not affect the palatability of food for insects, but they would affect the diversity of food and intestinal microorganisms of BSF larvae, and the inhibitory effect of antibiotics on growth and development of BSF larvae displayed in this study was a complex effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3aampicillin 3aintestines 3alarval development 3alevofloxacin 3ametronidazole 3apalatability 3asodium 3astreptomycin 3asulfates 0aantibiotic treatment 0agut bacteria 0abody weight gain 0apupation rate1 aMeng, Y.1 aXu, J.1 aRensing, C.1 aWang, D.0 tJournal of insects as food and feed.g2022 May 24, v. 8, no. 5 p.495-508dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:27298x2352-45887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/JIFF2021.00813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245007900154300001600233520223900249592002802488650001302516650001602529650001802545650001802563650002002581650001102601650001802612650001202630650002302642650004302665650002102708650001602729700001902745700002102764700001302785700001402798700001602812700001502828700002602843773012302869856007302992852000903065655001203074IND60132627120221119165956.0150505e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013262712DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.120892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunkel, B.10aSevere hypertriglyceridaemia in horses and ponies with endocrine disorders  ap. 118-122.  aREASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia in horses and ponies with endocrine disorders has been reported anecdotally but has not been documented in the literature. OBJECTIVES: To describe historical and clinicopathological findings as well as progression and outcome in horses and ponies with severe hypertriglyceridaemia (serum triglyceride concentration >5.65 mmol/l) secondary to an endocrine disorder that were otherwise apparently healthy. METHODS: Cases from 6 participating institutions were identified and case details extracted from the medical records. RESULTS: Case details of 3 horses and 4 ponies were available. Presenting complaints included weight loss despite good appetite in 4 animals, while in 3 hypertriglyceridaemia was identified incidentally. All animals were bright and alert and showed a normal or increased appetite. Serum triglyceride concentrations ranged from 10.5 to 60.3 mmol/l. Other abnormalities included hyperglycaemia in 6 animals, suspected insulin resistance and mild to severe increases in hepatic enzyme activities. In 2 animals, moderate hepatic lipidosis was confirmed histologically. Three horses and 3 ponies were diagnosed with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction based on clinical signs and basal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations or dexamethasone suppression test results. In 5 of these, type 2 diabetes mellitus was also confirmed, while one pony suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus without concurrent pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction. Laboratory abnormalities improved in 4 animals with treatment (pergolide and/or insulin), in one horse specific treatment was not attempted, and in 2 ponies treatment was impaired by the owner or only partly effective. In one of the latter cases, biochemical abnormalities persisted for 7 years without apparent ill effects. CONCLUSIONS AND POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Horses and ponies may develop severe hypertriglyceridaemia secondary to endocrine disorders that are associated with insulin resistance. Hypertriglyceridaemia can resolve with treatment of the endocrinopathy. Although biochemical evidence of hepatic compromise was present, clinical abnormalities were not noted in these animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3ablood serum 3acorticotropin 3adexamethasone 3aenzyme activity 3ahorses 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight loss1 aWilford, S.

The risk of spread of M. bovis infection currently prevents translocation of white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) from this population. Therefore, accurate assays are necessary for screening this threatened species. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRA) are commonly used for tuberculosis diagnosis in humans and other wildlife species. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop an IGRA for M. bovis detection in white rhinoceros. Heparinized whole blood was collected from immobilized white rhinoceros in KNP (n = 131) and incubated overnight in QuantiFERON®-TB Gold (QFT) blood collection tubes, after which the plasma was harvested following centrifugation. Tissue samples for mycobacterial culture were available from a subset of 21 rhinoceros. The concentration of IFN-γ in plasma samples was measured using the Mabtech equine IFN-γ ELISAPRO. An IGRA result was calculated as the difference in IFN- γ concentrations in the QFT Nil and TB antigen tubes. Using test results for the white rhinoceros with known infection status, a diagnostic cut-off value was calculated as 21 pg/ml. Additionally, cut-off values for IFN-γ concentrations for plasma from QFT Nil and QFT Mitogen tubes were calculated to increase confidence in IGRA result interpretation. The combination of the QFT stimulation platform and Mabtech equine IFN-γ ELISA is a promising diagnostic test to distinguish between of M. bovis-infected and -uninfected white rhinoceros.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratotherium simum 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aantigens 3ablood plasma 3ablood sampling 3abovine tuberculosis 3acentrifugation 3ahorses 3ahumans 3ainterferon-gamma 3amitogens 3anational parks 3arisk 3ascreening 3athreatened species 3awildlife 3aSouth Africa 0ainterferon gamma release assay 0awhite rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum)1 aRoos, Eduard O.1 aGoosen, Wynand J.1 aBuss, Peter1 aHausler, Guy1 aRossouw, Leana1 aManemela, Tebogo1 aVan Helden, Paul,1 aWarren, Robin1 aParsons, Sven DC1 aMiller, Michele0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2019 Aug. 14, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2019.1099313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245017000173300001600343520171400359592002802073650001402101650002302115650002002138650001102158650001802169650001602187650001202203650001802215650002902233650001902262653003102281653002002312653003102332653002302363653002902386700002002415773009602435856008402531852000902615655001202624IND60600673320221119053449.0180703e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060067332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2013.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, Robynne E.10aExperimental study of the phase change and energy characteristics inside a cylindrical latent heat energy storage system: Part 1 consecutive charging and discharging  ap. 571-581.  aSolar domestic hot water (SDHW) systems are a cost effective and efficient way to pre-heat domestic water for hot water use in buildings. Currently used sensible energy storage systems (commonly using water as the storage medium) are simple and inexpensive, but require large amounts of storage material, and therefore are heavy and take up considerable space. Latent heat energy storage systems (LHESS) store the energy absorbed/released when a material goes through a phase transition: these materials are called phase change materials (PCMs). Because of the large quantities of energy that are stored during a phase change, latent heat energy storage is more dense than sensible energy storage, and can therefore reduce the weight and space requirements of the energy storage system. The main objective of this research is to study the heat transfer processes and phase change behavior of a PCM during consecutive charging and discharging of a LHESS. This leads to better understanding of the melting and solidification processes in order to optimize future LHESS design.In part 1 of this paper the design of a LHESS that can operate under both consecutive and simultaneous charging and discharging modes is introduced. Dodecanoic acid is used as the PCM, as it has been shown to be safe, relatively inexpensive, and has a melting temperature in a range suitable for use with SDHW. Experimental results of consecutively charging and discharging the system are presented and the effect of the heat transfer fluid flow rate is explored. It was found that during charging a faster flow rate leads to shorter melting times; however, during discharging, the flow rate does not affect the rate of solidification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acost effectiveness 3adodecanoic acid 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3alatent heat 3amelting 3amelting point 3arenewable energy sources 3asolidification 0aLatent heat energy storage 0aDodecanoic acid 0aPhase change heat transfer 0aNatural convection 0aSolar domestic hot water1 aGroulx, Dominic0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Feb., v. 62 p.571-581dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245008000178300001600258520116200274592002801436650001601464650001401480650001801494650001501512650001801527650001101545650001401556650001801570650001401588653002301602653001901625653002301644653003101667700002201698700003001720700002401750773011801774856008701892852000901979655001201988IND50060409120221122041002.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006040912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.02.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurchiuli, Christelle10aProduction of fine emulsions at pilot scale for oil compounds encapsulation  ap. 452-458.  aFeasibility of producing, at pilot scale (5kg), stable oil in water emulsions with size of 1–2μm and 100–200nm was investigated in relation with the oil content of the emulsion (4%, 8% and 12%w/w) and with the composition of the aqueous phase.Sunflower oil was used as a model for oil-based compounds. Acacia gum (AG) was used as emulsifier and protective support in association with maltodextrin (MD) with DE 12 or 21 (weight ratio MD/AG=3/2). Emulsions, with 40%w/w dry matter (carriers and oil), were produced using first a high shear disperser (30min) leading to coarse emulsions (∼2μm) and then a high pressure homogeniser (4min recirculation) leading to sub-micron emulsions (∼200nm).Viscosity, size and size distribution of emulsions were found to be mainly governed by the aqueous phase viscosity. Maltodextrin DE 12 leading to more viscous aqueous phases was found to be more efficient for the production of finer emulsions. Whatever the composition, no oil oxidation was observed after processing and after 2weeks storage. After 3weeks, coarse emulsions presented two phases whilst the submicron ones were stable after more than 2months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3agum arabic 3alipid content 3amodels 3aoxidation 3asunflower oil 3aviscosity 0aMicroencapsulation 0aEmulsification 0aSubmicron emulsion 0aEmulsion size distribution1 aLemarié, Nicolas1 aCuvelier, Marie-Elisabeth1 aDumoulin, Elisabeth0 tJournal of food engineering.g2013 Apr., v. 115, no. 4 p.452-458dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001700150245011300167300001600280520143100296592002801727650002101755650001601776650002501792650001401817650001401831650001201845650001501857650001701872650001501889650001801904650001101922650001601933650001701949651001201966700001901978700001801997700001402015700002102029700001402050700001402064700001302078700001602091773008602107856008602193852000902279655001202288IND4479331420221122010827.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447933142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindedam, J.10aCultivar variation and selection potential relevant to the production of cellulosic ethanol from wheat straw  ap. 221-228.  aOptimizing cellulosic ethanol yield depends strongly on understanding the biological variation of feedstocks. Our objective was to study variation in capacity for producing fermentable sugars from straw of winter wheat cultivars with a high-throughput pretreatment and hydrolysis well-plate technique. This technique enabled us to estimate cultivar-related and environmental correlations between sugar yield, chemical composition, agronomic qualities, and distribution of botanical plant parts of wheat straw cultivars. Straws from 20 cultivars were collected in duplicates on two sites in Denmark. Following hydrothermal pretreatment (180Â Â°C for 17.6Â min) and co-hydrolysis, sugar release and sugar conversion were measured. Up to 26% difference in sugar release between cultivars was observed. Sugar release showed negative cultivar correlation with lignin and ash content, whereas sugar release showed positive cultivar correlation with content of carbohydrates and plant height. Accessibility to cellulose can impede the sugar conversion rate, and convertibility of each botanical fraction might be more important to overall sugar conversion than the relative proportions of botanical fractions. Our results suggest that selection of cultivars for improved biofuel feedstock of wheat straw is possible, because heritability of sugar release is 57% and there are few adverse correlations to other agronomic traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomic traits 3aash content 3acarbohydrate content 3acellulose 3acultivars 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3aheritability 3ahydrolysis 3aplant anatomy 3asugars 3awheat straw 3awinter wheat 3aDenmark1 aAndersen, S.B.1 aDeMartini, J.1 aBruun, S.1 aJÃ¸rgensen, H.1 aFelby, C.1 aMagid, J.1 aYang, B.1 aWyman, C.E.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2012 Feb., v. 37 p.221-228dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245007900174520171100253592002801964650001701992650001902009650002002028650001302048650002002061650001102081650002902092650002902121650002102150650001302171650001102184650001202195650002302207650002002230650001102250650001202261650000902273650000902282650001802291651001302309653002002322653001102342653001902353653001202372653001102384653002002395700005902415700001802474773012302492856008802615961001302703852000902716655001202725IND60659257120221116160257.0210812e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065925712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.1077092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReba, Michele L.10aFallow season CO2 and CH4 fluxes from US mid-south rice-waterfowl habitats  aFlooding rice fields in the US mid-south during the fallow season (November–March) for migratory waterfowl habitats provides revenue from hunting-related activities and helps with soil retention and water quality. However, flooding has the potential to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Research on GHG emissions in US mid-south during the fallow season has been limited. Eddy covariance (EC) systems measuring CO₂ and CH₄ fluxes were installed during the 2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018 fallow seasons at paired production-sized fields in NE Arkansas. Rice residue was burned after harvest at both field locations. The paired fields were separated by an access road and consisted of one field flooded (F) with precipitation by installing barriers to prevent drainage and the other field allowed to drain or non-flooded field (NF). Flooding did not influence CO₂ emissions during the fallow season significantly. However, F fields emitted 45 ± 2% more CH₄ than NF fields. The three-year fallow season average was 1408 ± 185 kg CO₂-C ha⁻¹ season-1 and 12.5 ± 2.0 kg CH₄-C ha⁻¹ season-1 in F fields and 1355 ± 132 kg CO₂-C ha⁻¹ season-1 and 8.6 ± 1.4 kg CH₄-C ha⁻¹ season-1 in NF fields. Methane contributed 5 to 10% global warming potential (GWP), reported as CO₂ equivalents from CO₂ and CH₄ measurements. The three-year fallow season average GWP was not different by treatment. Increases in fallow season GWP were noted to increase after rice cultivation. These findings will improve our overall understanding and modeling of GHG emissions from agricultural fields during an understudied but important period of the year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acarbon dioxide 3acrop production 3adrainage 3aeddy covariance 3afallow 3aglobal warming potential 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahabitats 3aincome 3amethane 3amethane production 3amigratory birds 3amodels 3apaddies 3arice 3asoil 3awater quality 3aArkansas 0aEddy covariance 0aFluxes 0aCarbon dioxide 0aMethane 0aFallow 0aWinter flooding1 aFong, Bryant N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4553-14921 aRijal, Ishara0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 279 p.107709-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.1077093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245015300178300001600331520200600347592002802353650001502381650001102396650001402407650001602421650001102437650001302448650001302461650002902474650001802503653001902521653003302540653003302573653002502606653001602631653003002647700002302677700002502700773009602725856008402821852000902905655001202914IND60600673520221119053401.0180703e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060067352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2013.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Gunter Reinald10aMulti-objective optimisation of horizontal axis wind turbine structure and energy production using aerofoil and blade properties as design variables  ap. 506-515.  aThe design of wind turbine blades is a true multi-objective engineering task. The aerodynamic effectiveness of the turbine needs to be balanced with the system loads introduced by the rotor. Moreover the problem is not dependent on a single geometric property, but besides other parameters on a combination of aerofoil family and various blade functions. The aim of this paper is therefore to present a tool which can help designers to get a deeper insight into the complexity of the design space and to find a blade design which is likely to have a low cost of energy. For the research we use a Computational Blade Optimisation and Load Deflation Tool (CoBOLDT) to investigate the three extreme point designs obtained from a multi-objective optimisation of turbine thrust, annual energy production as well as mass for a horizontal axis wind turbine blade. The optimisation algorithm utilised is based on Multi-Objective Tabu Search which constitutes the core of CoBOLDT. The methodology is capable to parametrise the spanning aerofoils with two-dimensional Free Form Deformation and blade functions with two tangentially connected cubic splines. After geometry generation we use a panel code to create aerofoil polars and a stationary Blade Element Momentum code to evaluate turbine performance. Finally, the obtained loads are fed into a structural layout module to estimate the mass and stiffness of the current blade by means of a fully stressed design. For the presented test case we chose post optimisation analysis with parallel coordinates to reveal geometrical features of the extreme point designs and to select a compromise design from the Pareto set. The research revealed that a blade with a feasible laminate layout can be obtained, that can increase the energy capture and lower steady state systems loads. The reduced aerofoil camber and an increased L/D-ratio could be identified as the main drivers. This statement could not be made with other tools of the research community before.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ablades 3adeflation 3adeformation 3aenergy 3ageometry 3amomentum 3arenewable energy sources 3awind turbines 0aBernoulli beam 0aHorizontal axis wind turbine 0aMulti-objective optimisation 0aParallel coordinates 0aTabu search 0aWind turbine blade design1 aKipouros, Timoleon1 aSavill, Anthony Mark0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Feb., v. 62 p.506-515dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245014100172300001400313520139900327592002801726650001701754650002101771650001901792650001601811650003001827650001901857650001701876650003801893650002501931650001001956650001101966650002501977650002602002650003002028650001102058650002602069650001602095650004302111650001502154650002302169653002102192653003002213653001902243653001702262653001602279653002502295700001902320700001402339700001802353700002302371700002302394700001902417700002102436700001702457773009102474856009002565852000902655655001202664IND60630918120221121064611.0190214e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063091812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Linxiao10aStiffness memory of indirectly 3D-printed elastomer nanohybrid regulates chondrogenesis and osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells  ap. 64-79.  aThe cellular microenvironment is dynamic, remodeling tissues lifelong. The biomechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) influence the function and differentiation of stem cells. While conventional artificial matrices or scaffolds for tissue engineering are primarily static models presenting well-defined stiffness, they lack the responsive changes required in dynamic physiological settings. Engineering scaffolds with varying elastic moduli is possible, but often lead to stiffening and chemical crosslinking of the molecular structure with limited control over the scaffold architecture. A family of indirectly 3D printed elastomeric nanohybrid scaffolds with thermoresponsive mechanical properties that soften by reverse self-assembling at body temperature have been developed recently. The initial stiffness and subsequent stiffness relaxation of the scaffolds regulated proliferation and differentiation of human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) towards the chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages over 4 weeks, as measured by immunohistochemistry, histology, ELISA and qPCR. hBM-MSCs showed enhanced chondrogenic differentiation on softer scaffolds and osteogenic differentiation on stiffer ones, with similar relative expression to that of human femoral head tissue. Overall, stiffness relaxation favored osteogenic activity over chondrogenesis in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomechanics 3abody temperature 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3acellular microenvironment 3achondrogenesis 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aextracellular matrix 3afemur 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amechanical properties 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananohybrids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 0aStiffness memory 0aStem cell differentiation 0aChondrogenesis 0aOsteogenesis 0a3D printing 0aElastomer nanohybrid1 aMagaz, Adrián1 aWang, Tao1 aLiu, Chaozong1 aDarbyshire, Arnold1 aLoizidou, Marilena1 aEmberton, Mark1 aBirchall, Martin1 aSong, Wenhui0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Dec., v. 186 p.64-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010900169500001900278520172200297592002802019650002802047650002402075650001602099650001402115650001202129650001402141650001402155650001702169650002102186650002102207650001602228650001402244650001702258650002702275653001502302653000902317653000902326653002002335653002102355653001302376653003702389653001602426653002202442653003202464653002102496653003002517653002002547700001702567700002202584700001902606700003702625700002202662773011002684856008602794852000902880655001202889IND60704700520221121110342.0201023e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070470052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2020.1079482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Nivedita10aImmunomodulator mediated changes in plasma membrane calcium ATPase in controlling visceral leishmaniasis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImmunomodulation is an emerging concept to combat infection in recent years. Immunomodulators like arabinosylated-lipoarabinomannan (Ara-LAM) and glycyrrhizic-acid (GA) possess anti-leishmanial property, whereas sodium-antimony-gluconate (SAG) is still considered as the first choice for chemotherapy against leishmaniasis. During infection, invasion of Leishmania donovani needs the potential requirement of Ca²⁺, which is further responsible for apoptosis in intracellular amastigotes. However, suppression of elevated intracellular calcium by the activation of plasma-membrane-calcium-ATPase (PMCA4) facilitates survival of L. donovani in the host. In the present study, SAG, Ara-LAM, and GA were found to evoke significant increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ in L. donovani infected macrophages by inhibiting PMCA4. Moreover, PMCA4 inhibition by TFP or PMCA4 siRNA elevated the level of PKCβ, whereas calcium-independent upregulation of PKCζ remained unchanged in infected macrophages. Furthermore, application of immunomodulators in infected macrophages resulted in down-regulation of PKCζ, conversion of anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of PMCA4. Plasma membrane-associated ceramide which is known to be elevated during leishmaniasis, triggered upregulation of PMCA4 via PKCζ activation. Interestingly, immunomodulators attenuated ceramide generation, which resulted into reduced PKCζ activation leading to the decreased PMCA expression in infected macrophages. Therefore, our study elucidated the efficacy of SAG, Ara-LAM, and GA in the reduction of parasite burden in macrophages by suppressing PMCA activation through inhibition of ceramide mediated upregulation of PKCζ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3aLeishmania donovani 3aamastigotes 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3aceramides 3acytokines 3adrug therapy 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunomodulators 3amacrophages 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3avisceral leishmaniasis 0aLeishmania 0aCa2+ 0aPMCA 0aImmunomodulator 0aProtein kinase C 0aCeramide 0aArabinosylated lipoarabinomannan 0aCalcium ion 0aGlycyrrhizic acid 0aPlasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 0aProtein kinase C 0aSodium antimony gluconate 0aTrifluoperazine1 aGhosh, Sweta1 aJuin, Subir Kumar1 aGhosh, Rishila1 aMajumdar, Suchandra Bhattacharya1 aMajumdar, Subrata0 tExperimental parasitology.g2020 Oct., v. 217 p.107948-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2020.1079483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010300155300001600258520159100274592002801865650002101893650001101914650001601925650001601941650001701957650003601974650001302010650001502023650001102038650001102049650001802060650001202078650001602090650003702106700001602143700002002159700001302179700001702192773012302209856007302332852000902405655001202414IND60132627620221119165621.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013262762DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.122352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRout, E.

This study investigated transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression in exosomes as a noninvasive method of characterising the regenerative response in anaemic horses. OBJECTIVES: To quantify TfR1 in ultraprecipitate of serum in horses before and after phlebotomy‐induced anaemia, and to identify exosomes as the source of TfR1. The hypothesis was that serum exosomal TfR1 expression would increase during a regenerative response. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental model of anaemia. METHODS: Six horses were phlebotomised to achieve a 25% decrease in packed cell volume. Transferrin receptor 1 quantity in exosomes was determined by western blot and relative densitometry before and after phlebotomy. The size and density of the TfR1‐associated particles were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and density gradient centrifugation, respectively. RESULTS: Regenerative anaemia was confirmed by decreased packed cell volumes and decreased myeloid:erythroid ratios in the bone marrow. In all 6 horses, TfR1 expression increased between Days 7 and 10. Mean TfR1 levels peaked on Day 10 and at 3‐fold higher than levels on Day 0. Appropriately sized particles were evident on transmission electron microscopy and sucrose density gradient fractions expected to contain exosomes also contained TfR1. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that TfR1 expression in serum exosomes may provide a marker for regeneration in anaemic horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanemia 3ablood serum 3abone marrow 3adensitometry 3adensity gradient centrifugation 3aexosomes 3ahematocrit 3ahorses 3amodels 3areticulocytes 3asucrose 3atransferrin 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWEBB, T.

Chitosan is derived from chitin by deacetylation process. It is important to note that the conventional chemical method of extracting chitin includes disadvantages and it poses various environmental issues. Recently, the green extraction techniques have perceived substantial development in the field of polymer chemistry. A variety of methods have been successfully developed using green extraction techniques for extracting chitin and chitosan from various resources. It includes the use of ionic liquids (ILs), deep eutectic solvents (DES), microbial fermentation, enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE), subcritical water extraction (SWE), and electrochemical extraction (ECE).

A total of 432 Cobb‐500 day‐old male broiler chicks were used in a 4 × 2 factorial design (0, 100, 200 or 300 g kg⁻¹ sDDGS with or without xylanase supplementation). Each treatment was replicated six times with nine birds per replicate in a 35 day study. RESULTS: Feed intake was increased (P < 0.001) throughout the study with the inclusion of dietary sDDGS. Body weight gain (BWG) was unaffected except for the last 2 weeks of study, when birds that received 200 and 300 g kg⁻¹ sDDGS had higher (P < 0.001) BWG. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) increased (P < 0.05) as sDDGS in the diet rose to 100 g kg⁻¹ during the starter phase and the whole period of study. Over the starter period, xylanase supplementation improved (P < 0.05) FCR, particularly for the highest inclusion of sDDGS. Protein digestibility deteriorated (P < 0.001) as sDDGS in the diet rose to 300 g kg⁻¹. Xylanase reduced (P < 0.001) the concentration of xylose in the ileum of birds. The activities of sucrase and maltase in the jejunal mucosa were reduced when birds were offered 200 and 300 g kg⁻¹ sDDGS. Incorporation of sDDGS increased (P < 0.01) the total short‐chain fatty acid concentration in the caeca. CONCLUSION: The results showed that diets containing large amounts of sDDGS will benefit from xylanase supplementation, particularly in terms of FCR. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abroiler chickens 3acecum 3achicks 3adigestible protein 3adistillers grains 3afatty acid composition 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aileum 3amucosa 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3aweight gain 3axylanases 3axylose 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aDietxstandardsxveterinary. 2aDietary Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDietary Supplements 2aDigestion 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxpharmacology 2aEnergy Intakexdrug effects 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmetabolism 2aIntestinesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aNutritive Value 2aPlant Preparationsxpharmacology 2aSorghum 2aSucrasexmetabolism 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 2aXylosexmetabolism1 aChoct, Mingan1 aIji, Paul A0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2013 May, v. 93, no. 7 p.1552-1559dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5992  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010300174300001600277520150300293592002801796650002301824650002101847650001601868650001801884650001301902650001201915650001201927650001501939650001301954650001401967650001301981650002701994650001302021650001502034650001302049650001402062650000902076650001102085650001802096650001402114653002302128653003002151653001802181653001602199653001402215700006002229700002002289773014302309856008502452852000902537655001202546IND60635270120221119203010.0201202e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063527012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2017.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinzelmann, Renate10aFrequent diploidisation of haploid Armillaria ostoyae strains in an outdoor inoculation experiment  ap. 147-155.  aVery little is known about the biology and ecology of haploid Armillaria strains in nature. In this outdoor inoculation experiment, we assessed the virulence of six haploid Armillariaostoyae strains along with their diploid parent towards 2-year-old seedlings and 4-year-old saplings of Norway spruce (Picea abies), and determined their ability to colonise freshly cut stumps. As inoculum source an Armillaria-colonised hazelnut (Corylus avellana) stem segment was inserted into the soil substrate. Re-isolations from mycelial fans at the root collar of infected trees or stumps were made. Surprisingly, not a single haploid re-isolate could be recovered. Microsatellite genotyping of 133 re-isolates suggests that the inoculated haploid strains were diploidised either by mating propagules (basidiospores or haploid mycelia) already present in the soil substrate or naturally disseminated in the course of the experiment from nearby forests. Consequently, no conclusion about the infectious ability of haploid Armillaria mycelia under natural conditions can be drawn. Nonetheless, the diploid half-sib families resulting from the diploidisation showed varying degrees of virulence, with a high correlation between the experiment with 2-year-old seedlings and 4-year-old saplings. Despite extensive genotyping of re-isolates, no evidence for somatic recombination between haploid mating propagules and diploidised mycelia was detected, suggesting that this is an uncommon phenomenon in A. ostoyae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArmillaria ostoyae 3aCorylus avellana 3aPicea abies 3abasidiospores 3adiploidy 3aecology 3aforests 3agenotyping 3ahaploidy 3ahazelnuts 3ainoculum 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amycelium 3aroot crown 3asaplings 3aseedlings 3asoil 3astumps 3atree diseases 3avirulence 0aArmillaria ostoyae 0aMicrosatellite genotyping 0aPathogenicity 0aPicea abies 0aSeedlings1 aProspero, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9129-85561 aRigling, Daniel0 tFungal biology.g2018 Feb.,  Mar., v. 122, no. 2-3 p.147-155dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2017.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012100156300001400277520171600291592002802007650001102035650000802046650001902054650002702073650001302100650001002113650001402123650002602137650001602163650002102179650001302200700001902213700002002232700001902252773012102271856007302392852000902465655001202474IND60132627720221119165531.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013262772DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.122462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnych, H.

The pharmacokinetics and the plasma concentration‐related behavioural actions of fentanyl have not been described for young foals. OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present study was to describe the pharmacokinetics and behavioural effects of fentanyl following administration to the same group of foals at 3 different ages. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study in healthy foals. METHODS: Fentanyl was administered i.v. (4 μg/kg bwt) to a group of 9 foals on 3 separate occasions at 6–8, 20–22 and 41–42 days of age. Blood samples were collected prior to administration and at multiple times until 24 h post administration. Blood samples were analysed for fentanyl concentrations and pharmacokinetics determined at each age. Behavioural and physiological effects were also assessed. RESULTS: The average volume of distribution was 3.55, 1.53 and 1.82 l/kg bwt and clearance 50.2, 40.7 and 35.7 ml/min/kg bwt when foals were 6–8, 20–22 and 41–42 days of age, respectively. The elimination half‐life was slightly prolonged (49.3 min) at 6–8 days relative to 20–22 and 41–42 days of age (25.8 and 33.7 min, respectively). The primary metabolite detected in blood samples was the same as for adult horses. While the onset and duration varied widely between foals, sedation was observed at all ages studied. CONCLUSIONS: Fentanyl appears to be consistently well tolerated following i.v. administration of 4 μg/kg bwt to foals ranging in age from 1 to 6 weeks. The results of this study support further study of fentanyl for clinical use in foals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aage 3ablood sampling 3acentral nervous system 3afentanyl 3afoals 3ahalf life 3aintravenous injection 3ametabolites 3apharmacokinetics 3asedation1 aSteffey, E.

The as-prepared GO-Fe₃O₄@P was further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), BET analysis, zeta potential analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the characterization results revealed that core–shell structural Fe₃O₄@P microspheres were covalently bonded onto the GO sheet. The adsorption characteristics of the GO-Fe₃O₄@P intended for removal of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) were investigated. Batch adsorption studies were carried out to optimize adsorption conditions. The effect of solution pH, adsorption isotherm, kinetics, and thermodynamics was deeply investigated. The results indicated that the adsorption property of GO-Fe₃O₄@P was highly pH dependent and the adsorption mechanism referred to hydrogen bond and π–π stacking interactions. The adsorption data for 2,4,6-TCP onto GO-Fe₃O₄@P was well fitted to a Langmuir isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity (qₘ) of GO-Fe₃O₄@P to 2,4,6-TCP was found to be 232.6 mg g⁻¹. Kinetic results showed that the adsorption reached equilibrium within 4 min, 10 min, and 60 min for initial 2,4,6-TCP concentrations of 10 mg L⁻¹, 100 mg L⁻¹, and 500 mg L⁻¹, respectively. The data of adsorption kinetics obeyed the pseudo-second-order rate model well. Thermodynamic parameters such as ΔHᶿ, ΔSᶿ, and ΔGᶿ for the 2,4,6-TCP adsorption onto GO-Fe₃O₄@P have been estimated, suggesting the adsorption process was endothermic and entropy favored in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4,6-trichlorophenol 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aendothermy 3aentropy 3agraphene 3ahydrogen bonding 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3amicroparticles 3apH 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asorption isotherms 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential1 aMin, Jian-Qing1 aPan, Sheng-Dong1 aJin, Mi-Cong0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 24, v. 4, no. 108 p.63494-63501dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra14150d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04083naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008100161300001400242500001500256520238700271592002802658650001002686650001402696650001702710650001302727650001902740650001302759650001602772650001402788650001502802650001602817650000902833650001302842650001502855650001902870650001502889650001402904650001902918650001802937650004202955650002102997650002403018650001903042650001503061650001803076650001303094650001103107650001703118653001203135700001803147700001703165700001703182700002003199700003503219773012103254856007303375852000903448655001203457IND60132627820221119165826.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013262782DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.122572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWohlfender, F.

OBJECTIVES: To collect data on current practice in equine anaesthesia and to recruit participants for CEPEF‐4. STUDY DESIGN: Online questionnaire survey. METHODS: An online questionnaire was prepared and the link distributed internationally to veterinarians possibly performing equine anaesthesia, using emails, posters, flyers and an editorial. The questionnaire included 52 closed, semiclosed and open questions divided into 8 subgroups: demographic data, anaesthetist, anaesthesia management (preoperative, technical equipment, monitoring, drugs, recovery), areas of improvements and risks and motivation for participation in CEPEF‐4. Descriptive statistics and Chi‐squared tests for comparison of categorical variables were performed. RESULTS: A total of 199 questionnaires were completed by veterinarians from 14 different countries. Of the respondents, 43% worked in private hospitals, 36% in private practices and 21% in university teaching hospitals. In 40 institutions (23%) there was at least one diplomate of the European or American colleges of veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia on staff. Individual respondents reported routinely employ the following anaesthesia monitoring modalities: electrocardiography (80%), invasive arterial blood pressures (70%), pulse oximetry (60%), capnography (55%), arterial blood gases (47%), composition of inspired and expired gases (45%) and body temperature (35%). Drugs administered frequently or routinely as part of a standard protocol were: acepromazine (44%), xylazine (68%), butorphanol (59%), ketamine (96%), diazepam (83%), isoflurane (76%), dobutamine (46%), and, as a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug, phenylbutazone (73%) or flunixin meglumine (66%). Recovery was routinely assisted by 40%. The main factors perceived by the respondents to affect outcome of equine anaesthesia were the preoperative health status of the animal and training of the anaesthetist. CONCLUSIONS: Current practice in equine anaesthesia varies widely, and the study has highlighted important topics relevant for designing a future prospective multicentre cohort study (CEPEF‐4).

Here, hydrosilane-mediated hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the furanic mixture 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF), directly derived from cellulosic biomass, can be enabled by heterogeneous Pd-catalyzed dechlorination to exclusively give the biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) in a high overall yield of 72%. Kinetic and isotope labeling studies supported by computational calculations explicitly elucidate the reaction pathways. The initial dechlorination of CMF into acidic species promotes the rapid in situ formation of relatively stable acetalized and etherified furanic intermediates, which not only greatly accelerate the reactivity of the entire HDO process (TOF: up to 1200 h⁻¹), but are also able to significantly get rid of unwanted side reactions. Importantly, this catalytic system can also be applied for the upgrade of various chlorinated carboxides to produce ortho-, meta- and para-substituted arenes with satisfactory yields of 82–99% at 25–45 °C, and the used commercial Pd/C catalyst is highly recyclable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adechlorination 3afeedstocks 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aisotope labeling 3apalladium 3apolymers1 aWang, Changhong1 aXu, Yufei1 aYu, Zhaozhuo1 aSaravanamurugan, Shunmugavel1 aWu, Zhilei1 aYang, Song1 aLuque, Rafael0 tGreen chemistry.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 22, no. 3 p.637-645dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9gc04092g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014100161300002000302520116100322592002801483650002201511650002301533650001901556650001901575650001001594650002101604650001801625650001301643650001801656650001801674650003101692650002401723650001901747650001701766650001201783650001601795650003701811700002601848700002201874773012401896856007402020852000902094655001202103IND60667127620221121012815.0190919e20150203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066712762DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra14151b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoiry, Bishnu P.10aFluorinated amphiphilic block copolymers via RAFT polymerization and their application as surf-RAFT agent in miniemulsion polymerization  ap. 15461-15468.  aThis investigation reports the preparation of amphiphilic block copolymer (Am-BCP) based on poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and 2,2,3,3,4,4,4-heptafluorobutyl acrylate (HFBA) via RAFT polymerization. In this case poly(PEGMA) (PPEGMA) was prepared using 2-cyano-2-propyl dithiobenzoate (CPBT) as a RAFT agent. This PPEGMA was later used as a macro-RAFT agent for the polymerization of HFBA to prepare well-defined block copolymers (BCPs), (PPEGMA-b-PHFBA) of varied lengths and compositions. The BCPs self-assembled in aqueous solution to produce spherical micelles consisting of hydrophobic block PHFBA as a core and a hydrophilic block of PPEGMA as a flexible corona. This Am-BCP formed micelles of different sizes, as characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM analyses. The Am-BCP was later used as a surf-RAFT agent i.e. as a surfactant as well as a macro-RAFT agent for the miniemulsion polymerization of styrene. TEM analysis showed that the synthesized polystyrene emulsion had a core–shell morphology. The particle size and particle size distributions of the polystyrene latex were determined by DLS analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alatex 3alight scattering 3amethyl ethers 3amicelles 3ananoemulsions 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3astyrene 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aChakrabarti, Arindam,1 aSingha, Nikhil K.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 03, v. 5, no. 20 p.15461-15468dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra14151b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03613naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172300001600306500001900322520233400341592002802675650002502703650002302728650001102751650001602762650002602778650001802804650001202822650002102834650001302855653001602868653002102884653001302905653001802918653002002936700002102956700002102977773009902998856008503097852000903182655001203191IND60736328920221120040014.0210527e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073632892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.04.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLois-Morales, Pia10aCharacterising tensile strength and elastic moduli of altered igneous rocks at comminution scale using the Short Impact Load Cell  ap. 343-356.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe primary breakage properties of rocks such a strength (σ) and elastic moduli (i.e. Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (ѵ)) are not usually characterised at comminution scale. Traditional comminution tests such as the Bond Work Index grinding test and the Drop Weight Test are used for describing the breakage behaviour of different ores. Nevertheless, these tests do not decouple the ore characteristics from the mode of breakage. The primary breakage properties control the initiation and propagation of fractures in rocks and exert control over the resultant progeny of breakage events when the rock is stressed. However, how these properties change as the particle size decreases in comminution is not clear yet. This work explores the change of primary breakage properties and the derived quantities estimated using the Short Impact Load Cell (SILC) (e.g. apparent stiffness and mass-specific fracture energy) within a particle size relevant to ball milling, using a suite of real ores.The results of this work show that the median values of strength in populations of cylindrical (minicore) particles do not vary with size within the range size studied (3–30 mm) for all the ore types studied. In contrast, the stiffness and the mass-specific fracture energy derived from the primary breakage properties data show a size dependency for all of the ore types in agreement with Weibull's weakest link theory. The degree of variation of the primary breakage properties has also been studied over a range of particle sizes. The results show that this degree of variation tends to increase for some of the rocks as the particle size decreases, but the variation is size-independent for other rock types. These results align with previous results in the literature that indicate the size independency of tensile strength in small samples but are contrary to earlier researchers' findings that suggest that the variance decreases with size. The ore dependent nature of the primary breakage properties found in this work requires further research. Understanding the behaviour of the primary breakage properties in a comminution context might help to characterise the comminution potential of ores better, as well as to develop characterisation and modelling techniques that are more responsive to the ore characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoisson distribution 3aWeibull statistics 3aenergy 3aimpact load 3amodulus of elasticity 3aparticle size 3aprogeny 3atensile strength 3avariance 0aComminution 0aImpact load cell 0aStrength 0aGeometallurgy 0aSize dependency1 aEvans, Catherine1 aWeatherley, Dion0 tPowder technology.g2021 Aug., v. 388 p.343-356dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.04.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008100175300001600256520144900272592002801721650001301749650001301762650001401775650001401789651001101803653001701814653001701831653001001848653001001858700002001868700001501888700002101903700002401924773013401948856008502082852000902167655001202176IND60635270420221119203341.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063527042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2019.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonín, Vladimír,10aTaxonomic update of Clitocybula sensu lato with a new generic classification  ap. 431-447.  aThe taxonomy and phylogeny of the hydropoid clade (genera Clitocybula s.l., Megacollybia, Leucoinocybe gen. nov., Hydropus, Trogia, Gerronema, Porotheleum and Lignomphalia gen. nov.) in Europe is studied using morphological and molecular approaches; the first three genera in detail including all known European species. Only two European species remain in Clitocybula s.str., Clitocybula lacerata and Clitocybula familia. The European C. lacerata is a species complex which should be treated as C. lacerata agg. at the current state of knowledge. A neotype originating from type area was designated to fix the application of the name. The presence of American species Clitocybula abundans in Europe is insufficiently proved. “Clitocybula dryadicola ˮ belongs to the genus Hydropus, and Clitocybula tilieti has an unclear systematic position. The results showed that Megacollybia and Leucoinocybe represent independent genera separated from Clitocybula. The genus Leucoinocybe is validly published with two European species, Leucoinocybe lenta and Leucoinocybe taniae. “Clitocybula flavoaurantia” proved to be conspecific with the latter species. The genus Lignomphalia is published for “Pseudoomphalina lignicola”, a lignicolous omphalinoid species. The Indian “Clitocybula sulcata” is transferred to Leucoinocybe and “Clitocybula atrialba” to Gerronema. The first European records of Megacollybia marginata are published.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydropus 3aneotypes 3anew genus 3aphylogeny 3aEurope 0aLeucoinocybe 0aLignomphalia 0anrITS 0anrLSU1 aBorovička, Jan1 aHolec, Jan1 aPiltaver, Andrej1 aKolařík, Miroslav0 tFungal biology.g2019 June, v. 123, no. 6 p.431-447dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2019.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04225naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003800132024002200170024001900192040001800211100002100229245009600250506007600346506017300422520199000595506003702585650001802622650002702640650001802667650001502685650001102700650002202711650001502733650001002748650001102758650000902769650002302778650002302801650001302824650001902837650002602856650001102882650002302893650001402916650001402930650001402944650003002958650000902988650001602997650001103013650001203024650001403036650001303050700002003063700002303083700002403106700002003130773009103150856011203241856008403353956008403437961000903521852000903530655001203539IND60006230320221214224733.0160413e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000623032DNAL7 a3173202aris7 a10113/623032hdl7 a10.1371/journal.pone.01310182doi7 aPMC44711752pmcid7 a260834292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeti, Massaro W.12aA virulent Babesia bovis strain failed to infect white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aWildlife are an important component in the vector-host-pathogen triangle of livestock diseases, as they maintain biological vectors that transmit pathogens and can serve as reservoirs for such infectious pathogens. Babesia bovis is a tick-borne pathogen, vectored by cattle fever ticks, Rhipicephalus spp., that can cause up to 90% mortality in naive adult cattle. While cattle are the primary host for cattle fever ticks, wild and exotic ungulates, including white-tailed deer (WTD), are known to be viable alternative hosts. The presence of cattle fever tick populations resistant to acaricides raises concerns regarding the possibility of these alternative hosts introducing tick-borne babesial parasites into areas free of infection. Understanding the B. bovis reservoir competence of these alternative hosts is critical to mitigating the risk of introduction. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that WTD are susceptible to infection with a B. bovis strain lethal to cattle. Two groups of deer were inoculated intravenously with either B. bovis blood stabilate or a larval extract supernatant containing sporozoites from infected R. microplus larvae. The collective data demonstrated that WTD are neither a transient host nor reservoir of B. bovis. This conclusion is supported by the failure of B. bovis to establish an infection in deer regardless of inoculum. Although specific antibody was detected for a short period in the WTD, the PCR results were consistently negative at multiple time points throughout the experiment and blood from WTD that had been exposed to parasite, transferred into naïve recipient susceptible calves, failed to establish infection. In contrast, naïve steers inoculated intravenously with either B. bovis blood stabilate or the larval extract supernatant containing sporozoites rapidly succumbed to disease. These findings provide evidence that WTD are not an epidemiological component in the maintenance of B. bovis infectivity to livestock.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBabesia bovis 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aRhipicephalus 3aacaricides 3aadults 3aalternative hosts 3aantibodies 3ablood 3acalves 3adeer 3adisease reservoirs 3adisease resistance 3ainoculum 3ainsect vectors 3aintravenous injection 3alarvae 3alivestock diseases 3amortality 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asporozoites 3asteers 3astrains 3avirulence 3awildlife1 aOlafson, Pia U.1 aFreeman, Jeanne M.1 aJohnson, Wendell C.1 aScoles, Glen A.0 tPlos One.g2015 June 17, v. 10, no. 6 p.e0131018-wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/623033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.01310183Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/out_0.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01861naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245005200157300001400209520088500223592002801108650002201136650001901158650001501177650002901192650001901221650001601240650001401256650001901270700001301289700001801302773012101320856007301441852000901514655001201523IND60132628020221119165601.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013262802DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.123082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarner, D.

Spermatozoal ultrastructure and form‐to‐function are detailed and spermatozoal metabolism is discussed, with specific reference to distinctive characteristics of stallion spermatozoa. Lastly, methods for assessment of spermatozoal function are considered, with emphasis on spermatozoal motility, the acrosome reaction and spermatozoon–oocyte interactions. Closing comments address the need for development and standardisation of molecular‐based assays for use with spermatozoa of stallions whose subfertility cannot be explained with conventional tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome reaction 3amale fertility 3ametabolism 3areproductive performance 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3astallions 3aultrastructure1 aGibb, Z.1 aAitken, R.

The variable oxygen content of malignant solid tumors increases the difficulty of treatment. Thus, it could be reasonably inferred that the tumor oxygen microenvironment, if efficiently and completely regulated, could bring certain changes to existing therapies. Based on this speculation, an acid-responsive, oxygen-scavenging and anaerobic-sensitizing nanoparticle was designed to regulate the oxygen level of solid tumor by creating an artificial anaerobic environment in our study. The Mg2Si core, which acted as a deoxygenating agent, was able to consume tumor oxygen and cause cell dormancy, while the incorporated hydrophobic tirapazamin (TPZ) helped to kill the now-dormant tumor cells. This simple and nontoxic nanoparticle achieved controllable factitious anaerobic circumstance in solid tumor for the first time, displaying the considerable potential and promising application of tumor gaseous microenvironment regulation therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adormancy 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoxygen 3atherapeutics 0aGaseous microenvironment regulation 0aCell dormancy 0aHypoxia 0aAnaerobic 0aControlled drug release1 aSu, Weiwei1 aLiu, Yanyan1 aZhang, Jiawen1 aZuo, Changjing1 aYao, Zhenwei1 aBu, Wenbo0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Apr., v. 200 p.48-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245015600176300001600332520144800348592002801796650001801824650001101842650002601853650001401879650002301893650001101916650001001927650001901937650002101956650002801977650002202005650001502027650002702042650002502069650002602094650001302120653001402133653002202147653002602169700003002195700002902225700003102254700003902285700002902324700002502353700002602378773013402404856008502538852000902623655001202632IND60635270620221119203307.0190726e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063527062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2019.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Jonas Henrique10aMonitoring indole alkaloid production by Penicillium digitatum during infection process in citrus by Mass Spectrometry Imaging and molecular networking  ap. 594-600.  aGreen mold, caused by Penicillium digitatum, is the most destructive post-harvest disease in citrus. Secondary metabolites produced by fungal phytopathogens have been associated with toxicity to their respective host through the interaction with a wide range of cell targets. Natural products have also been described as important molecules for biocontrol and competition in their respective environment. For P. digitatum, the production of indole alkaloids, tryptoquialanines A and B, have been reported. However, their biological role remains unknown. Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) technique was applied here for the first time to monitor the secondary metabolites produced on the orange surface during infection in order to gain insights about the P. digitatum-citrus interaction mechanisms. Through the combination of MSI and molecular networking it was possible to report, for the first time, the production of tryptoquivalines and fumiquinazolines by P. digitatum and also the accumulation of tryptoquialanines on the fruit surface from 4 to 7 d post inoculation. P. digitatum was also evaluated concerning the ability to sinthesize indole alkaloids in vivo in the different citrus hosts. The biological role of tryptoquialanines was investigated and tryptoquialanine A was submitted to insecticidal bioassays that revealed its high toxicity against Aedes Aegypti, suggesting an important insecticidal action during orange decay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aCitrus 3aPenicillium digitatum 3abioassays 3abiological control 3afruits 3ahosts 3aimage analysis 3aindole alkaloids 3ainsecticidal properties 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apostharvest diseases 3asecondary metabolites 3atoxicity 0aAlkaloids 0aCitrus green mold 0aInsecticidal activity1 aBazioli, Jaqueline Moraes1 ade Vilhena Araújo, Eder1 aVendramini, Pedro Henrique1 ade Freitas Porto, Mariana Cristina1 aEberlin, Marcos Nogueira1 aSouza-Neto, Jayme A.1 aFill, Taícia Pacheco0 tFungal biology.g2019 Aug., v. 123, no. 8 p.594-600dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2019.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04487naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009700166300002000263500001900283520233700302592002802639596005902667596006302726596010302789596004702892596010302939596009303042650002703135650002003162650001203182650001103194650002103205650002403226650002003250650002003270650001203290650002203302650002503324650002103349650000703370650001403377650001903391650001403410650001603424650001303440650003003453650001103483651001003494700001603504700001803520700001903538700001203557700001503569700001703584773016903601856008203770852000903852655001203861IND60729773020221118003107.0210302e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072977302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11299-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaoxi10aMixing of plant litters strengthens their remediation effects on crude oil-contaminated soil  ap. 12753-12765.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo investigate the effects of the mixing of litters on their remediation efficiency in petroleum-contaminated soil, litters from two common plants in the petroleum-contaminated region of Northern Shaanxi, China, Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng and Sophora davidii Kom. ex Pavol., and their mixture were mixed with 45 g/kg petroleum-contaminated soil. Based on these, a 150-day simulated remediation experiment was conducted at 25 °C and consistent moisture conditions. The effects on the degradation of petroleum components and the restoration of nutrient contents, pH, and enzymatic activity in the disturbed soil were detected. The effects of the litter treatments on the community structure and carbon source utilization characteristics of soil microorganisms were also studied. The results indicated that all litter treatments significantly accelerated the degradation of petroleum components, while the mixing of litter exhibited significant synergistic effects, leading to significantly higher degradation rates of saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and nonhydrocarbon substances than the observed rates in the single-litter treatments and the predicted rates based on the single-litter treatments. Litter treatment significantly increased the N and P contents and enzymatic activity of contaminated soil. The effects of mixed litter on soil chemical and biological properties fell between the effects of the 2 types of single-litter treatments. However, the mixing of litters exhibited significant synergistic effects in supplementing available P and increasing sucrase, dehydrogenase, lignin peroxidase, and laccase activity, while it exhibited significant antagonistic effects in supplementing nitrate nitrogen and increasing urease, phosphatase, polyphenol oxidase, and manganese peroxidase activity. Litter treatment significantly altered the community structure of soil microorganisms. The relative abundances of some petroleum-degrading microbial phyla or genera in mixed litter-treated soil were significantly different from those in single litter-treated soils, which might contribute to the strengthened remediation effects of mixed litter treatment. The results might provide a theoretical basis for the more effect utilization of biomass resources in the remediation of petroleum-contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data  a31800370cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018JQ4047cNatural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province  a20170704cYoung Talent Fund of University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China  aYDBK2017-26; YDY2020-34cYan'an University  aS202010719013cNational College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of China  aYCX2020071cEducation and Innovation Project for Graduate Student of Yan’an University 3aBothriochloa ischaemum 3aSophora davidii 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acatechol oxidase 3acommunity structure 3adisturbed soils 3aenzyme activity 3alaccase 3alignin peroxidase 3amanganese peroxidase 3anitrate nitrogen 3apH 3apetroleum 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3aremediation 3aresearch 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3aurease 3aChina1 aWang, Lijie1 aZhou, Wenxing1 aFeng, Liaoliao1 aHu, Man1 aHu, Jiawei1 aLiu, Zengwen0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2021 Mar., v. 28, no. 10 p.12753-12765dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11299-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245007900179300001600258520124300274592002801517650001101545650001201556650000901568650000901577650001801586650001501604650002101619650000901640651001001649700003401659700002601693700002701719700002601746773008901772856008601861990002301947852000901970655001201979IND60092054620221120123435.0141103e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009205462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Bella, José M.10aGlobal analysis of building façade exposure to water penetration in Chile  ap. 284-297.  aIn this study, the exposure of building façades in Chile to wind-driven rain and driving rain wind pressure was analysed. Daily climatic data from 29 weather stations throughout Chile were used to determine these exposures in scalar terms and are presented in exposure maps. These values were used to estimate the risk index for water penetration at each location and to determine the relationships between the different exposure indices calculated from the daily, monthly, and annual data. Finally, the directional characterisations of these exposures were determined with an alternative method that was based on climatic data from the Chilean stations. This method was used to quantify the exposure of façades oriented in any direction in 6 cities that represent the country's climate: Santiago, Concepción, La Serena, Temuco, Antofagasta, and Puerto Montt. In general, the exposure of façades to water penetration progressively increases from north to south. However, this pattern is affected by the topography of each location, especially in the capital and southern regions. Valdivia, which is located in the centre, and Balmaceda, which is located in the south, showed the greatest risk of water penetration in Chilean façades.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate 3arain 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3atopography 3aweather stations 3awind 3aChile1 aDomínguez-Hernández, Javier1 aCano-Suñén, Enrique1 adel Coz-Díaz, Juan J.1 aAlonso-Martínez, Mar0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Dec., v. 70 p.284-297dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012500157300001600282520092600298592002801224650002001252650001301272650001201285650002101297650002101318650002201339650002201361650001301383650002701396650002301423650002901446650001001475650001101485650001001496651001001506653001001516653002301526653002501549653001701574653001901591700002301610700001701633773014401650856007401794852000901868655001201877IND60679845420221118232632.0200102e20151019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067984542DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tov2942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongmo10aHigh Spatial Genetic Structure and Genetic Diversity in Chinese Populations of Sitobion miscanthi (Hemiptera: Aphididae)  ap. 375-384.  aThe wheat aphid, Sitobion miscanthi Takahashi, a serious wheat pest, was previously considered to be highly migratory and anholocyclic in China. We recorded 69 alleles and 346 multilocus genotypes among 708 aphid individuals from 12 populations in China using 5 microsatellite loci. This genotypic diversity indicates that at least some holocyclic lineages exist. Bayesian clustering analysis revealed that there are two differentiated genetic groups of S. misanthi, one northern and one southern, in China. Principal coordinates analysis of population genetic distance, pairwise FST's, and network analysis of individual minimum spanning distance also supported the division. Low levels of migration were detected between the northern and southern sampling sites, but the high genetic differentiation does not support the hypothesis S. miscanthi overwinters in the south and migrates to the north in the spring annually.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aSitobion 3aalleles 3acluster analysis 3agenetic distance 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amigratory behavior 3amultidimensional scaling 3apests 3aspring 3awheat 3aChina 0aaphid 0aSitobion miscanthi 0apopulation structure 0aanholocyclic 0amicrosatellite1 aHereward, James P.1 aZhang, Guoan0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Oct. 19, v. 109, no. 1 p.375-384dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov2943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100008200148245015600230300001800386520170000404592002802104650001902132650001602151650002402167650001002191650001302201650003102214650002502245650001502270650002002285650001702305653002102322653002002343653002002363653000802383700001902391700001802410700001702428700002002445773011202465856008302577852000902660655001202669IND60566043320221117044523.0191017e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056604332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2017.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazemi-Bajestani, Seyyed Mohammad Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9509-703010aHigh fat mass associates with occurrence of targeted therapy-induced left ventricular ejection fraction reduction in patients with renal cell carcinoma  ap. 1070-1072.  aRecent research suggests that variations of skeletal muscle (SM) and fat predict the severity of chemotherapy-induced toxicities in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Cardio-toxicity has not been evaluated in this context.In this study we considered 47 RCC patients who participated in randomized clinical trials of sorafenib or sunitinib (i.e., targeted therapy). To capture cardio-toxicity, multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scan-defined left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) tests (at least 3 tests over 1 year of treatment) were abstracted. Computed tomography (CT) cross-sectional images were analyzed before start of targeted therapy and at 1 year to define SM and fat at baseline and changes over time concurrent with MUGA-defined LVEF measurement.MUGA-defined cardio-toxicity (usually fall in LVEF >10% to an absolute LVEF<55%) occurred in 8/47 (17%) patients over 1 year of targeted therapy (all were male). Percentage of patients with high fat mass (baseline CT-defined total adipose tissue/indexed by height2 greater than the gender-specific median value) was higher among patients with cardio-toxicity versus patients without cardio-toxicity [7 (87.5%) versus 16 (41.0%); p = 0.02]. The percentage of SM loss in patients with cardio-toxicity was higher than the patients without cardio-toxicity [median of loss (%) −7 versus 0 respectively; p = 0.04].Cardio-toxicity in RCC patients might be associated with high fat mass. This finding is distinct from prior observations that low body weight and sarcopenia associated with non-cardiac toxicities of targeted therapies. Concurrence of SM loss over time and development of cardio-toxicity is reported for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3abody weight 3acomputed tomography 3amales 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3arenal cell carcinoma 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle 3atherapeutics 0aBody composition 0aCardio-toxicity 0aSkeletal muscle 0aFat1 aBecher, Harald1 aVenner, Peter1 aNorth, Scott1 aBaracos, Vickie0 tClinical nutrition.g2018 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.1070-1072dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2017.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014000169500002200309520213800331592002802469650003402497650001402531650001902545650002502564650001702589650001102606650001302617650002702630650001402657650001602671650002202687650002502709650001202734650002202746650002302768650002502791650002902816650001002845650002302855650002802878651001002906653002602916653002002942653000802962653002702970653001002997700001803007700002003025700001903045773007403064856008503138852000903223655001203232IND60571100020221116174011.0170710s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057110002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lizhen10aLife cycle assessment and life cycle cost of university dormitories in the southeast China: Case study of the university town of Fuzhou  aPre-press version  aThe aim of this paper is to assess university dormitories in terms of life cycle environmental impact and cost, as part of the university campuses sustainable development in southeast China. This life cycle assessment follows the ISO 14040/44 methodology, considering the construction, operation, maintenance and demolition stages. The reference unit of this study is defined as ‘one useful square meter university dormitories with 50 years life time’. This study estimates the life cycle inventory by: 1) tenders information of university dormitories built in the university town of Fuzhou during 2007–2011, 2) water and energy bills of those building over past 5 years, 3) damage and maintenance report of dormitories in Fuzhou University and Fujian University of traditional Chinese medicine during 2004–2014. The Ecoinvent database provides the background data to the analysis.The results indicate that 1) the use stage, including operation and maintenance is the dominate part of the life cycle environmental impacts and cost of university dormitories. 2) The consumption of electricity constitutes the main elements causing the environmental impacts over the life cycle of university dormitories. The technology for more energy efficient building is more important than other factors. 3) The window, concrete, steel, and cement have the largest contribution to the embodied environmental impacts but with the relative small contribution to the life cycle cost. Therefore, two main improving opportunities for reducing the environmental impacts of Chinese university dormitories development are identified: 1) improving building with deep renovation for current dormitories and implementing low energy buildings standards for new built dormitories the buildings energy efficiency and 2) increasing the use of low environmental impacts building material by implementing the carbon tax on main building material and introducing timbers as structure material. Moreover, policies to promote the more renewable energy supply and the implementation of carbon capture and storage technology constitute another import issue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3abuildings 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3acement 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3adatabases 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aimports 3aissues and policy 3alife cycle costing 3alife cycle inventory 3arenewable energy sources 3asteel 3astorage technology 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aLife cycle assessment 0aLife cycle cost 0aCO2 0aUniversity dormitories 0aChina1 aLiu, Yongping1 aKrigsvoll, Guri1 aJohansen, Fred0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012000166300001600286520171400302592002802016650002002044650002402064650001502088650001102103651001502114700002102129700001602150700001902166773009602185856004802281852000902329655001202338IND50067605020221118125842.0130705e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006760502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-013-0483-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hsiu-Ping10aMolecular evidence for cryptic species in a narrowly endemic western North American springsnail (Pyrgulopsis gilae)  ap. 917-923.  aPyrgulopsis gilae is a small springsnail that is narrowly distributed along the forks of the upper Gila River and currently being managed as a threatened and sensitive species by the State of New Mexico and United States Forest Service, respectively. A previous phylogeographic study of this species based on mitochondrial COI sequences delineated substantial divergence between several populations along the lower and upper reaches of the East Fork Gila River. The present study surveyed COI variation among a larger number of populations across the entire geographic range of P. gilae. Three haplotype groupings were delineated that were congruently resolved as clades by a Bayesian analysis. One of the clades was composed of populations along the lower East Fork and mainstem Gila River and corresponds to P. gilae as originally circumscribed. The other two clades were composed of populations along the Middle Fork and upper East Fork Gila River that were recently referred to P. gilae. These three geographically isolated clades do not share any haplotypes, have significant FST values, and are differentiated from each other by 3.9-6.3 % sequence divergence. Based on this evidence we suggest that the clades represent distinct species and should be managed as separate conservation units pending taxonomic revision of P. gilae. This study provides additional evidence that geographically disjunct subunits of Pyrgulopsis species often represent distinct monophyletic lineages that may warrant formal taxonomic recognition, and thus underscores the importance of fine-scale conservation genetics studies of these imperiled organisms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aUSDA Forest Service 3ahaplotypes 3arivers 3aNew Mexico1 aHershler, Robert1 aLang, Brian1 aDavies, Justin0 tConservation genetics.g2013 Aug., v. 14, no. 4 p.917-923dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-013-0483-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245008600175300001600261520087200277592002801149650001901177650001101196650001401207650001501221650002201236650001401258650001101272651001001283651001201293653001901305653002101324653003101345653002201376653003901398700001701437773009501454856008901549852000901638655001201647IND60566043420221117044232.0190319e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056604342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeisler, Charles10aImpediments to inland resettlement under conditions of accelerated sea level rise  ap. 322-330.  aGlobal mean sea level rise (GMSLR) stemming from the multiple effects of human-induced climate change has potentially dramatic effects for inland land use planning and habitability. Recent research suggests that GMSLR may endanger the low-elevation coastal zone sooner than expected, reshaping coastal geography, reducing habitable landmass, and seeding significant coastal out-migrations. Our research reviews the barriers to entry in the noncoastal hinterland. Using three organizing clusters (depletion zones, win-lose zones, and no-trespass zones), we identify principal inland impediments to relocation and provide preliminary estimates of their toll on inland resettlement space. We make the case for proactive adaptation strategies extending landward from on global coastlines and illustrate this position with land use planning responses in Florida and China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3ageography 3ahinterland 3aland use planning 3asea level 3asowing 3aChina 3aFlorida 0aSea level rise 0aclimate migrants 0aLow elevation coastal zone 0aBarriers to entry 0aInland adaptation and resettlement1 aCurrens, Ben0 tLand use policy.g2017 July, v. 66 p.322-330dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245006300168300001600231520150700247592002801754650001301782650002001795650002101815650000901836650002101845650001201866650001401878650001001892650001101902650002401913650002201937650001401959650002101973650001001994650001302004773008902017856008602106990002302192852000902215655001202224IND60092054920221120123516.0141103e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009205492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaiti, Rina10aPhysiological and subjective thermal response from Indians  ap. 306-317.  aA controlled laboratory experiment was carried out on forty Indian male college students for evaluating the effect of indoor thermal environment on occupants' response and thermal comfort. During experiment, indoor temperature varied from 21 °C to 33 °C, and the variables like relative humidity, airflow, air temperature and radiant temperature were recorded along with skin (Tₛₖ) and oral temperature (Tcₒᵣₑ) from the subjects. From Tₛₖ and Tc, body temperature (Tb) was evaluated. Subjective Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV) was recorded using ASHRAE 7-point scale. In PMV model, Fanger's Tₛₖ equation was used to accommodate adaptive response. Stepwise regression analysis result showed Tb was better predictor of TSV than Tₛₖ and Tcₒᵣₑ. Regional skin temperature response, lower sweat threshold temperature with no dipping sweat and higher cutaneous sweating threshold temperature were observed as thermal adaptive responses. Using PMV model, thermal comfort zone was evaluated as (22.46–25.41) °C with neutral temperature of 23.91 °C, whereas using TSV response, wider comfort zone was estimated as (23.25–26.32) °C with neutral temperature at 24.83 °C. It was observed that PMV-model overestimated the actual thermal response. Interestingly, these subjects were found to be less sensitive to hot but more sensitive to cold. A new TSV-PPD relation (PPDₙₑw) was obtained with an asymmetric distribution of hot-cold thermal sensation response in Indians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aair temperature 3abody temperature 3acold 3acollege students 3adipping 3aequations 3amales 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asensation 3askin temperature 3asweat 3asweating0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Dec., v. 70 p.306-317dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.08.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245025400163300001600417520162200433592002802055650001902083650001902102650002702121650001502148650002302163650002302186650003102209650002602240650002302266650001502289650001902304650001802323650002402341650001602365650002102381650001502402650002002417651002402437651001802461653003002479653002002509700002402529700002402553773014402577856007402721852000902795655001202804IND60679845620221118233103.0200102e20151030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067984562DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tov2962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Elizabeth S.10aAssessing the Role of Environmental Conditions on Efficacy Rates of Heterorhabditis indica (Nematoda: Heterorhabditidae) for Controlling Aethina tumida (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) in Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Colonies: a Citizen Science Approach  ap. 106-112.  aCertain species of entomopathogenic nematodes, such as Heterorhabditis indica Poinar, Karunakar & David, have the potential to be effective controls for Aethina tumida (Murray), or small hive beetles, when applied to the soil surrounding honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) hives. Despite the efficacy of H. indica, beekeepers have struggled to use them successfully as a biocontrol. It is believed that the sensitivity of H. indica to certain environmental conditions is the primary reason for this lack of success. Although research has been conducted to explore the impact of specific environmental conditions—such as soil moisture or soil temperature—on entomopathogenic nematode infectivity, no study to date has taken a comprehensive approach that considers the impact of multiple environmental conditions simultaneously. In exploring this, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine what environmental conditions resulted in reductions of A. tumida populations in honey bee colonies. To obtain the sample sizes necessary to run a multivariate logistic regression, this study utilized citizen scientist beekeepers and their hives from across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Results suggest that soil moisture, soil temperatures, sunlight exposure, and groundcover contribute to the efficacy of H. indica in reducing A. tumida populations in A. mellifera colonies. The results of this study offer direction for future research on the environmental preferences of H. indica and can be used to educate beekeepers about methods for better utilizing H. indica as a biological control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAethina tumida 3aApis mellifera 3aHeterorhabditis indica 3abeekeepers 3abiological control 3acitizen scientists 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aenvironmental factors 3ahoney bee colonies 3ahoney bees 3ainsect control 3apathogenicity 3aregression analysis 3asample size 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asolar radiation 3aMid-Atlantic region 3aUnited States 0aentomopathogenic nematode 0acitizen science1 aSmythe, Ashleigh B.1 aDelaney, Deborah A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Oct. 30, v. 109, no. 1 p.106-112dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov2963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03997naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245011800214500002200332520182700354592002802181650001202209650001302221650001102234650001502245650001202260650001502272650001202287650001502299650001502314650001302329650001602342650001802358650002502376650001702401650003002418650001702448650002302465650003202488650001202520650002002532650002602552650001202578651001702590653002202607653001202629653001902641653001602660700001702676700001902693700001802712700002402730700002002754700002002774700002202794700003602816700002002852700005802872700002702930700001702957700001702974700002002991700002403011700002303035773010603058856009003164852000903254655001203263IND60612087820221118133031.0181102s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061208782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLedoux, Allison1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4052-633610aAntiplasmodial, anti-chikungunya virus and antioxidant activities of 64 endemic plants from the Mascarene Islands  aPre-press version  aVector-borne diseases cause more than 1 million deaths annually. The research into new medicines is urgent, especially as there is currently no specific treatment. In this study, the authors have selected 64 endemic plants from the Mascarene Islands based on their endemism, their medicinal use and their registration in the French Pharmacopeia to evaluate the antiplasmodial, anti-chikungunya and antioxidant activities. The list of these 64 plants including their local name, population, data of collection and voucher number are available in the Supporting Information. Forty active extracts were identified from the 38 species: 22 responded positively to the antiplasmodial activity, 8 to the anti-chikungunya activity and 8 to the antioxidant activity.Six plants demonstrated high antiplasmodial activity (concentration inhibiting 50% of parasitic growth (IC50) <5 µg/mL): Casearia coriaceae, Monimia rotundifolia, Poupartia borbonica, Psiadia retusa, Vernonia fimbrillifera and Zanthoxylum heterophyllum; and five showed high anti-chikungunya activity (IC50<20 µg/mL): Aphloia theiformis, Stillingia lineata, Croton mauritianus, Indigofera ammoxylum, and Securinega durissima. Eight plants displayed an important antioxidant activity, with values of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) or oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) >2000 µM of Trolox equivalent per mg/mL of extract: Bertiera borbonica, Erythroxylon laurifolium, Erythroxylon sideroxyloides, I. ammoxylum, P. borbonica, Scolopia heterophylla, Sophora denudata, and Terminalia bentzoe.

We report here that human SULT2A1, in addition to being able to sulfate dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and other hydroxysteroids, could also catalyze the sulfation of Δ⁴-3-ketosteroids, which carry no hydroxyl groups in their chemical structure. Among a panel of Δ⁴-3-ketosteroids tested as substrates, 4-androstene-3,17-dione and progesterone were found to be sulfated by SULT2A1. Mass spectrometry analysis and structural modeling supported a reaction mechanism which involves the isomerization of Δ⁴-3-ketosteroids from the keto form to an enol form, prior to being subjected to sulfation. Results derived from this study suggested a potential role of SULT2A1 as a Δ⁴-3-ketosteroid sulfotransferase in steroid metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenols 3ahumans 3aisomerization 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amoieties 3aprasterone 3aprogesterone 3areaction mechanisms 3asteroid metabolism 3asulfates 3asulfotransferases 0aSULT 0aPAPS 0aDHEA 0aKSI 0aSulfotransferase 0aKetosteroid 0a4-androstene-3,17-dione 0aKetosteroid isomerase1 aKurogi, Katsuhisa1 aShimohira, Takehiko1 aTeramoto, Takamasa1 aLiu, Ming-Cheh1 aSuiko, Masahito1 aSakakibara, Yoichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9031-422X0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Nov., v. 1861, no. 11 p.2883-2890dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011400167300001600281520185700297592002802154650000802182650001302190650001402203650001102217650001102228650002402239650002002263650001902283650001602302650001902318700001602337700001902353700001502372773008902387856008602476990002302562852000902585655001202594IND60092055120221120123432.0141103e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009205512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHang, Jian10aNatural ventilation assessment in typical open and semi-open urban environments under various wind directions  ap. 318-333.  aSemi-open street roofs protect pedestrians from intense sunshine and rains. Their effects on natural ventilation of urban canopy layers (UCL) are less understood. This paper investigates two idealized urban models consisting of 4(2 × 2) or 16(4 × 4) buildings under a neutral atmospheric condition with parallel (0°) or non-parallel (15°, 30°, 45°) approaching wind. The aspect ratio (building height (H)/street width (W)) is 1 and building width is B = 3H. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were first validated by experimental data, confirming that standard k–ε model predicted airflow velocity better than RNG k–ε model, realizable k–ε model and Reynolds stress model. Three ventilation indices were numerically analyzed for ventilation assessment, including flow rates across street roofs and openings to show the mechanisms of air exchange, age of air to display how long external air reaches a place after entering UCL, and purging flow rate to quantify the net UCL ventilation capacity induced by mean flows and turbulence. Five semi-open roof types are studied: Walls being hung above street roofs (coverage ratio λₐ = 100%) at z = 1.5H, 1.2H, 1.1H (‘Hung1.5H’, ‘Hung1.2H’, ‘Hung1.1H’ types); Walls partly covering street roofs (λₐ = 80%) at z = H (‘Partly-covered’ type); Walls fully covering street roofs (λₐ = 100%) at z = H (‘Fully-covered’ type). They basically obtain worse UCL ventilation than open street roof type due to the decreased roof ventilation. ‘Hung1.1H’, ‘Hung1.2H’, ‘Hung1.5H’ types are better designs than ‘Fully-covered’ and ‘Partly-covered’ types. Greater urban size contains larger UCL volume and requires longer time to ventilate. The methodologies and ventilation indices are confirmed effective to quantify UCL ventilation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3abuildings 3acanopy 3amodels 3anatural ventilation 3asolar radiation 3aturbulent flow 3aurban areas 3awind direction1 aLuo, Zhiwen1 aSandberg, Mats1 aGong, Jian0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Dec., v. 70 p.318-333dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015300161300001600314520160900330592002801939650002901967650002401996650001002020650003102030650001102061650001402072650002302086650002202109650002202131650000902153650001002162650001802172653001702190653002902207653001602236653001902252700001602271700002102287700001702308773014402325856007402469852000902543655001202552IND60679845820221118232655.0200102e20151017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067984582DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tov2982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRybanska, Dagmar10aDry Dog Food Integrity and Mite Strain Influence the Density-Dependent Growth of the Stored-Product Mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Acari: Acaridida)  ap. 454-460.  aThe infestation of foodstuffs by mites is connected to health risks and economic losses. The cosmopolitan stored-product mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank, 1781) is an emerging and predominant pest of dry dog food. In this study, the influences on mite population growth of 1) the different dry dog food kernels present in the package; 2) the integrity of the dry dog food kernel, whether intact or crushed; 3) the initial population density of 10 or 100 specimens; and 4) the four mite strains used were investigated under laboratory conditions. The population growth tests were performed for 28 d at 85% relative humidity and 25°C. The intrinsic growth rates of the mites were compared. The population growth was higher on the brown and green kernels than on the red and white kernels. The kernel integrity affected the population growth, and the integrity effect was highly influenced by the initial mite population density. The mites showed density-dependent growth in three of the four mite strains tested. The initial population density changed the population growth ranking among the mite strains, thereby indicating strain-specific density-dependent growth. The results of this study have important implications for predictive models of stored-product mite populations in dry dog food. One practical recommendation is that the growth of mites should be considered with regard to the mite strains and according to the strain-specific density dependent growth. Next, the integrity of the kernels should be maintained because disrupted or crushed kernels promote increases in mite populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTyrophagus putrescentiae 3afinancial economics 3afoods 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3apet foods 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3arelative humidity 3arisk 3aseeds 3astorage mites 0adry dog food 0adensity-dependent growth 0amite strain 0astored product1 aHubert, Jan1 aMarkovic, Martin1 aErban, Tomas0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Oct. 17, v. 109, no. 1 p.454-460dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov2983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245010300179520131700282592002801599650002301627650002701650650001801677650001601695650002001711650002001731650002101751650001401772650001101786650002001797650000901817650001901826650000901845653002001854653002301874653002601897653001501923653002801938700006801966700002802034700003702062773012702099856008302226852000902309655001202318IND60713938620221120094401.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071393862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2020.1015612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Thatyane Pereira de10aTrichoderma asperellum modulates defense genes and potentiates gas exchanges in upland rice plants  aMagnaporthe oryzae (Mo) damages rice leaf, and Thichoderma asperellum (Ta) is a potential biological agent against rice blast. The aims were to identify a reduction of leaf blast severity (LBS), induction of biochemical defense, growth promotion, physiological changes, and modulation of four genes, promoted by four Ta isolates and Ta pool (mixed four Ta isolates). Assay 1 (A1) tested Ta, applied by soil drenched (D) or foliar spraying (S), and evaluated LBS and enzyme activity after challenge inoculation (ChI). Assay 2 (A2) detected growth promotion and physiological changes (A, E, gs, and WUE) when Ta was applied by seed treatment (ST). In assay 3 (A3), plants were treated with Ta by D and S and evaluated after ChI for physiological changes, total chlorophyll content, antioxidant enzymes, and gene expression. In A1, all treatments suppressed leaf blast, and Ta (Ufra.T06) promoted CHI, GLU, LOX, and PAL activities in all applications form. In A2, the Ta pool promoted increases of 52%, 12,24%, 90%, and 40% in A, E, gs, and WUE, respectively. In A3, the Ta pool suppressed LBS by 89% and modulated J10sPR10 and LOX-RLL expression by increasing 35% and 474%, respectively. Ta pool is a stable combination for a multiple function biological agent and should be inserted in integrated rice management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aTrichoderma asperellum 3ablast disease 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agrowth promotion 3ahighlands 3aleaves 3aplant pathology 3arice 3aseed treatment 3asoil 0aDefense enzymes 0aInduced resistance 0aPhysiology parameters 0aRice blast 0aRice disease management1 aChaibub, Amanda Abdallah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4025-668X1 aSilva, Gisele Barata da1 aFilippi, Marta Cristina Corsi de0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2020 Dec., v. 112 p.101561-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2020.1015613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001600282520136500298592002801663650001201691650001101703650001201714650001201726650001901738650002501757650001001782650002901792650000901821650001101830650002601841650001201867650002301879650001201902650001701914650001401931650000901945650001501954650000901969650001101978650001001989650001101999650001302010650001602023651001202039653002002051653001202071653001202083653002202095653001502117700002202132700002102154700002202175700002602197700002202223700002002245773012802265856008602393852000902479655001202488IND60571100420221116181451.0180831e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057110042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, Ali10aClimate-change and health effects of using rice husk for biochar-compost: Comparing three pyrolysis systems  ap. 260-272.  aThis study presents a comparative analysis of the environmental impacts of different biochar-compost (COMBI) systems in North Vietnam relative to the conventional practice of open burning of rice husks. Three COMBI systems, using different pyrolysis technologies (pyrolytic cook-stove, brick kiln and the BigChar 2200 unit) for conversion of rice husk into biochar were modelled. Biochar was assumed to be composted with manure and straw, and the biochar-compost produced from each system was assumed to be applied to paddy rice fields. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) showed that the three COMBI systems significantly improved environmental and health impacts of rice husk management in spring and summer compared with open burning, in terms of climate change, particulate matter (PM) and human toxicity (HT) impacts. The differences between the three COMBI systems in the climate change and PM impacts were not significant, possibly due to the large uncertainties. In all systems, the suppression of soil CH4 emissions is the major contributor to the reduced climate effect for the COMBI systems, comprising 56% in spring and 40% in summer. The greatest reduction in the HT impact was offered by the BigChar 2200 system, where biochar is produced in a large-scale plant in which pyrolysis gases are used to generate heat rather than released into the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3abricks 3aburning 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental impact 3agases 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3ahumans 3alife cycle assessment 3amethane 3amethane production 3apaddies 3aparticulates 3apyrolysis 3arice 3arice hulls 3asoil 3aspring 3astraw 3asummer 3atoxicity 3auncertainty 3aVietnam 0aPyrolysis gases 0aBiochar 0aCompost 0aMethane emissions 0aPaddy rice1 aCowie, Annette L.1 aAnh Mai, Thi Lan1 aBrandão, Miguel,1 aAnaya de la Rosa, Ruy1 aKristiansen, Paul1 aJoseph, Stephen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 162 p.260-272dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245006100173300001400234520161300248592002801861650001401889650001601903650002201919650001101941650001501952700001601967700001801983700002002001700002002021700001902041773008702060856008602147990002302233852000902256655001202265IND60092055320221120123626.0141103e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009205532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomažič, Simon10aIndoor-environment simulator for control design purposes  ap. 60-72.  aBuilding-management systems (BMSs) are becoming increasingly important as they are an efficient means to having buildings that consume less energy as well as for improving the indoor working and living environments. On the other hand, implementing automated control and monitoring systems in buildings is still relatively new, and one of the obstacles for their wider implementation is the ease of setting up the appropriate parameters for the controllers. During our work on an experimental controller for an indoor environment that is installed in an occupied office in the building of the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, it has become evident that a computer simulator of the system would be a welcome aid for the optimization of its functioning. In this paper we present a simulator application developed in a combined Matlab/Simulink and Dymola/Modelica environment. The simulator mirrors the functioning of the control system and the dynamics of the indoor environment, where the thermal model of the simulator was developed in the Dymola/Modelica environment, while the illuminance model was developed and parameterized as a black-box model on the basis of measurements in the Matlab environment. The simulator can emulate the response of conventional ON/OFF controllers as well as fuzzy controllers. The paper presents the design of the simulator with all of the key elements described. The underlying models for the thermal and illuminance control are also separately described. Finally, the performance of the simulator is presented for a selected day.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acontrollers 3aenergy efficiency 3amodels 3amonitoring1 aLogar, Vito1 aKristl, Živa1 aKrainer, Aleš,1 aŠkrjanc, Igor,1 aKošir, Mitja,0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Dec., v. 70 p.60-72dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.08.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245005500178300001600233520087300249536001001122592002801132650001701160650001401177650002001191650001001211650001001221650003001231650001701261653001601278653002101294653000901315653001601324700002301340773011001363856008501473852000901558655001201567IND60691461520221121001747.0200430e20191020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069146152DNAL7 a10.1080/15528014.2019.16381202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobart, Hiʻilei Julia10aOn racial constitutions and digestive therapeutics  ap. 576-594.  aThis dialogic piece includes two case studies examining how racial difference figures in digestion, health, and assimilation through the digestive tract.

The authors demonstrate the need for scholars of critical food and nutrition studies to reckon with the constitutively colonial manner in which dietary products, therapeutics, and ideals link “natural” or “ancient” foods to Indigenous lands and bodies.  aNone.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3afeces 3afoods 3aintestinal microorganisms 3atherapeutics 0aIndigeneity 0ahuman microbiome 0ataro 0acolonialism1 aMaroney, Stephanie0 tFood, culture, & society.g2019 Oct. 20, v. 22, no. 5 p.576-594dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15528014.2019.16381203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245018500176500002200361520173700383592002802120650002602148650002602174650001202200650001202212650002002224650001402244650002202258650002502280650001202305651001102317651002102328653001602349653001302365653003002378653001402408653001102422700002202433700002402455700006202479700001902541700002102560700001702581700002002598773010602618856009002724852000902814655001202823IND60612088020221118133022.0181029s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061208802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeović, Bojana,10aLegal framework of antimicrobial stewardship in hospitals (LEASH): a European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) cross-sectional international survey  aPre-press version  aAntimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is the cornerstone activity in the combat against antimicrobial resistance. In order to ensure sustainable deployment and development of AMS, a strategic and regulatory framework needs to be provided by national healthcare authorities. Experts from 32 European countries, Israel and Turkey were invited to participate in a cross-sectional internet-based survey from October 2016 to May 2017 on the legal framework and mandatory components (structures, activities) of AMS in hospitals, i.e. components required by legislation or regulations. We collected data from 25 countries and two regions (in countries with federal health administration). Laws regulating AMS existed in seven countries and one region. Other health ministry regulations were applicable in 13 countries and one region. National strategies and/or action plans approved by ministries of health were in place in 13 countries and one region. Conversely, five countries and one region had no regulation of AMS in hospitals. Funding for AMS in hospitals was provided in five countries and one region. Eight countries and one region reported mandatory AMS structures and activities complying with the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR) structure, policy and practice indicators. In 10/27 cases, however, the mandatory AMS activities were not being fully carried out. The survey showed heterogeneous legal frameworks for AMS in hospitals, and in many countries it was even lacking. The situation may be critical in countries with poor control of antimicrobial use and resistance. Recent international initiatives calling on policy-makers to address the threat of antimicrobial resistance could yield improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3aexperts 3afunding 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3asurveys 3aIsrael 3aTurkey (country) 0aLegislation 0aStrategy 0aAntimicrobial stewardship 0aHospitals 0aEurope1 aPulcini, Céline,1 aDumartin, Catherine1 aBéraud, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4705-09161 aNerat, Barbara1 aMaurel, Cristina1 aDoušak, May1 aČižman, Milan0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245010100168300001800269520162500287592002801912650004401940650003701984650001102021650002202032650002802054650002102082650002502103650001702128650001902145650004402164650001402208650002102222650001102243650001602254650002402270650001202294650001902306700001902325700002802344700002302372773014102395856007402536852000902610655001202619IND60670682320221118023800.0191002e20131009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067068232DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb21110j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoonasekera, Chandhi S.10aAttachment of poly(acrylic acid) to 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane surface-modified hydroxyapatite  ap. 5842-5852.  aNano-sized hydroxyapatite (HAP) is of interest in biomaterials science due to its similarity to bone mineral. In this study, HAP modification using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) was carried out in toluene and the effect of reaction time and curing temperature on the surface layers formed was investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It is shown that the chemical composition is strongly influenced by the curing temperature; with low temperatures of 50 and 100 °C resulting in a fully condensed APTES layer, an intermediate temperature of 150 °C causing partial oxidation of the surface layer with the conversion of some amine functionality to amides while curing at a temperature of 200 °C additionally leads to thermal decomposition of the silane layer and a loss of the pendent amine groups. However, the stability of these particles in aqueous solution indicated a loss of the silane layer for samples cured at 150 °C or less and it is concluded that there is a trade-off between the availability of functionality for further chemical grafting and the stability for these APTES-modified HAP materials. Subsequent attachment of the polyelectrolyte poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) via both ionic interaction and covalent bonding using carbodiimide chemistry resulted in particles with more negative zeta potentials (−27 to −18 mV) compared to pure HAP, which were stable to dispersion in aqueous solution, both with respect to their chemical composition at the particle surface and to aggregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aamides 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocompatible materials 3achemical bonding 3achemical composition 3aelectrolytes 3ahydroxyapatite 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3apolyacrylic acid 3asilane 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3atoluene 3azeta potential1 aJack, Kevin S.1 aCooper-White, Justin J.1 aGrøndahl, Lisbeth0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2013 Oct. 9, v. 1, no. 42 p.5842-5852dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21110j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245019600169300001600365520138400381592002801765650001101793650001101804650002701815650002001842650001201862650001401874650003301888650001701921650002801938653002001966653001101986653002101997653003702018653001402055700001102069700001302080700001902093773011402112856008602226852000902312655001202321IND60571100720221116174037.0180831e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057110072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lingen10aEnergy and valuable resource recovery from waste liquid crystal display panels by an environment-friendly technological process: Pyrolysis of liquid crystals and preparation of indium product  ap. 141-152.  aThe contradiction of energy, resource and environment from waste liquid crystal display (LCD) panels is becoming more and more prominent because it contain both harmful liquid crystals and valuable metal indium. However, scarce researches have considered how to separate liquid crystals and recycle indium from waste LCD panels by an environment-friendly process. In this work, an integrated technological process to recycle energy and valuable resource from LCD panels is proposed. Firstly, a stripping product enriched liquid crystals and indium is gained by a mechanical stripping separation. Then, based on a series of pyrolysis separation, vacuum chlorinated separation and substitution reaction, concentration of indium is increased to 36 wt % in final product from 0.02 wt % in waste LCD panels. Several highlights were summarized as follows: (i) Feasibility, principle and reaction mechanism was studied to understand this integrated process. (ii) For pyrolysis process, separation rate of liquid crystals approached 82.06% under optimized parameters by response surface methodology. For vacuum chlorinated process, recovery rate of indium can reach 97.16%. This technological process is quite significant in accordance with the “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle Principle” for solid waste and further provides a new opportunity for sustainable development of LCD markets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aindium 3aliquid crystal display 3aliquid crystals 3amarkets 3apyrolysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolid wastes 3asustainable development 0aLiquid crystals 0aIndium 0aWaste LCD panels 0aIntegrated technological process 0aRecycling1 aWu, Bi1 aChen, Ya1 aHsu, Chen-Min,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 162 p.141-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010300162300001600265520141400281592002801695650001701723650002901740650001401769650001801783650003501801650001401836650002401850650002401874650001501898650001101913650001501924650001501939651001001954700001701964700001401981700001601995773010002011856004802111852000902159655001202168IND50089387620221120120605.0140507e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008938762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11707-013-0393-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Yong10aDevelopment of a model-based flood emergency management system in Yujiang River Basin, South China  ap. 231-241.  aFlooding is the most frequent disaster in China. It affects people’s lives and properties, causing considerable economic loss. Flood forecast and operation of reservoirs are important in flood emergency management. Although great progress has been achieved in flood forecast and reservoir operation through using computer, network technology, and geographic information system technology in China, the prediction accuracy of models are not satisfactory due to the unavailability of real-time monitoring data. Also, real-time flood control scenario analysis is not effective in many regions and can seldom provide online decision support function. In this research, a decision support system for real-time flood forecasting in Yujiang River Basin, South China (DSS-YRB) is introduced in this paper. This system is based on hydrological and hydraulic mathematical models. The conceptual framework and detailed components of the proposed DSS-YRB is illustrated, which employs real-time rainfall data conversion, model-driven hydrologic forecasting, model calibration, data assimilation methods, and reservoir operational scenario analysis. Multi-tiered architecture offers great flexibility, portability, reusability, and reliability. The applied case study results show the development and application of a decision support system for real-time flood forecasting and operation is beneficial for flood control.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision support systems 3aeconomics 3aflood control 3ageographic information systems 3ahydrology 3amathematical models 3ameteorological data 3amonitoring 3apeople 3aprediction 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aCai, Yanpeng1 aJia, Peng1 aMao, Jiansu0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2014 June, v. 8, no. 2 p.231-241dSpringer-Verlagx2095-01957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-013-0393-8  aDNAL 7aarticle05694naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245018400182300001400366520321700380592002803597650001903625650003303644650001403677650001703691650001603708650001903724650002103743650002003764650002803784650001503812650002003827650001203847650001003859650001203869650001303881650001903894650001303913650000703926650002103933650001403954650002603968650002903994650002204023650001604045650001804061650001504079650001404094650001104108653000804119653000804127653000704135653000704142653000804149653000804157653000804165653001004173653000804183653000804191653000904199653002104208653002904229653001504258653001404273653003904287700003104326700001704357700006204374700002704436700002304463700002304486700006504509700006804574773011504642856008604757852000904843655001204852IND60612088220221118133045.0190705e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061208822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarques, Natália Paganini10aCellulases and xylanases production by endophytic fungi by solid state fermentation using lignocellulosic substrates and enzymatic saccharification of pretreated sugarcane bagasse  ap. 66-75.  aEndophytic fungi are widely studied as producers of secondary metabolites of biotechnological interest. In recent years, the interest in these fungi as new sources of enzymes, especially hydrolytic, has increased. In the present study, 14 strains of endophytic fungi not yet explored as enzymes sources were randomly chosen and prospected for cellulases and xylanases production by solid-state fermentation. Initially, fungi were cultivated in a mixture (1:1 w/w) of sugarcane bagasse and wheat bran for 7 days, at 28 °C. In this initial screening, 4 fungi excelled in endoglucanase activity (U/g): Cladosporium cladosporioides PAJ 03 (88.51 ± 1.0), Phomopsis stipata SC 04 (83.44 ± 7.7), Trichoderma viridae PAJ 01 (64.56 ± 4.0) and Botryosphaeria sp. AM 01 (42.79 ± 1.6). On the other hand, the following 4 fungi stood out in relation to β-glucosidase activity (U/g): Saccharicola sp. EJC 04 (51.56 ± 2.7), Paecilomyces sp. SF 021 (33.19 ± 9.2), Ustilaginoidea sp. CV 04 (29.75 ± 0.8) and Ustilaginoidea sp. XYA 04 (21.72 ± 3.05). Among these fungi, P. stipata SC 04 and Botryosphaeria sp. AM 01 were the best producers of xylanase and β-xilosidase (694,33 and 4,87 U/g, respectively). These 8 fungi were then cultured in new mixtures (1:1 w/w) of lignocellulosic substrates. Botryosphaeria sp. AM01and Saccharicola sp. EJC04 stood out regarding endoglucanase and β-glucosidase activities (184.74 ± 6.0 and 92.28 ± 9.57 U/g, respectively) when cultivated on cotton seed meal and wheat bran and were selected to continue the study. The influence of time cultivation, inoculum amount and substrate initial moisture content was evaluated and the best condition for cellulases production was 192 h, six mycelial plugs and 65%, respectively, for both fungi. Cellulases and xylanases produced under these conditions were characterized and optimum pH and temperature values were between 4.5–6 and 60–75 °C, respectively. The enzymes were stable over a wide pH range and under 30–70 °C. β-glucosidase from both isolates retained about 75–80% of their activity in the presence of glucose at 6 mM. The presence of ethanol stimulated β-glucosidase activity from Botryosphaeria sp. AM01 (about 60% higher in the presence of ethanol at 15%). On the other hand, the activity of β-glucosidase produced by Saccharicola sp. EJC 04 was reduced at ethanol concentrations above 15%. A blend of the enzymatic extracts was used to saccharify pretreated sugarcane bagasse and a face-centered central composite design was used to find the best conditions. Under the predicted optimum condition (50 °C, 5% of sugarcane bagasse, 150 U g−1 of endoglucanase and 20 h), glucose and xylose concentrations obtained were 3.56 and 1.66 mg mL−1, respectively. These results show that the 14 endophytic fungi studied have potential to be explored as producers of plant material degrading enzymes. Botryosphaeria sp. AM01 and Saccharicola sp. EJC 04 are promising in relation to the production of cellulases and xylanases and their enzymatic extracts have potential for application in pre-treated sugarcane bagasse saccharification processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryosphaeria 3aCladosporium cladosporioides 3aDiaporthe 3aPaecilomyces 3aTrichoderma 3aUstilaginoidea 3abeta-glucosidase 3acottonseed meal 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aendophytes 3aenzyme activity 3aethanol 3afungi 3aglucose 3ainoculum 3alignocellulose 3amycelium 3apH 3asaccharification 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3asolid state fermentation 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3awater content 3awheat bran 3axylanases 3axylose 0aSCB 0aCSM 0aWB 0aOT 0aSBM 0aSSF 0aPDA 0aFPase 0aFPU 0aCCD 0aHPLC 0aEndophytic fungi 0aSolid state fermentation 0aCellulases 0aXylanases 0aSugarcane bagasse saccharification1 ade Cassia Pereira, Josiani1 aGomes, Eleni1 aSilva, Roberto da,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1468-57521 aAraújo, Angela Regina1 aFerreira, Henrique1 aRodrigues, André,1 aDussán, Kelly Johana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1810-53131 aBocchini, Daniela Alonso1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4353-48300 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 122 p.66-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04302naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245016400205300001800369500002400387500001500411520237000426650002202796650001802818650002602836650001702862650001902879650001602898650001902914650001202933650002002945650001602965650001102981650001702992650002203009650002503031650001003056650002003066650001503086650002103101650002003122650001903142650001703161650002003178650001503198653001903213653003103232700001803263700001803281700001803299700001703317700001603334700001703350773009403367852000903461856007703470930003303547945002503580946001103605655001203616IND4386127420221120130208.0061219e20061211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438612742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2006.07.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aM001 0aM1201 aRefstie, S.10aDigestive function and intestinal integrity in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fed kernel meals and protein concentrates made from yellow or narrow-leafed lupins  ap. 1382-1395.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study assessed the effects of yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus) and narrow-leafed lupin (L. angustifolius) kernel meals and protein concentrates on the gastrointestinal integrity, capacity for digestive hydrolysis, and digestibility of nutrients in Atlantic salmon. A basal diet (FM) was made from fish meal, wheat, and fish oil. Six additional diets were formulated by replacing 30% of the FM diet with lupin kernel meal made from L. l. cv. Wodjil (LKM), L. a. cv. Belara (BKM), and L. a. cv. Myallie (MKM), lupin protein concentrates made from the same L. l. (LPC) and L. a. cv. M (MPC), or extracted soybean meal (SBM). All diets were extruded. Each diet was fed to three groups of 176 g salmon kept in 1 m2 tanks with 5.6 °C saltwater for 3 weeks prior to sampling of blood, intestinal organs, digesta, and faeces. Inclusion of lupin meals in the diets resulted in harder and more condensed feed particles. Ulcer-like lesions were observed in the stomach of fish from all feeding groups, and this was worsened by lupin in the diet, but did not appear to be pellet hardness related. No consistent altered morphology was observed in the distal intestine (DI) of fish fed the FM and lupin diets, while the DI of fish fed SBM showed consistent and typical soybean meal-induced pathomorphological changes. Plasma cholesterol was higher when feeding MKM and LKM than when feeding FM, MPC, and LPC, with intermediate levels when feeding BKM and SBM. Feeding LKM and LPC resulted in a higher weight of the GIT when related to body weight. Trypsin activity and bile acid concentration were generally higher in digesta from the pyloric (PI) and mid (MI) intestine when feeding FM and lupin diets than when feeding SBM, while the opposite was seen for trypsin activity in digesta from DI. There were no effects of diet on leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and maltase activity in PI and MI, but in DI the activity of these brush border enzymes were significantly lowered when feeding SBM. SBM in the diet resulted in watery faeces and lowered apparent digestibility of lipid, but this was not observed when feeding the lupin diets. To conclude, the tested lupin kernel meals and protein concentrates did not alter the intestinal function in Atlantic salmon when included at 30% of the diet. Dietary lupin was, however, involved in the worsening of ulcer-like gastric lesions. 3aanimal morphology 3adigestibility 3aLupinus angustifolius 3afish feeding 3astomach ulcers 3aSalmo salar 3aLupinus luteus 3atrypsin 3ablood chemistry 3amariculture 3asalmon 3ablood plasma 3adigestible energy 3aplant source protein 3aseeds 3aanadromous fish 3amicrovilli 3afeed composition 3aenzyme activity 3ahistopathology 3afish culture 3aprotein content 3abile acids 0aplant proteins 0agastrointestinal integrity1 aGlencross, B.1 aLandsverk, T.1 aSørensen, M.1 aLilleeng, E.1 aHawkins, W.1 aKrogdahl, A.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Dec. 11, v. 261, no. 4 p.1382-1395dElsevier Pub.

Five iso-energetic diets containing different level of cholesterol ranging from 0.14% to 1% of dry weight of the diet were tested. Fifteen megalopa were reared individually for each dietary treatment, and development time and survival were recorded on a daily basis. More than 25% of megalopa from all treatments were able to metamorphose into the first crab stage, suggesting that the endogenous level of cholesterol in the basal diet (0.14%) was sufficient to support development of the megalopa stage of this species. Widest mean carapace width (3.53 ± 0.08 mm) and highest mean dry weight (2.11 ± 0.22 mg) were recorded for juveniles that molted from megalopa fed live Artemia, whereas no megalopa in the unfed control treatment metamorphosed into crabs. The average development time from megalopa to the juvenile crab stage varied between the treatments, where megalopa fed live Artemia or MBD containing 0.2%, 0.4% or 0.8% total cholesterol showed the most synchronized molting (between 8.0 and 9.9 days). Longest development time was recorded for the megalopa fed diets containing 0.14% or 1% total cholesterol (both 11 days). Highest survival (74.3%) was recorded for the megalopa fed a diet containing 0.8% cholesterol. The results of this study are valuable in research to develop formulated diets for mud crab larvae as a replacement for live food in hatchery culture. 3aPortunidae 3amortality 3aanimal growth 3aanimal development 3ametamorphosis 3afeed supplements 3adietary fat 3acholesterol 3acrab culture 0aScylla serrata1 aZeng, C.1 aSouthgate, P.C.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Dec. 11, v. 261, no. 4 p.1328-1334dElsevier Pub.

Animals—20 dogs from another study with macroscopic evidence of pancreatitis and 44 dogs surrendered for euthanasia or expected to die. Procedures—Prior to death, physical examination of each dog was performed and blood samples were collected for serum biochemical, serum cPSL, and hematologic analyses. After death, the pancreas was removed, sectioned in 1- to 2-cm slices, and evaluated by a pathologist. Dogs were classified by whether they had clinical or macroscopic pancreatitis. Each pancreatic section was histologically examined, and mean cumulative scores (MCSs) were assigned for 8 histologic characteristics. For each characteristic, comparisons were made between dogs with and without pancreatitis to establish histologic criteria for lack of evidence of pancreatitis. Results—For all histologic characteristics except lymphocytic infiltration, the median MCS differed significantly between dogs with and without pancreatitis. Dogs were categorized as having no histologic evidence of pancreatitis when the MCSs for neutrophilic infiltration, pancreatic necrosis, peripancreatic fat necrosis, and edema were 0.0. On the basis of these criteria, 40 dogs were classified as having no evidence of pancreatitis. The cPSL concentration was within reference limits in 38 of these 40 dogs and was less than the cutoff value for diagnosing pancreatitis (400 μg/L) in 39 of the 40 dogs, resulting in a specificity of 97.5% (95% confidence interval, 86.8% to 99.9%). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—The cutoff cPSL value used in this study may be useful for diagnosing pancreatitis in dogs with a lack of histologic lesions consistent with pancreatitis and for which pancreatitis is not considered a major differential diagnosis. 3ablood serum 3aclinical examination 3aconfidence interval 3adeath 3adogs 3aedema 3aeuthanasia 3anecrosis 3apancreas 3apancreatitis1 aRobertson, Jane E.1 aNewman, Shelley J.1 aKutchmarick, David1 aRelford, Roberta1 aWoosley, Kristen1 aSteiner, Jörg M.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2011 Mar., v. 72, no. 3 p.302-307x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.72.3.3023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02153naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002200141245007500163300001600238500002400254520112800278650001501406650002801421650001401449650001201463650001201475650001401487700002401501700002201525700002301547700002101570700002501591773009701616852000901713856008101722655001201803IND4457264420221122203722.0110427s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445726442DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.72.3.2952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchemera, Bettina10aEvaluation of otoacoustic emissions in clinically normal alert puppies  ap. 295-301.  aIncludes references  aObjective—To evaluate distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements in puppies with normal hearing. Animals—23 clinically normal 7.5-to 10.5-week-old puppies. Procedures—A cross-sectional study was performed. The DPOAE measurements were obtained with a commercially available distortion product otoacoustic measurement system and were performed in a quiet, non-sound-attenuated room. All measurements were obtained from alert puppies and were repeated 1 or 2 times to ensure that the measurements were replicable. Results that were a minimum of 8 dB higher than the noise floor were accepted. Values from the first trial in which emissions were obtained at all test frequencies were used for analysis. Results—Otoacoustic emission measurements were easily obtained, robust, reliable, and consistent with auditory brainstem response and behavioral results. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Hearing screening in alert puppies can be accomplished reliably and rapidly with otoacoustic emissions testing. Results supported the possibility of the use of DPOAE measurement in hearing screening of dogs. 3abrain stem 3across-sectional studies 3aemissions 3ahearing 3apuppies 3ascreening1 aBlumsack, Judith T.1 aCellino, Alice F.1 aQuiller, Travis D.1 aHess, Bradley A.1 aRynders, Patricia E.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2011 Mar., v. 72, no. 3 p.295-301x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.72.3.2953Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03294naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245010000182300001400282500002400296520146800320650002701788650001501815650001501830650001301845650001301858650002301871650001601894650001901910650001601929650003001945650001601975650001401991650001402005650002002019650001802039650001502057650001002072650002402082650001302106650001002119650001202129650001502141650002402156650001102180650001502191650006302206650003102269650001602300650001402316650000902330650002202339651000902361651000902370700002402379700001602403700001802419773010102437852000902538856008502547655001202632IND4457261220221122174304.0110427s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445726122DNAL7 a205695192pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853100001552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIranipour, S.10aLife tables for sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae) in northern Iran  ap. 33-44.  aIncludes references  aLife table studies of sunn pest were carried out in Varamin, Iran, from 1998–2001 in order to determine stage-specific mortalities and the impact of specific natural enemies on population dynamics. Populations were sampled 2–3 times weekly in agricultural fields during the growing season and monthly during the period of dormancy at resting sites in nearby mountains some 30km away from cereal fields. Adults spend a period of 9–10 months in diapause and suffered overcompensatory, density-dependent mortality during this period. Variation in adult overwintering survival was inferred to be largely a function of the physiological condition of bugs that is reduced in a density-dependent manner by intraspecific competition for food among newly molted adults prior to migration to resting sites. Adult mortality emerged as the primary factor in key factor analysis, contributing 73% of the total variance in mortality. Other important factors were egg parasitism by Trissolcus vassilievi Mayr and adult parasitism by several species of Tachinidae. Although T. vassilievi made only a minor contribution to overall variance in total mortality, it had a significant effect on the number of newly molted adults, the life stage that is most damaging to cereal crops. The equilibrium level of the pest population in wheat fields was inferred to be ca. 72.6 adults mx2, a number that substantially exceeds the economic threshold that ranges from 3–5 adults mx2. 3aEurygaster integriceps 3aTachinidae 3aTrissolcus 3adiapause 3adormancy 3aeconomic threshold 3agrain crops 3agrowing season 3ainsect eggs 3aintraspecific competition 3alife tables 3amortality 3amountains 3anatural enemies 3aoverwintering 3aparasitism 3apests 3apopulation dynamics 3avariance 3awheat 2aAnimals 2aCrotalaria 2aDipteraxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFood Chain 2aHemipteraxgrowth & developmentxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aLife Tables 2aLongevity 2aMale 2aWaspsxphysiology 3aIran 0aIran1 aPakdel, A.

The carbon sequestration potential of crop lands should be considered as a modest but non-negligible contribution to climate change mitigation. Salinity is one of the most important environmental factors limiting crop production of marginal agricultural soils in many parts of the world. In our research, several physiological analyses were performed in atmospheric CO2, in daylight, both in normal conditions and with salinity (40 mM NaCl). Crops like melon or pepper showed significantly lower photosynthetic rates when they were grown in saline conditions. Also, the total chlorophyll content and carbon percentage were lower in the salinity-treated plants of these species. For lettuce, treated plants showed a significant decrease in photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll content, but there were no differences in carbon content. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the values of total chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, or carbon content for tomato and watermelon plants when control and NaCl-treated plants were compared. The mineral composition data showed greater increases of sodium in both roots and leaves of melon and pepper when plants were treated with NaCl compared with the rest of the species. In conclusion, tomato and watermelon seem to be more efficient in CO2 fixation than the other crops of this experiment and this seems to be related to their greater salinity tolerance. 3aagricultural soils 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3acropland 3aenvironmental factors 3ahorticultural crops 3aleaves 3alettuce 3amineral content 3apepper 3aphotosynthesis 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atomatoes 3awatermelons1 aAlcaraz-Lopez, Carlos1 aMartinez-Ballesta, M.

The trial was carried out over two growing seasons (2008 to 2009). In April 2008, 1-year-old bare-root seedlings of the two species were potted in three types of 1-L containers: Superoots Air-Cell (The Caledonian Tree Company, Pathhead, UK), Quadro fondo rete (Bamaplast, Massa e Cozzile, Italy), and smooth-sided containers. At the beginning of the second growing season, the same plants were repotted in the following 3-L containers: Superoots Air-Pot (The Caledonian Tree Company), Quadro antispiralizzante (Bamaplast), and smooth-sided containers. At the end of each growing season, a subset of the plants from each container type was harvested to determine shoot and root dry mass and root deformation (by dry weight of root deformed mass relative to the whole root mass). Chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf chlorophyll content were measured during the second growing season. For both species, at the end of first growing season, the poorest root architecture was observed in the smooth-sided containers, whereas Superoots Air-Cell and Quadro fondo rete both reduced the percentage of deformed root mass. At the end of the second growing season, plants of both species grown in Superoots Air-Pot showed less deformed root mass, whereas Quadro antispiralizzante provided good results only in littleleaf linden. A reduction of field elm root biomass and littleleaf linden shoot biomass was observed at the end of the trial in plants grown in Superoots Air-Pot. Plants grown in these containers showed less leaf chlorophyll content compared with plants grown in smooth-sided containers at the end of the second year. 3aTilia cordata 3aUlmus minor 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acontainer-grown plants 3acontainers 3adeformation 3afluorescence 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3atrees 3aItaly 3aUnited Kingdom1 aFrangi, Piero1 aPiatti, Riccardo1 aFerrini, Francesco1 aFini, Alessio1 aFaoro, Marco0 tHortScience.g2010 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.1824-1829x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245021700181300001600398500002400414520166000438650001702098650001302115650000902128650001102137650001502148650001102163650001202174650001002186650002702196650001102223650001502234650001002249650001302259650001002272650002002282650001702302650001502319650000902334650001102343650001902354650001002373650001202383650002102395650001102416650001002427650004602437650000902483650003702492650001102529650002302540650003202563651001402595651001402609700001702623700001702640700001202657700002002669700001602689773010302705852000902808856008502817655001202902IND4457272120221122143118.0110429s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445727212DNAL7 a210345172pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853100003012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoddle, M.S.10aField optimization of the sex pheromone of Stenoma catenifer (Lepidoptera: Elachistidae): evaluation of lure types, trap height, male flight distances, and number of traps needed per avocado orchard for detection  ap. 145-152.  aIncludes references  aThe sex pheromone of Stenoma catenifer was evaluated in commercial avocado orchards in Guatemala to determine operational parameters, such as optimal lure type, trap height, trap density and estimates of the distances that male moths fly. Of four pheromone dispensers tested, gray and white rubber septa were of equal efficacy, whereas 1-ml low-density polyethylene vials and 2×3-cm polyethylene ziplock bags were least efficacious. The height at which wing traps were hung did not significantly affect the number of adult male S. catenifer captured. For monitoring S. catenifer, these data suggest that the pheromone should be dispensed from gray rubber septa in wing traps hung inside the tree canopy at 1.75 m, a height convenient for trap placement and monitoring. Mark-recapture studies of male S. catenifer indicated that, on average, males flew 67 m in one night. However, it is likely that this is an underestimate of the distance that male moths are capable of flying in a single night. Probabilistic modeling of S. catenifer capture data from different numbers of pheromone traps deployed in seven commercial avocado orchards of varying sizes and infestation levels suggested that 10-13 randomly deployed traps per orchard for a 7-day period are needed to detect at least one male S. catenifer with 90% confidence. These data provide sufficient information to develop effective protocols for using the S. catenifer pheromone to detect and monitor this pest in countries with endemic populations that are exporting fresh avocados, and for quarantine detection and incursion monitoring in countries receiving avocado imports from high risk areas. 3aElachistidae 3aavocados 3abags 3acanopy 3adispensers 3aflight 3aimports 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amoths 3aorchards 3apests 3apheromone traps 3apolyethylene 3aquarantine 3arisk 3arubber 3asex pheromones 3atrees 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aInsect Controlxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aMale 2aMothsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPersea 2aPopulation Density 2aSex Attractantsxphysiology 3aGuatemala 0aGuatemala1 aMillar, J.G.1 aHoddle, C.D.1 aZou, Y.1 aMcElfresh, J.S.1 aLesch, S.M.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2011 Apr., v. 101, no. 2 p.145-152dCABI Pubx0007-48537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853100003013Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02440naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245009300136300001800229500002400247520157100271650002501842650001701867650001001884650001401894650001601908650000701924650001701931650002201948650001401970700002201984700002702006773007202033852000902105655001202114IND4457280720221122143207.0110429s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445728072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvila-Rostant, Omaira10aSpathe Color Variation in Anthurium andraeanum Hort. and Its Relationship to Vacuolar pH  ap. 1768-1772.  aIncludes references  aThe relationship between vacuolar pH in Anthurium andraeanum (Hort.) and spathe color, cultivar, developmental stage, spathe location, spathe surface differences, and time after harvest was investigated with the overall long-term objective of developing a methodology for engineering blue-colored spathes. Chromospectral analysis of the pigmentation was also studied. Six experiments were conducted involving 23 cultivars of anthurium with each experiment arranged in a randomized complete block design with five replications. Spathe color was associated with vacuolar pH with the whites and greens having the highest pH (average 5.65) followed by corals (5.38), pinks (5.20), reds (5.10), and oranges (4.5). In general, there was correspondence between the lightness of the pigmentation (L*) and the pH values with the lighter colors having higher pH values. There were, however, significant differences among cultivars within the color groups. Whereas spathe pH decreased with aging, there was no difference in the spectral data, suggesting that factors other than anthocyanin content may be contributing to the pH difference. There were no differences in pH between locations sampled on the spathe nor between the spathe surfaces provided there were no differences in color intensity (L*). The pH increased with vase life in two of three cultivars tested with pH values showing an association with increases in a* and b* (chromospectral data) reflecting a bluing effect. The importance of the results to engineering blue-colored spathes in anthurium is discussed. 3aAnthurium andraeanum 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3acultivars 3aengineering 3apH 3apigmentation 3aspectral analysis 3avase life1 aLennon, Adrian M.1 aUmaharan, Pathmanathan0 tHortScience.g2010 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.1768-1772x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017200126300001600298500002400314520148000338650005101818650001601869650001301885650002301898650001301921650001501934650001401949650001401963650001201977650001201989650000902001651001002010700001702020700001602037700001702053700002102070700002402091773008902115852000902204856009302213655001202306IND4457270920221122143122.0110428s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445727092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayak, A.K.10aDiagnosis and recommendation integrated system approach for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc foliar diagnostic norms for aonla in Central Indo-Gangetic Plains  ap. 547-556.  aIncludes references  aA survey was conducted for the nutritional status of aonla orchards in the state of Uttar Pradesh lying in Central Indo-Gangetic plains. Preliminary diagnosis and recommendation integrated system (DRIS) norms were established for different nutrient ratios and used to compute the DRIS indices, which assessed the nutrient balance and order of limitations to yield. Maximum fruit yield of 40.2 kg plant-1 was recorded for the plants at the age group of 10-15 years and lowest yield was recorded 28.3 kg plant-1 in the age of above 20 years. Nutrient sufficiency ranges for aonla derived from DRIS norms were 1.30- 1.64, 0.054-0.092, 0.40-0.64%, and 32.4-45.9 ppm for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and zinc (Zn), respectively. On the basis of these sufficiency ranges 33, 51, 47, and 46% of samples were found sufficient whereas 34, 22, 18 and 27% of samples were low and 26, 8, 1 and 17% deficient in N, P, K, and Zn, respectively. When compared age wise, a relative deficiency for N, P, and K corresponding to relative sufficiency for Zn was detected by DRIS technique for the plants above the age group of 15 onwards. For the younger orchards (5yrs old) a relative deficiency of N, Zn, and K corresponding to the relative sufficiency of P was detected. Nitrogen was found most limiting elements in all age group of plant. When the DRIS indices were compared on basis of soil pH, Zn and K was found to be relatively lesser in order of requirement than N and P. 3aDiagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System 3afruit yield 3anitrogen 3anutritional status 3aorchards 3aphosphorus 3aplant age 3apotassium 3asoil pH 3asurveys 3azinc 3aIndia1 aSharma, D.K.1 aSingh, C.S.1 aMishra, V.K.1 aSingh, Gurbachan1 aSwarup, A.q(Anand)0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011, v. 34, no. 1-4 p.547-556dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02214naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010800125300001600233500002400249520101800273650002201291650001001313650002101323650002301344650001601367650002601383650001301409650001601422650001101438650001301449650001101462650001801473650001001491651001301501700001601514700001701530700001301547700001501560700001401575773008901589852000901678856009301687655001201780IND4457271420221122143112.0110428s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445727142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashid, A.10aBoron deficiency in rainfed wheat in Pakistan: incidence, spatial variability and management strategies  ap. 600-613.  aIncludes references  aBoron (B) deficiency is potentially an important nutrient constraint in calcareous soils. We determined B deficiency incidence and spatial distribution in rainfed wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 1.82 Mha Pothohar plateau in Pakistan, its relationship with soil types, crop responses to B, and internal B requirement and B fertilizer use efficiency of wheat. Plant and soil analyses indicated deficiency in 64% of the 61 sampled fields; geostatistics-aided contour maps delineated B deficient areas. In rainfed field experiments, B use increased wheat yields up to 11%. Fertilizer requirement was 1.2 kg B ha-1; critical B concentration (mg kg-1) ranges were: young whole shoots, 4-6; flag leaves, 5-7. Boron uptake by wheat was 0.14-0.58% of applied dosage, leaving substantial residual impact. Highly cost-effective B use or B-efficient genotype adoption can enhance wheat productivity and grower-income. Such effective nutrient assessment and management approaches can be beneficially adopted elsewhere as well. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aboron 3acalcareous soils 3acost effectiveness 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3aplateaus 3ashoots 3asoil analysis 3awheat 3aPakistan1 aRafique, E.1 aBhatti, A.U.1 aRyan, J.1 aBughio, N.1 aYau, S.K.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011, v. 34, no. 1-4 p.600-613dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02273naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245015400126300001600280500002400296520102600320650001201346650002101358650002001379650001401399650001701413650001601430650001401446650002301460650001301483650002001496650002101516650001701537650002201554700001901576700001701595700001501612700002001627700001301647773008901660852000901749856009301758655001201851IND4457269620221122105111.0110428s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445726962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhayyat, M.10aEffects of different calcium forms on gas exchange activities, water usage and macronutrient uptake by strawberry plants under sodium chloride stress  ap. 427-435.  aIncludes references  aStrawberry cv. 'Selva' was grown in soilless culture under greenhouse conditions to study the effects of supplementary calcium added to nutrient solution and applied to the plants grown under sodium chloride (NaCl) (35 mM) salinity. Treatments were: 1) commercial nutrient solution or control [expressed as (N)]; 2) N+NaCl (35 mM) [expressed as (NS)]; 3) NS+CaCl2 (5 mM) [expressed as (NS1)]; 4) NS+calcium chloride (CaCl2) (10 mM) [expressed as (NS2)]; 5) NS+calcium sulfate (CaSO4) (5 mM) [expressed as (NS3)]; and 6) NS+CaSO4 (10 mM) [expressed as (NS4)]. Leaf area, water usage and gas exchange were negatively affected under salinity. Supplementary calcium positively affected the harmful effects of NaCl on mentioned variables. However, there were significant differences between beneficial effects of calcium forms. Based on previous findings and in regards to these results, it was shown that calcium sulfate was better than calcium chloride in ameliorating the negative effects of NaCl salinity on this cultivar. 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acalcium sulfate 3acultivars 3agas exchange 3agreenhouses 3aleaf area 3anutrient solutions 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3asoilless culture 3astrawberries 3awater utilization1 aKhanizadeh, S.1 aTafazoli, E.1 aRajaee, S.1 aKholdebarin, B.1 aEmam, Y.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011, v. 34, no. 1-4 p.427-435dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02855naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009100130300001600221500002400237520157900261650002201840650001301862650002401875650000901899650002501908650002101933650001901954650001001973650001101983650001301994650002102007650002502028650001702053650001102070650002502081650001702106651001302123700001702136700001902153700001602172700001802188773008902206852000902295856009302304655001202397IND4457267520221122064828.0110428s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445726752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirma, Kefyalew10aNitrogen accumulation in shoots as a function of growth stage of corn and winter wheat  ap. 165-182.  aIncludes references  aMidseason fertilizer nitrogen (N) rates based on predicted yields can be projected if the quantity of N accumulated in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) is known especially early in the growing season. This study was conducted in 2006 and 2007 to establish the amount of N accumulated in corn and winter wheat over the entire growing season. Plots representing three N fertilization rates 0, 45, and 90 kg ha-1 at Stillwater and 0, 67, and 112 kg ha-1 at Lahoma were selected from two long-term wheat experiments located at research stations in Stillwater and Lahoma, Oklahoma. For corn, three N fertilization rates 0, 112 and 224 kg ha-1 at Lake Carl Blackwell and 0, 56 and 112 kg ha-1 at Perkins were selected from N studies, located at research stations near Lake Carl Blackwell and Perkins, Oklahoma. Sequential aboveground biomass samples were collected from 1 m2 area of wheat and 1.5 m long row (0.76 cm spacing) for corn throughout their respective growing seasons. In general, this work showed that more than 45% of the maximum total N accumulated could be found in corn plants by growth stage V8 (8th leaf collar fully unfolded). For winter wheat, more than 61% of the maximum total N accumulated at later stages of growth could be accounted for by Feekes growth stage 5 (F5, leaf strongly erected). Our findings are consistent with those of others showing that yield potential can be predicted at mid-season since such a large percentage of the total N accumulated was accounted for early on in the growing cycle of either wheat or corn. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aaboveground biomass 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3afertilizer rates 3agrowing season 3alakes 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aplant growth 3ashoots 3aspatial distribution 3awinter wheat 3aOklahoma1 aHoltz, Starr1 aTubana, Brenda1 aSolie, John1 aRaun, William0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011, v. 34, no. 1-4 p.165-182dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02301naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007600128300001400204500002400218520101900242650001201261650001601273650001801289650001601307650002101323650002401344650001001368650001401378650001201392650001201404650001101416650001801427650001701445650001701462700002301479700001301502700001801515700002701533700002101560700002001581700002001601700002101621773008701642852000901729856009301738655001201831IND4457266620221122064937.0110428s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445726662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonobe, Kaori10aEffect of silicon application on sorghum root responses to water stress  ap. 71-82.  aIncludes references  aTo analyze how silicon (Si) fertilizer improves plant growth under water stress, we investigated the growth and root responses of sorghum seedlings to Si application. Seedlings were grown hydroponically at two Si levels (0 and 1.78 mM) and under two water stress conditions simulated with polyethylene glycol. The reduction in dry weight due to stress was alleviated by Si application, accompanied by an increase in root water uptake. Silicon application decreased the osmotic potential of the roots without affecting their water content, showing that osmotic adjustment occurred to increase water uptake. An assessment of root solutes suggested that soluble sugar and amino acids (alanine and glutamic acid) were osmolytes responsible for this adjustment. Root anatomical traits related to water transport were not affected by the Si application. These results improved our understanding of the physiological mechanisms that underlie the Si-induced increases in sorghum growth and water uptake under water stress. 3aalanine 3afertilizers 3aglutamic acid 3ahydroponics 3aosmotic pressure 3apolyethylene glycol 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asilicon 3asolutes 3asugars 3awater content 3awater stress 3awater uptake1 aHattori, Taiichiro1 aAn, Ping1 aTsuji, Wataru1 aEneji, Anthony Egrinya1 aKobayashi, Sohei1 aKawamura, Yukio1 aTanaka, Kiyoshi1 aInanaga, Shinobu0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011, v. 34, no. 1-4 p.71-82dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01448naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245010200132300001400234500001500248520040000263650002500663650002300688650002200711650001500733653003100748653001300779653001500792653002200807653002000829653002100849700001600870700001600886773010900902852000901011939003301020945000801053946001301061655001201074991596594000742620221122052443.0841217e198404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE849250022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWysong, J.W.14aThe economic viability of commercial fresh vegetable production in the Northeastern United States  ap. 65-72.  a2019-12-04  aExtract: The Northeast region with nearly 25 percent of the U.S. population and purchasing power in 1983 is a deficit region in both processing and fresh market vegetable crops.

An analysis of 59 requests for rezoning from agricultural to other uses indicates that, in general, both the Planning Commission staff and the County Commissioners conform to the Ordiance. At the Commissioners' level, a development bias in favor of industrial use was found. The methodology may also be used to forecast the probability a particular rezoning request would be approved. 3aagricultural land 3azoning 3amodels 3aMaryland 0adevelopment rights1 aLessley, B.V.1 aPhipps, T.0 tJournal - Northeastern Agricultural Economics Council.g1984 Apr., v. 13, no. 1 p.20-24x0163-54847nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19841213c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle01108naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004700133300001400180500003100194520028300225650001500508650002200523650001200545650001700557653001100574653001600585773012600601852000900727939003300736945000800769946002900777655001200806991596593390742620221122035121.0841213e198103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE849249622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, J.E.10aTrends in 1980 farmland leases and rentals  ap. 23-26.  aIncludes statistical data.  aExtract: Many North Dakota farmers and ranchers use leasing agreements to gain control of additional resources for their businesses.

Although the EBV-infected normal B cells in vitro and the EBV-carrying B cell lymphomas in immunodeficient patients express the full set of latent proteins (type III latency), the majority of EBV-associated malignancies express the restricted type I (EBNA-1 only) or type II (EBNA-1 and LMPs) viral program. The mechanisms responsible for these different latent viral gene expression patterns are only partially known. IL-21 is a potent B cell activator and plasma cell differentiation-inducer cytokine produced by CD4⁺ T cells. We studied its effect on EBV-carrying B cells. In type I Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines and in the conditional lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) ER/EB2-5, IL-21 potently activated STAT3 and induced the expression of LMP-1, but not EBNA-2. The IL-21-treated type I Jijoye M13 BL line ceased to proliferate, and this was paralleled by the induction of IRF4 and the down-regulation of BCL6 expression. In the type III LCLs and BL lines, IL-21 repressed the C-promoter-derived and LMP-2A mRNAs, whereas it up-regulated the expression of LMP-1 mRNAs. The IL-21-treated type III cells underwent plasma cell differentiation with the induction of Blimp-1, and high levels of Ig and Oct-2. IL-21 might be involved in the EBNA-2-independent expression of LMP-1 in EBV-carrying type II cells. In light of the fact that IL-21 is already in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple malignancies, the in vivo modulation of EBV gene expression by IL-21 might have therapeutic benefits for the EBV-carrying malignancies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproteins 3amessenger RNA 3alymphoma 3ahumans 3agene expression regulation 3agene expression 3apatients 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3acell differentiation 3aclinical trials 3ainterleukin-21 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 4 0aHuman herpesvirus 41 aSalamon, Daniel1 aPersson, Emma K.1 aFerrari de Nagy, Noemí.1 aScheeren, Ferenc A.1 aSpits, Hergen1 aKlein, George1 aKlein, Eva0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 12, v. 107, no. 2 p.872-877dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09129201073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02975naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245007800204300001800282506007600300520103100376506003701407650001801444650001301462650001101475650001401486650000901500650001301509650001301522650001801535650001301553650001101566651001101577651002201588651001601610700002401626700003001650700002501680700002101705700001701726700002001743700002401763700003801787700003201825700002801857700002701885700003101912700002201943700003501965700001702000700002102017773017302038852000902211856008302220930003302303946001302336655001202349IND4431684620221207083833.0100122e20100119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443168462DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09140881072doi7 aPMC28243072pmcid7 a200806532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZilhão, João.10aSymbolic use of marine shells and mineral pigments by Iberian Neandertals  ap. 1023-1028.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo sites of the Neandertal-associated Middle Paleolithic of Iberia, dated to as early as approximately 50,000 years ago, yielded perforated and pigment-stained marine shells. At Cueva de los Aviones, three umbo-perforated valves of Acanthocardia and Glycymeris were found alongside lumps of yellow and red colorants, and residues preserved inside a Spondylus shell consist of a red lepidocrocite base mixed with ground, dark red-to-black fragments of hematite and pyrite. A perforated Pecten shell, painted on its external, white side with an orange mix of goethite and hematite, was abandoned after breakage at Cueva Antón, 60 km inland. Comparable early modern human-associated material from Africa and the Near East is widely accepted as evidence for body ornamentation, implying behavioral modernity. The Iberian finds show that European Neandertals were no different from coeval Africans in this regard, countering genetic/cognitive explanations for the emergence of symbolism and strengthening demographic/social ones.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcanthocardia 3aAfricans 3aPecten 3acognition 3adyes 3agoethite 3ahematite 3alepidocrocite 3apigments 3apyrite 3aAfrica 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMiddle East1 aAngelucci, Diego E.1 aBadal García, Ernestina.1 aD'Errico, Francesco.1 aDaniel, Floréal1 aDayet, Laure1 aDouka, Katerina1 aHigham, Thomas F.G.1 aMartínez Sánchez, María José.1 aMontes Bernárdez, Ricardo.1 aMurcia-Mascarós, Sonia1 aPérez-Sirvent, Carmen1 aRoldán-García, Clodoaldo1 aVanhaeren, Marian1 aVillaverde Bonilla, Valentín.1 aWood, Rachel1 aZapata, Josefina0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 19, v. 107, no. 3 p.1023-1028dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09140881073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03319naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100001700218245009000235300002000325500001500345506007600360520179300436506003702229650002502266650002602291650001702317650001402334650001202348650001202360650001202372650001202384650000802396653001702404653001302421653001002434700002502444700001702469773017602486852000902662856008302671930003302754945002502787946001302812655001202825IND4430678720221207054703.0100101e20091229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443067872DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09087181062doi7 aPMC27996932pmcid7 a200077712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNag, Anwesha10amiR319a targeting of TCP4 is critical for petal growth and development in Arabidopsis  ap. 22534-22539.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn a genetic screen in a drnl-2 background, we isolated a loss-of-function allele in miR319a (miR319a¹²⁹). Previously, miR319a has been postulated to play a role in leaf development based on the dramatic curled-leaf phenotype of plants that ectopically express miR319a (jaw-D). miR319a¹²⁹ mutants exhibit defects in petal and stamen development; petals are narrow and short, and stamens exhibit defects in anther development. The miR319a¹²⁹ loss-of-function allele contains a single-base change in the middle of the encoded miRNA, which reduces the ability of miR319a to recognize targets. Analysis of the expression patterns of the three members of the miR319 gene family (miR319a, miR319b, and miR319c) indicates that these genes have largely non-overlapping expression patterns suggesting that these genes have distinct developmental functions. miR319a functions by regulating the TCP transcription factors TCP2, TCP3, TCP4, TCP10, and TCP24; the level of RNA expression of these TCP genes is down-regulated in jaw-D and elevated in miR319a¹²⁹. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that TCP4 is a key target of miR319a. First, the tcp4soj⁶ mutant, which contains a mutation in the TCP4 miRNA-binding site complementary to the miR319a¹²⁹ mutation, suppresses the flower phenotype of miR319a¹²⁹. Second, expression of wild-type TCP4 in petals and stamens (i.e., AP3:TCP4) has no effect on flower development; by contrast, a miRNA-resistant version of TCP4, when expressed in petals and stamens (i.e., pAP3:mTCP4) causes these organs not to develop. Surprisingly, when AP3:TCP4 is present in a miR319a¹²⁹ background, petal and stamen development is severely disrupted, suggesting that proper regulation by miR319a of TCP4 is critical in these floral organs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3aplant growth 3aflowering 3aalleles 3acorolla 3amutants 3astamens 3aRNA 0apetal growth 0amicroRNA 0agenes1 aKing-Gordon, Stacey.1 aJack, Thomas0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Dec. 29, v. 106, no. 52 p.22534-22539dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09087181063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100120b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/19  aOther US 7aarticle03153naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245009100199300002000290506007600310520156600386506003701952650001501989650002002004650001702024650001902041650001802060650002302078650002302101650001302124650001502137650002202152650001102174650001602185650001602201650001402217650000902231650001402240651001302254700001802267700001802285700001802303773017602321852000902497856008302506930003302589946001302622655001202635IND4430675420221207054732.0100101e20091229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443067542DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09075291062doi7 aPMC27933142pmcid7 a200187062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, S.D.10aOverfishing reduces resilience of kelp beds to climate-driven catastrophic phase shift  ap. 22341-22345.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA key consideration in assessing impacts of climate change is the possibility of synergistic effects with other human-induced stressors. In the ocean realm, climate change and overfishing pose two of the greatest challenges to the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. In eastern Tasmania, temperate coastal waters are warming at approximately four times the global ocean warming average, representing the fastest rate of warming in the Southern Hemisphere. This has driven range extension of the ecologically important long-spined sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii), which has now commenced catastrophic overgrazing of productive Tasmanian kelp beds leading to loss of biodiversity and important rocky reef ecosystem services. Coincident with the overgrazing is heavy fishing of reef-based predators including the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii. By conducting experiments inside and outside Marine Protected Areas we show that fishing, by removing large predatory lobsters, has reduced the resilience of kelp beds against the climate-driven threat of the sea urchin and thus increased risk of catastrophic shift to widespread sea urchin barrens. This shows that interactions between multiple human-induced stressors can exacerbate nonlinear responses of ecosystems to climate change and limit the adaptive capacity of these systems. Management actions focused on reducing the risk of catastrophic phase shift in ecosystems are particularly urgent in the face of ongoing warming and unprecedented levels of predator removal from the world's oceans.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEchinoidea 3aJasus edwardsii 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3acoastal water 3aconservation areas 3aecosystem services 3alobsters 3amacroalgae 3amarine ecosystems 3aoceans 3aoverfishing 3aovergrazing 3apredators 3arisk 3asynergism 3aTasmania1 aJohnson, C.R.1 aFrusher, S.D.1 aRidgway, K.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Dec. 29, v. 106, no. 52 p.22341-22345dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09075291063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100101b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02790naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245012600204300002000330506007600350520111000426506003701536650000801573650001501581650002301596650002401619650001001643650001801653650002701671700002001698700002101718700002001739700002101759700001901780700001901799700001901818700001601837700001901853700002001872700002501892700002101917700002001938773017601958852000902134856008302143930003302226946001302259655001202272IND4430676020221207054747.0100101e20091229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443067602DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09118791062doi7 aPMC27996912pmcid7 a200187302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Maki10aAID-induced decrease in topoisomerase 1 induces DNA structural alteration and DNA cleavage for class switch recombination  ap. 22375-22380.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo initiate class switch recombination (CSR) activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) induces staggered nick cleavage in the S region, which lies 5' to each Ig constant region gene and is rich in palindromic sequences. Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) controls the supercoiling of DNA by nicking, rotating, and religating one strand of DNA. Curiously, Top1 reduction or AID overexpression causes the genomic instability. Here, we report that the inactivation of Top1 by its specific inhibitor camptothecin drastically blocked both the S region cleavage and CSR, indicating that Top1 is responsible for the S region cleavage in CSR. Surprisingly, AID expression suppressed Top1 mRNA translation and reduced its protein level. In addition, the decrease in the Top1 protein by RNA-mediated knockdown augmented the AID-dependent S region cleavage, as well as CSR. Furthermore, Top1 reduction altered DNA structure of the Sμ region. Taken together, AID-induced Top1 reduction alters S region DNA structure probably to non-B form, on which Top1 can introduce nicks but cannot religate, resulting in S region cleavage.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3acytidine deaminase 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3atranslation (genetics)1 aAida, Masatoshi1 aNagaoka, Hitoshi1 aBegum, Nasim A.1 aKitawaki, Yōko.1 aNakata, Mikiyo1 aStanlie, Andre1 aDoi, Tomomitsu1 aKato, Lucia1 aOkazaki, Il-mi1 aShinkura, Reiko1 aMuramatsu, Masamichi1 aKinoshita, Kazuo1 aHonjō, Tasuku.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Dec. 29, v. 106, no. 52 p.22375-22380dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09118791063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100101b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03184naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245012900202300002000331506007600351520142300427506003701850650002201887650001501909650001501924650001401939650001701953650002001970650003101990650001002021650002502031650001902056650001702075650002702092650000902119650001702128650003102145650001402176650001202190700001702202700001702219700001802236700001902254700002002273700002302293773017602316852000902492856008302501930003302584946001302617655001202630IND4430676520221207054711.0100101e20091229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443067652DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09123361062doi7 aPMC27921632pmcid7 a200187372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhmi, Yuhsuke10aGangliosides play pivotal roles in the regulation of complement systems and in the maintenance of integrity in nerve tissues  ap. 22405-22410.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGangliosides are considered to be essential in the maintenance and repair of nervous tissues; however, the mechanisms for neurodegeneration caused by ganglioside defects are unknown. We examined gene expression profiles in double knockout (DKO) mice of GM2/GD2 synthase and GD3 synthase genes and showed that the majority of complement genes and their receptors were up-regulated in cerebellum in DKO mice. Inflammatory reactions were demonstrated in those tissues by measuring up-regulated inflammatory cytokines, indicating the presence of complement activation and inflammation as reported in Alzheimer's disease. Immunoblotting of fractionated membrane extracts by sucrose density gradient revealed that complement-regulatory molecules such as decay-accelerating factor and CD59 were dispersed from glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts in DKO cerebellum. Immunohistostaining of these molecules showed disordered membrane localization. These results suggested that dysfunction of complement-regulatory molecules may be due to abnormal glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts that triggered complement activation, subsequent inflammation, and neurodegeneration in DKO mice. Generation of the triple KO mice lacking complement activity in addition to the two glycosyltransferases suggested that complement activation is involved in the inflammatory reactions and neurodegeneration caused by the ganglioside deficiency.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3acerebellum 3acomplement 3acytokines 3agangliosides 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglycosyltransferases 3aimmunoblotting 3ainflammation 3amaintenance and repair 3amice 3anerve tissue 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3areceptors 3asucrose1 aTajima, Orie1 aOhkawa, Yuki1 aMori, Atsushi1 aSugiura, Yasuo1 aFurukawa, Keiko1 aFurukawa, Kōichi.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Dec. 29, v. 106, no. 52 p.22405-22410dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09123361063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100101b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02963naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245006400206300002000270506007600290520148600366506003701852650001701889650001401906650001201920650002601932650001501958650001901973650001101992650002502003650001102028650001402039650001802053650002202071651001802093700002502111700002302136700002002159773017602179852000902355856008302364930003302447946001302480655001202493IND4430676920221207054659.0100101e20091229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443067692DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09082841062doi7 aPMC27969072pmcid7 a200187412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaland, Pierre E.10aEcology of the rare microbial biosphere of the Arctic Ocean  ap. 22427-22432.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding the role of microbes in the oceans has focused on taxa that occur in high abundance; yet most of the marine microbial diversity is largely determined by a long tail of low-abundance taxa. This rare biosphere may have a cosmopolitan distribution because of high dispersal and low loss rates, and possibly represents a source of phylotypes that become abundant when environmental conditions change. However, the true ecological role of rare marine microorganisms is still not known. Here, we use pyrosequencing to describe the structure and composition of the rare biosphere and to test whether it represents cosmopolitan taxa or whether, similar to abundant phylotypes, the rare community has a biogeography. Our examination of 740,353 16S rRNA gene sequences from 32 bacterial and archaeal communities from various locations of the Arctic Ocean showed that rare phylotypes did not have a cosmopolitan distribution but, rather, followed patterns similar to those of the most abundant members of the community and of the entire community. The abundance distributions of rare and abundant phylotypes were different, following a log-series and log-normal model, respectively, and the taxonomic composition of the rare biosphere was similar to the composition of the abundant phylotypes. We conclude that the rare biosphere has a biogeography and that its tremendous diversity is most likely subjected to ecological processes such as selection, speciation, and extinction.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogeography 3abiosphere 3aecology 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3aoceans 3aphylotype 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aArctic region1 aCasamayor, Emilio O.1 aKirchman, David L.1 aLovejoy, Connie0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Dec. 29, v. 106, no. 52 p.22427-22432dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09082841063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100101b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02796naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001200184245015200196300002000348506007600368520100900444506003701453650001701490650002501507650002201532650001901554650001001573650000901583650001101592650001901603650001401622650002401636650001301660700001501673700002101688700002601709700002301735700001601758700002001774700002201794700002201816700002101838700002201859700002701881700002001908773017601928852000902104856008302113930003302196946001302229655001202242IND4430676420221207054710.0100101e20091229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443067642DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09111891062doi7 aPMC27940352pmcid7 a200187792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhe10aEmbryonic stem cell tumor model reveals role of vascular endothelial receptor tyrosine phosphatase in regulating Tie2 pathway in tumor angiogenesis  ap. 22399-22404.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInhibiting angiogenesis has become an effective approach for treating cancer and other diseases. However, our understanding of signaling pathways in tumor angiogenesis has been limited by the embryonic lethality of many gene knockouts. To overcome this limitation, we used the plasticity of embryonic stem (ES) cells to develop a unique approach to study tumor angiogenesis. Murine ES cells can be readily manipulated genetically; in addition, ES cells implanted subcutaneously in mice develop into tumors that contain a variety of cell types (teratomas). We show that ES cells differentiate into bona fide endothelial cells within the teratoma, and that these ES-derived endothelial cells form part of the functional tumor vasculature. Using this powerful and flexible system, the Angiopoietin/Tie2 system is shown to have a key role in the regulation of tumor vessel size. Endothelial differentiation in the ES teratoma model allows gene-targeting methods to be used in the study of tumor angiogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3aembryonic stem cells 3aendothelial cells 3agene targeting 3agenes 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3asignal transduction 3atyrosine1 aHuang, Hui1 aBoland, Patricia1 aDominguez, Melissa G.1 aBurfeind, Patricia1 aLai, Ka-Man1 aLin, Hsin-Chieh1 aGale, Nicholas W.1 aDaly, Christopher1 aAuerbach, Wojtek1 aValenzuela, David1 aYancopoulos, George D.1 aThurston, Gavin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Dec. 29, v. 106, no. 52 p.22399-22404dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09111891063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100101b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03085naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245010800205300001600313506007600329520137500405506003701780650001801817650001801835650001901853650001801872650002401890650000901914650001401923700002001937700002301957700002101980700002402001700002002025700001602045700002102061700001602082700002302098700002502121700001802146700002802164700002902192700002602221773017002247852000902417856008302426930003302509946001302542655001202555IND4430958420221207054655.0100108e20100105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443095842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09031581072doi7 aPMC28067462pmcid7 a200186602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHumrich, Jens Y.10aHomeostatic imbalance of regulatory and effector T cells due to IL-2 deprivation amplifies murine lupus  ap. 204-209.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe origins and consequences of a regulatory T cell (Treg) disorder in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are poorly understood. In the (NZBxNZW) F₁ mouse model of lupus, we found that CD4⁺Foxp3⁺ Treg failed to maintain a competitive pool size in the peripheral lymphoid organs resulting in a progressive homeostatic imbalance of CD4⁺Foxp3⁺ Treg and CD4⁺Foxp3⁻ conventional T cells (Tcon). In addition, Treg acquired phenotypic changes that are reminiscent of IL-2 deficiency concomitantly to a progressive decline in IL-2-producing Tcon and an increase in activated, IFN-γ-producing effector Tcon. Nonetheless, Treg from lupus-prone mice were functionally intact and capable to influence the course of disease. Systemic reduction of IL-2 levels early in disease promoted Tcon hyperactivity, induced the imbalance of Treg and effector Tcon, and strongly accelerated disease progression. In contrast, administration of IL-2 partially restored the balance of Treg and effector Tcon by promoting the homeostatic proliferation of endogenous Treg and impeded the progression of established disease. Thus, an acquired and self-amplifying disruption of the Treg-IL-2 axis contributed essentially to Tcon hyperactivity and the development of murine lupus. The reversibility of this homeostatic Treg disorder provides promising approaches for the treatment of SLE.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3adisease course 3ainterleukin-2 3alupus erythematosus 3amice 3aphenotype1 aMorbach, Henner1 aUndeutsch, Reinmar1 aEnghard, Philipp1 aRosenberger, Stefan1 aWeigert, Olivia1 aKloke, Lutz1 aHeimann, Juliane1 aGaber, Timo1 aBrandenburg, Susan1 aScheffold, Alexander1 aHuehn, Jochen1 aRadbruch, A.q(Andreas)1 aBurmester, Gerd-Rüdiger1 aRiemekasten, Gabriela0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 5, v. 107, no. 1 p.204-209dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09031581073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03478naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245007100203300001600274506007600290520171800366506003702084650002002121650002502141650001402166650001302180650001602193650003102209650002402240650003502264650001902299650001702318650002302335650002402358650001002382650001602392650000902408650001102417650001202428650001702440650001402457650000902471650003602480700001902516700001502535700001802550700002402568773017002592852000902762856008302771930003302854946001302887655001202900IND4430959120221207054719.0100108e20100105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443095912DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09053101072doi7 aPMC28067772pmcid7 a200077672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrero, Laura10aInflammation and adipose tissue macrophages in lipodystrophic mice  ap. 240-245.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLipodystrophy and obesity are opposites in terms of a deficiency versus excess of adipose tissue mass, yet these conditions are accompanied by similar metabolic consequences, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and increased risk for diabetes and atherosclerosis. Hepatic and myocellular steatosis likely contribute to metabolic dysregulation in both states. Inflammation and macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue also appear to participate in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced insulin resistance, but their contributions to lipodystrophy-induced insulin resistance have not been evaluated. We used aP2-nSREBP-1c transgenic (Tg) mice, an established model of lipodystrophy, to ask this question. Circulating cytokine elevations suggested systemic inflammation but even more dramatic was the number of infiltrating macrophages in all white and brown adipose tissue depots of the Tg mice; in contrast, there was no evidence of inflammatory infiltrates or responses in any other tissue including liver. Despite there being overt evidence of adipose tissue inflammation, antiinflammatory strategies including salicylate treatment and genetic suppression of myeloid NF-κB signaling that correct insulin resistance in obesity were ineffective in the lipodystrophic mice. We further showed that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in lipodystrophy and obesity are very different in terms of activation state, gene expression patterns, and response to lipopolysaccharide. Although ATMs are even more abundant in lipodystrophy than in obesity, they have distinct phenotypes and likely roles in tissue remodeling, but do not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aatherosclerosis 3abrown adipose tissue 3acytokines 3adiabetes 3afatty liver 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic suppression 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amice 3amodels 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3arisk 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aShapiro, Hagit1 aNayer, Ali1 aLee, Jongsoon1 aShoelson, Steven E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 5, v. 107, no. 1 p.240-245dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09053101073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02366naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245007900207300001600286506007600302520097200378506003701350650001901387650001601406650001401422650001401436650002601450650002201476650002001498650001101518650001301529700002201542700001901564700002001583700002101603773017001624852000901794856008301803930003301886946001301919655001201932IND4430957020221207073739.0100108e20100105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443095702DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09089781072doi7 aPMC28067612pmcid7 a200077692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalary, Sébastien10aNetwork analyses structure genetic diversity in independent genetic worlds  ap. 127-132.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA flows between chromosomes and mobile elements, following rules that are poorly understood.

Network analyses of 119,381 homologous DNA families, sampled from 111 cellular genomes and from 165,529 phage, plasmid, and environmental virome sequences, offer challenging insights. Our results support a disconnected yet highly structured network of genetic diversity, revealing the existence of multiple "genetic worlds." These divides define multiple isolated groups of DNA vehicles drawing on distinct gene pools. Mathematical studies of the centralities of these worlds' subnetworks demonstrate that plasmids, not viruses, were key vectors of genetic exchange between bacterial chromosomes, both recently and in the past. Furthermore, network methodology introduces new ways of quantifying current sampling of genetic diversity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteriophages 3achromosomes 3aevolution 3agene pool 3agenetic recombination 3agenetic variation 3agenetic vectors 3agenome 3aplasmids1 aLeigh, Jessica W.1 aCheaib, Bachar1 aLopez, Philippe1 aBapteste, Éric.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 5, v. 107, no. 1 p.127-132dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09089781073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02796naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245013300208300001600341506007600357520125300433506003701686650003101723650001501754650002501769650001701794650002001811650001901831650001601850650000901866700001901875700002101894700002001915700002201935700002001957700002701977700002602004773017002030852000902200856008302209930003302292946001302325655001202338IND4430958320221207073743.0100108e20100105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443095832DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09106201072doi7 aPMC28067152pmcid7 a200187632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchildknecht, Anita10aFoxP3⁺ regulatory T cells essentially contribute to peripheral CD8⁺ T-cell tolerance induced by steady-state dendritic cells  ap. 199-203.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPeripheral T-cell tolerance is thought to significantly contribute to the prevention of autoimmunity, and it has been shown that antigen-presenting steady-state dendritic cells efficiently induce peripheral tolerance. We previously showed that dendritic-cell-induced tolerance is a T-cell-intrinsic process that depends on coinhibitory molecules such as programmed death-1. Here we specifically analyze the involvement of FoxP3⁺ regulatory T cells, which are known to be important for maintenance of self-tolerance. We show that antigen presentation by steady-state dendritic cells failed to induce peripheral tolerance in the absence of FoxP3⁺ regulatory T cells but induced protective CD8⁺ T-cell-mediated immunity instead. Regulatory T-cell-depleted mice had massively increased numbers of dendritic cells in lymph nodes. Dendritic cells isolated from mice without regulatory T cells had up-regulated costimulatory molecules and showed stronger T-cell stimulatory capacity ex vivo, suggesting that regulatory T cells contribute to peripheral tolerance by keeping the dendritic cells in an immature state. Using blocking antibodies, we demonstrate that CTLA-4 but not IL-10 is necessary for control of dendritic cells by regulatory T cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3aantigen presentation 3aautoimmunity 3adendritic cells 3ainterleukin-10 3alymph nodes 3amice1 aBrauer, Sabine1 aBrenner, Corinne1 aLahl, Katharina1 aSchild, Hansjörg1 aSparwasser, Tim1 aProbst, Hans Christian1 avan den Broek, Maries0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 5, v. 107, no. 1 p.199-203dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09106201073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03070naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245014300204300001600347506007600363520149800439506003701937650003101974650003102005650002702036650001902063650001802082650001302100650002502113650001802138650001402156700002302170700002202193700002502215700001802240700002502258700002102283773017002304852000902474856008302483930003302566946001302599655001202612IND4430958220221207073740.0100108e20100105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443095822DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09099451072doi7 aPMC28067512pmcid7 a199663022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObar, Joshua J.10aCD4⁺ T cell regulation of CD25 expression controls development of short-lived effector CD8⁺ T cells in primary and secondary responses  ap. 193-198.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBoth CD4⁺ T cell help and IL-2 have been postulated to "program" activated CD8⁺ T cells for memory cell development. However, the linkage between these two signals has not been well elucidated. Here we have studied effector and memory CD8⁺ T cell differentiation following infection with three pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, vesicular stomatitis virus, and vaccinia virus) in the absence of both CD4⁺ T cells and IL-2 signaling. We found that expression of CD25 on antigen-specific CD8⁺ T cells peaked 3-4 days after initial priming and was dependent on CD4⁺ T cell help, likely through a CD28:CD80/86 mediated pathway. CD4⁺ T cell or CD25-deficiency led to normal early effector CD8⁺ T cell differentiation, but a subsequent lack of accumulation of CD8⁺ T cells resulting in overall decreased memory cell generation. Interestingly, in both primary and recall responses KLRG1high CD127low short-lived effector cells were drastically diminished in the absence of IL-2 signaling, although memory precursors remained intact. In contrast to previous reports, upon secondary antigen encounter CD25-deficient CD8⁺ T cells were capable of undergoing robust expansion, but short-lived effector development was again impaired. Thus, these results demonstrated that CD4⁺ T cell help and IL-2 signaling were linked via CD25 up-regulation, which controls the expansion and differentiation of antigen-specific effector CD8⁺ T cells, rather than "programming" memory cell traits.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aVaccinia virus 3aVesiculovirus 3aantigens 3acell differentiation 3ainterleukin-2 3apathogens1 aMolloy, Michael J.1 aJellison, Evan R.1 aStoklasek, Thomas A.1 aZhang, Weijun1 aUsherwood, Edward J.1 aLefrancois, Leo.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 5, v. 107, no. 1 p.193-198dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09099451073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01589naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245007500153300001300228520053100241650002700772650000900799650002600808650001900834650002400853650001100877650004900888650001100937650002000948650003100968650001400999650003401013773010501047852000901152939003301161945000801194946001301202655001201215991596580890742620221121033443.0881031s1987    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880032222DNAL7 a36945182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuellette, M.D.10aFetal alcohol syndrome: a role for zinc?

General FAS intervention strategies also are discussed. It is noted that, while prenatal alcohol intake can result in FAS and the mechanism of teratogenesis is not yet clear, evidence exists for a significant role for Zn. Further, alcohol ingestion appears to exacerbate Zn status. 3afetal alcohol syndrome 3azinc 3anutrient deficiencies 3apregnant women 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disordersxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aPatient Education as Topic 2aPregnancy 2aZincxdeficiencyxmetabolism.0 tJournal of pediatric & perinatal nutrition.g1987 Spring/Summer, v. 1, no. 1 p.1-12x8756-62067nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01768naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245006400132300001800196500012600214520066100340650001901001650001701020650001101037650002301048650001801071650002801089650002101117650001801138650002601156653002301182700001601205773009701221852001301318930003301331945000801364946001301372852000901385655001201394991596580880742620221121033343.0860903e198505  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860110472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodges, R.E.10aDietary changes and their possible effect on blood pressure  ap. 1155-1162.  aWheat foods: Nutritional Implications in Health and Disease, Proceedings of a Symposium, May 21-22, 1984, Washington, DC.  aThe potential effects of various dietary factors (fiber, unsaturated/saturated fat, sodium, potassium, cholesterol, animal vs. vegetable protein, and carbohydrates) on blood pressure are reviewed. The evidence indicates that both hypertension and ischemic heart disease have a nutritional background. One of the strongest correlates appears to be the role played by complex carbohydrates in regulating blood lipid levels. It also appears that the use of more cereal food (bread and other baked items) in place of excessive meat and fat intakes may be protective against atherosclerosis and hypertension, but further studies are needed to quantify this.(wz) 3ablood pressure 3ahypertension 3alipids 3adisease prevention 3acarbohydrates 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3alipid metabolism 3adietary fiber 3adiet study techniques 0aliterature reviews1 aRebello, T.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1985 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.1155-1162x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01077naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245004300131300001500174520040200189650000900591650001600600650002600616650001300642650001500655773006600670852000900736939003300745945000800778946001300786655001200799991596580670742620221121033507.0881110e198705  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880033022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihalik, M.10a29 Little ways to lose a lot of weight  ap. 28- 32.  aTwenty-nine simple ideas for losing weight are suggested in this feature article.

The theory is based on an optimal signal detection, which generalizes the signal detection theory by adding the choice of effort as optimal choice for a given informational value of the signal for every effort level and a cost of effort. NTCP predicts the choice made as a stochastic choice: That is, as a probability distribution over two options in a set, the level of effort provided, the error rate, and the time to respond. The theory provides a unified account of behavioral evidence (choices made, error rate, time to respond) as well as neural evidence (represented by the effort rate measured for example by the level of brain activation). The theory also provides a unified explanation of several facts discovered and interpreted in the last decades of experimental economic analysis of choices, which we review.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3aeconomic analysis 3aprobability distribution1 aRustichini, Aldo1 aSmith, Vernon0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Dec. 29, v. 106, no. 52 p.22145-22150dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09125001063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100101b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03199naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245009400202300001800296506007600314520145700390506003701847650001701884650001401901650002001915650003101935650001001966650001301976650001201989650000902001650002002010650001602030650001802046650002002064650002902084650001402113650002902127650001902156700001602175700001902191700002402210700001802234700001702252700002102269700001402290700001902304773017202323852000902495856008302504930003302587946001302620655001202633IND4432389320221207080516.0100205e20100202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443238932DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09102671072doi7 aPMC28366232pmcid7 a200806762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Jee Young10aUBR2 mediates transcriptional silencing during spermatogenesis via histone ubiquitination  ap. 1912-1917.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUbiquitination of histones provides an important mechanism regulating chromatin remodeling and gene expression. Recent studies have revealed ubiquitin ligases involved in histone ubiquitination, yet the responsible enzymes and the function of histone ubiquitination in spermatogenesis remain unclear. We have previously shown that mice lacking the ubiquitin ligase UBR2, one of the recognition E3 components of the N-end rule proteolytic pathway, are infertile associated with meiotic arrest at prophase I. We here show that UBR2 localizes to meiotic chromatin regions, including unsynapsed axial elements linked to chromatin inactivation, and mediates transcriptional silencing via the ubiquitination of histone H2A. UBR2 interacts with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme HR6B and its substrate H2A and promotes the HR6B-H2A interaction and the HR6B-to-H2A transfer of ubiquitin. UBR2 and ubiquitinated H2A (uH2A) spatiotemporally mark meiotic chromatin regions subject to transcriptional silencing, and UBR2-deficient spermatocytes fail to induce the ubiquitination of H2A during meiosis. UBR2-deficient spermatocytes are profoundly impaired in chromosome-wide transcriptional silencing of genes linked to unsynapsed axes of the X and Y chromosomes. Our findings suggest that insufficiency in UBR2-dependent histone ubiquitination triggers a pachytene checkpoint system, providing a new insight into chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aY chromosome 3achromatin 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistones 3ameiosis 3amice 3apachytene stage 3aproteolysis 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogenesis 3atranscription (genetics) 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination1 aKim, Ŭn-a.1 aJiang, Yonghua1 aZakrzewska, Adriana1 aKim, Dong Eun1 aLee, Min Jae1 aMook-Jung, Inhee1 aZhang, Yi1 aKwon, Yong Tae0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 2, v. 107, no. 5 p.1912-1917dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09102671073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03282naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245012900198300001800327506007600345520179100421506003702212650000802249650001602257650002102273650001102294650001502305650001302320650003502333700002102368700002002389700002102409700002702430700002602457700002102483700002202504773017202526852000902698856008302707930003302790946001302823655001202836IND4432389920221207080529.0100205e20100202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443238992DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09084631072doi7 aPMC28047412pmcid7 a200806752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Fei10aReconstructed evolutionary adaptive paths give polymerases accepting reversible terminators for sequencing and SNP detection  ap. 1948-1953.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAny system, natural or human-made, is better understood if we analyze both its history and its structure. Here we combine structural analyses with a "Reconstructed Evolutionary Adaptive Path" (REAP) analysis that used the evolutionary and functional history of DNA polymerases to replace amino acids to enable polymerases to accept a new class of triphosphate substrates, those having their 3'-OH ends blocked as a 3'-ONH₂ group (dNTP-ONH₂). Analogous to widely used 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs), dNTP-ONH₂s terminate primer extension. Unlike ddNTPs, however, primer extension can be resumed by cleaving an O-N bond to restore an -OH group to the 3'-end of the primer. REAP combined with crystallographic analyses identified 35 sites where replacements might improve the ability of Taq to accept dNTP-ONH₂s. A library of 93 Taq variants, each having replacements at three or four of these sites, held eight variants having improved ability to accept dNTP-ONH₂ substrates. Two of these (A597T, L616A, F667Y, E745H, and E520G, K540I, L616A) performed notably well. The second variant incorporated both dNTP-ONH₂sand ddNTPs faithfully and efficiently, supporting extension-cleavage-extension cycles applicable in parallel sequencing and in SNP detection through competition between reversible and irreversible terminators. Dissecting these results showed that one replacement (L616A), not previously identified, allows Taq to incorporate both reversible and irreversible terminators. Modeling showed how L616A might open space behind Phe-667, allowing it to move to accommodate the larger 3'-substituent. This work provides polymerases for DNA analyses and shows how evolutionary analyses help explore relationships between structure and function in proteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aamino acids 3achemical bonding 3amodels 3aopen space 3aproteins 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aGaucher, Eric A.1 aLeal, Nicole A.1 aHütter, Daniel.1 aHavemann, Stephanie A.1 aGovindarajan, Sridhar1 aOrtlund, Eric A.1 aBenner, Steven A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 2, v. 107, no. 5 p.1948-1953dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09084631073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02061naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003100184245006100215300001800276506007600294520095000370506003701320650002101357650001201378650001101390700002401401773017201425852000901597856008301606930003301689946001301722655001201735IND4432388320221207080511.0100205e20100202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443238832DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09147281072doi7 aPMC28366362pmcid7 a201338332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapadimitriou, Christos H.13aAn impossibility theorem for price-adjustment mechanisms  ap. 1854-1859.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe show that there is no discrete-time price-adjustment mechanism (any process that at each period looks at the history of prices and excess demands and updates the prices) such that for any market (a set of goods and consumers with endowments and strictly concave utilities) the price-adjustment mechanism will achieve excess demands that are at most an ε fraction of the total supply within a number of periods that is polynomial in the number of goods and Formula . This holds even if one restricts markets so that excess demand functions are differentiable with derivatives bounded by a small constant. For the convergence time to the actual price equilibrium, we show by a different method a stronger result: Even in the case of three goods with a unique price equilibrium, there is no function of ε that bounds the number of periods needed by a price-adjustment mechanism to arrive at a set of prices that is ε-close to the equilibrium.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ademand functions 3amarkets 3aprices1 aYannakakis, Mihalis0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 2, v. 107, no. 5 p.1854-1859dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09147281073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02409naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245004900205300001800254506007600272520117000348506003701518650001401555650001301569650001301582650000901595700002501604700002301629700002201652700001901674700002001693773017201713852000901885856008301894930003301977946001302010655001202023IND4432387720221207080514.0100205e20100202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443238772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09068521072doi7 aPMC28366102pmcid7 a200805612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalgado, Eric N.10aMetal templated design of protein interfaces  ap. 1827-1832.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMetal coordination is a key structural and functional component of a large fraction of proteins. Given this dual role we considered the possibility that metal coordination may have played a templating role in the early evolution of protein folds and complexes. We describe here a rational design approach, Metal Templated Interface Redesign (MeTIR), that mimics the time course of a hypothetical evolutionary pathway for the formation of stable protein assemblies through an initial metal coordination event. Using a folded monomeric protein, cytochrome cb₅₆₂, as a building block we show that its non-self-associating surface can be made self-associating through a minimal number of mutations that enable Zn coordination. The protein interfaces in the resulting Zn-directed, D₂-symmetrical tetramer are subsequently redesigned, yielding unique protein architectures that self-assemble in the presence or absence of metals. Aside from its evolutionary implications, MeTIR provides a route to engineer de novo protein interfaces and metal coordination environments that can be tuned through the extensive noncovalent bonding interactions in these interfaces.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aevolution 3amutation 3aproteins 3azinc1 aAmbroggio, Xavier I.1 aBrodin, Jeffrey D.1 aLewis, Richard A.1 aKuhlman, Brian1 aTezcan, F.

Recent empirically based models using individual species' traits suggest that higher species richness is required to provide multiple ecosystem functions. However, no study to date has analyzed the observed functionality of communities of interacting species over multiple temporal scales to assess the relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality. We use data from the longest-running biodiversity-functioning field experiment to date to test how species diversity affects the ability of grassland ecosystems to provide threshold levels of up to eight ecosystem functions simultaneously. Across years and every combination of ecosystem functions, minimum-required species richness consistently increases with the number of functions considered. Moreover, tradeoffs between functions and variability among years prevent any one community type from providing high levels of multiple functions, regardless of its diversity. Sustained multifunctionality, therefore, likely requires both higher species richness than single ecosystem functionality and a diversity of species assemblages across the landscape.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3along term experiments 3aspecies diversity 3aecosystems 3aplant ecology 3agrasslands 3aMinnesota 0agrassland ecosystems 0acommunity ecology 0abiodiversity1 aPasari, Jae R.1 aHulvey, Kristin B.1 aTilman, G.

However, because regeneration research has focused almost exclusively on highly regenerative taxa or on comparisons between regenerating and nonregenerating taxa that are deeply diverged, virtually nothing is known about how regeneration loss occurs. Here, we show that, following a recent evolutionary loss of regeneration, regenerative abilities can remain latent and still be elicited. Using comparative regeneration experiments and a molecular phylogeny, we show that ancestral head regeneration abilities have been lost three times among naidine annelids, a group of small aquatic worms that typically reproduce asexually by fission. In all three lineages incapable of head regeneration, worms consistently seal the wound but fail to progress to the first stage of tissue replacement. However, despite this coarse-level convergence in regeneration loss, further investigation of two of these lineages reveals marked differences in how much of the regeneration machinery has been abolished. Most notably, in a species representing one of these two lineages, but not in a representative of the other, amputation within a narrow proliferative region that forms during fission can still elicit regeneration of an essentially normal head. Thus, the presence at the wound site of elements characteristic of actively growing tissues, such as activated stem cells or growth factors, may permit blocks to regeneration to be circumvented, allowing latent regeneration abilities to be manifested.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnnelida 3aamputation 3aanimals 3aasexual reproduction 3agrowth factors 3ahead 3aphylogeny 3astem cells 3atissues1 aSikes, James M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. 4 p.1464-1469dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09079311073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03089naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245012900200300001800329506007600347520176200423506003702185650000802222650001302230650001602243650001402259650001002273650001302283650002202296650002102318700002302339700001802362773017302380852000902553856008302562930003302645946001302678655001202691IND4432037520221207061502.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443203752DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09126281072doi7 aPMC28244062pmcid7 a200806932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasas, Vera10aLack of evolvability in self-sustaining autocatalytic networks constraints metabolism-first scenarios for the origin of life  ap. 1470-1475.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA basic property of life is its capacity to experience Darwinian evolution. The replicator concept is at the core of genetics-first theories of the origin of life, which suggest that self-replicating oligonucleotides or their similar ancestors may have been the first "living" systems and may have led to the evolution of an RNA world. But problems with the nonenzymatic synthesis of biopolymers and the origin of template replication have spurred the alternative metabolism-first scenario, where self-reproducing and evolving proto-metabolic networks are assumed to have predated self-replicating genes. Recent theoretical work shows that "compositional genomes" (i.e., the counts of different molecular species in an assembly) are able to propagate compositional information and can provide a setup on which natural selection acts. Accordingly, if we stick to the notion of replicator as an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in successive replications, those macromolecular aggregates could be dubbed "ensemble replicators" (composomes) and quite different from the more familiar genes and memes. In sharp contrast with template-dependent replication dynamics, we demonstrate here that replication of compositional information is so inaccurate that fitter compositional genomes cannot be maintained by selection and, therefore, the system lacks evolvability (i.e., it cannot substantially depart from the asymptotic steady-state solution already built-in in the dynamical equations). We conclude that this fundamental limitation of ensemble replicators cautions against metabolism-first theories of the origin of life, although ancient metabolic systems could have provided a stable habitat within which polymer replicators later evolved.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aancestry 3abiopolymers 3aequations 3agenes 3ahabitats 3anatural selection 3aoligonucleotides1 aSzathmáry, Eörs.1 aSantos, Mauro0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. 4 p.1470-1475dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09126281073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03662naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201072001700218100001800235245008100253300001800334500001500352506007600367520136900443506003701812650002401849650001301873650001401886650001401900650002101914653003101935653001601966653001001982653002701992653001102019653002202030653002402052700001802076700002002094700002902114700002402143700001902167700002602186700001702212700001702229700002402246700002102270700002002291700002102311700002102332700002102353700002102374700001802395700002302413700002402436700002402460700002302484700002202507700002002529700001902549773017302568852000902741856008302750930003302833945002502866946001302891655001202904IND4432037120221207061430.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443203712DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09025541072doi7 aPMC28243652pmcid7 a200806002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using a single allometric equation to characterize empirical scaling relationships and to evaluate alternative hypotheses about mechanisms has been controversial. We developed a method to directly measure respiration of 271 whole plants, spanning nine orders of magnitude in body mass, from small seedlings to large trees, and from tropical to boreal ecosystems. Our measurements include the roots, which have often been ignored. Rather than a single power-law relationship, our data are fit by a biphasic, mixed-power function. The allometric exponent varies continuously from 1 in the smallest plants to 3/4 in larger saplings and trees. Therefore, our findings support the recent findings of Reich et al. [Reich PB, Tjoelker MG, Machado JL, Oleksyn J (2006) Universal scaling of respiratory metabolism, size, and nitrogen in plants. Nature 439:457-461] and West, Brown, and Enquist [West GB, Brown JH, Enquist BJ (1997) A general model for the origin of allometric scaling laws in biology. Science 276:122 -126.]. The transition from linear to 3/4-power scaling may indicate fundamental physical and physiological constraints on the allocation of plant biomass between photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic organs over the course of ontogenetic plant growth.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amathematical models 3asaplings 3aseedlings 3aallometry 3acell respiration 0amathematics and statistics 0agiant trees 0atrees 0arespiratory metabolism 0aplants 0ametabolic scaling 0amixed power scaling1 aYamaji, Keiko1 aIshida, Atsushi1 aProkushkin, Stanislav G.1 aMasyagina, Oxana V.1 aHagihara, Akio1 aHoque, A.T.M.

Mice lacking CTLA-4 develop an early onset, fatal breakdown in T cell tolerance. Whether this autoimmune disease occurs because of the loss of CTLA-4 function in regulatory T cells, conventional T cells, or both is unclear. We show here that lack of CTLA-4 in regulatory T cells leads to aberrant activation and expansion of conventional T cells. However, CTLA-4 expression in conventional T cells prevents aberrantly activated T cells from infiltrating and fatally damaging nonlymphoid tissues. These results demonstrate that CTLA-4 has a dual function in maintaining T cell tolerance: CTLA-4 in regulatory T cells inhibits inappropriate naïve T cell activation and CTLA-4 in conventional T cells prevents the harmful accumulation of self-reactive pathogenic T cells in vital organs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aautoimmune diseases 3aautoimmunity 3acytotoxicity 3ahomeostasis 3amice 3atissues1 aNguyễn, Hải.1 aChambers, Cynthia1 aKang, Joonsoo0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. 4 p.1524-1528dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09103411073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02659naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245004900204300001800253506007600271520147400347506003701821650001301858650002101871650001501892650002601907650001401933650001501947700002401962773017301986852000902159856008302168930003302251946001302284655001202297IND4432036020221207061446.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443203602DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09096731072doi7 aPMC28243492pmcid7 a200807042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCelani, Antonio10aBacterial strategies for chemotaxis response  ap. 1391-1396.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRegular environmental conditions allow for the evolution of specifically adapted responses, whereas complex environments usually lead to conflicting requirements upon the organism's response. A relevant instance of these issues is bacterial chemotaxis, where the evolutionary and functional reasons for the experimentally observed response to chemoattractants remain a riddle. Sensing and motility requirements are in fact optimized by different responses, which strongly depend on the chemoattractant environmental profiles. It is not clear then how those conflicting requirements quantitatively combine and compromise in shaping the chemotaxis response. Here we show that the experimental bacterial response corresponds to the maximin strategy that ensures the highest minimum uptake of chemoattractants for any profile of concentration. We show that the maximin response is the unique one that always outcompetes motile but nonchemotactic bacteria. The maximin strategy is adapted to the variable environments experienced by bacteria, and we explicitly show its emergence in simulations of bacterial populations in a chemostat. Finally, we recast the contrast of evolution in regular vs. complex environments in terms of minimax vs. maximin game-theoretical strategies. Our results are generally relevant to biological optimization principles and provide a systematic possibility to get around the need to know precisely the statistics of environmental fluctuations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3achemoattractants 3achemotaxis 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3astatistics1 aVergassola, Massimo0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. 4 p.1391-1396dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09096731073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02418naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245010700204300001800311506007600329520088600405506003701291650002201328650002001350650001201370650002101382650001001403650002001413650001401433650001101447650002001458650001701478650001401495650001301509650001401522650002401536650001401560650003101574650001401605773017901619852000901798856008301807930003301890946001301923655001201936IND4432041720221207061532.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443204172DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09096061062doi7 aPMC28682862pmcid7 a199663012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinch, Caleb E.10aEvolution of the human lifespan and diseases of aging: Roles of infection, inflammation, and nutrition  ap. 1718-1724.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHumans have evolved much longer lifespans than the great apes, which rarely exceed 50 years. Since 1800, lifespans have doubled again, largely due to improvements in environment, food, and medicine that minimized mortality at earlier ages. Infections cause most mortality in wild chimpanzees and in traditional forager-farmers with limited access to modern medicine. Although we know little of the diseases of aging under premodern conditions, in captivity, chimpanzees present a lower incidence of cancer, ischemic heart disease, and neurodegeneration than current human populations. These major differences in pathology of aging are discussed in terms of genes that mediate infection, inflammation, and nutrition. Apolipoprotein E alleles are proposed as a prototype of pleiotropic genes, which influence immune responses, arterial and Alzheimer's disease, and brain development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aPan troglodytes 3aalleles 3aapolipoprotein E 3abrain 3acaptive animals 3aevolution 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3alongevity 3amedicine 3amortality 3amyocardial ischemia 3aneoplasms 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3anutrition0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. suppl_1 p.1718-1724dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09096061063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02068naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245011800200300001800318506007600336520067900412506003701091650001301128650001401141650001801155650001401173650001001187650002301197650001101220650001201231650001701243650001201260650001201272650002001284650001301304773017901317852000901496856008301505930003301588946001301621655001201634IND4432041920221207061345.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443204192DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09041111062doi7 aPMC28682972pmcid7 a196665292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaig, David10aTransfers and transitions: Parent-offspring conflict, genomic imprinting, and the evolution of human life history  ap. 1731-1735.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman offspring are weaned earlier than the offspring of other great apes but take longer to reach nutritional independence. An analysis of human disorders of imprinted genes suggests genes of paternal origin, expressed in infants, have been selected to favor more intense suckling than genes of maternal origin. The same analysis suggests that genes of maternal origin may favor slower childhood growth but earlier sexual maturation. These observations are consistent with a hypothesis in which slow maturation was an adaptation of offspring that reduced maternal fitness, whereas early weaning was an adaptation of mothers that reduced the fitness of individual offspring.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPongidae 3achildhood 3aearly weaning 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomic imprinting 3ahumans 3ainfants 3alife history 3amothers 3aprogeny 3asexual maturity 3asuckling0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. suppl_1 p.1731-1735dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09041111063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02762naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245010800201300001800309506007600327520106700403506003701470650001801507650001601525650000901541650002001550650001301570650000901583650001701592650001201609700001701621700002001638700001601658700002601674700002601700700001901726700002201745700001701767700001801784700001901802700001901821700002201840700002601862700002101888773017301909852000902082856008302091930003302174946001302207655001202220IND4432039320221207084759.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443203932DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09123441072doi7 aPMC28244022pmcid7 a200807102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlain, Tommy10aVesicular stomatitis virus oncolysis is potentiated by impairing mTORC1-dependent type I IFN production  ap. 1576-1581.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOncolytic viruses constitute a promising therapy against malignant gliomas (MGs). However, virus-induced type I IFN greatly limits its clinical application. The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) stimulates type I IFN production via phosphorylation of its effector proteins, 4E-BPs and S6Ks. Here we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mice lacking S6K1 and S6K2 are more susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection than their WT counterparts as a result of an impaired type I IFN response. We used this knowledge to employ a pharmacoviral approach to treat MGs. The highly specific inhibitor of mTOR rapamycin, in combination with an IFN-sensitive VSV-mutant strain (VSVΔM⁵¹), dramatically increased the survival of immunocompetent rats bearing MGs. More importantly, VSVΔM⁵¹ selectively killed tumor, but not normal cells, in MG-bearing rats treated with rapamycin. These results demonstrate that reducing type I IFNs through inhibition of mTORC1 is an effective strategy to augment the therapeutic activity of VSVΔM⁵¹.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVesiculovirus 3afibroblasts 3amice 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3arats 3atherapeutics 3aviruses1 aLun, XueQing1 aMartineau, Yvan1 aSean, Polen1 aPulendran, B.q(Bali)1 aPetroulakis, Emmanuel1 aZemp, Franz J.1 aLemay, Chantal G.1 aRoy, Dominic1 aBell, John C.1 aThomas, George1 aKozma, Sara C.1 aForsyth, Peter A.1 aCosta-Mattioli, Mauro1 aSonenberg, Nahum0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. 4 p.1576-1581dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09123441073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03487naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002700184245008100211300001800292506007600310520181000386506003702196650001102233650002102244650001502265650002002280650002702300650001402327650002202341650001602363650001602379650001302395650001402408650000902422650001202431700002002443700002302463700001702486700001702503700002702520700002202547700002102569700001902590700002502609773017302634852000902807856008302816930003302899946001302932655001202945IND4432040120221207084749.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443204012DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09142071072doi7 aPMC28244212pmcid7 a200805892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodruff-Pak, Diana S.10aDifferential effects and rates of normal aging in cerebellum and hippocampus  ap. 1624-1629.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCognitive functions show many alternative outcomes and great individual variation during normal aging. We examined learning over the adult life span in CBA mice, along with morphological and electrophysiological substrates. Our aim was to compare cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink classical conditioning and hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning in the same animals using the same conditioned and unconditioned stimuli for eyeblink and fear conditioning. In a subset of the behaviorally tested mice, we used unbiased stereology to estimate the total number of Purkinje neurons in cerebellar cortex and pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Several forms of synaptic plasticity were assessed at different ages in CBA mice: long-term depression (LTD) in both cerebellum and hippocampus and NMDA-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP) and voltage-dependent calcium channel LTP in hippocampus. Forty-four CBA mice tested at one of five ages (4, 8, 12, 18, or 24 months) demonstrated statistically significant age differences in cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning, with 24-month mice showing impairment in comparison with younger mice. These same CBA mice showed no significant differences in contextual or cued fear conditioning. Stereology indicated significant loss of Purkinje neurons in the 18- and 24-month groups, whereas pyramidal neuron numbers were stable across age. Slice electrophysiology recorded from an additional 48 CBA mice indicated significant deficits in LTD appearing in cerebellum between 4 and 8 months, whereas 4- to 12-month mice demonstrated similar hippocampal LTD and LTP values. Our results demonstrate that processes of aging impact brain structures and associated behaviors differentially, with cerebellum showing earlier senescence than hippocampus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3acalcium channels 3acerebellum 3acerebral cortex 3aclassical conditioning 3acognition 3aelectrophysiology 3afearfulness 3ahippocampus 3alearning 3alongevity 3amice 3aneurons1 aFoy, Michael R.1 aAkopian, Garnik G.1 aLee, Ka Hung1 aZach, Jordan1 aNguyen, Kim Phuong Thi1 aComalli, David M.1 aKennard, John A.1 aAgelan, Alexis1 aThompson, Richard F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. 4 p.1624-1629dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09142071073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03530naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245014300204300001800347506007600365520188100441506003702322650001202359650002102371650001302392650001902405650001302424650002002437650003602457650001902493650001902512650001202531650002702543700001802570700002702588700001802615700002602633700002202659700002002681700002402701773017302725852000902898856008302907930003302990946001303023655001203036IND4432040620221207084749.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443204062DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09087351072doi7 aPMC28243802pmcid7 a200806922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, Anthony14aThe α₂δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels form GPI-anchored proteins, a posttranslational modification essential for function  ap. 1654-1659.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVoltage-gated calcium channels are thought to exist in the plasma membrane as heteromeric proteins, in which the α1 subunit is associated with two auxiliary subunits, the intracellular β subunit and the α₂δ subunit; both of these subunits influence the trafficking and properties of CaV1 and CaV2 channels. The α₂δ subunits have been described as type I transmembrane proteins, because they have an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal hydrophobic and potentially transmembrane region. However, because they have very short C-terminal cytoplasmic domains, we hypothesized that the α₂δ proteins might be associated with the plasma membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attached to δ rather than a transmembrane domain. Here, we provide biochemical, immunocytochemical, and mutational evidence to show that all of the α₂δ subunits studied, α₂δ-1, α₂δ-2, and α₂δ-3, show all of the properties expected of GPI-anchored proteins, both when heterologously expressed and in native tissues. They are substrates for prokaryotic phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and trypanosomal GPI-PLC, which release the α₂δ proteins from membranes and intact cells and expose a cross-reacting determinant epitope. PI-PLC does not affect control transmembrane or membrane-associated proteins. Furthermore, mutation of the predicted GPI-anchor sites markedly reduced plasma membrane and detergent-resistant membrane localization of α₂δ subunits. We also show that GPI anchoring of α₂δ subunits is necessary for their function to enhance calcium currents, and PI-PLC treatment only reduces calcium current density when α₂δ subunits are coexpressed. In conclusion, this study redefines our understanding of α₂δ subunits, both in terms of their role in calcium-channel function and other roles in synaptogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3aepitopes 3ahydrophobicity 3amutation 3aplasma membrane 3apost-translational modification 3asignal peptide 3asynaptogenesis 3atissues 3atransmembrane proteins1 aKadurin, Ivan1 aAlvarez-Laviada, Anita1 aDouglas, Leon1 aNieto-Rostro, Manuela1 aBauer, Claudia S.1 aPratt, Wendy S.1 aDolphin, Annette C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. 4 p.1654-1659dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09087351073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02085naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245004600204300001600250506007600266520084100342506003701183650002201220650001201242650001301254650002301267650001101290650001901301700002201320700002701342700002101369773017101390852000901561856008301570930003301653946001301686655001201699IND4431689120221207054727.0100122e20100119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443168912DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09130151072doi7 aPMC28243082pmcid7 a200805602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSokolov, Andrey10aSwimming bacteria power microscopic gears  ap. 969-974.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhereas the laws of thermodynamics prohibit extraction of useful work from the Brownian motion of particles in equilibrium, these motions can be "rectified" under nonequilibrium conditions, for example, in the presence of asymmetric geometrical obstacles. Here, we describe a class of systems in which aerobic bacteria Bacillus subtilis moving randomly in a fluid film power submillimeter gears and primitive systems of gears decorated with asymmetric teeth. The directional rotation is observed only in the regime of collective bacterial swimming and the gears' angular velocities depend on and can be controlled by the amount of oxygen available to the bacteria. The ability to harness and control the power of collective motions appears an important requirement for further development of mechanical systems driven by microorganisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aaerobes 3abacteria 3abacterial motility 3aoxygen 3athermodynamics1 aApodaca, Mario M.1 aGrzybowski, Bartosz A.1 aAranson, Igor S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 19, v. 107, no. 3 p.969-974dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09130151073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02970naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201072001700218100002200235245009300257300001800350500001500368506007600383520114300459506003701602650002201639650002001661650002601681650001101707650002201718650001801740650001001758650001901768650000801787650001201795650002501807651001801832653002001850653001901870653002101889653001801910653001501928653001201943700001801955700001801973700002101991700002002012773017302032852000902205856008302214930003302297945002502330946001302355655001202368IND4432034220221207054702.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443203422DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09138461072doi7 aPMC28031412pmcid7 a200806282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A largely deciduous ecosystem has been suggested as a possible landscape for future Arctic vegetation and is seen in paleo-records of warm times in the past. Here we use a global climate model with an interactive terrestrial biosphere to investigate the effects of adding deciduous trees on bare ground at high northern latitudes. We find that the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance from enhanced transpiration (associated with the expanded forest cover) is up to 1.5 times larger than the forcing due to albedo change from the forest. Furthermore, the greenhouse warming by additional water vapor melts sea-ice and triggers a positive feedback through changes in ocean albedo and evaporation. Land surface albedo change is considered to be the dominant mechanism by which trees directly modify climate at high-latitudes, but our findings suggest an additional mechanism through transpiration of water vapor and feedbacks from the ocean and sea-ice.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adeciduous forests 3asolar radiation 3abotanical composition 3aoceans 3agreenhouse effect 3atranspiration 3atrees 3aglobal warming 3aice 3amelting 3aalbedo (reflectance) 3aArctic region 0asea ice melting 0aclimate change 0aclimate feedback 0aplant ecology 0avegetation 0aforests1 aFung, Inez Y.1 aLevis, Samuel1 aBonan, Gordon B.1 aDoney, Scott C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. 4 p.1295-1300dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09138461073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100310b20100403c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle02360naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245006200203300001800265506007600283520093700359506003701296650002701333650001901360650001701379650001101396650001901407650001801426650001301444700002301457700001901480700001601499700002201515700002101537700002401558700002101582773017301603852000901776856008301785930003301868946001301901655001201914IND4432034120221207054747.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443203412DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09107851072doi7 aPMC28025902pmcid7 a200805832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, YongKeun10aMetabolic remodeling of the human red blood cell membrane  ap. 1289-1294.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe remarkable deformability of the human red blood cell (RBC) results from the coupled dynamic response of the phospholipid bilayer and the spectrin molecular network. Here we present quantitative connections between spectrin morphology and membrane fluctuations of human RBCs by using dynamic full-field laser interferometry techniques. We present conclusive evidence that the presence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) facilitates non-equilibrium dynamic fluctuations in the RBC membrane that are highly correlated with the biconcave shape of RBCs. Spatial analysis of the fluctuations reveals that these non-equilibrium membrane vibrations are enhanced at the scale of spectrin mesh size. Our results indicate that the dynamic remodeling of the coupled membranes powered by ATP results in non-equilibrium membrane fluctuations manifesting from both metabolic and thermal energies and also maintains the biconcave shape of RBCs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acell membranes 3aerythrocytes 3ahumans 3ainterferometry 3aphospholipids 3aspectrin1 aBest, Catherine A.1 aAuth, Thorsten1 aGov, Nir S.1 aSafran, Samuel A.1 aPopescu, Gabriel1 aSuresh, S.q(Subra)1 aFeld, Michael S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 26, v. 107, no. 4 p.1289-1294dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09107851073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02639naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245013300207300001600340506007600356520130300432506003701735650001601772650001101788650001201799650002401811650000901835650002301844650001901867650001201886650001301898700002101911773017101932852000902103856008302112930003302195946001302228655001202241IND4431689520221207054746.0100122e20100119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443168952DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09094821072doi7 aPMC28242882pmcid7 a200806822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnuesel, Robert J.10aSelf-assembly of microscopic chiplets at a liquid-liquid-solid interface forming a flexible segmented monocrystalline solar cell  ap. 993-998.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper introduces a method for self-assembling and electrically connecting small (20-60 micrometer) semiconductor chiplets at predetermined locations on flexible substrates with high speed (62500 chips/45 s), accuracy (0.9 micrometer, 0.14°), and yield (> 98%). The process takes place at the triple interface between silicone oil, water, and a penetrating solder-patterned substrate. The assembly is driven by a stepwise reduction of interfacial free energy where chips are first collected and preoriented at an oil-water interface before they assemble on a solder-patterned substrate that is pulled through the interface. Patterned transfer occurs in a progressing linear front as the liquid layers recede. The process eliminates the dependency on gravity and sedimentation of prior methods, thereby extending the minimal chip size to the sub-100 micrometer scale. It provides a new route for the field of printable electronics to enable the integration of microscopic high performance inorganic semiconductors on foreign substrates with the freedom to choose target location, pitch, and integration density. As an example we demonstrate a fault-tolerant segmented flexible monocrystalline silicon solar cell, reducing the amount of Si that is used when compared to conventional rigid cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3agravity 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asemiconductors 3asilicon 3asilicone1 aJacobs, Heiko O.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 19, v. 107, no. 3 p.993-998dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09094821073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02874naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245014200207300001800349506007600367520145200443506003701895650002701932650002801959650001801987650003402005650001402039650002002053650001502073650001202088650001302100700001902113700002102132773017302153852000902326856008302335930003302418946001302451655001202464IND4431688320221207054704.0100122e20100119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443168832DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09110611072doi7 aPMC28242832pmcid7 a199663052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCsanády, László10aStrict coupling between CFTR's catalytic cycle and gating of its Cl⁻ ion pore revealed by distributions of open channel burst durations  ap. 1241-1246.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCFTR, the ABC protein defective in cystic fibrosis, functions as an anion channel. Once phosphorylated by protein kinase A, a CFTR channel is opened and closed by events at its two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Formation of a head-to-tail NBD1/NBD2 heterodimer, by ATP binding in two interfacial composite sites between conserved Walker A and B motifs of one NBD and the ABC-specific signature sequence of the other, has been proposed to trigger channel opening. ATP hydrolysis at the only catalytically competent interfacial site is suggested to then destabilize the NBD dimer and prompt channel closure. But this gating mechanism, and how tightly CFTR channel opening and closing are coupled to its catalytic cycle, remains controversial. Here we determine the distributions of open burst durations of individual CFTR channels, and use maximum likelihood to evaluate fits to equilibrium and nonequilibrium mechanisms and estimate the rate constants that govern channel closure. We examine partially and fully phosphorylated wild-type CFTR channels, and two mutant CFTR channels, each bearing a deleterious mutation in one or other composite ATP binding site. We show that the wild-type CFTR channel gating cycle is essentially irreversible and tightly coupled to the ATPase cycle, and that this coupling is completely destroyed by the NBD2 Walker B mutation D1370N but only partially disrupted by the NBD1 Walker A mutation K464A.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abinding sites 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3achlorides 3acystic fibrosis 3ahydrolysis 3amutants 3amutation1 aVergani, Paola1 aGadsby, David C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 19, v. 107, no. 3 p.1241-1246dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09110611073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03436naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245007200210300001800282506007600300520178400376506003702160650000802197650001202205650002402217650001802241650001102259650001002270650002202280650001602302650001902318650001902337650001102356650002702367650001102394650002002405650001702425650001502442650001602457700002002473700001702493700002402510700002602534700002302560773017302583852000902756856008302765930003302848946001302881655001202894IND4432035220221207085534.0100129e20100126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443203522DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09103831072doi7 aPMC28243512pmcid7 a200805812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahlig, Kristopher M.10aMultiplexed transposon-mediated stable gene transfer in human cells  ap. 1343-1348.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGeneration of cultured human cells stably expressing one or more recombinant gene sequences is a widely used approach in biomedical research, biotechnology, and drug development. Conventional methods are not efficient and have severe limitations especially when engineering cells to coexpress multiple transgenes or multiprotein complexes. In this report, we harnessed the highly efficient, nonviral, and plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system to enable concurrent genomic integration of multiple independent transposons harboring distinct protein-coding DNA sequences. Flow cytometry of cell clones derived from a single multiplexed transfection demonstrated approximately 60% (three transposons) or approximately 30% (four transposons) stable coexpression of all delivered transgenes with selection for a single marker transposon. We validated multiplexed piggyBac transposon delivery by coexpressing large transgenes encoding a multisubunit neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel (SCN1A) containing a pore-forming subunit and two accessory subunits while using two additional genes for selection. Previously unobtainable robust sodium current was demonstrated through 38 passages, suitable for use on an automated high-throughput electrophysiology platform. Cotransfection of three large (up to 10.8 kb) piggyBac transposons generated a heterozygous SCN1A stable cell line expressing two separate alleles of the pore-forming subunit and two accessory subunits (total of four sodium channel subunits) with robust functional expression. We conclude that the piggyBac transposon system can be used to perform multiplexed stable gene transfer in cultured human cells, and this technology may be valuable for applications requiring concurrent expression of multiprotein complexes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aalleles 3abiomedical research 3abiotechnology 3aclones 3adrugs 3aelectrophysiology 3aengineering 3aflow cytometry 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3amultiprotein complexes 3asodium 3asodium channels 3atransfection 3atransgenes 3atransposons1 aSaridey, Sai K.1 aKaja, Aparna1 aDaniels, Melissa A.1 aGeorge, Alfred L.

Here, we report the structures of LDL and its complex with the LDL receptor extracellular domain (LDL·LDLr) at extracellular pH determined by cryoEM. Difference imaging between LDL·LDLr and LDL localizes the site of LDLr bound to its ligand. The structural features revealed from the cryoEM map lead to a juxtaposed stacking model of cholesteryl esters (CEs). High density in the outer shell identifies protein-rich regions that can be accounted for by a single apolipoprotein (apo B-100, 500 kDa) leading to a model for the distribution of its α-helix and β-sheet rich domains across the surface. The structural relationship between the apo B-100 and CEs appears to dictate the structural stability and function of normal LDL.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholesterol 3acholesteryl esters 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3alow density lipoprotein 3amodels 3apH 3arisk factors1 aRudenko, Gabby1 aLudtke, Steven J.1 aDeisenhofer, Johann1 aChiu, Wah1 aPownall, Henry J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 19, v. 107, no. 3 p.1059-1064dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09080041073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03024naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245010600204300001800310506007600328520170800404506003702112650001602149650002302165650001702188650002502205650001402230700002002244700001702264700002002281700002602301773017302327852000902500856008302509930003302592946001302625655001202638IND4431686620221207074303.0100122e20100119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443168662DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09102051072doi7 aPMC28242712pmcid7 a200805542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Won Suk.10aSuppression of Alk8-mediated Bmp signaling cell-autonomously induces pancreatic β-cells in zebrafish  ap. 1142-1147.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBmp signaling has been shown to regulate early aspects of pancreas development, but its role in endocrine, and especially β-cell, differentiation remains unclear. Taking advantage of the ability in zebrafish embryos to cell-autonomously modulate Bmp signaling in single cells, we examined how Bmp signaling regulates the ability of individual endodermal cells to differentiate into β-cells. We find that specific temporal windows of Bmp signaling prevent β-cell differentiation. Thus, future dorsal bud-derived β-cells are sensitive to Bmp signaling specifically during gastrulation and early somitogenesis stages. In contrast, ventral pancreatic cells, which require an early Bmp signal to form, do not produce β-cells when exposed to Bmp signaling at 50 hpf, a stage when the ventral bud-derived extrapancreatic duct is the main source of new endocrine cells. Importantly, inhibiting Bmp signaling within endodermal cells via genetic means increased the number of β-cells, at early and late stages. Moreover, inhibition of Bmp signaling in the late stage embryo using dorsomorphin, a chemical inhibitor of Bmp receptors, significantly increased β-cell neogenesis near the extrapancreatic duct, demonstrating the feasibility of pharmacological approaches to increase β-cell numbers. Our in vivo single-cell analyses show that whereas Bmp signaling is necessary initially for formation of the ventral pancreas, differentiating endodermal cells need to be protected from exposure to Bmps during specific stages to permit β-cell differentiation. These results provide important unique insight into the intercellular signaling environment necessary for in vivo and in vitro generation of β-cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3acell communication 3agastrulation 3aislets of Langerhans 3areceptors1 aAndersson, Olov1 aRow, Richard1 aKimelman, David1 aStainier, Didier Y.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 19, v. 107, no. 3 p.1142-1147dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09102051073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03549naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245010300209300001800312506007600330520148800406506003701894650001401931650002601945650001601971650001501987650002502002650001002027650001302037650001702050650001002067650001902077650001302096650001002109650001202119650000902131650001402140650001402154650001402168650001602182650002102198650002102219650002302240650001302263700001902276700002002295700002602315700001702341700002202358700002402380700001902404700001402423700002102437700002002458700001802478700002102496700002302517773017302540852000902713856008302722930003302805946001302838655001202851IND4431687120221207074301.0100122e20100119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443168712DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09133741072doi7 aPMC28243172pmcid7 a200806192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubler-Kielb, Joanna12aA bicomponent Plasmodium falciparum investigational vaccine composed of protein-peptide conjugates  ap. 1172-1177.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is yet no licensed vaccine against malaria, a serious human disease affecting mostly children, with an annual death rate of about one million. Plasmodia, the malaria-causing parasites, have two obligatory hosts: mammals or birds, in which they multiply asexually, and mosquitoes with sexual multiplication. The most common and serious type of malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a major surface antigen of sporozoites, is a protective antigen. A unique feature of P. falciparum CSP is its large central domain composed of over 30 tetrapeptide repeats of Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro (NANP). Several NANP peptide-protein conjugates were tested clinically but elicited a low level of CSP antibodies for a short duration. To provide a CSP-based candidate vaccine, we investigated recombinant CSP and NANP conjugates of various peptide lengths, with different N-terminal amino acids, bound at different ratios to various carrier proteins. Injected into mice, CSP alone and CSP or NANP conjugates induced antibodies with booster responses and were positive by the sporozoite imunofluorescent assay. The use of the mosquito stage P. falciparum ookinete surface protein, Pfs25, cross-linked onto itself as a carrier for NANP, induced in mice high levels of uniquely long-lasting antibodies to both vaccine components with secondary biological activities, that will provide immunity to liver infection by sporozoites and block transmission by mosquitoes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCulicidae 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3abioactive properties 3abirds 3achildren 3acrosslinking 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3aimmunity 3aliver 3amalaria 3amice 3amortality 3aookinetes 3aparasites 3asporozoites 3asurface antigens 3asurface proteins 3atransport proteins 3avaccines1 aMajadly, Fathy1 aBiesova, Zuzana1 aMocca, Christopher P.1 aGuo, Chunyan1 aNussenzweig, Ruth1 aNussenzweig, Victor1 aMishra, Satish1 aWu, Yimin1 aMiller, Louis H.1 aKeith, Jerry M.1 aLiu, Teh-Yung1 aRobbins, John B.1 aSchneerson, Rachel0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Jan. 19, v. 107, no. 3 p.1172-1177dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09133741073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01674naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006900125300001400194520084300208650002201051650001901073650001601092653001701108653001201125653001101137700001901148700001501167700001901182773008101201852000901282930003301291945001301324946001101337655001201348IND2047561820221120180627.0950831e19950721ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204756182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, A.10aBinding of galactomannans to kappa-carrageenan after cold mixing  ap. 91-96.  aThe room temperature interaction between swollen carrageenan particles and solutions of carob, cassia, guar, and tara galactomannans has been studied. Analysis using gel permeation chromatography of the supernatant solution above the carrageenan particles demonstrated binding of all the galactomannans, except guar, to kappa-carrageenan. It was also demonstrated that carob galactomannan did not bind to iota-carrageenan. Binding after cold mixing saturates at high kappa-carrageenan/carob ratios, of the order of 80, unlike the interaction in mixtures after heating, which saturates at ratios close to 1. The existence of binding shows that the interaction between these two species is attractive, and thus suggests that the synergistic rheological interaction which occurs after heating is due to the formation of mixed junction zones. 3aCeratonia siliqua 3agalactomannans 3acarrageenan 0ainteractions 0abinding 0acarobs1 aLelimousin, D.1 aMiniou, C.1 aBoulenguer, P.0 tCarbohydrate research.g1995 July 21, v. 272, no. 1 p.91-96x0008-62157nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01983naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009600127300001500223500001500238520113700253650001301390650001801403650002001421650002601441653001701467653002101484700001601505773008201521852000901603930003301612945001301645946001101658655001201669IND2047561920221120180533.0950831e19950721ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204756192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlanchot, V.10aPurification and characterization of extracellular alpha-amylase from Aspergillus fumigatus  ap. 97-109.  a2019-12-05  aExtracellular alpha-amylase [(1 leads to 4)-alpha-D-glucan glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.1] from Aspergillus fumigatus (Aspergillus sp.

The purified enzyme, a glycoprotein with 15% carbohydrate content, showed an isoelectric point of 3.7, a molecular weight of 65,000 (as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), and an amino acid composition with a high number of neutral hydrophobic residues. Alpha-amylase activity on alpha-D-glucans in solution was optimal at pH 5.5, and the enzyme was stable at 40 degrees C. It hydrolyzed amylose and amylopectin, with respective Km of 0.42 and 7.7 mg mL-1 and kcat/Km of 3.4 and 2.5 mL mg-1 min-1. The major end-products of maltohexaose, degradation were glucose and maltose. Maltotriose, maltotetraose, and maltopentaose were formed as intermediate products with an alpha-anomeric configuration. Despite its ability to slowly degrade some alpha-(1 leads to 6) linkages, this purified enzyme should be classified as an alpha-amylase. 3akinetics 3aalpha-amylase 3aenzyme activity 3aAspergillus fumigatus 0apurification 0acharacterization1 aColonna, P.0 tCarbohydrate research.g1995 July 21, v. 272, no. 1 p.97-109x0008-62157nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02838naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013900127300001600266520166000282650002601942650001701968650002301985650002002008650001802028650003002046650002702076650002002103650002402123650000802147650001102155650001002166650001002176650001402186653001102200700001702211700001302228700001902241773007602260852000902336930003302345945001302378946001302391655001202404IND2205518620221120180542.0000629e199910  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220551862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazzei, K.C.10aDevelopmental rates of the native milfoil weevil, Euhrychiopsis lecontei, and damage to Eurasian watermilfoil at constant temperatures  ap. 139-143.  aThe native aquatic weevil Euhrychiopsis lecontei (Dietz) is a potential biological control agent of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.). The weevil reduces the viability of milfoil by mining plant stems. We determined the influence of temperature on the developmental rates of the weevil and damage to Eurasian watermilfoil stems. Single E. lecontei eggs were laid on rooted plants in individual tubes filled with water and 16 such tubes were randomly assigned to each of eight environmental chambers set at constant temperatures of 15, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 31 degrees C with a 16-h daylength. Weevils and plants were monitored daily and development times were recorded for the egg, larval, and pupal stages. Length of watermilfoil stem damaged (cm) was estimated at 21, 25, and 29 degrees C. Developmental rate was linearly related to temperature, up to 29 degrees C; the developmental maximum appeared to be between 29 and 31 degrees C. Average egg hatch occurred in 12.0 days at 15 degrees C and in 4.2 days at 31 degrees C. Average larval development time took 20 days at 15 degrees C and 6.1 days at 31 degrees C. Complete egg to adult development ranged from 16.6 days at 29 degrees C to 61.7 days at 15 degrees C. The lower developmental threshold was between 8.2 and 10.5 degrees C, and egg to adult development required 309 +/- 27.6 (2 SE) degree-days above 9.8 degrees C. Daily stem damage increased with temperature but total damage (by larvae) was equal across temperatures and averaged 15.1 +/- 1.9 cm. Field temperature data indicated that up to five generations could be completed in a typical summer in Minnesota lakes. 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3aweed control 3abiological control 3aaquatic insects 3aCurculionidae 3abiological control agents 3abiological development 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3aova 3alarvae 3apupae 3astems 3aheat sums 0adamage1 aNewman, R.M.1 aLoos, A.1 aRagsdale, D.W.0 tBiological control.g1999 Oct., v. 16, no. 2 p.139-143x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02551naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012400129300001600253500001500269520105600284650002401340650004301364650002201407650001601429650001201445650003001457650002601487650002701513650001701540650001401557650001701571650002301588650001901611650002401630650003001654650002301684653001401707653001601721653002101737653002101758653000901779653003001788700002001818700002001838700001801858773007701876852000901953930003301962945001301995946001302008655001202021IND2205246220221120180655.0000614e199909  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220524622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGregor, R.R.10aPotential use of Dicyphus hesperus Knight (Heteroptera: Miridae) for biological control of pests of greenhouse tomatoes  ap. 104-110.  a2019-12-05  aThe potential of Dicyphus hesperus Knight as a predator of greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), and two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch, was assessed in the laboratory and in a tomato greenhouse. D. hesperus adults fed readily upon both pest species in the laboratory, and nymphs completed development from egg to adult on either whitefly or mites. Whitefly, however, were a superior food for growth and development of D. hesperus compared to mites. Development time was shorter and resulting adult body size was larger for nymphs reared on whitefly compared to those reared on mites. In a greenhouse release, adults oriented to and oviposited on whitefly-infested sentinel plants but did not orient to mite-infested sentinel plants. D. hesperus adults oviposited on greenhouse tomatoes and their progeny completed development in a greenhouse in which both whitefly and mites were present. The results are discussed as they relate to the use of D. hesperus for biological control of pests of greenhouse vegetables. 3ahorticultural crops 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3apredatory insects 3aoviposition 3aMiridae 3abiological control agents 3agreenhouse production 3abiological development 3amite control 3apredation 3ahost seeking 3apopulation density 3ainsect control 3aTetranychus urticae 3aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 3abiological control 0apredators 0aorientation 0adevelopment time 0agreenhouse crops 0asize 0apredators of insect pests1 aGillespie, D.R.1 aQuiring, D.M.J.1 aFoisy, M.R.J.0 tBiological control.g1999 Sept., v. 16, no. 1 p.104-110x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02948naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013000126300001600256500001500272520149000287650001901777650001701796650000901813650001601822650001101838650001301849650003001862650001601892650002701908650001401935650002501949650002101974650002701995650002402022650002302046650001802069651001502087653001102102653001202113653002302125653002702148653001102175653002202186700001702208700001702225700002002242773007602262852000902338930003302347945001302380946001302393655001202406IND2321842020221120165912.0010630e200103  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232184202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoche, C.T.10aEustenopus villosus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) feeding of herbicide-resistant yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.)  ap. 279-286.  a2019-12-05  aA population of yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.) near Dayton, Washington developed herbicide resistance in response to repeated applications of picloram and other auxin-type herbicides. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted in 1998 to determine host acceptability and suitability of this herbicide-resistant yellow starthistle population to the biological control weevil Eustenopus villosus (Boheman) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). In choice and nochoice feeding and oviposition experiments using excised buds, the weevil did not demonstrate a consistent preference for either herbicide-resistant (R) or -susceptible (S) yellow starthistle. When caged on buds of intact plants, the E. villosus feeding rate of 97% did not differ between R and S types. Host plant suitability, measured as larval damage and development to adult weevils, was equivalent in R and S types, with weevils maturing in 46% of the R and in 32% of the S capitula bearing oviposition scars. The number of viable achenes per capitulum was reduced by 87% due to larval feeding, with no difference between R and S types. Observations at the field site where resistance was found revealed oviposition scars on 78% of the late-bud-stage capitula on 23 June 1998 and 73% of the flowering and postflowering capitula on 15 August 1998. Selection for herbicide resistance has not created host incompatibility for E. villosus nor reduced the effectiveness of E. villosus as a biological control agent. 3ainflorescences 3aweed control 3abuds 3aoviposition 3alarvae 3apicloram 3abiological control agents 3ahost plants 3aCentaurea solstitialis 3afruit set 3aherbicide resistance 3ahost preferences 3abiological development 3afeeding preferences 3abiological control 3aCurculionidae 0aWashington 0adamage 0aachenes 0ahost acceptability 0aoviposition preference 0afruits 0aachene production1 aHarmon, B.L.1 aWilson, L.M.1 aMcCaffrey, J.P.0 tBiological control.g2001 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.279-286x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03832naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245018000126300001600306500001500322520229800337650002302635650001802658650001402676650002802690650001802718650003002736650002602766650001602792650001102808650002702819650002602846650001402872650001402886650002302900653002202923653002402945653002502969653001302994653002503007653003203032653002203064700001703086700002103103700001503124700001903139773007603158852000903234930003303243945001303276946001303289655001203302IND2321841620221120165855.0010630e200103  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232184162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, L.10aFluorescent brighteners improve Anticarsia gemmatalis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV) activity on AgMNPV-Susceptible and resistant strains of the insect  ap. 247-253.  a2019-12-05  aFluorescent (optical) brighteners are known for their characteristics of protecting baculoviruses against deactivation by ultraviolet (UV) light and enhancing the activity of these agents as microbial insecticides on hosts and semipermissive hosts. These substances were evaluated in combination with the velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, multiple-embedded nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV). The first trial involved 4 fluorescent brighteners (Blankophor BBH, Blankophor HRS, Blankophor RKH, and Tinopal LPW) obtained from the United States. The second trial was conducted with 11 fluorescent brighteners (Tinopal UNPA-GX, Tinopal DMS, Tinopal CBS, Leukophor DUB, Leukophor BSBB, Hostalux KS-N, Hostalux ETBN, BRY 10 D2 100, BRY 10 D2 150, Uvitex BHT, and Uvitex NFW) available in Brazil in combination with the AgMNPV to determine the degree of enhancement of viral activity. These brighteners were also evaluated with regard to AgMNPV protection against deactivation by UV light. Combinations of the virus with selected fluorescent brighteners were tested against both AgMNPV-susceptible and resistant strains of A. gemmatalis. In the first trial, brighteners obtained from the United States promoted increases in AgMNPV activity from 5.2-fold (Blankophor HRS) to 76.6-fold (Blankophor RKH) and reduced the mean time to death by 2.8 to 3.5 days. In the second trial, the most effective brightener (Tinopal UNPA-GX) reduced the LC50 in A. gemmatalis larvae from 7083 occlusion bodies (OBs)/ml (virus alone) to 77.8 OBs/ml (approximately equal to 90-fold). When 4 selected brighteners were tested in combination with the AgMNPV in resistant insects, the LC50 was reduced by ca. 10,000-fold (Leukophor DUB) to ca. 62,000-fold (Tinopal UNPA-GX), in comparison to the LC50 of 3.7 x 10(7) OBs/ml observed for the virus alone. Therefore, mortality of highly resistant A. gemmatalis larvae to the AgMNPV increased dramatically when the virus was combined with some fluorescent brighteners. UV protection measured by original activity remaining (OAR) varied from <30% OAR (Uvitex NFW) to >90% OAR (Tinopal UNPA-GX and BRY 10 D2 100). All efficacious brighteners were stilbene disulfonic acid derivatives and, when used alone, none showed negative effects against A. gemmatalis larvae. 3aviral insecticides 3adose response 3astilbenes 3ainsecticidal properties 3aBaculoviridae 3abiological control agents 3aAnticarsia gemmatalis 3alethal dose 3alarvae 3ainsecticide resistance 3aultraviolet radiation 3avirulence 3amortality 3abiological control 0amicrobial control 0aoptical brighteners 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0aefficacy 0aradiation protection 0aradiation protection agents 0avirus enhancement1 aMoscardi, F.1 aSosa-Gomez, D.R.1 aParo, F.E.1 aSoldorio, I.L.0 tBiological control.g2001 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.247-253x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02538naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012400126300001200250520143700262650002701699650001701726650001701743650001601760650003001776650002301806650001701829650001601846650001501862650001601877650002401893651002301917653002701940700001801967700001601985773007102001852000902072930003302081945001302114946001302127655001202140IND2203763220221120165926.0000411e199905  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220376322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeard, T.A.10aChalcodermus serripes (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) for biological control of Mimosa pigra: host relations and life cycle  ap. 1-9.  aChalcodermus serripes, a seed feeder of Mimosa pigra (Mimosaceae) was studied to assess its suitability for biological control of this important weed in Australia and South East Asia. Adults fed on growing tips, flowers, and pods of its host plant but oviposited only on seeds. Females avoided laying more than one or at most two eggs per seed even in the absence of other oviposition sites. One larva developed per seed and took approximately 14 days to completely consume the seed. They then changed to prepupae, which, in the field, stayed in their pod segments until the following wet season when they left the segment and pupated in the soil before emerging as adults. In the laboratory, few of these prepupae completed their development to adults despite having been provided with a range of environmental conditions to break diapause. Choice and no-choice tests on pods of 71 legume species showed that only M. pigra was acceptable for oviposition. Some adult feeding occurred on new growth of 10 species closely related to M. pigra but this does not diminish the safety of this insect for biological control as it will not oviposit and therefore complete its life cycle on these plants. Populations of C. serripes from Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil all showed the same restriction to M. pigra. Permission to release this insect in Australia was obtained and it was first released in the Northern Territory during April 1996. 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aChalcodermus 3aMimosa pigra 3awoody weeds 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3aweed control 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3aoviposition 3afeeding preferences 3aNorthern Territory 0aoviposition preference1 aBurcher, J.A.1 aForno, I.W.0 tBiological control.g1999 May, v. 15, no. 1 p.1-9x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02251naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014400127300001600271520102700287650002401314650001701338650001501355650001601370650002101386650002401407650003201431650001401463650002701477650001401504650001401518653000901532653003001541653001901571653001701590653002801607700001601635700002201651773007601673852000901749930003301758945001301791946001301804655001201817IND2323179720221120165904.0010920e200106  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232317972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauziere, I.10aHost stage selection and suitability in Cephalonomia stephanoderis Betrem (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), a parasitoid of the coffee berry borer  ap. 128-133.  aPaired choice experiments were used to evaluate host feeding and oviposition preferences of Cephalonomia stephanoderis (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), a solitary ectoparasitoid of the coffee berry borer (CBB), Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). Immature and ovipositing females may feed on all developmental stages of the host, but prefer eggs and adults. Parasitoid females parasitize prepupae, pupae, and full-grown larvae of H. hampei, the latter stage being least preferred. Ovipositional decisions of C. stephanoderis females lead to the selection of the most profitable host stage for parasitoid development because parasitoids developing on larval hosts took more time to reach the adult stage and were smaller than those developing on prepupal and pupal hosts. The behavioral plasticity of C. stephandoderis in CBB host stage selection for both host feeding and oviposition may contribute to the survival and establishment of C. stephanoderis as a biological control agent of H. hampei in coffee plantations. 3aHypothenemus hampei 3aCephalonomia 3aparasitism 3aoviposition 3ahost preferences 3afeeding preferences 3ahost-parasite relationships 3amortality 3abiological development 3asex ratio 3aparasites 0asize 0aparasites of insect pests 0ahost selection 0ahost feeding 0aoviposiiton preferences1 aBrodeur, J.1 aPerez-Lachaud, G.0 tBiological control.g2001 June, v. 21, no. 2 p.128-133x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03643naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245014600130300001400276500001500290520207600305650001602381650001602397650000802413650001502421650001902436650001402455650001402469650003202483650003002515650002402545650001402569650001502583650001402598650002102612650002702633650001402660650001602674650001202690650001902702651001902721653001402740653002302754653002402777653001302801653003002814653002102844700001902865700001902884700002102903773007302924852000902997930003303006945001303039946001303052655001203065IND2322212520221120154437.0010725e200105  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232221252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChabi-Olaye, A.10aFactors affecting the biology of Telenomus isis (Polaszek) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), an egg parasitoid of cereal stem borers in West Africa  ap. 44-54.  a2019-12-05  aThis study aimed at an assessment of the potential of the egg parasitoid Telenomus isis (Polaszek) as a biological control agent of cereal stem borers. Therefore, the effects of temperature, host species, host age, and time of host deprivation on the development and the reproductive potential of T. isis were studied in the laboratory. By use of linear regression and a modified Logan model and with eggs of the noctuid Sesamia calamistis Hampson as hosts, the lower and upper thresholds for development were estimated at 13.1 and 36 degrees C, respectively, and the optimal temperature for development was 31 degrees C. Female T. isis had no measurable preoviposition period, and the oviposition period ranged from 3 to 5 days. Approximately 66% of the total lifetime complement of eggs of T. isis were produced within 6 h after emergence. Average total life-time fecundity was 61.1 and 82.1 eggs per female at 21 and 28 degrees C, respectively. Longevity of adult females was 17.1 days at 21 degrees C and 5.2 days at 30 degrees C. Host acceptance and suitability were tested, using nine lepidopteran borer species. Only the noctuids S. calamistis, Sesamia poephaga (Tam & Bowden), Sesamia botanephaga (Tam & Bowden), and Busseola fusca (Fuller) were successfully attacked by T. isis. Parasitism and emergence did not differ among those species, but the sex ratio (expressed as proportion of female progeny) was significantly lower on S. calamistis. An increase of the host age from 1 to 4 days significantly reduced mean parasitism from 56.7 to 23.5%. Parasitoid emergence rates and sex ratio did not vary among 1-, 2-, or 3-day-old host eggs, but both parameters were significantly lower on 4-day-old eggs. With increasing duration of host deprivation from 0 to 17 days, longevity increased from 8.5 to 18.5 days, whereas average lifetime fecundity decreased from 81.2 to 40.5 eggs per female, respectively, indicating resorption of eggs. The results are discussed and compared with life table parameters of the ubiquitous egg parasitoid Telenomus busseolae (Gahan). 3aparasitoids 3aoviposition 3aage 3aparasitism 3aboring insects 3alongevity 3afecundity 3ahost-parasite relationships 3abiological control agents 3aambient temperature 3asex ratio 3ahost range 3aTelenomus 3ahost preferences 3abiological development 3amortality 3alife tables 3aSesamia 3aBusseola fusca 3aWestern Africa 0aparasites 0ahost acceptability 0atelenomus busseolae 0ahost age 0aparasites of insect pests 0ahost deprivation1 aSchulthess, F.1 aPoehling, H.M.1 aBorgemeister, C.0 tBiological control.g2001 May, v. 21, no. 1 p.44-54x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03057naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245018200127300001600309520191200325650001302237650002402250650001602274650001402290650001802304650001402322650001402336650002202350650003002372650002302402650001702425653001002442653002602452653002302478700001402501773007602515852000902591930003302600945001302633946001302646655001202659IND2202172520221120154330.0000107e199906  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220217252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAvoy, T.J.10aEffects of temperature on eggs, fecundity, and adult longevity of Hylobius transversovittatus Goeze (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a biological control agent of purple loosestrife  ap. 162-167.  aOviposition, egg development, and adult longevity of Hylobius transversovittatus Goeze (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a biological control agent of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.), were studied at several temperatures. Adults reared at constant temperatures of 12.5, 15, 20, 25, and 30 +/- 1 degree C showed large differences in longevity and oviposition response to temperature. Preoviposition and oviposition periods increased with decreased temperature. The preoviposition period ranged from 8.4 days at 25 degrees C to 77.9 days at 12.5 degrees C, and the oviposition period was 143.2 days at 30 degrees C and 891.7 days at 12.5 degrees C. Oviposition per female per day increased from 0.34 eggs at 12.5 degrees C to 2.92 at 25 degrees C. The highest total number of eggs per female (701.3) was observed at 25 degrees C. At 30 degrees C, total eggs laid per female decreased to 139.0. Adults lived for over 3 years at the lower temperatures, and longevity was inversely proportional to temperature. For the range of temperatures tested, females survived six times longer at the lowest temperature (1149.3 days at 12.5 degrees C) compared with the highest temperature (185.4 days at 30 degrees C). Based on regression analysis, minimum threshold temperature for development was 9.5, 12.7, and 11.6 degrees C for eggs, preoviposition, and oviposition, respectively. Eggs were reared at 10, 15, 20, 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5, and 35 degrees C and had hatch rates of > 90% at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C but only 5% hatch at 32.5 degrees C, and zero at 10 and 35 degrees C. Developmental rate of eggs increased with temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C but decreased at 32.5 degrees C. Egg developmental time increased from 8 to 36 days with temperatures decreasing from 30 to 15 degrees C, respectively. These data indicate that 25 degrees C is the optimum temperature for oviposition and egg development. 3aHylobius 3aambient temperature 3aoviposition 3afecundity 3aembryogenesis 3alongevity 3amortality 3aLythrum salicaria 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3aweed control 0ahatch 0apreoviposition period 0aoviposition period1 aKok, L.T.0 tBiological control.g1999 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.162-167x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01629naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009700129300001600226500001500242520059000257650001500847650001600862650003000878650001400908650001700922650002000939650002400959653001400983653003000997700001801027700001801045700001701063700001901080773007601099852000901175930003301184945001301217946001301230655001201243IND2202171920221120154412.0000107e199906  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220217192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBautista, R.C.10aMass-rearing of the tephritid fruit fly parasitoid Fopius arisanus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)  ap. 137-144.  a2019-12-05  aFopius (= Biosteres) arisanus (Sonan) (= Opius oophilus (Fullaway)) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), an egg-pupal parasitoid of tephritid fruit flies was successfully bred in captivity, resulting in the development of a laboratory-adapted strain.

Aim of this study was to establish a safe, noninvasive and accurate technique for the measurement of segmental oroanal transit time. We localized an orally ingested magnetic marker by means of a biomagnetic instrumentation that allows us to identify in a three-dimensional pattern the position of a biomagnetic source inside the body. The biomagnetic localizations were compared with the anatomical data obtained by magnetic resonance imaging investigations. The study was performed in 12 healthy subjects, and scans were taken every hour up to the arrival of the marker into the cecum; thereafter, scans were taken every 4 hr up to the elimination of the marker. In 99% of the isofield maps obtained from each field scan, the marker was localized within the bowel walls. The mean oroanal transit time was 56 +/- 5 hr, the mouth-to-cecum transit time was 13 +/- 1.7 hr, and the total colonic transit time was 43.5 +/- 5 hr (mean +/- SEM). Segmental colon transit did not show major differences among the regions considered, although most of the time was spent in the right colon. In fact, a good correlation was found between transit time through the right colon and oroanal and total colonic transit (r = 0.77, P < 0.02, r = 0.79, P < 0.02 respectively). In conclusion, this method might be a safe alternative to the techniques presently used in the clinical setting for the measurement of intestinal transit. 3adigesta 3aintestines 3ameasurement 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aColonxphysiology 2aGastrointestinal Transit 2aHumans 2aMagneticsxdiagnostic use. 2aMale 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aReference Values 0atransit time 0amethodology1 aNeri, M.1 aCarriero, A.1 aCasciardi, S.1 aComani, S.1 aDel Gratta, C.1 aDi Donato, L.1 aDi Luizo, S.1 aMacri, M.A.1 aPasquarelli, A.0 tDigestive diseases and sciences.g1992 Oct., v. 37, no. 10 p.1537-1543x0163-21167nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03068naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245008400152300001600236300002400252500001500276520159300291650000901884650001401893650002201907650003001929650001001959650002301969650001001992650000902002650001202011650003002023650001602053650005802069650006102127650002902188650002902217650001102246650001102257650000902268650000902277650001602286650001702302650003202319653001102351773008802362852001302450939003302463945000802496946001302504852000902517655001202526991596570620742620221120144115.0870401e198605  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870005932DNAL7 a30091112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorfleet, R.G.10aEffect of diet on fecal occult blood testing in patients with colorectal polyps  ap. 498-501.  ap. 498-501. charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: To determine the effect of a red-meat-free, high-fiber diet, patients performed fecal blood testing before colonoscopy for suspected polyps. One hundred twenty-nine patients were allowed an unrestricted diet, and 159 consumed the special diet. Without dietary restrictions, 31 of 77 patients with adenomas, five of eight with cancer, one of seven with nonneoplastic polyps, and one of 37 with normal colonoscopy had positive tests. With the special diet, 30 of 97 patients with adenomas, eight of ten with cancer, one of six with nonneoplastic polyps, and one of 46 with normal colonoscopy had positive tests. There are no statistical differences between the groups. Comparing all patients with cancer to those with normal colonoscopy, the sensitivity of fecal blood testing is 72 per cent, the specificity 98 per cent, and the positive and negative predictive value 87 per cent and 94 per cent, respectively. The sensitivity for fecal blood testing in patients with adenomas (compared to those with normal endoscopy) is 35 per cent, the specificity is 98 per cent, and the positive and negative predictive values are 97 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively. Combining all patients with adenomas, those with multiple polyps, larger polyps, or polyps located distal to the splenic flexure had positive fecal blood tests more frequently. Fecal blood testing does not detect a large number of colorectal adenomas. This study does not indicate any benefit on the sensitivity or specificity of fecal blood tests from the red-meat-free, high-fiber diet currently recommended.(author) 3adiet 3acarcinoma 3afeces composition 3adigestive system diseases 3ablood 2aAdenomaxdiagnosis 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aColonic Polypsxdiagnosis 2aColonoscopy 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFalse Negative Reactions 2aFalse Positive Reactions 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMeat 2aMiddle Aged 2aOccult Blood 2aRectal Neoplasmsxdiagnosis 0apolyps0 tDigestive diseases and sciences.g1986 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.498-501x0163-21167nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19870401c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245008400148300001800232500001500250520150900265650001801774650001801792650001401810650000901824650001001833650001201843650003001855650005601885650002801941650003101969650003202000650001102032650000902043650000902052650001502061650002902076650004002105650002302145650003402168653001902202653000902221700001802230700001702248700001602265773009202281852000902373939003302382946001302415655001202428IND9203720520221120144131.0920611e199111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920372052DNAL7 a16575572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGarrity, T.J.10aEffects of fat and fiber on human colon cancer xenografted to athymic nude mice  ap. 1606-1610.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of unsaturated fat and fiber (cellulose) on the growth of human colon cancer explanted to athymic nude mice was evaluated. Eighty-seven male nude mice bearing xenografts of human HT29 or WiDr colon cancer were divided into three groups of equal weight and tumor volume. Each group was fed one of three diets: normal fat/no fiber (N/N), high fat/no fiber (H/N) or high fat/high fiber (H/H). To equalize caloric intake, animals in the H/N group received 4 g of food per day and the other animals were fed 5 g of food per day. At sacrifice tumor volume and weight was recorded, and tumors were analyzed for protein and DNA content and ornithine decarboxylase activity. Tumor volume, weight, and protein were greater in the H/N group compared to the N/N group for both colon cancer cell lines. Tumor DNA content was greater in the HT29 H/N group compared to the N/N group (P < 0.05) and tumor ornithine decarboxylase activity in the WiDr H/N group was greater than the N/N animals (P < 0.002). The tumor growth-promoting effects of the high unsaturated fat diet were attenuated by the addition of fiber. Animal weight was higher in the H/N group compared to the N/N and H/H groups. This study suggested that a high-fat diet stimulated and fiber decreased the growth of human colon cancer explanted to athymic nude mice. The growth-promoting effects of a high-fat diet in colorectal cancer may be due in part to a circulating trophic factor since these tumors were remote from the large intestine. 3alipid content 3adietary fiber 3acarcinoma 3amice 3acolon 2aAnimals 2aCell Divisionxphysiology 2aColonic Neoplasmsxenzymologyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aDNA, Neoplasmxanalysis 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aDietary Fiberxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Nude 2aNeoplasm Transplantation 2aOrnithine Decarboxylasexmetabolism 2aProteinsxanalysis 2aTransplantation, Heterologous 0afat percentage 0adiet1 aPeiffer, L.P.1 aKramer, S.T.1 aSmith, J.P.0 tDigestive diseases and sciences.g1991 Nov., v. 36, no. 11 p.1606-1610x0163-21167nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02714naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245006800131300001600199300002400215500001500239520164400254650001301898650001101911650001401922650001401936650002001950650001201970650001101982650001501993650002202008653003102030653001302061653001702074700001602091700002002107773008902127852001302216939003302229945000802262946001302270852000902283655001202292991596570240742620221120144246.0880613e198802  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880012202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaine, L.A.10aEffect of oral iron therapy on the upper gastrointestinal tract  ap. 172-177.  ap. 172-177. charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: This study assesses the effect of oral iron therapy on the upper gastrointestinal tract and fecal occult blood testing. Fourteen healthy volunteers completed a checklist of gastrointestinal symptoms, underwent endoscopy and biopsy of the stomach and duodenum, and supplied a fresh stool sample for Hemoccult and HemoQuant testing. They then took ferrous sulfate 325 mg per os tid for two weeks and had the same evaluation repeated. Gastrointestinal symptoms were rated by the patients on a scale of 0-3, endoscopic findings were numerically scored (0-4), and the biopsies were graded blindly. Thirteen other healthy volunteers took ferrous sulfate 325 mg per os tid for one week and had Hemoccult testing of stool at days 0 and 7. All subjects developed dark stools, and significant nausea and diarrhea were noted (0.1 +/- 0.1 to 0.9 +/- 0.3, P less than 0.05 for both symptoms). Only 1/27 had a questionably trace-positive Hemoccult test (two observers disagreed) and no significant difference was seen in HemoQuant testing (1.4 +/- 0.5 to 1.8 +/- 0.7 mg Hb/g). A significant increase was seen in endoscopic abnormalities in the stomach (0.1 +/- 0.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.3, P = 0.003), consisting of erythema, small areas of subepithelial hemorrhage, and, in two subjects, erosions. Biopsies showed no significant change after iron therapy. We conclude that (1) oral ferrous sulfate rarely causes Hemoccult-positive stools, and patients with positive Hemoccult tests on iron therapy require further evaluation; and (2) oral iron may cause mild endoscopic abnormalities in the stomach which are of uncertain clinical significance.(author) 3aduodenum 3ahumans 3ahistology 3aendoscopy 3aferrous sulfate 3astomach 3abiopsy 3ahematology 3afeces composition 0afecal occult blood testing 0asymptoms 0atherapeutics1 aBentley, E.1 aChandrasoma, P.0 tDigestive diseases and sciences.g1988 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.172-177x0163-21167nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19880613c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007700131300001500208500001500223520157900238650001101817650001801828650001601846650001601862650001901878650003001897650001301927650001601940650003001956650002001986650002002006650002302026650001902049650001902068650001202087650002302099651001302122653001902135653003302154653002202187653002202209700001702231700001802248700001502266700001702281773007502298852000902373930003302382945001302415946001302428655001202441IND2200945920221120133708.0991006e199902  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220094592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnglish-Loeb, G.10aControl of powdery mildew in wild and cultivated grapes by a tydeid mite  ap. 97-103.  a2019-12-05  aThe leaf surface of woody perennials is inhabited by an extraordinary diversity of mites. Although a majority of these mite species are thought to feed on fungi or other microbes, their ability to control plant pathogens has not been rigorously investigated. We present experimental evidence that a tydeid mite, Orthotydeus lambi, can suppress the development of grape powdery mildew on wild and cultivated grapes. Orthotydeus lambi is abundant on the leaves of a number of different tree and vine species in the northeastern United States, including the riverbank grape, Vitis riparia. When released at realistic densities, O lambi was able to reduce the incidence and severity of grape powdery mildew on potted V. riparia vines placed in the field. Orthotydeus lambi was also able to reduce the severity of powdery mildew on the cultivated grape V. vinifera (cv "Cabernet Sauvignon") under greenhouse conditions and on the cultivated grape "Chancellor" (a Vitis interspecific hybrid) under vineyard conditions. A survey of wild and cultivated grapes in central New York indicated that O. lambi is common on wild grape leaves but generally rare in commercial vineyards. We present experimental data showing that two commonly used fungicides, sulfur and mancozeb, suppress O. lambi populations under vineyard conditions. Our results suggest that O. lambi and other mycophagous mites play an important role in regulating some epiphyllous fungi in the wild. We may be able to exploit mycophagous mites as biological control agents of important fungal pathogens of crop plants. 3asulfur 3aVitis riparia 3aOrthotydeus 3awild plants 3aVitis labrusca 3abiological control agents 3amancozeb 3aviticulture 3afungal diseases of plants 3aadverse effects 3adisease control 3apopulation density 3aVitis vinifera 3awine cultivars 3amildews 3abiological control 3aNew York 0afungus control 0aplant diseases and disorders 0anontarget effects 0aorthotydeus lambi1 aNorton, A.P.1 aGadoury, D.M.1 aSeem, R.C.1 aWilcox, W.F.0 tBiological control.g1999 Feb., v. 14, no. 2 p.97-103x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02117naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245013800131300001600269520090800285650001901193650002401212650001201236650002001248650000901268650001201277650002301289650002301312650003001335650001801365651001401383653002601397653002101423653001801444653002101462700001701483700002401500700001501524773007601539852000901615930003301624945001301657946001301670655001201683IND2201105120221120124133.0991015e199903  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220110512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinkraus, D.C.10aInfection of sentinel cotton aphids (Homoptera: Aphididae) by aerial conidia of Neozygites fresenii (Entomophthorales: Neozygitaceae)  ap. 181-185.  aUninfected adult Aphis gossypii (Homoptera: Aphididae) apterae (sentinel aphids) on cotton leaves were exposed for 8 h to the air over a commercial cotton field in Louisiana during the night of 1-2 July 1995. At 0015 h there were 90,437 primary conidia/m3 air of the fungus Neozygites fresenii (Entomophthorales: Neozygitaceae) at the midfield position as determined from Rotorod samples. Forty-eight percent (n = 106) of the sentinel aphids exposed for 8 h at midfield were infected by aerial conidia of N. fresenii. Exposure of sentinel aphids outside the cotton field, at 10 and 100 m downwind and 10 m upwind, resulted in 34.8% (n = 131), 24.0% (n = 129), and 17.4% (n = 146) infected aphids, respectively.

In field populations, the occurrence of A. misella in HbGV-infected H. brillians pupae was less frequent than would have been expected by random assortment of the virus and the parasitoid. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detected granulovirus less frequently and in lower concentrations in parasitized pupae than in nonparasitized pupae. Finally, in the host pupae that tested positive for virus, parasitoids were more likely to survive pupation than hosts. When laboratory-reared H. brillians larvae were exposed to naturally occurring A. misella in a field experiment, the parasitoid oviposited more often in older than in younger host larvae and more often in healthy than in HbGV-infected host larvae. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that selective oviposition by A. misella leads to reduced overlap of the parasitoid and HbGV in hosts, resulting in greater parasitoid survival. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aoviposition 3abiological control agents 3aage 3aTachinidae 3aVitis 3ainterspecific competition 3aBetabaculovirus 3ahost preferences 3amortality 3abiological control 0aoviposition preference 0aparasites 0aharrisina metallica 0amicrobial control 0ainteractions 0aGranulovirus 0aparasites of insect pests 0ahost age1 aMills, N.J.1 aPurcell, A.H.0 tBiological control.g1999 Mar., v. 14, no. 3 p.146-151x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02929naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014100127300001300268500001500281520167100296650002501967650001501992650001602007650001002023650001402033650003202047650001302079650002402092650002302116650002002139650001402159650002302173653001402196653002602210653003002236653002502266653001102291700001402302700001502316773007202331852000902403930003302412945001302445946001302458655001202471IND2195939720221120114233.0981210e199805  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219593972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreene, G.L.10aParasitization of house fly pupae (Diptera: Muscidae) by Spalangia nigroaenea (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) in cattle feedlot environments  ap. 7-13.  a2019-12-05  aSpalangia nigroaenea Curtis, a parasitoid that attacks filth fly pupae, has been mass-released for biological control in western Kansas. The influence of three different variations of the parasitoid-to-host ratio on parasitism of house fly, Musca domestica L., pupae was studied under feedlot conditions from 1993 to 1995. When a single parasitoid female was introduced to containers with varied host densities, the highest percentage of parasitization occurred at densities of 15 (1993 and 1994) and 10 (1995) puparia. When the ratio of parasitoid-to-host was changed, increasing densities from 30 to 300 for the host and from 3 to 30 for the parasitoid did not significantly affect performance of the parasitoid. Finally, parasitoid densities were varied, while host densities were held constant. Although significantly more offspring were produced as the parasitoid-to-host ratio changed from 1:5 to 1:50, the percentage parasitism actually decreased. The third measure of parasitoid activity, parasitoid-induced mortality (PIM), also was examined. In 1994, PIM did not differ significantly with the changing parasitoid-to-host ratios. However, in 1995 a direct correlation occurred between PIM and parasitoid-host-ratios. During the fly breeding season (May to October in 1994), the daily maximum temperature was correlated negatively with parasitism. Clearly, physical factors (mainly temperature) and biological factors (such as interspecific competition) are important in determining the success of mass release programs. The conflict between the efficiency and the effectiveness of biological control of filth flies using pteromalid parasitoids is discussed. 3aSpalangia nigroaenea 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apupae 3afecundity 3ahost-parasite relationships 3afeedlots 3aambient temperature 3apopulation density 3aMusca domestica 3amortality 3abiological control 0aparasites 0aparasitoid host ratio 0aparasites of insect pests 0afunctional responses 0aratios1 aGuo, Y.J.1 aChen, H.Y.0 tBiological control.g1998 May, v. 12, no. 1 p.7-13x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03120naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245023000129300001400359500001500373520169600388650002402084650002302108650002002131650001402151650001802165650001102183650002302194650002702217650001702244650001902261650001102280650002402291650001502315650001402330653001402344653002502358653002802383653002202411700002202433700002302455700001802478773007402496852000902570930003302579945001302612946001302625655001202638IND2180792020221120114257.0981103e199801  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218079202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWashburn, J.O.10aEvidence that the stilbene-derived optical brightener M2R enhances Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus infection of Trichoplusia ni and Heliothis virescens by preventing sloughing of infected midgut epithelial cells  ap. 58-69.  a2019-12-05  aPrevious reports have shown that the stilbene-derived optical brightener M2R increases mortality and hastens death of larval lepidopterans orally challenged with baculoviruses. The mechanism of viral enhancement, however, has not been elucidated. We used a reporter gene recombinant of Autographa californica MNPV (AcMNPV-hsp70/lacZ) to investigate the enhancing effects of M2R on pathogenesis, mortality and time to death in larvae of Trichoplusia ni, and Heliothis virescens inoculated as newly molted fourth instars (4(0)s) and at various hours after molting (e.g., 16 h = 4(16)). For both hosts, M2R significantly reduced the time to death by AcMNPV. In 4(0)-inoculated larvae, M2R accelerated infection of tracheal cells, but overall the effects on pathogenesis were minor, and no significant increase in mortality over controls was observed. Among infected M2R-treated 4(16) H. virescens, there were significantly more foci per insect compared to controls, and first lacZ expression was detected in the midgut epithelium at 6 h postinoculation (hpi). In contrast, no lacZ signals were detected in the midgut epithelia of control insects at any time point, and first lacZ expression was observed in the tracheal system at 14 hpi. When we compared virus-induced mortality in H. virescens inoculated at various times during the fourth instar, we found that M2R treatment enhanced mortality levels progressively for larvae inoculated later during the instar. Our results suggested that in T. ni and H. virescens, M2R enhanced AcMNPV pathogenesis by blocking the sloughing of infected primary target cells in the midgut, thereby countering developmental resistance and increasing mortality. 3amechanism of action 3aviral insecticides 3aTrichoplusia ni 3astilbenes 3aBaculoviridae 3amidgut 3abeta-galactosidase 3aAutographa californica 3apathogenesis 3areporter genes 3alarvae 3aHeliothis virescens 3aepithelium 3amortality 0aenhancers 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0arecombinant baculovirus 0avirus enhancement1 aKirkpatrick, B.A.1 aHaas-Stapleton, E.1 aVolkman, L.E.0 tBiological control.g1998 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.58-69x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02350naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012700128300001400255520131700269650001501586650001601601650002901617650002201646650002101668650001501689650003001704650002301734650001701757650002401774653002401798653002301822773007501845852000901920930003301929945001301962946001301975655001201988IND2196953420221120114225.0990212e199809  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219695342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWithers, T.M.10aInfluence of plant species on host acceptance behavior of the biocontrol agent Zygogramma bicolorata (Col.: Chrysomelidae)  ap. 55-62.  aThe parthenium leaf beetle, Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister (Chrysomelidae), is a biological control agent for parthenium weed, Parthenium hysterophorus L., in India and Australia. It generally feeds on plants within the subtribe Ambrosiinae (Asteraceae), but starvation-induced adult feeding on sunflower, Helianthus annuus L. (Asteraceae: Helianthinae), has occurred in India. Adult feeding and locomotor behavior on different host plants was investigated. Behavior on the field host parthenium weed differed significantly from that on the nonhost sunflower. Beetles on parthenium weed expressed shorter latencies to the first sample bite and to feeding, ingested continuous meals compared to only a series of bites on sunflower, and spent a higher proportion of time feeding and resting following feeding. Beetles on sunflower showed the highest locomotor activity level and shortest plant residence times. Behavior expressed on a less preferred field host Noogoora burr, Xanthium occidentale Bertol. (Ambrosiinae), was intermediate between that on parthenium weed and sunflower. On the basis of these results, Z. bicolorata can be confirmed as specific to plants within the Ambrosiinae. Behavioral observations are suggested as a useful additional tool for host specificity testing of weed biocontrol agents. 3aZygogramma 3afood plants 3aParthenium hysterophorus 3aHelianthus annuus 3afeeding behavior 3alocomotion 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3aweed control 3aXanthium strumarium 0ahost specialization 0afeeding experience0 tBiological control.g1998 Sept., v. 13, no. 1 p.55-62x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02676naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012100126300001600247500001500263520147400278650002401752650002501776650002901801650001601830650002601846650001701872650002701889650001901916650002001935650001801955653001401973653001901987653003002006653000902036700001802045700001802063700001702081773007602098852000902174930003302183945001302216946001302229655001202242IND2196565020221120103932.0990121e199807  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219656502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeden, C.J.10aIdentification of Muscidifurax spp., parasitoids of muscoid flies, by composition patterns of cuticular hydrocarbons  ap. 200-207.  a2019-12-05  aGas chromatographic analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons of Muscidifurax spp. adult females revealed species-specific patterns of composition that allowed identification of Muscidifurax raptor Girault and Sanders, Muscidifurax zaraptor Kogan and Legner, and Muscidifurax raptorellus Kogan and Legner. A total of 18 components, all C29-C37 alkanes and methylalkanes, accounted for over 90% of the total cuticular hydrocarbons for all three species. Muscidifurax zaraptor was characterized by a high ratio (11.9) of 3-MeC31:internal Me2C35's, whereas this ratio was <3 for the other species. Muscidifurax raptorellus was characterized by a low (< 1) 3-MeC31:3,7,15-Me3C37 ratio compared with ratios of 3.1 and 6.3 for these components in M. raptor and M. zaraptor, respectively. Three populations of M. raptorellus could be distinguished from one another based on two other component ratios (5- and 7-MeC31:3MeC32, 5- and 7-MeC31:3,7- to 3,15-Me2C33) with either 100% (Nebraska population) or 90% (Chilean and Peruvian populations) certainty. Comparison of M. raptor colonies established from five different locations (Florida, France, Germany, Brazil, Hungary) indicated that the hydrocarbon pattern was highly conserved in this species.

Control of stump sprouting was evaluated 1 and 2 years after treatment by the proportion of stumps with living sprouts and by the mean number of living and dead sprouts per stump. One and 2 years after treatment, biological control was comparable to chemical control in terms of frequency of sprouting and mean number of sprouts per stump, for B. papyrifera. While the two fungal isolates affected stump sprouting in B. papyrifera similarly, P. pensylvanica showed two significantly different responses, suggesting that virulence could vary among isolates of C. purpureum, particularly for less susceptible species. One year after treatment with C. purpureum, an infection analysis was performed to assess the extent of colonization within the stumps of both species. Results suggest that the extent of colonization was not related to the level of control of stump sprouting. 3aBetula papyrifera 3aPrunus pensylvanica 3astumps 3asprouting 3aChondrostereum purpureum 3abilanafos 3aglyphosate 3abiological control 3achemical control 3amycoherbicides 3aQuebec 0aefficacy 0asprout inhibition 0astump sprouting0 tBiological control.g1998 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.22-28x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02923naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245021700127300001600344500001500360520168600375650001502061650001602076650002302092650002002115650002002135650002402155650001402179650002302193650002302216653001402239653002702253653001702280653003002297700002102327700002102348773007602369852000902445930003302454945001302487946001302500655001202513IND2180675220221120103819.0981026e199803  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218067522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewer, M.J.10aAphelinus albipodus (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) and Diaeretiella rapae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) parasitism on Diuraphis noxia (Homoptera: Aphididae) infesting barley plants differing in plant resistance to aphids  ap. 255-261.  a2019-12-05  aRussian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), as a pest of small grains, has prompted research into biological control and host plant resistance. In the presence of Russian wheat aphid, leaves of a susceptible barley (Morex) are curled and chlorotic and sustain large densities of this aphid, while leaves of a resistant barley (STARS-9301B) remain flat and green and sustain fewer aphids. Might parasitism of Russian wheat aphid by Aphelinus albipodus Hayat & Fatima and Diaeretiella rapae McIntosh be affected differently by these plant types? When presented the plants separately and based on parasitism rate relative to aphid density, the larger D. rapae was more effective in parasitizing relatively high densities of aphids within curled leaves of Morex than relatively low densities of aphids on uncurled leaves of STARS-9301B. Parasitism by A. albipodus did not significantly differ among the plants. When given a choice of plants, approximately equal rates of parasitism occurred on the two plant lines for both parasitoid species, and parasitism by D. rapae was greater than A. albipodus. These data indicate that using parasitoid size as an indicator of success in a physically restricted environment may be misleading, when considered in a plant environment responsive in several manners to aphids (chlorosis, curling, and ability to sustain Russian wheat aphid). We expect that use of resistant barley will result in decreased parasitoid abundance as aphid densities decrease. However, parasitism rates are expected to be approximately equal on resistant and susceptible barley. In this system, plant resistance and biocontrol are compatible management strategies. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aDiaeretiella rapae 3aDiuraphis noxia 3aHordeum vulgare 3avarietal resistance 3aAphelinus 3apopulation density 3abiological control 0aparasites 0atritropic interactions 0ainteractions 0aparasites of insect pests1 aStruttmann, J.M.1 aMornhinweg, D.W.0 tBiological control.g1998 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.255-261x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02508naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014700129300001600276500001500292520124700307650001501554650001601569650002201585650003201607650002201639650001401661650001301675650001101688650002701699650002701726650001401753653001901767653001401786653003701800653001701837653003001854653001901884700001501903773007601918852000901994930003302003945001302036946001302049655001202062IND2180672720221120093828.0981026e199803  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218067272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKye-Poku, G.K.10aNondevelopment of Cotesia kariyai (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in Entomopoxvirus-infected larvae of Pseudaletia separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 209-216.  a2019-12-05  aInteraction between an entomopoxvirus (PsEPV) and a gregarious braconid endoparasitoid, Cotesia kariyai, in Pseudaletia separata larvae showed that infection of larvae with PsEPV was deleterious to the development and survival of C. kariyai. The survival and development of C. kariyai in PsEPV-infected P. separata larvae depended on the length of time between parasitization and viral infection. No parasitoid larvae emerged from PsEPV-infected hosts when host larvae were exposed simultaneously to parasitization and PsEPV inoculation whereas more than 80% of the hosts produced parasitoids when PsEPV was administered 5 days postparasitization. C. kariyai larvae in PsEPV-infected hosts showed a retarded development, shrank, and died about 8 days after viral exposure. Virion-free plasma from PsEPV-infected P. separata larvae was toxic to the parasitoid larvae even up to a dilution level of 32 when it was injected intrahemocoelically into the host larvae. Development of parasitoids in hosts that were simultaneously parasitized and injected with the virion-free plasm never progressed beyond the egg stage. The parasitized P. separata larvae injected with the virion-free plasma did not pupate and died within 30 days after injection. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aMythimna separata 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aApanteles kariyai 3ahemolymph 3atoxicity 3alarvae 3aecological competition 3abiological development 3amortality 0aentomopoxvirus 0aparasites 0aparasitoid pathogen interactions 0ainteractions 0aparasites of insect pests 0ainfected hosts1 aKunimi, Y.0 tBiological control.g1998 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.209-216x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02949naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013800127300001600265500001500281520149700296650002801793650001501821650001601836650001001852650001601862650001501878650002001893650002401913650003301937650002101970650001401991650002102005650002002026653002002046653002402066653001402090653002102104653002002125653001302145653002502158653003002183653001602213700001602229700001602245700001402261773007602275852000902351930003302360945001302393946001302406655001202419IND2180670720221120093838.0981026e199803  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218067072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivinski, J.14aThe bionomics of Coptera haywardi (Ogloblin) (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae) and other pupal parasitoids of tephritid fruit flies (Diptera)  ap. 193-202.  a2019-12-05  aThe endoparasitoid Coptera haywardi (Ogloblin) (Diapriidae) was discovered in Mexico attacking the pupae of the Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens (Loew). Typically, parasitoids of Diptera Cychlorrhapha pupae develop as ectoparasitoids and are generalists that attack hosts in a number of families. Aspects of the bionomics of C. haywardi were compared to those of two chalcidoid ectoparasitoids, Dirhinus himalayanus Westwood and Spalangia gemina Boucek. C. haywardi developed in three genera of Tephritidae, but not in species of other families. The two species of chalcidoids developed in all the calypterate and acalypterate hosts to which they were exposed. In an olfactometer C. haywardi preferred Anastrepha suspensa (Loew) pupae, while the chalcidoids preferred the pupae of Musca domestica L. This preference in S. gemina was diminished in insects that had been reared of A. suspensa. C. haywardi oviposited in the A. suspensa pupae that had been previously parasitized by the braconid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead). However, it completed development only in unparasitized pupae. Mortality of the primary parasitoid due to D. himalayanus was approximately two-thirds the mortality inflicted on the host fly. S. gemina did not discriminate between parasitized and unparasitized pupae of A. suspensa and developed in both. C. haywardi appears to have a more restricted host range relative to chalcidoid pupal parasitoids and this may be due to its endoparasitic development. 3ainterspecific variation 3ahost range 3aparasitoids 3apupae 3aoviposition 3aDiapriidae 3ahyperparasitism 3aAnastrepha suspensa 3aDiachasmimorpha longicaudata 3ahost specificity 3aSpalangia 3ahost preferences 3aMusca domestica 0aectoparasitoids 0aspecies differences 0aparasites 0aspalangia gemina 0aendoparasitoids 0adirhinus 0adirhinus himalayanus 0aparasites of insect pests 0aTephritidae1 aVulinec, K.1 aMenezes, E.1 aAluja, M.0 tBiological control.g1998 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.193-202x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03402naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245016600169300001400335500020500349520179500554650002002349650001002369650002002379650002802399650001402427650001602441650002102457650001602478650001302494650001202507650002702519650002002546650001402566650001002580650002402590650000902614650001502623700001902638700001902657700001902676700001802695773013502713856005402848961000902902852000902911655001202920IND60708055320221120082641.0200824s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070805532DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1266.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwen, W.

However, there is limited information regarding processed pine wood's suppressiveness to soilborne diseases. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate pine wood chips (PWC) suppressiveness to Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. 'Straight Eight') seedling growth. In Experiment 1, cucumber seeds were sown in substrates formulated to contain either 10, 20, or 30% perlite or PWC aggregates and were inoculated with no pathogen (control), 0.1 g L(‑1) Pythium ultimum, or 0.05 g L(-1) Rhizoctonia solani isolates. Fourteen-day-old cucumber seedlings were evaluated to determine disease severity. P. ultimum inoculum concentration of 0.1 g L(‑1) did not cause damping-off in substrates amended with perlite or PWC aggregates. Regardless of aggregate amendment rate, R. solani severity of damping-off was generally similar among substrates amended with perlite. In general, less disease was observed with PWC aggregates than with perlite across all amendment volumes. In Experiment 2, cucumber seedlings were sown in substrates formulated to contain either 20, 30, or 40% perlite or PWC aggregates and were inoculated with 0 (control), 1.2, 2.4, or 3.6 g L(‑1) P. ultimum isolates. Disease severity of cucumber seedlings were similar among all substrates amended with 20 to 40% PWC aggregates. In Experiment 3, cucumber seedlings were sown in substrates formulated to contain either 20, 30, or 40% perlite or PWC aggregates and were inoculated with 0 (control), 1.2 g L(‑1) of P. ultimum, or 0.05 g L(‑1) R. solani inoculum isolates. Results found potential suppressiveness of P. ultimum and R. solani when peat-based substrates were amended with PWC. 3aCucumis sativus 3aPinus 3aPythium ultimum 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3acucumbers 3adamping off 3adisease severity 3agreenhouses 3ainoculum 3aperlite 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil-borne diseases 3awood 3awood chips1 aJackson, B.

Biochar is a sustainable option as a substrate component with varying characteristics of surface area, pH, nutrient supply and water storage. Using less nutrient-rich feedstocks for biochar production has created material with high pH and abilities to neutralize acidic peat. Two different biochars were produced through gasification using pine wood chips (Pinus taeda L.) and rice hulls (Oryza sativa L.). The resulting biochars had pH values above 8.5 and were assessed as potential lime replacements by pulverizing the biochars to KLEINERDAN2 mm to create a powder-form of pine wood biochar and rice hull biochar. These pulverized biochars were amended to a pure peat substrate at rates of 1.78, 3.56, 5.34, or 7.13 kg m‑3 (3, 6, 9, or 12 lb yd(‑3)). In this pulverized form, the two biochars showed little to no effect on neutralizing the peat's acidity; after seven days the maximum substrate pH attained for both pine wood biochar and rice hull biochar was 4.1. The second study increased the amount of pulverized biochar amendments to 10.69, 12.47, or 14.25 kg m(‑3) (18, 21 or 24 lb yd‑3, respectively). Again, the substrate pH for both biochar types did not reach the recommended minimum for substrates (5.4).

Two different substrates were studied: a control mix composed of peat and perlite (80:20%, v/v) and a biochar mix, composed of peat and biochar (80:20%, v/v). To evaluate the role of biochar in the dynamic of plant available potassium, two levels of starter potassium fertilization were used (0 and 150 mg K L(‑1) substrate). A randomized trial was conducted in a commercial greenhouse, where 132 pots were filled with the control mix and with the biochar mix; then one young plant/pot of Cyclamen persicum Mill. 'Halios' was transplanted and cultivated for 150 days. Special attention was paid to the effect of biochar on potassium and other nutrients dynamic in pore water during the first phases of plant growth and in the substrate at the end of the cultivation. Cyclamen morphological properties (leaf number, plant height, flower number, fresh and dry biomass of aboveground) were surveyed at an early crop growth and at the end of the experiment. Biochar increased K, P and Mg concentrations in the pore water up to 16 days after transplanting. At 75 d, the growth of cyclamen was 30% enhanced by biochar, with statistically significant increases in fresh and dry weight. Leaf and flower numbers, and mineral content of leaves were not influenced by biochar and starter K addition. At the end of the cultivation, there was no more noticeable effect of biochar on cyclamen quality and leaf nutrient contents. Chemical analysis of the substrates showed that biochar was able to induce an increase in water extractable K (+23%) and in CAT (calcium chloride and DTPA) extractable K (+36%) in respect to control medium. Moreover, the significant interaction between biochar and starter potassium fertilization suggested that biochar can preserve potassium from leaching, being able to store potassium fertilizer in a plant available pool. These results demonstrated that biochar can be considered a good substitute for perlite in growing media, acting at the same time as a sink and a source of potassium available for plants. 3aCyclamen persicum 3aacidity 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acalcium chloride 3acation exchange capacity 3achemical analysis 3acontainer-grown plants 3afertilizer application 3aflowers 3agreenhouses 3agrowing media 3aleaching 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3apeat 3aperlite 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers1 aCrippa, L.1 aBedussi, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1266 p.35-42dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1266.6  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012500128300001600253500001500269520175900284650004502043650004702088650001302135650001502148650001602163650000802179650001602187650001102203650001302214650002402227650001302251650002302264650002002287650002102307653001102328653001602339653001702355653001802372653002002390653001702410700001802427700001602445700001802461700001702479773009202496852000902588930003302597945001302630946001102643655001202654IND2123433220221120072320.0980617e199710  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212343322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtiz, J.P.A.10aGenetic fingerprinting for determining the mode of reproducton in Paspalum notatum, a subtropical apomictic forage grass  ap. 850-856.  a2019-12-05  aPaspalum is an important genus of the family Gramineae that includes several valuable forage grasses. Many of the species are polyploid and either obligate or facultative apomicts. Cyto-embryological observations of several tetraploid genotypes of P. notatum were performed to determine their mode of reproduction. Afterwards, selfed progenies of the genotypes F131, Q3664 and Q4117 were analysed using RFLP and RAPD genetic fingerprints to identify maternal and non-maternal (aberrant) plants, and to establish the degree of apomictic reproduction. Five maize clones and six primers were used for detecting genetic deviations from the maternal profile. Maize clones umc379, umc384 and umc318 and primers OPG10 and OPI4 were the most informative for discriminating between maternal and aberrant individuals within the progenies of F 131 and Q3664. The combined results of three RFLP clones or 4-6 RAPD primers were necessary to ascertain the mode of reproduction in plants F131 and Q3664. The results obtained with the RFLP and RAPD markers were in agreement with the cyto-embryological studies in ascertaining the mode and degree of apomictic reproduction. Plant F131 showed a completely sexual reproductive behaviour, Q3664 an elevated expression of sexuality, while Q4117 was highly apomictic. A fingerprint analysis of an outcrossing population, aimed at the identification of hybrid plants, was also performed. Maize clones um318 and umc379 and primers OPC2 and OPC9 were used. The presence of specific bands belonging to the male parent permitted a rapid and easy detection of hybrids. The methodology described here can be applied both for the characterisation of P. notatum populations and to identify hybrid progenies Paspalum breeding programs. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aZea mays 3aembryo sac 3aDNA primers 3aDNA 3atetraploidy 3aclones 3aapomixis 3asexual reproduction 3agenotype 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic markers 3aPaspalum notatum 0aovules 0asegregation 0ameiotic sacs 0aplant anatomy 0aaposporous sacs 0acell biology1 aPessino, S.C.1 aLeblanc, O.1 aHayward, M.D.1 aQuarin, C.L.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1997 Oct., v. 95, no. 5/6 p.850-856x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02795naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012000128300001600248500001500264520162300279650001501902650004701917650004301964650001602007650000902023650002102032650001302053650002502066650002002091651001102111653001402122653003002136653002302166700001702189700002102206773009202227852000902319930003302328945001302361946001102374655001202385IND2123432820221120063929.0980617e199710  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212343282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaiotto, F.A.10aEstimation of outcrossing rate in a breeding population of Eucalyptus urophylla with dominant RAPD and AFLP markers  ap. 842-849.  a2019-12-05  aEucalyptus breeding is typically conducted by selection in open-pollinated progenies. As mating is controlled only on the female side of the cross, knowledge of outcrossing versus selfing rates is essential for maintaining adequate levels of genetic variability for continuous gains. Outcrossing rate in an open-pollinated breeding population of Eucalyptus urophylla was estimated by two PCR-based dominant marker technologies, RAPD and AFLP, using 11 open-pollinated progeny arrays of 24 individuals. Estimated outcrossing rates indicate predominant outcrossing and suggest maintenance of adequate genetic variability within families. The multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) estimated from RAPD markers (0.93 +/- 0.027), although in the same range, was higher (alpha > 0.01) than the estimate based on AFLP (0.89 + 0.033). Both estimates were of similar magnitude to those estimated for natural populations using isozymes. The estimated Wright's fixation index was lower than expected based on tm possibly resulting from selection against selfed seedlings when sampling plants for the study. An empirical analysis suggests that 18 is the minimum number of dominant marker loci necessary to achieve robust estimates of tm This study demonstrates the usefulness of dominant markers, both RAPD and AFLP, for estimating the outcrossing rate in breeding and natural populations of forest trees. We anticipate an increasing use of such PCR-based technologies in mating-system studies in view of their high throughput and universality of the reagents, particularly for species where isozyme systems have not yet been optimized. 3aestimation 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aoutcrossing 3aloci 3aopen pollination 3agenotype 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3agenetic markers 3aBrazil 0adominance 0apolymerase chain reaction 0amaternal genotypes1 aBramucci, M.1 aGrattapaglia, D.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1997 Oct., v. 95, no. 5/6 p.842-849x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02946naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009400130300001600224520187100240650001602111650000902127650002302136650002502159650002002184650002402204650002302228650004502251650002002296650001902316700001602335700001702351700001802368700001702386773009102403852000902494930003302503945001302536946001102549655001202560IND2080028620221120063735.0980507e199709  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND208002862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamulonis, J.P.10aDNA marker analysis of loci conferring resistance to peanut root-knot nematode in soybean  ap. 664-670.  aPeanut root-knot nematode [Meloidogyne arenaria (Neal) Chitwood] (Ma) is a serious pathogen of soybean, Glycine max L. Merrill, in the southern USA. Breeding for root-knot nematode resistance is an important objective in many plant breeding programs. The inheritance of soybean resistance to Ma is quantitative and has a moderate-to-high variance-component heritability on a family mean basis. The objectives of the present study were to use restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring resistance to Ma and to determine the genomic location and the relative contribution to resistance of each QTL. An F2 population from a cross between PI200538 (Ma resistant) and CNS' (Ma susceptible) was mapped with 130 RFLPs. The 130 markers converged on 20 linkage groups spanning a total of 1766 cM. One hundred and five F2:3 families were grown in the greenhouse and inoculated with Ma Race 2. Two QTLs conferring resistance to Ma were identified and PI200538 contributed the alleles for resistance at both QTLs. One QTL was mapped at 0-cM recombination with marker B212V-1 on linkage group-F (LG-F) of the USDA/ARS-Iowa State University RFLP map, and accounted for 32% of the variation in gall number. Another QTL was mapped in the interval from B212D-2 to A111H-2 on LG-E, and accounted for 16% of the variation in gall number. Gene action for the QTL located on LG-F was additive to partially dominant, whereas the gene action for the QTL on LG-E was dominant with respect to resistance. The two QTLs, when fixed on the framework map, accounted for 51% of the variation in gall number in a two-QTL model. The two QTLs for Ma resistance were found in duplicated regions of the soybean genome and the major QTL for Ma resistance on LG-F is positioned within a cluster of eight diverse disease-resistance loci. 3aGlycine max 3aloci 3agenetic resistance 3aMeloidogyne arenaria 3apest resistance 3aquantitative traits 3achromosome mapping 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3alinkage groups1 aLuzzi, B.M.1 aHussey, R.S.1 aParrott, W.A.1 aBoerma, H.R.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1997 Sept., v. 95, no. 4 p.664-670x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02347naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012500126300001600251500001500267520113500282650004501417650001001462650002401472650001801496650003001514650003001544650002201574650001501596650001301611651001101624653004201635653001301677700001501690700001601705700002101721700002501742773009201767852000901859930003301868945001301901946001101914655001201925IND2180765220221120053233.0981102e199803  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218076522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuijada, A.10aVariation in the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of Pinus rzedowskii revealed by PCR-RFLP  ap. 539-544.  a2019-12-05  aIn the genus Pinus the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the 5.8s region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA are approximately 3000 bp in length. ITS1 is considerably longer than ITS2 and partial sequences of ITS1 indicate that this region is evolving rapidly and exhibits intraspecific variation. The ITS2 and 5.8s regions are relatively conserved. We surveyed restriction fragment length variability of PCR-amplified fragments (PCR-RFLP) of the ITS region in four populations (86 individuals) of Pinus rzedowskii, a pine endemic to western Michoacan, Mexico. Five of the restriction endonucleases assayed revealed variation, with a total of 13 variants, most of which were length mutations of 300-900 bp. A moderate degree of population differentiation was detected. The average diversity (Shannon's index) of ITS fragment size patterns was 1.19, with 34% of the variation due to differences among populations and 66% due to differences among individuals within populations. The same individuals were assayed for nine polymorphic isozymes, which gave diversity measures similar to those of each restriction endonuclease. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aPinus 3arestriction mapping 3aribosomal DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3agenetic variation 3apopulation 3aisozymes 3aMexico 0arestriction fragment length variation 0amutation1 aListon, A.1 aDelgado, P.1 aVasquez-Lobo, A.1 aAlvarez-Buylla, E.R.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1998 Mar., v. 96, no. 3/4 p.539-544x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01844naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005000126300001600176500001500192520073100207650001500938650004700953650001501000650000901015650001401024650001401038650002301052650001301075650002001088650002601108653001901134653002301153653002701176653002701203700001701230700001701247773009201264852000901356930003301365945001301398946001101411655001201422IND2180764320221120035508.0981102e199803  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218076432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatovic, Z.10aEstimation of linkage in trisomic inheritance  ap. 513-518.  a2019-12-05  aBased on F2 families derived from selfed F1 trisomic plants we have developed a genetic model to estimate linkage relationships between pairs of loci located on the extra chromosome.

This method has been applied to an analysis of morphological, isozyme and RAPD data from faba bean (Vicia faba L.). 3aestimation 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aVicia faba 3aloci 3aequations 3atrisomics 3alinkage (genetics) 3aisozymes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic recombination 0agenetic models 0amaximum likelihood 0arecombination fraction 0ainheritance (genetics)1 aTorres, A.M.1 aCubero, J.I.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1998 Mar., v. 96, no. 3/4 p.513-518x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02402naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009800130300001600228500001500244520120000259650001901459650001401478650001201492650001501504650003701519650001301556650002501569650002001594650002201614650001901636650001901655651002001674651000901694651001101703653001001714653001501724653002001739653001101759700001601770773009201786852000901878930003301887945001301920946001101933655001201944IND2180760420221120035456.0981102e199803  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218076042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlagarswamy, G.10aPattern analysis of international sorghum multi-environment trials for grain-yield adaptation  ap. 397-405.  a2019-12-05  aPattern analysis, which consists of joint and complementary use of classification and ordination techniques, was applied to grain-yield data of 12 sorghum genotypes in 25 environments to identify the grouping of genotypes and environments. The 12 genotypes represented a wide geographical origin, different genetic diversity, and three photoperiod-sensitive classes. The 25 environments represented a super population of widely different environments covering latitudes from 20 degrees S to 45 degrees N. The knowledge of environmental and genotype grouping helped reveal several patterns of genotype x environment (GE) interaction. The existence of two mega-environments--African and Asian-- was indicated. Within these mega-environments, several subgroups were further discernible. The Asian-type subgroups of environments tended to be closer to one another, suggesting that they discriminated genotypes similarly. By contrast, the African-type sub-groups of environments were more divergent. Differential genotype adaptation patterns existed in the two mega-environments. The repeatability of the GE patterns seen in this multi-environmental trial, however, needs to be established over time. 3avariety trials 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3acrop yield 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agenotype 3astatistical analysis 3aSorghum bicolor 3agenetic variation 3abreeding lines 3aphotoperiodism 3aCentral America 3aAsia 3aAfrica 0alines 0aadaptation 0agermplasm lines 0aorigin1 aChandra, S.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1998 Mar., v. 96, no. 3/4 p.397-405x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02087naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245013300123300001600256500001500272520091300287650003101200650001801231650002401249650002401273650002201297650001601319650002001335650003001355650002001385650001001405650001301415650002501428653001301453653002801466653002501494773009201519852000901611930003301620945001301653946001101666655001201677IND2180759520221120035350.0981102e199803  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218075952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Y.10aPCR amplification of CMS-specific mitochondrial nucleotide sequences to identify cytoplasmic genotypes of onion (Allium cepa L.)  ap. 367-370.  a2019-12-05  aS-cytoplasm is the most common source of cytoplasmic-genic male sterility (CMS) used to produce hybrid onion seed. CMS determinants are thought to be on the mitochondrial (mt) genome. Although the characterization of polymorphisms in the mtDNA that distinguishes the N- and S-cytoplasms is significantly faster than test crossing, it is still time-consuming to complete RFLP analysis. I identified an unusual transcript pattern for the mitochondrial cob gene in S-cytoplasm. Sequencing of the mitochondrial cob gene revealed an insertion of chloroplast DNA sequence into the upstream region of cob in the S-cytoplasm. This region could be amplified with oligonucleotides flanking the upstream region to cob. PCR-detectable polymorphism based on differences in the sequences of the mtDNA that distinguishes N- and S-cytoplasms allows a quick and confident identification of the cytoplasm of individual plants. 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 3aopen reading frames 3amitochondrial DNA 3aAllium cepa 3achloroplast DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenetic polymorphism 0acob gene 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1998 Mar., v. 96, no. 3/4 p.367-370x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01599naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002200136245005400158300001600212520064100228592002800869653001800897653002600915653001300941653001400954700002100968700001900989700002101008700002101029773015401050856007201204852000901276655001201285IND60128998220221118015759.0151124e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012899822DNAL7 a10.2987/5738.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeccacini, Emilia10aAedes aegypti Resistance to Temephos in Argentina  ap. 608-609.  aMonitoring of resistance of Aedes aegypti to temephos was implemented in the provinces of Formosa and Misiones, Argentina, as a response to the need to improve the vigilance for the dengue vector in areas of high risk of dengue.

Deoxypodophyllotoxin (4) was identified in the extract as an outstanding antiproliferative compound, and five diterpenes (1–3, 5, and 6) were isolated as known compounds with weak or no cytotoxicity. These compounds were examined for their respective apoptosis- and differentiation-inducing activities toward HL-60 cells by DNA fragmentation and NBT-reducing assays, respectively. Among them, 7α-hydroxysandaracopimaric acid (6) was found to have a potent differentiation-inducing activity in a dose-dependent manner at 0.125–2 μg/ml (0.39–6.29 μM), together with apoptosis-inducing activity at concentrations of more than 2.5 μg/ml (7.86 μM). Deoxypodophyllotoxin (4) that exerted cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing activities at 2 ng/ml (5 nM) did not induce differentiation at the same concentration, and the other diterpenes (1–3 and 5) showed no effect on cell differentiation, even at 5 μg/ml. It was thus demonstrated for the first time that 7α-hydroxysandaracopimaric acid was an effective differentiation-inducing compound toward HL-60 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aJuniperus 3abiotechnology 3acell differentiation 3achloroform 3acytotoxicity 3aditerpenoids 3adose response 3ahumans 3aleukemia 0a7α-hydroxysandaracopimaric acid 0adeoxypodophyllotoxin 0adifferentiation 0aHL-60 cell 0aJuniperus taxifolia1 aTOMOKUNI, Tatsuru1 aHARAMOTO, Mari1 aTATEMOTO, Hideki1 aNAKANISHI, Tsutomu1 aINATOMI, Yuka1 aMurata, Hiroko,1 aINADA, Akira0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2008 Feb. 23, v. 72, no. 2 p.477-484dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.705703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245012400175500002200299520144900321592002801770650001101798650001001809650002401819650002601843650001401869650001201883650002201895650001101917650001001928650001301938650001501951650002201966650001401988653004202002653003802044653001302082653001302095653001902108700002002127700001902147700001802166700001802184700002002202700001702222700002002239700001802259700002302277700001902300700002002319773007602339856008802415852000902503655001202512IND60584403920221122055920.0171024s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058440392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorimitsu, Suguru10aSex assessment based on clavicular measurements in a modern Japanese population using multidetector computed tomography  aPre-press version  aAccurate sex estimation from unknown human remains is crucial as an integral and foremost step toward individual identification. The aims of this study were to assess sexual dimorphism of the clavicle and develop discriminant equations for sex estimation in a modern adult Japanese population based on clavicular measurements using three-dimensional (3D) computed tomographic (CT) images. A total of 300 cadavers (150 males, 150 females) of known age and sex that underwent postmortem CT and subsequent forensic autopsy were obtained. Four measurements were performed using 3D CT reconstructed images that extracted only bones based on the CT values, as follows: the linear distances between the medial superior margins of the left and right sternal facets to the lateral points of the left and right acromial ends, and the linear distances between the medial superior margins of the left and right sternal facets to the tips of the left and right conoid tubercles. The mean values of all measurements were significantly greater for male subjects than female subjects. Univariate discriminant function analysis (DFA) provided correct sex prediction rates of 88.3–92.2%. Stepwise DFA for the left and right clavicles yielded sex classification accuracy rates of 92.2% and 91.0%, respectively. In conclusion, clavicular measurements using 3D CT images of a contemporary Japanese population may be useful for sex estimation in forensic contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abones 3acomputed tomography 3adiscriminant analysis 3aequations 3afemales 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3amales 3anecropsy 3aprediction 3asexual dimorphism 3ashoulders 0aForensic anthropology population data 0aMultidetector computed tomography 0aClavicle 0aJapanese 0aSex estimation1 aMakino, Yohsuke1 aSaitoh, Hisako1 aSakuma, Ayaka1 aIshii, Namiko1 aYajima, Daisuke1 aInokuchi, Go1 aMotomura, Ayumi1 aChiba, Fumiko1 aYamaguchi, Rutsuko1 aHoshioka, Yumi1 aIwase, Hirotaro0 tForensic science international.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013800161300001600299520172700315592002802042650003102070650001002101650002102111650001902132650002002151650001102171650000702182650001502189650001802204650001602222650001502238650002002253650001502273653002802288653002602316653002502342653000802367700001702375700002102392700001602413700001502429700001902444700001702463700002102480773012502501856008302626852000902709655001202718IND60597100020221120061323.0191231e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059710002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan10aZirconium-based metal organic frameworks loaded on polyurethane foam membrane for simultaneous removal of dyes with different charges  ap. 267-279.  aTreating dye wastewater by membrane filtration technology has received much attention from researchers all over the world, however, current studies mainly focused on the removal of singly charged dyes but actual wastewater usually contains dyes with different charges. In this study, the removal of neutral, cationic and anionic dyes in binary or ternary systems was conducted by using zirconium-based metal organic frameworks loaded on polyurethane foam (Zr-MOFs-PUF) membrane. The Zr-MOFs-PUF membrane was fabricated by an in-situ hydrothermal synthesis approach and a hot-pressing process. Neutrally charged Rhodamine B (RB), positively charged Methylene blue (MB), and negatively charged Congo red (CR) were chosen as model pollutants for investigating filtration performance of the membrane. The results of filtration experiments showed that the Zr-MOFs-PUF membrane could simultaneously remove RB, MB, and CR not only from their binary system including RB/MB, RB/CR, and MB/CR mixtures, but also from RB/MB/CR ternary system. The removal of dyes by Zr-MOFs-PUF membrane was mainly attributed to the electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bond interaction, and Lewis acid-base interactions between the membrane and dye molecules. The maximum removal efficiencies by Zr-MOFs-PUF membrane were 98.80% for RB at pH ≈ 7, 97.57% for MB at pH ≈ 9, and 87.39% for CR at pH ≈ 3. Additionally, when the NaCl concentration reached 0.5 mol/L in single dye solutions, the removal efficiencies of RB, MB, and CR by Zr-MOFs-PUF membrane were 93.08%, 79.52%, and 97.82%, respectively. All the results suggested that the as-prepared Zr-MOFs-PUF membrane has great potential in practical treatment of dye wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afoams 3ahydrogen bonding 3amethylene blue 3amicrofiltration 3amodels 3apH 3apollutants 3apolyurethanes 3aresearchers 3arhodamines 3asodium chloride 3awastewater 0aMetal organic framework 0aPolyurethane membrane 0aWastewater treatment 0aDye1 aGong, Ji-Lai1 aZeng, Guang-Ming1 aZhang, Peng1 aSong, Biao1 aCao, Wei-Cheng1 aLiu, Hong-Yu1 aHuan, Shuang-Yan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 527 p.267-279dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137100002400155245011200179300001400291520113800305592002801443650002501471650001201496650001101508650001401519650001501533650002001548650001001568700002901578700002401607700001901631700002001650773009201670856009101762852000901853655001201862IND4479694620221119074941.0141110e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447969462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2012.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Phillip C.10aCutting energy characteristics of Miscanthus x giganteus stems with varying oblique angle and cutting speed  ap. 42-48.  aPrevious studies highlighted the need to develop efficient harvesting and size reduction equipment for miscanthus. This study investigated the effect of blade oblique angles and cutting speeds on cutting energy. Cutting blade speed, before and after severing a single miscanthus stem, was used to calculate the cutting energy. The cutting energy was determined at three oblique angles and three cutting speeds. A 60Â° oblique angle cut required the least energy to cut miscanthus stems averaging about 7.6Â J whilst a 30Â° oblique cut averaged 8.7Â J and a straight cut averaged 10.1Â J. In general, the 60Â° oblique cut performed best since it required average lowest specific energy (energy per unit of stem diameter) of 741.9Â JÂ mâ»Â¹ at an average cutting speed of 12.9Â mÂ sâ»Â¹. The specific cutting energy was directly proportional to the cutting speed and cutting energy was proportional to the stem diameter. The results indicate that optimisation of cutting speed and blade oblique angle will result in significant energy savings and increased efficiency of miscanthus harvesting machinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus giganteus 3acutting 3aenergy 3aequipment 3aharvesting 3aspecific energy 3astems1 aClementson, Clairmont L.1 aMathanker, Sunil K.1 aGrift, Tony E.1 aHansen, Alan C.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2012 May, v. 112, no. 1 p.42-48dElsevier Ltdx1537-51107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2012.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245012500169500001900294520134300313592002801656650001201684650001501696650001601711650001401727650001701741650001301758650001901771650001701790650001701807650001101824650001701835650001101852650001001863650001201873650001201885651001301897653001601910653001501926653001401941653001301955653001701968653002001985653002302005653002102028700002002049700002402069700002502093773011102118856007602229852000902305655001202314IND60728566320221120211432.0210308e20160509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072856632DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.4.e88302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkvarla, Michael Joseph10aTerrestrial arthropods of Steel Creek, Buffalo National River, Arkansas.

In vitro studies were reported that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) could inhibit the microglia-associated inflammation in response to lipopolysaccharide and our previous study indicated that mGluR5 was expressed in activated microglia following TBI. However, there is little known about whether mGluR5 activation can provide neuro-protection and reduce microglia-associated neuro-inflammation in rats after TBI. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of mGluR5 activation with selective agonist CHPG, on cerebral edema, neuronal degeneration, microglia activation and the releasing of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in a rat model of TBI. Rats were randomly distributed into various subgroups undergoing the sham surgery or TBI procedures, and 250nmol of CHPG or equal volume vehicle was given through intracerebroventricular injection at 30min post-TBI. All rats were sacrificed at 24h after TBI for the further measurements. Our data indicated that post-TBI treatment with CHPG could significantly reduce the secondary brain injury characterized by the cerebral edema and neuronal degeneration, lead to the inhibition of microglia activation and decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both mRNA transcription and protein synthesis. These results provide the substantial evidence that activation of mGluR5 reduces the secondary brain injury after TBI, in part, through modulating microglia-associated neuro-inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aanimal models 3abrain 3acytokines 3aedema 3aglutamic acid 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3amessenger RNA 3aneuroglia 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asurgery 0aTraumatic brain injury 0aMetabotropic glutamate receptor 5 0aInflammation1 aWang, Han-Dong1 aCong, Zi-Xiang1 aZhang, Xiang-Sheng1 aZhou, Xiao-Ming1 aZhang, Ding-Ding0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 430 p.1016-1021dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001700185245008500202300001600287506007600303520095800379592002801337506003701365650002701402650002201429650001201451650001001463650003101473700002001504700001801524700001801542773012901560856007801689852000901767655001201776IND60649251520221207104247.0190703e20140617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064925152DNAL7 a10.3390/insects50203992doi7 aPMC45925972pmcid7 a264626912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeisig, Nina10aResponses to Pheromones in a Complex Odor World: Sensory Processing and Behavior  ap. 399-422.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInsects communicating with pheromones, be it sex- or aggregation pheromones, are confronted with an olfactory environment rich in a diversity of volatile organic compounds of which plants are the main releaser. Certain of these volatiles can represent behaviorally relevant information, such as indications about host- or non-host plants; others will provide essentially a rich odor background out of which the behaviorally relevant information needs to be extracted. In an attempt to disentangle mechanisms of pheromone communication in a rich olfactory environment, which might underlie interactions between intraspecific signals and a background, we will summarize recent literature on pheromone/plant volatile interactions. Starting from molecular mechanisms, describing the peripheral detection and central nervous integration of pheromone-plant volatile mixtures, we will end with behavioral output in response to such mixtures and its plasticity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaggregation pheromones 3ainformation needs 3ainsects 3aodors 3avolatile organic compounds1 aDupuy, Fabienne1 aAnton, Sylvia1 aRenou, Michel0 tInsects.g2014 June 17, v. 5, no. 2 p.399-422dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects50203993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011200161300001800273520165300291592002801944650001901972650001901991650001702010650001102027650001302038650003002051650001402081650001902095700002102114700002002135700001902155700002202174700001902196700002302215700002202238700002302260700001902283700001902302700002002321700002202341773013402363856007502497852000902572655001202581IND60779438520221121063723.0220608e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943852DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cs01079k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatenet, Marian10aWater electrolysis: from textbook knowledge to the latest scientific strategies and industrial developments  ap. 4583-4762.  aReplacing fossil fuels with energy sources and carriers that are sustainable, environmentally benign, and affordable is amongst the most pressing challenges for future socio-economic development. To that goal, hydrogen is presumed to be the most promising energy carrier. Electrocatalytic water splitting, if driven by green electricity, would provide hydrogen with minimal CO₂ footprint. The viability of water electrolysis still hinges on the availability of durable earth-abundant electrocatalyst materials and the overall process efficiency. This review spans from the fundamentals of electrocatalytically initiated water splitting to the very latest scientific findings from university and institutional research, also covering specifications and special features of the current industrial processes and those processes currently being tested in large-scale applications. Recently developed strategies are described for the optimisation and discovery of active and durable materials for electrodes that ever-increasingly harness first-principles calculations and machine learning. In addition, a technoeconomic analysis of water electrolysis is included that allows an assessment of the extent to which a large-scale implementation of water splitting can help to combat climate change. This review article is intended to cross-pollinate and strengthen efforts from fundamental understanding to technical implementation and to improve the ‘junctions’ between the field's physical chemists, materials scientists and engineers, as well as stimulate much-needed exchange among these groups on challenges encountered in the different domains.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3asocioeconomic development 3aviability 3awater analysis1 aPollet, Bruno G.1 aDekel, Dario R.1 aDionigi, Fabio1 aDeseure, Jonathan1 aMillet, Pierre1 aBraatz, Richard D.1 aBazant, Martin Z.1 aEikerling, Michael1 aStaffell, Iain1 aBalcombe, Paul1 aShao-Horn, Yang1 aSchäfer, Helmut,0 tChemical Society reviews.g2022 June 6, v. 51, no. 11 p.4583-4762dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs01079k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012000206300001800326520168900344592002802033650002302061650001802084650002202102650001602124650002002140650001102160650001702171650001002188650001302198650001602211650001502227650001302242650001402255650000902269650001002278650001802288650002602306650001302332650002402345650000902369650001602378650001602394650000902410651001202419653002502431653002902456653002202485653001902507653001902526653000902545700001902554700002402573700001402597700002102611700002702632700002402659773008502683856008202768852000902850655001202859IND60570981720221119034215.0170709e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057098172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2016.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGesquiere, Ina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1891-388X10aMicronutrient intake, from diet and supplements, and association with status markers in pre- and post-RYGB patients  ap. 1175-1181.  aRoux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is associated with an increased risk for micronutrient deficiencies. This study aimed to assess total (dietary and supplement) intake and association with iron (including hepcidin), vitamin B12, vitamin C and zinc status markers before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).This prospective study included patients with a planned RYGB in University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium; who were followed until 12 months post-RYGB. Patients completed an estimated dietary record of two non-consecutive days before and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-RYGB and supplement/drug use was registered. Associations between total micronutrient intake and status markers were analyzed.Fifty-four patients (21 males; mean age: 48.0 [95%CI 46.6; 49.3] years; mean preoperative BMI: 40.4 [95%CI 39.4; 41.4] kg/m2) were included. One month post-RYGB, usual dietary intake of the studied micronutrients was significantly decreased compared to pre-RYGB, but gradually increased until 12 months post-RYGB, remaining below baseline values. By including micronutrient supplement intake, 12 months post-RYGB values were higher than baseline, except for zinc. Hemoglobin, ferritin, vitamin B12 and C-reactive protein serum concentrations were significantly decreased and transferrin saturation and mean corpuscular volume were significantly increased 12 months post-RYGB. Serum hepcidin concentration was significantly decreased 6 months post-RYGB.Medical nutritional therapy is essential following RYGB as dietary intake of iron, vitamin B12, vitamin C, copper and zinc was markedly decreased postoperatively and some patients still had an inadequate total intake one year post-RYGB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aascorbic acid 3abariatric surgery 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acopper 3adiet therapy 3adrugs 3aferritin 3afood intake 3ahemoglobin 3ahepcidin 3ahospitals 3airon 3amales 3anormal values 3anutrient deficiencies 3apatients 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3atransferrin 3avitamin B12 3azinc 3aBelgium 0aMicronutrient status 0aRoux-en-Y gastric bypass 0aBariatric surgery 0aDietary intake 0aSupplement use 0aIron1 aFoulon, Veerle1 aAugustijns, Patrick1 aGils, Ann1 aLannoo, Matthias1 aVan der Schueren, Bart1 aMatthys, Christophe0 tClinical nutrition.g2017 Aug., v. 36 p.1175-1181dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2016.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011700177300001600294520122900310592002801539650001501567650000901582650001301591650001201604650001301616650001601629650001201645650001101657653000801668653002901676653001901705653001801724653003601742700005701778700001901835773011401854856008501968852000902053655001202062IND60607584420221121102058.0180731e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060758442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddai, Emmanuel Kwasi10aExperimental investigation on the minimum ignition temperature of hybrid mixtures of dusts and gases or solvents  ap. 314-326.  aInvestigations on the minimum ignition temperatures (MIT) of hybrid mixtures of dusts with gases or solvents were performed in the modified Godbert–Greenwald (GG) furnace. Five combustible dusts and six flammable gases (three ideal and three real) were used. The test protocol was according to EN 50281-2-1 for dust–air mixtures whereas in the case of gases, solvents and hybrid mixtures this standard was used with slight modification. The experimental results demonstrated a significant decrease of the MIT of gas, solvent or dust and an increase in the likelihood of explosion when a small amount of dust, which was either below the minimum explosion concentration or not ignitable by itself, was mixed with gas and vice versa. For example, the MIT of toluene decreased from 540°C to 455°C when small amount of lycopodium was added. It was also confirmed that a hybrid mixture explosion is possible even when both dust and vapour or gas concentrations are respectively lower than their minimum explosion concentration (MEC) and lower explosion limit (LEL). Another example is CN4, the MEC of which of 304g/m³ decreased to 37g/m³ when propane was added, even though the concentrations of the gas was below its LEL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycopodium 3adust 3afurnaces 3apropane 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atoluene 3avapors 0aMIT 0aHybrid mixture explosion 0aDust explosion 0aGas explosion 0aMIT of hybrid mixture explosion1 aGabel, Dieter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3814-09601 aKrause, Ulrich0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 301 p.314-326dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008500166300001600251520139300267592002801660650002501688650001101713650001901724650002501743650001201768650001901780650001301799650001201812650002101824650001501845650001101860650002501871650001301896650001101909650001801920650002001938650001501958651001801973653001801991653001902009653002402028653001202052700002802064700002602092773012202118856008202240852000902322655001202331IND60130020220221120131204.0151126e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013002022DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-10-00191.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRitten, John P.10aProfitability of Carbon Sequestration in Western Rangelands of the United States  ap. 340-350.  aConcerns over climate change have increased interest in carbon sequestration in agricultural lands. While the per-hectare carbon capture potential of rangelands is less than either cropland or forests, existing research suggests modest changes in carbon storage on rangelands can potentially alter the global carbon cycle. This paper examines the potential firm-level revenues from voluntary carbon offset programs, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) Rangeland Soil Carbon Offset program. We estimate revenues for short-term voluntary offsets given historical prices and prices projected with potential cap-and-trade legislation. We also estimate revenues assuming 100-yr offsets are required to meet international sequestration standards. Simulation results indicate a relatively wide range of modest revenues from recent CCX contracts and carbon prices. The analysis suggests that recent carbon prices or low-end projected prices from cap-and-trade legislation are not likely to encourage producer participation. Medium and high carbon price projections for cap-and-trade legislation may make carbon sequestration a more attractive option for rangeland managers, but given potential requirements for projects to meet international guidelines for greenhouse gas offset projects, many issues remain before range managers may be interested in carbon sequestration as an enterprise.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acropland 3aforests 3agreenhouse gases 3aguidelines 3aincome 3alaws and regulations 3amanagers 3aprices 3aprofitability 3arangeland soils 3arangelands 3aUnited States 0acap-and-trade 0acarbon storage 0aeconomic incentives 0arevenue1 aBastian, Christopher T.1 aRashford, Benjamin S.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2012 July, v. 65, no. 4 p.340-350dthe Society for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2FREM-D-10-00191.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245009400209300001600303506007600319520147100395592002801866596004501894506003701939650001201976650001801988650002902006650002702035650001202062650002802074650001802102700001302120700002302133700002002156773010402176856008202280852000902362655001202371IND60486047120221207101655.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-015-2134-72doi7 aPMC47529652pmcid7 a266607602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHancock, Chad N.10aCo-regulation of mitochondrial respiration by proline dehydrogenase/oxidase and succinate  ap. 859-872.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProline dehydrogenase/oxidase (PRODH/POX) is a mitochondrial protein critical to multiple stress pathways. Because of the roles of PRODH/POX in signaling, and its shared localization to the mitochondrial inner membrane with the electron transport chain (ETC), we investigated whether there was a direct relationship between PRODH/POX and regulation of the ETC. We found that PRODH/POX binds directly to CoQ1 and that CoQ1-dependent PRODH/POX activity required functional Complex III and Complex IV. PRODH/POX supported respiration in living cells during nutrient stress; however, expression of PRODH/POX resulted in an overall decrease in respiratory fitness. Effects on respiratory fitness were inhibited by DHP and NAC, indicating that these effects were mediated by PRODH/POX-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. PRODH/POX expression resulted in a dose-dependent down-regulation of Complexes I–IV of the ETC, and this effect was also mitigated by the addition of DHP and NAC. We found that succinate was an uncompetitive inhibitor of PRODH/POX activity, inhibited ROS generation by PRODH/POX, and alleviated PRODH/POX effects on respiratory fitness. The findings demonstrate novel cross-talk between proline and succinate respiration in vivo and provide mechanistic insights into observations from previous animal studies. Our results suggest a potential regulatory loop between PRODH/POX and succinate in regulation of mitochondrial respiration.  aPublisher supplied data  aIntramuralcNational Institues of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3adose response 3aelectron transport chain 3amitochondrial membrane 3aproline 3areactive oxygen species 3asuccinic acid1 aLiu, Wei1 aAlvord, W.

Naturally derived macromolecules (e.g., proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and polyphenols) have increasingly found use as fundamental building blocks for nanostructured particles as their advantageous properties, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, inherent bioactivity, and diverse chemical properties make them suitable for advanced therapeutic applications. This review provides a timely and comprehensive summary of the use of a broad range of natural building blocks in the rapidly developing field of advanced therapeutics with insights specific to nanostructured particles. We focus on an up-to-date overview of the assembly of nanostructured particles using natural building blocks and summarize their key scientific and preclinical milestones for advanced therapies, including adoptive cell therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, active targeted drug delivery, photoacoustic therapy and imaging, photothermal therapy, and combinational therapy. A cross-comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of different natural building blocks are highlighted to elucidate the key design principles for such bio-derived nanoparticles toward improving their performance and adoption. Current challenges and future research directions are also discussed, which will accelerate our understanding of designing, engineering, and applying nanostructured particles for advanced therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3adrugs 3aenergy conversion 3agene therapy 3aimmune system 3aimmunotherapy 3aphotons 3aphotothermotherapy 3apolyphenols 3apolysaccharides 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLiao, Haotian1 aRichardson, Joseph J.1 aGuo, Junling1 aCaruso, Frank0 tChemical Society reviews.g2022 June 6, v. 51, no. 11 p.4287-4336dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cs00343g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245008800202300002000290520112700310592002801437650001401465650001101479650001301490650001901503650003301522700006301555773017301618856008001791852000901871655001201880IND60649251920221119152943.0190703e20190214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064925192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b044912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhenyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3624-608012aA Dynamic Response Surface Model for Polymer Grade Transitions in Industrial Plants  ap. 11187-11198.  aThe dynamic response surface methodology (DRSM) has recently been applied to accurately model the dynamics of polymer grade transitions (Wang and Georgakis, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.2017, 56, 10770−10782). Following this publication, we propose here two methodological improvements that greatly reduce the required number of experiments and still achieve similar model accuracy. First, a novel design of the experiments is defined to combine the previously separate input domains incorporating transitions that increase and decrease a measure of polymer grade. This enables use of a single DRSM model, instead of the prior two separate ones, and reduces the number of experiments by half. Furthermore, a sequential modeling strategy is proposed, appending experiments to an initial simpler design to estimate a more complex DRSM model. As the desired DRSM model complexity is not known a priori, the sequential modeling strategy is critical in achieving the desired model accuracy with the minimum number of experiments. These methodological advances have been tested against an academic and an industrial process simulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3amodels 3apolymers 3aprocess design 3aresponse surface methodology1 aGeorgakis, Christos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9895-85640 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Feb. 14, v. 58, no. 26 p.11187-11198dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b044913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300001600295520146400311592002801775650001801803650001601821650001001837650002801847650001801875650001501893650002301908650002101931650002801952650002901980650002602009650001302035653000802048653000902056653001002065653001502075653001702090653003302107700002202140700002102162700002102183700002202204700002302226700002002249773012102269856008202390852000902472655001202481IND60089691620221120030918.0160728e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008969162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKume, Kenichi14aThe transcription factor Snail enhanced the degradation of E-cadherin and desmoglein 2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells  ap. 889-894.  aEpithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in the tumor metastatic cascade, is characterized by the loss of cell–cell junctions and cell polarity as well as the acquisition of migratory and invasive properties. However, the precise molecular events that initiate this complex EMT process are poorly understood. Snail is a regulator of EMT that represses E-cadherin transcription through its interaction with proximal E-boxes in the promoter region of target genes. To investigate the role of Snail in EMT, we generated stable Snail transfectants using the oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC-4 (Snail/HSC-4). Snail/HSC-4 cells had a spindle-shaped mesenchymal morphology, and enhanced migration and invasiveness relative to control cells. Consistent with these EMT changes, the downregulation of epithelial marker proteins, E-cadherin and desmoglein 2, and the upregulation of mesenchymal marker proteins, vimentin and N-cadherin were detected. Despite these observations, the mRNA levels of E-cadherin and desmoglein 2 did not decrease significantly. Although E-cadherin and desmoglein 2 proteins were stable in parental HSC-4 cells, these proteins were rapidly degraded in Snail/HSC-4 cells. The degradation of E-cadherin, but not desmoglein 2, was inhibited by dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Therefore, in HSC-4 cells Snail regulates levels of these proteins both transcriptionally and post-translationally.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell polarity 3aendocytosis 3agenes 3aintercellular junctions 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3amigratory behavior 3apromoter regions 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3avimentin 0aEMT 0aOSCC 0aSnail 0aE-cadherin 0aDesmoglein 2 0aOral squamous cell carcinoma1 aHaraguchi, Misako1 aHijioka, Hiroshi1 aIshida, Takayuki1 aMiyawaki, Akihiko1 aNakamura, Norifumi1 aOzawa, Masayuki0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 430 p.889-894dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03866naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015300165500002200318520202400340592002802364650004102392650001302433650001602446650000802462650001202470650001902482650002002501650001602521650002302537650002102560650002102581650002002602650001102622650001602633650002302649650001702672651001002689653002602699653001302725653002602738653002702764653002202791700001402813700001702827700001402844700001502858700001502873700001502888700002002903700001902923700001802942700001702960700002502977700001503002773013803017856005103155961001303206852000903219655001203228IND60795453920221121223617.0221004e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079545392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2022.1074082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xinlin10aEffects of global climate change on the hydrological cycle and crop growth under heavily irrigated management - A comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP6  aPre-press version  aQuantifying the impact of global climate change on the water cycle and crop production is essential for water resource management and agricultural production planning. This study compared multiple GCM (General Circulation Model) projections of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5) and CMIP6 and further used the selected GCMs to quantify the impact of future climate change on hydrology and crop production under intensive irrigation management in the North China Plain using an improved SWAT model (SWAT-MAD). Taylor’s skill score was used firstly to screen out six groups of GCMs with better simulation performance from 10 pairs of homologous GCMs of CMIP5 and CMIP6. The selected GCMs of CMIP5 and CMIP6 were further used to drive SWAT-MAD for a robust evaluation of climate change impacts. Results showed that during winter wheat growing season, average actual evapotranspiration (ETₐ) increased by 3%, 3%, 4%, and 5%, respectively, under 2041-2070 RCP4.5, 2041-2070 SSP2-4.5, 2041-2100 RCP4.5, and 2071-2100 SSP2-4.5 scenarios, compared to the historical period (1971-2000). During summer maize growing season, those changes in ETₐ were 4%, 2%, -0.2%, and -3%. Predicted future precipitation, air temperatures, and surface runoff could increase, while irrigation could decrease as precipitation increased. The dynamic patterns of leaf area index of winter wheat and summer maize indicated that there is a tendency for early emergence and maturity of both crops in the future, and the daily total biomass elevated with a corresponding increase in final yields. The highest increases in yields of winter wheat and summer maize were 18.9% and 16.7%. The findings not only contribute to enhancing the confidence of future projections using CMIP6 but also facilitate our understanding of the relative uncertainty of GCMs. This study provides technical and data support for pre-selections of GCMs and decision making in best management practices for groundwater conservation and agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aZea mays 3aagriculture 3aair 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3aelectronics 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic cycle 3airrigation rates 3aleaf area index 3arunoff 3auncertainty 3awater conservation 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aHydrological modeling 0aSWAT-MAD 0aFuture climate change 0aDouble-cropping system 0aIrrigated farming1 aTan, Lili1 aLi, Yingxuan1 aQi, Junyu1 aFeng, Puyu1 aLi, Baoguo1 aLi Liu, De1 aZhang, Xueliang1 aMarek, Gray W.1 aZhang, Yingqi1 aLiu, Haipeng1 aSrinivasan, Raghavan1 aChen, Yong0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Sept. 22,  p.107408-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.107408  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013500164300001600299520142700315592002801742650001801770650003601788650001401824650001901838650001501857650001601872650001501888650001501903650001801918650000901936650001101945650001701956650002001973653000901993653000802002653000802010653001102018653001702029653003602046653000902082653003102091700002202122700002102144700002302165700002102188773012102209856008202330852000902412655001202421IND60089691720221117180335.0160728e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008969172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jaemin10aEnhancement of CGRP sensory afferent innervation in the gut during the development of food allergy in an experimental murine model  ap. 895-900.  aRecent advances in neuroscience and immunology have revealed a bidirectional interaction between the nervous and immune systems. Therefore, the gastrointestinal tract may be modulated by neuro–immune interactions, but little information about this interaction is available. Intrinsic and extrinsic primary afferent neurons play an important role in this interaction because of their abilities to sense, process and transmit various information in the intestinal microenvironment. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is exclusively contained in intrinsic and extrinsic primary afferent neurons in the mouse intestine. Therefore, we investigated CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the colonic mucosa of mice induced to develop food allergy. CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers were specifically increased with the development of food allergy, and the fibers were juxtaposed to mucosal mast cells in the colonic mucosa of food allergy mice. Denervation of the extrinsic afferent neurons using neonatal capsaicin treatment did not affect the development of food allergy or the density and distribution of CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the colonic mucosa of food allergy mice. Furthermore, the mRNA and plasma level of CGRP was increased in food allergy mice. These results suggest that the activation of intrinsic primary afferent neurons in the intestine contributes to the development and pathology of food allergy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acalcitonin gene-related peptide 3acapsaicin 3afood allergies 3aimmunology 3ainnervation 3aintestines 3amast cells 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amucosa 3anerve fibers 3asensory neurons 0aCGRP 0aNGF 0aOVA 0amMCP-1 0aFood allergy 0aCalcitonin gene-related peptide 0aCGRP 0aNeuro–immune interaction1 aYamamoto, Takeshi1 aHayashi, Shusaku1 aKuramoto, Hirofumi1 aKadowaki, Makoto0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 430 p.895-900dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245005400153300001800207520189700225592002802122650001402150650002302164650002102187650001502208650001702223650001102240650001102251650001402262650001602276700001302292700001102305700001802316700001402334700001402348700001402362773013402376856007502510852000902585655001202594IND60779439020221121063759.0220608e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943902DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cs00948f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying10aEther-based electrolytes for sodium ion batteries  ap. 4484-4536.  aSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered to be strong candidates for large-scale energy storage with the benefits of cost-effectiveness and sodium abundance. Reliable electrolytes, as ionic conductors that regulate the electrochemical reaction behavior and the nature of the interface and electrode, are indispensable in the development of advanced SIBs with high Coulombic efficiency, stable cycling performance and high rate capability. Conventional carbonate-based electrolytes encounter numerous obstacles for their wide application in SIBs due to the formation of a dissolvable, continuous-thickening solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and inferior stability with electrodes. Comparatively, ether-based electrolytes (EBEs) are emerging in the secondary battery field with fascinating properties to improve the performance of batteries, especially SIBs. Their stable solvation structure enables highly reversible solvent-co-intercalation reactions and the formation of a thin and stable SEI. However, although EBEs can provide more stable cycling and rapid sodiation kinetics in electrodes, benefitting from their favorable electrolyte/electrode interactions such as chemical compatibility and good wettability, their special chemistry is still being investigated and puzzling. In this review, we provide a thorough and comprehensive overview on the developmental history, fundamental characteristics, superiorities and mechanisms of EBEs, together with their advances in other battery systems. Notably, the relation among electrolyte science, interfacial chemistry and electrochemical performance is highlighted, which is of great significance for the in-depth understanding of battery chemistry. Finally, future perspectives and potential directions are proposed to navigate the design and optimization of electrolytes and electrolyte/electrode interfaces for advanced batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3asodium 3asolvation 3awettability1 aWu, Feng1 aLi, Yu1 aLiu, Mingquan1 aFeng, Xin1 aBai, Ying1 aWu, Chuan0 tChemical Society reviews.g2022 June 6, v. 51, no. 11 p.4484-4536dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cs00948f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010400175300001600279520139600295592002801691650004401719650001501763650002101778650002101799650001401820650002301834650003701857650001501894650002301909650001801932650000901950650001301959650001901972650001401991650003302005653002402038653001902062653001902081653002302100700001902123700001802142773011402160856008502274852000902359655001202368IND60607585020221116142740.0180731e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060758502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Hammouda, Samia10aChemical oxidation of a malodorous compound, indole, using iron entrapped in calcium alginate beads  ap. 350-361.  aIron-alginate beads (Fe-ABs) were successfully prepared by the ion-gelation method, and applied as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts for the removal of a malodorous compound ‘indole’. Similarly, copper-enriched alginate beads (Cu-ABs) were synthesized and tested as like-Fenton catalyst, however, their application proved not to be effective for this purpose. Fe-ABs catalysts were characterized by FTIR, SEM, EDS and AAS spectroscopy.Results pointed out that the parameters affecting Fenton catalysis must be carefully chosen to avoid excessive iron release. Under optimal conditions, complete indole removal and considerably high reduction of TOC, without significant leaching was achieved. Indole decay followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics. The absolute rate constant for indole hydroxylation was 3.59×10⁹M⁻¹s⁻¹, as determined by the competition kinetics method.Four reaction intermediates (Isatin, Dioxindole, Oxindole and Anthralinic acid) were identified by ULC/MS/MS analysis. Short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids like formic, acetic, oxalic, maleic, oxamic and pyruvic acids were identified by ion exclusion chromatography and as end-products. Based on the identified by-products, a plausible mineralization pathway was proposed. Moreover, the catalyst was recovered quantitatively by simple filtration and reused for several times without significant loss of activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abyproducts 3acalcium alginate 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afiltration 3agel chromatography 3ahydroxylation 3airon 3aleaching 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aMalodorous compound 0aAlginate beads 0aFenton process 0aSupported catalyst1 aAdhoum, Nafaâ1 aMonser, Lotfi0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 301 p.350-361dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245016200162520126800324592002801592650001701620650001201637650001901649650001901668650002301687650001501710650002201725650001601747650001601763653003601779653002201815700001701837700002001854700002001874773011401894856008502008852000902093655001202102IND60750149420221123031733.0211023e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075014942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4625462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Lu10aEsterification of perfluorinated carboxylic acids with bromomethyl aromatic compounds for gas chromatography combined with laser ionization mass spectrometry  aPerfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were derivatized with two types of aromatic compounds that contained a bromomethyl group, i.e., 2-(bromomethyl)naphthalene (BMN) and benzyl bromide (BB). The conditions for derivatization were optimized in terms of reaction temperature and time and the concentration of derivatizing reagent. Using these optimal conditions, the PFCAs-MN and PFCAs-B derivatives were measured by gas chromatography (GC) combined with mass spectrometry using an ultraviolet femtosecond laser (267 nm) as the ionization source. The efficiency of derivatization for PFCAs-B was higher than that for PFCAs-MN because of the smaller size of the chromophore (benzene). The ionization efficiency of PFCAs-MN, however, was better than PFCAs-B, since a larger sized chromophore (naphthalene) and then a larger molar absorptivity was preferable for resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization. Due to superior GC separation, BB was successfully used as the derivatizing agent for the trace analysis of PFCAs, with detection limits of 6.0, 8.4, and 9.5 ng/mL for perfluoroheptanoic, perfluorooctanoic, and perfluorononanoic acids, respectively. The other bromomethyl aromatic compounds were evaluated for use as a derivatization reagent in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorptivity 3abenzene 3aderivatization 3aesterification 3agas chromatography 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3anaphthalene 3atemperature 0aPerfluorinated carboxylic acids 0aFemtosecond laser1 aJin, Fengdan1 aImasaka, Totaro1 aImasaka, Tomoko0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 1656 p.462546-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4625463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245009900178300001600277520128800293592002801581650001701609650002101626650002801647650001301675650002101688650001501709650002001724650001201744650002301756650001001779650001301789650001201802650002201814650001901836650002801855650001501883650002201898650002601920650001601946650002201962653004001984653002602024700002602050700001902076700006202095700006502157700005902222773013502281856008702416852000902503655001202512IND60591723620221121063622.0190725e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059172362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFusco, Francesca Anna10aBiochemical characterization of a novel thermostable β-glucosidase from Dictyoglomus turgidum  ap. 783-791.  aDtur_0462 gene from the hypertermophilic bacterium Dictyoglomus turgidum, encoding a β-glucosidase, was synthetically produced and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-RIL. DturβGlu was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and its homotetrameric structure was determined by gel filtration. The monomer is composed by 418 amino acidic residues and showed high sequence similarity with Glycoside Hydrolases (GHs) belonging to GH1 family. The maximum activity of DturβGlu was observed at 80°C and at pH5.4. DturβGlu was stable in the range of pH5–8 and retained 70% of its activity after 2h of incubation at 70°C. Metal ions and chemical reagents differently influenced the β-glucosidase activity; furthermore, DturβGlu displays a good ethanol and glucose tolerance (Ki 750mM). The enzyme is active on p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPGlu) (Km 0.84mM) and p-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (pNPGal) (Km 1.36mM) and shows a broad substrate specificity towards natural compounds as salicin, cellobiose and genistin. The ability to hydrolyze different substrates, the activation in the presence of surfactants, the good thermal resistance, and finally the high glucose and ethanol tolerance make this enzyme a good candidate for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDictyoglomus 3aEscherichia coli 3aaffinity chromatography 3abacteria 3abeta-glucosidase 3acellobiose 3aenzyme activity 3aethanol 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3agenistin 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3aheat tolerance 3aindustrial applications 3ametal ions 3asequence homology 3asubstrate specificity 3asurfactants 3athermal stability 0aβ-glucosidase, thermophilic enzyme 0aDictyoglomus turgidum1 aFiorentino, Gabriella1 aPedone, Emilia1 aContursi, Patrizia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8443-32731 aBartolucci, Simonetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1968-29591 aLimauro, Danila1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2387-55820 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 July 01, v. 113 p.783-791dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245019700165300001400362520150800376592002801884596005901912596005901971596007302030650002202103650001802125650001702143650001202160650001102172650001402183650002802197650001902225650001102244650000902255650002302264650001002287650001002297651001002307700001602317700002002333700001602353700005402369773012602423856008302549852000902632655001202641IND60759495520221120090044.0220812e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075949552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05149-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Siyuan10aIntraspecific variations of anatomical, morphological and chemical traits in leaves and absorptive roots along climate and soil gradients: a case study with Ginkgo biloba and Eucommia ulmoides  ap. 73-88.  aAIMS: Functional traits play key role in plant resource-use strategy, but the intraspecific variation of root traits particularly of anatomy along large-scale environmental gradient has been poorly understood. METHODS: Here, we examined 16 morphological, anatomical, and chemical traits of leaves and absorptive roots (i.e., the first-order roots) for two wide-planted tree species, Ginkgo biloba and Eucommia ulmoides, sampled at five locations from subtropical, temperate, and cold-arid regions in China. RESULTS: Morphological traits in leaves tended to shift from conservative at resource-poor sites to acquisitive at resource-rich sites, showing lower leaf thickness and larger specific leaf area, while roots showed a reverse pattern. All anatomical traits in leaves and roots inclined to be more conservative in resource-poor sites. Leaves and roots generally showed negative relationships in analogous morphological traits, but positive in anatomical and chemical traits across both species. Intraspecific variation of leaf traits confirmed the existence of one-dimensional economics spectrum, whereas root traits displayed multidimensional variation, showing an independent dimension of cortex to stele size ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Leaf and root traits in both species showed considerable intraspecific variations under changing environments, which improved whole-plant-level adaptions to climate and soil constraints, and exhibited different above- and belowground intraspecific economics spectra.  aPublisher supplied data  a31901301cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31870608cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2572018BA11cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aEucommia ulmoides 3aGinkgo biloba 3acase studies 3aclimate 3acortex 3aeconomics 3aintraspecific variation 3aleaf thickness 3aleaves 3asoil 3aspecific leaf area 3astele 3atrees 3aChina1 aWang, Wenna1 aWang, Shaozhong1 aYang, Lixue1 aGu, Jiacun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7570-33580 tPlant and soil.g2021 Dec., v. 469, no. 1-2 p.73-88dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05149-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014200174520169300316592002802009650001302037650003002050650001302080650001902093650001802112650001102130650001202141650001902153650002602172650002002198650001002218650001602228650001402244650001602258650002002274650001202294650001402306650001002320650001702330653001402347653001302361653002402374653002402398653001302422653001402435700002002449700002802469700002502497700002202522700002102544773011602565856008502681852000902766655001202775IND60734060420221122164327.0210918e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073406042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiapero, Ana Laura10aReproductive resilience to habitat fragmentation of Lithraea molleoides (Anacardiaceae), a dominant dioecious tree from the Chaco Serrano  aMost of the earth's surface has been transformed by man into urbanized and cultivated areas, decreasing and fragmenting the remaining natural habitats. These changes result in decreased plant population sizes and increased isolation among remaining populations. Because dioecious plant species have male and female flowers in different individuals, they are obligately outcrossing and highly dependent on pollination vectors. Thus, reductions in population size and changes in their sex ratio after deforestation can be significantly drastic for their reproduction. While much research has been conducted assessing habitat fragmentation effects on sexual reproduction of populations of hermaphrodite species, very little is known about the effects on dioecious species. Here, we simultaneously assessed habitat fragmentation effects on the phenological patterns, sex ratios, reproductive ecology and progeny performance of the Chaco Serrano dominant native dioecious tree Lithraea molleoides. In contrast to our initial hypotheses, we found that neither conspecific flowering density, sex ratios, nor flowering phenology of L. molleoides was affected by habitat fragmentation. Lastly, progeny performance was not affected by habitat fragmentation either. Our overall findings across three reproductive seasons show that this dioecious species is resilient to changes imposed by habitat fragmentation. We discuss the particular combination of ecological traits of L. molleoides that may be conferring reproductive resilience, such as ambophilous pollination system and the capability of asexual seed production through apomixis, which may be shared by other woody native dioecious species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithraea 3aadministrative management 3aapomixis 3aconspecificity 3adeforestation 3adioecy 3afemales 3aforest ecology 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahermaphroditism 3amales 3aoutcrossing 3aphenology 3apollination 3apopulation size 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3atrees 3aurbanization 0aAmbophily 0aApomixis 0aFlowering phenology 0aProgeny performance 0aSeed set 0aSex ratio1 aAguilar, Ramiro1 aGalfrascoli, Giovana M.1 aBernardello, Gabriel1 aQuesada, Mauricio1 aAshworth, Lorena0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 July 15, v. 492 p.119215-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03643naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005200153245013100205300001600336520211300352592002802465650002002493650001102513650001902524650003102543650002302574650001502597650002502612650001302637650000902650650001902659650003302678650002702711653001502738653002602753653002302779653002502802653002802827700001502855700002202870700001302892700001302905700002602918773012002944856008803064852000903152655001203161IND60644888820221118065729.0190628e20190910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064488882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.1602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2057-633610aFunctional diversity overrides community-weighted mean traits in linking land-use intensity to hydrological ecosystem services  ap. 583-590.  aLand-use intensification can importantly influence terrestrial ecosystem services by altering plant functional traits. Although we know that functional traits influence both ecosystem properties and services, we do not fully understand the mechanistic pathways governing these relationships nor how they will respond to global climate change. To identify the impact pathways of land-use intensity on hydrological services under changing precipitation regimes, we monitored hydrological services in 15 plots of different land-use types during 25 precipitation events (6 light, 8 moderate, and 11 heavy rains). Bayesian structural equation modeling was used to quantify the direct and indirect effects between land-use intensity, functional trait components (community weighted mean [CWM] and functional diversity [FD]), ecosystem properties (canopy density, litter fall and fine-root density), and hydrological services under different rainfall intensities. The impact of land-use intensity on hydrological service provisioning was regulated by plant functional traits regardless of intensity rainfall. Under light and moderate rain, FD significantly influenced hydrological services by altering canopy density and fine-root density, but we found no significant effect of CWMs. Under heavy rain, FD had significant, and greater, impacts on hydrological services than CWM of traits, although CWM of traits influenced hydrological services provision indirectly by altering canopy density and fine-root density. Land-use intensity indirectly affected hydrological services mainly by altering FD regardless of rainfall intensification, suggesting that the reduction of niche differentiation caused by land-use intensity is the main mechanism of hydrological services degradation. Our results suggested that the effect of land-use intensity on hydrological services are likely to change with increasing frequency of extreme precipitation events because of the different underlying mechanism at play and emphasize the importance of FD in maintaining hydrological services in respond to global environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3aecological differentiation 3aecosystem services 3afine roots 3afunctional diversity 3aland use 3arain 3arain intensity 3astructural equation modeling 3aterrestrial ecosystems 0aLand cover 0aGlobal climate change 0aEcosystem services 0aFunctional diversity 0aHydrological regulation1 aZheng, Hua1 aSmith, Jeffrey R.1 aZhao, He1 aLiu, Lei1 aOuyang, Z.q(Zhiyun),0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Sept. 10, v. 682 p.583-590dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.1603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245013700164300001600301520112900317592002801446650002501474650001601499650001401515650001401529650001801543650001401561650001601575650002101591650001901612650004401631650002501675650002001700650001001720650001301730653002501743653001901768653002601787653001401813653002701827700001701854700001401871700001501885700005301900773013501953856008702088852000902175655001202184IND60591723820221121093652.0190725e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059172382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Dan10aStructural characterization of a galactan from Ophiopogon japonicus and anti-pancreatic cancer activity of its acetylated derivative  ap. 907-915.  aA galactan ROH05 was isolated from the roots of Ophiopogon japonicus and further purified by DEAE Sepharose™ Fast Flow columns. The molecular weight of ROH05 was estimated to be 16.7kDa. ROH05 was composed of galactose only. According to the methylation analysis and the results of IR and NMR spectra, the backbone of ROH05 was composed of 1, 4-linked β-D-galactose and 1, 4, 6-linked β-D-galactose, while the branch of this polysaccharide was terminal-linked β-D-galactose attached at C-6 position of 1, 4-linked β-D-galactose directly. The acetylated galactan, ROH05A was prepared by the acetic anhydride-pyridine method. The acetylation modification mainly occurred at C-2, C-3 and C-6 positions of 1, 4-linked β-D-galactose, and C-6 position of terminal-linked β-D-galactose. Bioactivity test showed that ROH05A might inhibit both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells growth in a dose-dependent manner without significant toxicity to LO2 cells. In addition, the cells apoptosis was triggered since cleaved caspase-3 and FasL were activated while p53, p21, Bax expression were up-regulated by ROH05A as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOphiopogon japonicus 3aacetylation 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3adose response 3agalactose 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apolysaccharides 3aroots 3atoxicity 0aOphiopogon japonicus 0aPolysaccharide 0aAcetylated derivative 0aApoptosis 0aAnti-pancreatic cancer1 aHuang, Lulin1 aChen, Xia1 aWu, Qianhu1 aDing, Kan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6026-99820 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 July 01, v. 113 p.907-915dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005000150245013200200520164900332592002801981650002002009650001602029650001402045650002102059650004302080650001902123650001502142650001902157650000902176650001602185650001602201650001102217653001602228653004102244653005002285653003002335653002402365700001602389700001502405700001202420700001602432700001802448773011402466856008502580852000902665655001202674IND60750149620221123021048.0211023e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075014962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4625482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9617-366710aSynthesis of octadecylamine-derived carbon dots and application in reversed phase/hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography  aIn order to make up for the deficiencies of traditional C18 column for separating strong polar compounds, combined with the good hydrophilicity of carbon dots (CDs), novel octadecylamine-derived CDs denoted as C18-CDs are designed, synthesized and applied in RPLC/HILIC mixed-mode chromatography with good separation performance towards both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds. C18-CDs are synthesized by simple one-step solvothermal method using octadecylamine and citric acid as carbon sources, and C18-CDs with proper polarity are collected through column chromatography purification. This C18-CDs decorated silica column showed good separation performance for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and alkylbenzenes under RPLC mode. Hydrophilic compounds including sulfonamides, nucleosides and nucleobases also achieved good resolution in HILIC mode. Hydrophobic and π-π stacking interactions play major retaining roles in RPLC, whereas hydrophilic partitioning and hydrogen bond interactions turn to the main retention interactions under HILIC mode. This C18-CDs/SiO₂ column was applied for the fast detection of chloramphenicol in milk without complex sample pretreatment process. Quantitative relationship between the peak area and the concentration of chloramphenicol was established with linear equation of A = 1677c + 173. Satisfactory spiked recoveries in the range of 94.1–109.0% were obtained. This work not only proposes a simple method for improving the polarity of C18 column through forming octadecane into CDs, but also provides novel CDs with certain hydrophobicity/hydrophily suitable for mixed-mode chromatography.  aPublisher supplied data 3achloramphenicol 3acitric acid 3aequations 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophily 3ahydrophobicity 3amilk 3anucleobases 3anucleosides 3asilica 0aCarbon dots 0aReversed phase liquid chromatography 0aHydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography 0aMixed-mode chromatography 0aRetention mechanism1 aHou, Xiudan1 aLv, Haitao1 aLi, Hui1 aZhao, Liang1 aQiu, Hongdeng0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 1656 p.462548-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4625483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245014200167300001800309520145300327592002801780650001501808650001201823650001901835650002201854650001301876650002501889700002001914700001601934773012601950856008202076852000902158655001202167IND60567859020221123014341.0170428e20170126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056785902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b115212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratik, Saied
Md10aDesign of van der Waals Two-Dimensional Heterostructures from Facially Polarized Janus All-Cis 1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexafluorocyclohexane (C6H6F6)  ap. 1752-1762.  aThe recently synthesized all-cis 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane (1) has a large dipole moment (6.2 D) and uniaxial facial polarization. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is shown that both the “positive” and “negative” surfaces of 1 can recognize flat aromatic molecules (X, X = benzene, pyrene, and coronene), 2D materials (graphene), and their fully hydrogenated analogues through attractive noncovalent interactions. 1 can be sandwiched between graphene and graphane layers, where the enhanced polarity of the axial CH and CF bonds leads to the formation of an unusual “triple-decker” complex. Upon adsorption with 1, the band gap of graphane reduces from 3.40 to 2.05 eV, which might be useful for visible-light energy-conversion applications. We demonstrate the controlled tuning of the structural and electronic properties in 1-benzene, 1-cyclohexane, and benzene-1-cyclohexane complexes by the application of an external electric field along the polarization axis. The extended analogue of 1, hydrofluorinated graphene (HFG), which has semiconducting properties (band gap ≈ 3.0 eV), can form strong CH···FC interlayer interactions with graphane to form a stable, metallic bilayer. Our calculations show that the two-dimensional HFG can be realized through the high-pressure topochemical condensation of monofluoroacetylene (C₂HF) for which the barrier of activation is 18.7 kcal/mol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3aelectric field 3aenergy conversion 3agraphene 3avan der Waals forces1 aNijamudheen, A.1 aDatta, Ayan0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Jan. 26, v. 121, no. 3 p.1752-1762dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b115213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011700176520119800293592002801491653002901519653001401548653002001562653001801582700002801600700007201628773008001700856008501780852000901865655001201874IND60656136920221119071645.0190809e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065613692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1158632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorral-Vega, Pedro J.10aDesign, modelling, control and techno-economic evaluation of a fuel cell/supercapacitors powered container crane  aThis paper presents a “full green” version of a rubber tyre gantry (RTG) crane with a fuel cell (FC) unit and supercapacitors (SCs) as energy storage system (ESS), instead of using the conventional RTG powered by a diesel engine. The SCs provide the required high current peaks and power demands when accelerating the load in the hoisting-up movement. Once the power demand reaches a steady level (hoist up constant speed), the FC provides the energy needed for the rest of the movements. The SCs are also charged when the hoist down movement is taking place. In this case, the regenerative energy can be stored in the SCs instead of being burnt in the braking resistors as in the conventional RTG crane. The new hybrid powertrain based on FC and SCs is designed and evaluated from the real driving cycle of the RTG crane. Simulation results, which include a comparative study with the current configuration of the RTG crane (powered only by diesel engine), demonstrate the technical viability of the RTG crane powered by FC and SCs. This hybrid powertrain is more expensive than the diesel powertrain, but more energy-efficient, and a better solution from the environmental point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRubber tyre gantry (RTG) 0aFuel cell 0aSupercapacitors 0aHybrid system1 aGarcía-Triviño, Pablo1 aFernández-Ramírez, Luis M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4898-06800 tEnergy.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 186dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1158633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245020100164520149700365592002801862650002101890650002301911650001901934650001601953650002301969650001901992650002002011650000902031650002402040650001002064650001702074650001102091650001502102650001202117650001002129650001602139650000902155650003902164650001502203650001502218650001702233653001902250653002802269653002502297653001802322653002002340653002902360700001802389700001702407700001702424700001802441700013202459773011302591856008202704852000902786655001202795IND60647129020221120000511.0190624e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064712902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1105792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jia-yi10aHydrolyzed wheat gluten alleviates deoxynivalenol-induced intestinal injury by promoting intestinal stem cell proliferation and differentiation via upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mice  aDisintegration of the intestine caused by deoxynivalenol (DON), which is a fungal metabolite found in cereal grain-based human and animal diets, triggers severe intestinal inflammatory disease. Hydrolyzed wheat gluten (HWG) can promote the development of intestine. Therefore, HWG was administered orally to male mice on 1–14 days, and DON was administered to them on 4–11 days. Feed, water intake and body weight were recorded all over the experimental period. Blood samples were collected then the mice were sacrificed to collect the jejunum for crypt isolation and culture. The intestinal morphology was observed by electron microscopy, and Western blotting was used to investigate intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and differentiation, as well as the primary regulatory mechanism of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The results showed that HWG increased the average daily gain and average daily water intake of mice under DON-induced injury conditions, and increased the jejunum weight, villous height in the jejunum, and promoted jejunal crypt cell expansion. The DON-induced decrease in Wnt/β-catenin activity, the expression of Ki67, PCNA and KRT20 were rescued by HWG in the jejunum, crypt and enteroid, as well as the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells. Furthermore, HWG increased jejunum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity. In conclusion, HWG alleviates DON-induced intestinal injury by enhancing ISC proliferation and differentiation in a Wnt/β-catenin-dependent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood sampling 3abody weight 3acell proliferation 3adeoxynivalenol 3adiamine oxidase 3adiet 3aelectron microscopy 3afungi 3agoblet cells 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ajejunum 3amales 3ametabolites 3amice 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3astem cells 3atoxicology 3awheat gluten 0aDeoxynivalenol 0aHydrolyzed wheat gluten 0aIntestine stem cells 0aProliferation 0aDifferentiation 0aWnt/β-catenin signaling1 aZhang, Sai-wu1 aLin, Hua-lin1 aGao, Chun-qi1 aYan, Hui-chao1 aWang, Xiu-qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2033-9485 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2033-9485 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2033-94850 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Sept., v. 131 p.110579-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1105793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013000172520190300302592002802205650002502233650001302258650003002271650001202301650001102313650001102324650001902335650001702354650001402371650001802385650002002403650001002423650001502433651001502448653001702463653005802480653000902538653002002547700002902567700002102596700002702617700006302644700002002707700002102727773011602748856008502864852000902949655001202958IND60734060620221122103211.0210918e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073406062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaul, Tarit Kumar10aForest carbon stocks under three canopy densities in Sitapahar natural forest reserve in Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh  aTropical forests play a significant role in sequestrating and storing atmospheric carbon di-oxide (CO₂) emissions. However, estimation of forest carbon (C) stocks in relation to changes in forest structure and disturbances are less studied. We estimated forest C stocks in live trees, saplings, lianas, deadwood, forest floor, and soil in Sitapahar natural forest reserve of Bangladesh based on field measurements and laboratory assessments. We categorized the 99 temporary sample plots into three canopy densities: closed, moderately closed, and open. According to the results, the forest C stocks were dominated by the soil C pool and forest C stocks in the closed canopy (91 Mg ha⁻¹) differed significantly from that in the open canopy (50 Mg ha⁻¹). Forest C stocks were also affected by basal area (BA) and deadwood C stocks. In the open canopy, the second highest contributor to forest C stock was deadwood, whereas it was above and below-ground live biomass in the closed and moderately closed canopies. In the open canopy, forest disturbances significantly decreased height and BA, and C stocks in live biomass were significantly lower compared to the other two canopy densities. In the open canopy, decreased tree density resulted in the lowest C stock in litterfall and humus, and they were up to 95% lower compared to the other two canopy densities. C stocks in humus were higher than those in litterfall in the closed and moderately closed canopies, which was opposite to that in the open canopy. The soil C stock decreased with soil depth and the highest C stocks across all depths were in the closed canopy, followed by the moderately closed and open canopy. This study also provided a stand-level estimation of C stocks that contribute to determining which tree species sequester more carbon, such as Swintonia floribunda, Lannea coromandelica, Anacardiaceae and Moraceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLannea coromandelica 3aMoraceae 3aadministrative management 3abiomass 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3adead wood 3aforest litter 3aforest reserves 3ahumus 3asoil depth 3aBangladesh 0aLive biomass 0aDeadwood, disturbance, forest floor, forest structure 0aSoil 0aTropical forest1 aChowdhury, Anwarul Islam1 aUddin, Md.

This technique uses cellophane film-overlaid agar plates to facilitate the separation of fungal biomass. The findings showed that inoculum of P. sajor-caju produced is viable, and it was confirmed by the presence of laccase enzyme activity in SSF of rice husk. The correlation between fungal dry and wet weights (r2=0.9329) provides an accurate estimation of fungal dry weight from its wet weight during inoculum preparation. Besides, this technique does not require a strict sterile handling condition and possesses lower risk of contamination compared with liquid culture and agar plugs approaches. In consideration of large scale inoculum preparation, this newly developed technique is comparatively more cost-effective, which further suggests its potential in inoculum preparation from mycelial fungi for SSF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3acellophane 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3ahulls 3ainoculum 3alaccase 3amicrobial biomass 3arice 3arisk 3asolid state fermentation 0aInoculum 0aSolid-state fermentation 0aCellophane 0aFungus 0aRice husk1 aNgoh, Gek Cheng1 aChua, Adeline Seak May0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 May, v. 43 p.774-777dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009300165520086200258592002801120650001401148650003101162650001901193650002001212650001601232650001501248650001601263650001501279650001401294650001901308650001201327650000901339650001401348650001701362650000901379650001601388653003101404653001301435653001901448653002101467653002501488653001101513700001701524700001801541700001701559700001201576700001901588700013301607773011301740856008201853852000901935655001201944IND60647129120221120000014.0190624e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064712912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1105802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Chao-Kun10aAcute, genetic and sub-chronic toxicities of flaxseed derived Maillard reaction products  aIn present study, the acute, genetic, and sub-chronic toxicities of flaxseed derived Maillard reaction products (MRPs) were investigated.

D.q(James D.),10aMeasurement of NOx Fluxes from a Tall Tower in Central London, UK and Comparison with Emissions Inventories  ap. 1025-1034.  aDirect measurements of NOₓ concentration and flux were made from a tall tower in central London, UK as part of the Clean Air for London (ClearfLo) project. Fast time resolution (10 Hz) NO and NO₂ concentrations were measured and combined with fast vertical wind measurements to provide top-down flux estimates using the eddy covariance technique. Measured NOₓ fluxes were usually positive and ranged from close to zero at night to 2000–8000 ng m–² s–¹ during the day. Peak fluxes were usually observed in the morning, coincident with the maximum traffic flow. Measurements of the NOₓ flux have been scaled and compared to the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) estimate of NOₓ emission for the measurement footprint. The measurements are on average 80% higher than the NAEI emission inventory for all of London. Observations made in westerly airflow (from parts of London where traffic is a smaller fraction of the NOₓ source) showed a better agreement on average with the inventory. The observations suggest that the emissions inventory is poorest at estimating NOₓ when traffic is the dominant source, in this case from an easterly direction from the BT Tower. Agreement between the measurements and the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) are better, due to the more explicit treatment of traffic flow by this more detailed inventory. The flux observations support previous tailpipe observations of higher NOₓ emitted from the London vehicle diesel fleet than is represented in the NAEI or predicted for several EURO emission control technologies.

Restoration of riparian shading may help to regulate the growth of macrophytes, particularly invasive species, which often proliferate in open streams. In a large, flowing outdoor mesocosm we studied the establishment and colonization success of three non-native macrophyte species (Egeria densa, Elodea canadensis and Ceratophyllum demersum) and one native charophyte (Nitella spp. aff. cristata) that commonly occur in stream systems. Plant shoots were grown at five shade levels (35%, 63%, 79%, 90% and 95%) for eight weeks with regular monitoring of growth, morphology and biomass accrual. All species were able to establish at all shading levels. At high shade (≥ 90%) we found a reduction in lateral spread and branching and an increase in main stem length for the non-native species, while Nitella did not show any response for these traits. Biomass accumulation was delayed at high shade for all species. At the end of the experiment, the highest biomass accrual was observed at the lowest shade level (35%) for E. densa and E. canadensis, at 63% shade for C. demersum and at 79% shade for Nitella. Our results confirm, and provide additional examples, that both native and non-native submerged macrophytes can establish and colonize streams that are highly shaded but that the growth of non-native species, in particular, can be limited. Our study also highlights that there are differences in shade tolerance among non-native species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratophyllum demersum 3aEgeria densa 3aElodea canadensis 3aNitella 3abiomass production 3abranching 3aecosystems 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amacrophytes 3amonitoring 3ashade 3ashade tolerance 3ashoots 3astreams 0aShading 0aMacrophyte establishments 0aCommon invaders 0aNative charophytes1 aMatheson, Fleur E.1 aRiis, Tenna0 tAquatic botany.g2019 Oct., v. 158 p.103125-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245010800204300001600312520170000328592002802028596005302056596012602109596006902235650002102304650001602325650001402341650001402355650001602369650000902385650002102394650000702415650001902422650002202441650000902463700001402472700001802486700002202504700002202526700002102548773012802569856008302697852000902780655001202789IND60759496020221120075543.0220812e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075949602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05152-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeno, Daisei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4063-123X12aA synthetic phytosiderophore analog, proline-2′-deoxymugineic acid, is efficiently utilized by dicots  ap. 123-134.  aPURPOSE: Phytosiderophores (PS) from grasses solubilize sparingly soluble iron (Fe), and the resultant PS-Fe is an Fe source even for dicots. Recently, the synthetic PS proline-2′-deoxymugineic acid (PDMA) has been developed as a moderately biodegradable Fe fertilizer for grasses. We aimed to investigate whether PDMA-Fe is also a good Fe source for dicots. METHODS: The availability of PDMA-Fe to cucumber was evaluated in a calcareous substrate and hydroponic cultures at pH 7.0–9.0 by determining chlorophyll level, PSII activity, and Fe uptake. EDDHA-Fe, EDTA-Fe, and citrate-Fe were used as controls. The reducibility of Fe chelates by roots was measured to determine the mechanism underlying differences in availability. Expressions of Fe deficiency-inducible genes were analyzed to estimate the Fe status in plants. RESULTS: The application of PDMA-Fe and EDDHA-Fe to a calcareous substrate reduced Fe-deficient chlorosis to a similar extent; however, the shoot Fe concentration was higher in the PDMA-Fe treatment. In the hydroponic culture, the availability of PDMA-Fe was higher than that of the other chelates at all pH levels, and this was confirmed by higher PSII activity and lower expression of Fe deficiency-inducible genes. The reducibility assay revealed that the reduction level of PDMA-Fe was greater than that of EDTA-Fe and citrate-Fe under alkaline pH. CONCLUSIONS: PDMA-Fe is utilized by cucumber roots more efficiently than traditional synthetic chelates in both calcareous substrate and hydroponic cultures. The higher availability of PDMA-Fe may be attributed to its higher reducibility. Our findings suggest that PDMA-Fe could be a good Fe fertilizer for dicots.  aPublisher supplied data  aAICHI STEEL CORPORATIONcAICHI STEEL CORPORATION  aA12ccabinet office grant in aid, the advanced next-generation greenhouse horticulture by iop (internet of plants), japan  aJPMJCR1503ccore research for evolutional science and technology 3abiodegradability 3achlorophyll 3achlorosis 3acucumbers 3ahydroponics 3airon 3airon fertilizers 3apH 3aphotosystem II 3aphytosiderophores 3asoil1 aIto, Yuta1 aOhnishi, Miho1 aMiyake, Chikahiro1 aSohtome, Takayuki1 aSuzuki, Motofumi0 tPlant and soil.g2021 Dec., v. 469, no. 1-2 p.123-134dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05152-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008900162300001600251520105300267592002801320650003001348650002201378650001401400650001001414650001201424650001201436650001301448650001601461651001001477700001501487700001601502700001901518773010901537856008101646852000901727655001201736IND60438788120221120230217.0151023e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-006-0125-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zu-Lin10aAuditory response characteristics of the piebald odorous frog and their implications  ap. 801-806.  aThe piebald odorous frog (Odorrana schmackeri), the large odorous frog (Odorrana livida) and the concave-eared torrent frog (Amolops tormotus) are sympatric species living near the same torrent streams in the vicinity of Mt. Huangshan, China. A recent study demonstrated that A. tormotus can use sound signals involving ultrasonic components for communication in a noisy environment, and another sympatric species, O. livida, can also perceive ultrasonic sound. Here we report data on the hearing range of O. schmackeri by studying auditory evoked potentials and single-unit data from the torus semicircularis. This frog exhibits its two most sensitive peaks at 2 kHz and 3.5–4.0 kHz with thresholds <42 dB SPL, with an upper frequency limit of hearing at 8.5 kHz with threshold of 87 dB SPL. The upper limit is much lower than those of O. livida and A. tormotus, at 22 and 34 kHz, respectively. It suggests that sympatric species may respond differently to similar environmental selection pressures sculpting auditory communication systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunications technology 3aevoked potentials 3afrequency 3afrogs 3ahearing 3astreams 3asympatry 3aultrasonics 3aChina1 aQiu, Qiang1 aXu, Zhi-Min1 aShen, Jun-Xian0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2006 Aug., v. 192, no. 8 p.801-806dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-006-0125-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012900172300001600301520169600317592002802013650001302041650000802054650001302062650002602075650001202101650001002113650001902123650001502142650000902157650001002166650001602176651001002192653001202202653003002214653002202244653002402266653001702290653001802307700002102325700001902346700001702365700001702382700001902399773008802418856008602506852000902592655001202601IND60089276520221119122349.0160903e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008927652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.07.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadmakumari, B.10aIn situ measurements of aerosol vertical and spatial distributions over continental India during the major drought year 2009  ap. 107-121.  aThe variability in aerosol vertical and spatial distribution over the continental Indian region is studied using the airborne observations during the Cloud Aerosol Interactions and Precipitation Enhancement EXperiment (CAIPEEX) from May to September, 2009. The fine mode (0.1–3.0 μm) aerosol vertical profiles up to 6 km at different regions showed different vertical structures mostly influenced by the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) depth as well as the origin of air mass trajectories and the presence of clouds. Elevated aerosol layers are observed during pre-monsoon and during monsoon at some locations but comparatively lower than the one observed in the boundary layer. During monsoon, aerosol number concentration showed strong vertical gradient and a transition is observed between the boundary layer and the free troposphere. The coarse mode (>3 μm) aerosol vertical profiles also showed elevated layers at higher altitudes due to the incursion of dry air laddened with dust. The spatial distribution shows significant variation at the elevated layers as compared to that in the boundary layer during pre-monsoon, while high variability is observed in the boundary layer during monsoon. The frequency distribution of different aerosol types from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) showed dominating contributions from dust, polluted dust and smoke during pre-monsoon. During monsoon also traces of these pollutants were found to be high as the year 2009 is a drought year with rainfall deficiency of 22%. The surface level number concentration and the height of ABL are found to influence the aerosol optical depths significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adrought 3alidar 3amonsoon season 3apollutants 3arain 3asmoke 3atroposphere 3aIndia 0aCAIPEEX 0aElevated pollution layers 0aFine mode aerosol 0aCoarse mode aerosol 0aDrought year 0aAerosol types1 aMaheskumar, R.S.1 aHarikishan, G.1 aMorwal, S.B.1 aPrabha, T.V.1 aKulkarni, J.R.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2013 Dec., v. 80 p.107-121dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.07.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245007700173300001600250520125000266592002801516650002001544650001501564650001601579650001801595650001001613650001701623650002201640650003201662650001301694650001901707650001801726650001701744650001701761650001401778700002601792700002701818773009901845856008501944852000902029655001202038IND60080828320221118140039.0140812e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008082832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2010.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHounkong, Kruawan12aA colorimetric method for the evaluation of anti-giardial drugs in vitro  ap. 600-603.  aThe aim of this study was to develop a simple and reliable method to determine the viability of Giardia intestinalis after incubation with an anti-giardial agent by using a colorimetric method. Factors that may affect the optical density value were systematically evaluated. The most suitable conditions were obtained when G. intestinalis trophozoites, 5×10⁵cells/ml were incubated with the anti-giardial agent for 48h. The culture medium was removed and trophozoites were immediately fixed by immersing the whole plate in absolute methanol for 2min. The fixed trophozoites were then stained with 0.1% w/v methylene blue for 10min, washed once by immersing the whole plate into distilled water. The dye was released by adding 0.1M hydrochloric acid solution (300μl) and the optical density was read at 655nm. The 50% inhibitory concentration values (IC₅₀) of metronidazole, ornidazole and furazolidone obtained from our proposed method (0.41±0.06, 0.18±0.01, 0.26±0.13μg/ml, respectively) were comparable to the IC₅₀ values obtained by the current conventional method (0.14±0.05, 0.15±0.04, 0.14±0.02μg/ml, respectively). This new method did provide a convenient and reliable way to screen for potential anti-giardial agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGiardia lamblia 3aabsorbance 3acolorimetry 3aculture media 3adrugs 3afurazolidone 3ahydrochloric acid 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amethanol 3amethylene blue 3ametronidazole 3aparasitology 3atrophozoites 3aviability1 aSawangjaroen, Nongyao1 aPhongpaichit, Souwalak0 tExperimental parasitology.g2011 Feb., v. 127, no. 2 p.600-603dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2010.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009700165520191200262592002802174650003002202650001102232650001902243650001802262650002102280650001602301651001002317653002602327653002102353653001502374653002002389653004502409653001702454700001702471700005002488700001502538700002102553773011602574856008502690852000902775655001202784IND60734061020221122062939.0210918e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073406102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Haimei10aAdditivity of stand basal area predictions in canopy stratifications for natural oak forests  aStand basal area is an important variable for evaluating forest productivity. In this study, four types of growth models were used for modeling the stand basal area of natural oak forests in Hunan Province, China. The results showed that the Schumacher model (Eq. (3)) performed the best. Because of different canopy layers in natural oak secondary forests, it is important to develop stand basal area models considering canopy stratification. Three widely used canopy stratification methods were used for natural oak forests: the clustering analysis of tree height, classification scheme of the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) standard, and canopy competition cut-off height (CCH) method. According to the standards set forth in the National Standards of the People’s Republic of China (GB/T 26424-2010), the forests were divided into two layers: upper and lower. Among the three canopy stratification approaches, the IUFRO method was selected as the best. In addition, it should be noted that the sum of the basal area predictions at different layers can generate inconsistent results, as compared to predictions from the total stand basal area model. To solve the additivity of stand basal area predictions, the additive stand basal area growth model was established by nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (NSUR). Comparing with the whole stand basal area growth model without stratification, the R² values of basal area growth models with stratification increased by 4.78% (from 0.9277 to 0.9721). In addition, compared with equations estimated separately, the NSUR method increased R² by 0.82% (from 0.9721 to 0.9801). The results reveal that the NSUR method can be applied to solve the additivity of stand basal area predictions at each layer and can improve model precision, which provides helpful insights into developing stand growth models in natural forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acanopy 3aforest ecology 3agrowth models 3astand basal area 3atree height 3aChina 0aCanopy stratification 0aStand basal area 0aAdditivity 0aNatural forests 0aNonlinear seemingly unrelated regression 0aQuercus spp.1 aZhu, Guangyu1 aMa, Wu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2656-339X1 aLiu, Feihu1 aZhang, Xiongqing0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 July 15, v. 492 p.119246-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009700175520147700272592002801749650001601777650001801793650002501811650001401836650001201850650001001862650001401872650001601886650002001902650002101922650001601943650001201959650001101971650001501982650001101997650002102008650001402029650001102043650002102054650001702075650001302092650001202105650001402117650001102131650002202142653001902164653002802183653001802211653001902229700006802248700003402316700001802350773010902368856008602477852000902563655001202572IND60647129520221119235837.0190801e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064712952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGemin, Luiz Gabriel10aMicroalgae associated to humic acid as a novel biostimulant improving onion growth and yield  aThe search for new natural sources for plant growth promotion and yield gains can contribute to ensuring safe and sustainable vegetable production. The potential of microalgae as a plant biostimulant source has been investigated in recent years, while the use of humic substances is well established; however the study of the combination of both is novel, and is the aim of this work. A step-by-step approach was adopted, conducting three experiments using the microalgae Scenedesmus subspicatus combined with humic acid: i) rooting bioassays in a growth chamber to identify bioactivity of microalgae, humic acid and their mixtures using Vigna radiata as a model plant. ii) immersion treatments of two onion cultivar seedlings at transplantation which were then grown in pots in a greenhouse, iii) immersion treatments of two onion cultivar (open-pollinated and hybrid) seedlings at transplantation which were then grown at field in organic system. Growth and biochemical variables, yield and nutrient content of onion leaves and bulbs were evaluated. The bioactivity of microalgae biomass, of humic acid and their mixtures were identified on bioassays, and synergy was found. The immersion of onion seedlings in microalgae plus humic acid solutions showed growth promoting effects at the early stages, improved bulb caliber and yield of the hybrid cultivar, and incremented sugars and proteins content in bulbs. The yield gain was not related to nutrients uptake stimuli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3aVigna radiata 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3abiomass 3abulbs 3acultivars 3agreenhouses 3agrowth chambers 3agrowth promotion 3ahumic acids 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aonions 3aopen pollination 3aplant growth 3aproteins 3arooting 3aseedlings 3asugars 3avegetable growing 0aAllium cepa L. 0aScenedesmus subspicatus 0aVigna radiate 0aOrganic system1 aMógor, Átila Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4199-90791 aDe Oliveira Amatussi, Juliana1 aMógor, Gilda0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 256 p.108560-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014000169300001800309520116800327592002801495650001501523650001201538650001901550650001101569650000901580650002001589650002501609650001401634650001001648650001501658653002601673653002701699653001701726653002901743653003901772700005501811700001301866773010001879856008701979852000902066655001202075IND60584179420221121133110.0180830e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058417942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jinbo10aCoordinated dispatch of electric power and district heating networks: A decentralized solution using optimality condition decomposition  ap. 1508-1522.  aThe strong linkage of electric power and heat supplies can be decoupled to reduce wind power curtailment by exploiting the energy storage and regulation capabilities of the district heating network (DHN), electric boilers and heat storage tanks. In this paper, the coordinated dispatch of integrated electrical and heating systems (CDIEHS), considering the energy storage of both pipelines in the DHN and heat storage tanks, is formulated as a convex quadratic program. Since the electric power system (EPS) and the district heating system (DHS) are controlled separately by different operation organizations, CDIEHS is solved in a decentralized manner using optimality condition decomposition (OCD). The OCD algorithm, with guaranteed convergence for convex programs, can achieve a fully distributed solution for the CDIEHS and requires only minor boundary information exchange between the EPS and the DHS. The simulation results are discussed for two test systems, including a real power system, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized method, which achieves the same solution as the centralized method in a moderate number of iterations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aboilers 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aheat 3aheating systems 3ainformation exchange 3apipelines 3atanks 3awind power 0aCoordinated operation 0aDecentralized solution 0aHeat storage 0aIntegrated energy system 0aOptimality condition decomposition1 aLi, Zhigang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0464-88001 aWu, Q.H.0 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 206 p.1508-1522dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245015600160300001800316520125700334592002801591650001901619650001701638650001701655650001601672650002201688650001901710650001701729650001401746653002401760653002501784653002601809653002501835653002901860700001301889700001601902700001801918700001301936700001601949773012701965856008302092852000902175655001202184IND60750150120221119044155.0220214e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075015012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jun10aMultifunctional carbon quantum dots as a theranostic nanomedicine for fluorescence imaging-guided glutathione depletion to improve chemodynamic therapy  ap. 1219-1228.  aTo minimize unwanted reactions with high concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) during chemodynamic therapy (CDT), a simple and effective strategy was developed to fabricate a TME stimuli-responsive theranostic nanomedicine (Fe-CD) for fluorescence imaging-guided GSH depletion and cancer therapy by combining fluorescent imaging carbon dots (CD) and Fe(III). Introducing Fe(III) into Fe-CD not only quenched the fluorescence of CD while reacting with and consuming intracellular GSH for fluorescence imaging of the depletion of GSH but also provided a source of metal ions to generate more abundant hydroxyl radicals (•OH) with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) through the Fenton reaction to improve CDT. Fe-CD showed promising •OH generation under H₂O₂ to effectively degrade methylene blue in vitro and obviously activate the green fluorescence of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) probe in cells. Benefiting from the fluorescence enhancement in response to TME stimulation, Fe-CD greatly enhanced CDT cytotoxicity while monitoring successful GSH depletion by fluorescence imaging. Fe-CD has the potential to act as a theranostic nanomedicine for fluorescence imaging-guided GSH depletion to amplify CDT.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3aglutathione 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amethylene blue 3ananomedicine 3aneoplasms 0aCarbon quantum dots 0aFluorescence imaging 0aGlutathione depletion 0aChemodynamic therapy 0aTheranostic nanomedicine1 aHu, Zu-E1 aWe, Yun-Jie1 aLiu, Yan-Hong1 aWang, Na1 aYu, Xiao-Qi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 606 p.1219-1228dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245011200178300001800290520182200308592002802130650001902158650001202177650001702189650001302206650003002219650001802249650001102267650001802278650002102296650001802317650001602335650001102351653002602362653002102388653001702409653001802426653001702444653001802461700002202479700002702501773010002528856008702628852000902715655001202724IND60584179620221121133056.0180830e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058417962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTashtoush, Bourhan M.10aInvestigation of the use of nano-refrigerants to enhance the performance of an ejector refrigeration system  ap. 1446-1463.  aIn this work, the performance of an ejector refrigeration system using nano-refrigerants is investigated. A new hypothesis is proposed for flow boiling modeling, where nanoparticles are assumed to not migrate to the vapor phase as phase changes occur continuously; this causes a significant increase in nanoparticle mass fraction for high vapor quality values. This assumption shows a reasonable correlation with previously published data for R113/CuO mixtures, where an average deviation of 9.24% was obtained. A parametric analysis is performed to investigate the variation in heat transfer coefficient (HTC) with temperature, nanoparticle type, size, and mass fraction. Finally, the effect of nanoparticles on the coefficient of performance (COP) of the ejector refrigeration cycle as a response to the augmented flow boiling HTC is investigated by simulating a 5-kW cooling refrigeration cycle. Considering the advantage of using nano-refrigerants, a higher quality vapor was attained at the evaporator exit, resulting in an increase in the enthalpy difference in the evaporator in the ejector cooling cycle. As a result, a lower mass flux inside the evaporator is required to attain the same cooling capacity. Improved refrigerant-side HTCs improve the overall HTCs of the evaporator, allowing the evaporator to operate at lower temperature differences and higher pressures, which consequently increases the cycle COPs. Furthermore, the refrigerant vapor quality increases at the evaporator exit, leading to an enhanced COP of the cycle. The augmentation in COP reached 24.7% and 12.61% for R134a with 2wt.% CuO and Al2O3, respectively, whereas the vapor quality for the refrigerant leaving the evaporator increased from 0.7616 for the case of the pure refrigerant to 0.8212 for R134a/CuO 2wt.% nano-refrigerant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aboiling 3acupric oxide 3aenthalpy 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amass transfer 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3arefrigeration 3atemperature 3avapors 0aEjector cooling cycle 0aNano-refrigerant 0aNanoparticle 0aRefrigeration 0aFlow boiling 0aHeat transfer1 aAl-Nimr, Moh'd A.1 aKhasawneh, Mohammad A.0 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 206 p.1446-1463dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016000165300001800325520137900343592002801722650001501750650002401765650001201789650001901801650002701820650003001847650001101877650001201888650001301900650001501913650001101928650001901939650001901958650002501977653001002002653000802012653002602020653003602046653001702082700001502099700001902114700001502133700001502148700001902163700001602182773012702198856008302325852000902408655001202417IND60750150220221119043838.0220214e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075015022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qingli10aPolyvinyl pyrrolidone-coordinated ultrathin bismuth oxybromide nanosheets for boosting photoreduction of carbon dioxide via ligand-to-metal charge transfer  ap. 1087-1100.  aPhotoreduction of CO₂ to useful ingredients remains a great challenge due to the high energy barrier of CO₂ activation and poor product selectivity. Herein, Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) coordinated BiOBr was synthesized by a facile chemical precipitation method at room temperature. The CO₂ photoreduction behaviors of PVP coordinated BiOBr were evaluated with H₂O without sacrificial agent under the simulated sunlight. The evolution rates of CO and CH₄ are 263.2 µmol g⁻¹h⁻¹ and 3.3 µmol g⁻¹h⁻¹, which are 8 times and 2 times higher than those of pure BiOBr respectively. Furthermore, the coordination of PVP on BiOBr surface enhances greatly the selectivity of product CO, which is close to 100%. Loading PVP onto BiOBr could not only induce and stabilize the oxygen vacancy, but also increase the charge density of BiOBr via the ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT), which could be beneficial to the adsorption and activation of CO₂ molecule. The photoreduction mechanism of CO₂ for PVP coordinated BiOBr was proposed based on the improved charge density of BiOBr by the experimental results and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This finding provides a new pathway to boost the conversion efficiency and selectivity for the activation of CO₂ photoreduction and new molecule insights into the role of PVP in photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3abismuth 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical precipitation 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aligands 3alighting 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoreduction 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 0aBiOBr 0aPVP 0aPhotoreduction of CO2 0aLigand to metal charge transfer 0aCoordination1 aJin, Yuhan1 aZhang, Yanfeng1 aLi, Yuxian1 aWang, Xuxu1 aCao, Xingzhong1 aWang, Baoyi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 606 p.1087-1100dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007300166500002200239520127900261592002801540650001301568650001301581650001201594650001501606650001101621650001701632650001201649650003101661650001401692650001801706650001501724650002001739650002401759650001701783650001901800650001401819653001201833653002201845653001401867653001901881700001501900700001801915700001401933700005601947700001902003773007402022856008502096852000902181655001202190IND60656137720221119071725.0190809e20190804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065613772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1158822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Wenfei10aLong term storage stability of bio-oil from rice husk fast pyrolysis  aPre-press version  aBi-oil, the liquid product from biomass fast pyrolysis, is a kind of clean and sustainable fuel. However, its physicochemical characteristics are not stable, which hinder its actual applications. In this research, bio-oil made from rice husk by a commercial-scale biomass fast pyrolysis plant was utilized to investigate the effects of long period storage (two years) under three different conditions: at 4 °C in a refrigerator, at 25 °C in a room, and at outdoors in the nature conditions. In each condition, three samples collected from the upper, middle and the bottom of the containers. The results showed that low temperature (4 °C) can slow down the process of degradation during storage. The bio-oils endure the most severe aging process at 25 °C in a room. The maximum value of the viscosity was obtained from the bottom layer of bio-oil stored at 25 °C (348.5 ± 2.9 mm2 s−1), which is 50.8 times higher than that of the original bio-oil. The alcohols, furans and hydrocarbons are prone to accumulate in the bottom layers. This research could give insight on degradation of bio-oils at the distinct storage conditions and will be useful for designing the storage system and maintaining the quality of bio-oils in transportation and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acontainers 3afurans 3ahydrocarbons 3aliquids 3aphysicochemical properties 3apyrolysis 3arefrigerators 3arice hulls 3astorage quality 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atransportation 3aviscosity 0aBio-oil 0aStorage stability 0aRice husk 0aFast pyrolysis1 aKang, Ning1 aJang, Moon Ki1 aSun, Chen1 aLiu, Ronghou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7589-54811 aLuo, Zhongyang0 tEnergy.g2019 Aug. 04, dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1158823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011800171300001600289520134300305592002801648650002001676650002701696650002001723650002001743650002501763650001301788650001101801650002201812650002001834650001301854650001401867650001401881650001601895650001101911650001001922650001201932650002101944650002001965650001301985650001601998650001802014650001202032653000702044653000902051653000802060653000802068653001002076653000802086653000802094653002002102653001302122653002202135700001902157700001602176700001602192700001402208700001802222700001902240700001602259773013502275856008702410852000902497655001202506IND60591724620221121093655.0190725e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059172462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.03.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Shang-Jun10aMetabolic responses and arginine kinase expression of juvenile cuttlefish (Sepia pharaonis) under salinity stress  ap. 881-888.  aThe pharaoh cuttlefish Sepia pharaonis is particularly sensitive to environmental changes in its breeding environment. The breeding of S. pharaonis larvae was carried out in different salinities for 48h, and the changes in survival rate, histological structure, energy metabolism, and anti-oxidative stress parameters were investigated and correlated with arginine kinase (AK) expression changes in muscle and liver tissues. The suitable salinity for larvae cultivation ranged from 24 to 30‰, and the survival rate showed a significant decline at 21‰ salinity. Histological observations of muscle and liver showed that changes in salinity and osmotic pressure had an adverse effect on tissue structure. Measurements of glycogen and lactic acid levels suggested that S. pharaonis could dynamically adjust energy metabolism to provide additional energy under unsuitable salinity. The protein levels and enzyme activities of AK in muscle significantly increased at 21‰ salinity. The results were consistent with prompt replenishment of phosphoarginine stores during salinity stress to maintain a dynamic ATP balance, suggesting that AK plays an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism. This study provides insight into metabolic changes during salinity stress and sheds light on the functional role of AK in S. pharaonis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSepia pharaonis 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadverse effects 3aarginine kinase 3abiochemical pathways 3abreeding 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3aglycogen 3ahistology 3ajuveniles 3alactic acid 3alarvae 3aliver 3amuscles 3aosmotic pressure 3aprotein content 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asurvival rate 3atissues 0aAK 0aSPAK 0aATP 0aGST 0aT-SOD 0aGSH 0aMDA 0aArginine kinase 0aSalinity 0aEnergy metabolism1 aZhang, Linmeng1 aZhang, Lili1 aWan, Jiaxin1 aSong, Wei1 aJiang, Xiamin1 aPark, Yong-Doo1 aSi, Yue-Xiu0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 July 01, v. 113 p.881-888dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.03.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04096naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245012700205300001600332500002000348520273500368592002803103596005003131596005103181650002703232650001603259650001203275650002603287650000903313650001603322650001403338650001803352650002003370700005503390700005803445773011803503856008003621852000903701655001203710IND60769156520221122094423.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076915652DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.139602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchons, Rieke F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3232-673710aResource heterogeneity but not inbreeding affects growth and grouping behaviour in socially foraging juvenile cichlid fish  ap. 550-560.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpatial food distribution determines resource profitability, defensibility and encounter rate of foragers. Clumped food distribution can promote aggressiveness and resource monopolisation, in turn increasing within‐group variation in food intake and growth. However, the effects of food distribution may depend on foraging strategies. Little is known about the impact of spatial food heterogeneity on growth and grouping behaviour in social foragers in the absence of monopolisation. Social foraging is present in many fishes, particularly at early juvenile life stages when fish are especially sensitive to environmental variation. Here, a heterogeneous food distribution may impair foraging success and growth and juveniles may increase sociability to attain social information about food resources. We examined the impact of the spatial distribution of food as well as inbreeding on growth and social behaviour in juveniles of the cichlid fish Pelvicachromis pulcher. Inbred individuals often show poorer performance than outbred individuals (inbreeding depression), but inbreeding effects can be environment dependent. In the experiment, inbred and outbred fish were reared in a split‐clutch design either under homogeneously distributed or spatially clumped food conditions for 8 weeks starting 1 week after juveniles could actively feed. We documented growth and performed a shoaling assay and a sociality test (choice between a large vs. a small shoal) after 6 weeks. Spatial food distribution did not affect within‐group body length variation, but individuals reared under clumped food conditions were smaller. Shoals of the different feeding conditions differed in social behaviour. Shoals of the clumped treatment group showed higher variation in inter‐individual distances compared to shoals of the homogeneous treatment group. Furthermore, focal fish of the clumped treatment adjusted their association preference to the position of the groups' largest individual. We did not find significant inbreeding or environment‐dependent inbreeding effects regarding growth or social behaviour. Our study suggests that a clumped food distribution can impede localisation of food resources and thus growth in juvenile social foragers. Accordingly, in heterogeneous environments, the use of social information may be highly relevant to increase individuals' foraging success potentially explaining orientation on successful foragers, that is, large individuals. Inter‐individual variation in juvenile’s social behaviour may precede variation in food monopolisation capability and in growth emerging at later life stages.

Single-chamber reactors inoculated with thermophiles and operated at 55 °C showed high CH₄ production rates (max. 1103 mmol m–² day–¹ at an applied voltage of 0.8 V) with current-capture efficiencies >90%, indicating that thermophiles have high potential as biocatalysts. To improve the electromethanogenic activity, the developed biocathode was transferred to a two-chamber reactor and operated at a poised potential of −0.5 V vs SHE. The CH₄ production rates of the biocathode were enhanced approximately 6-fold in 160 h of poised-potential incubation, indicating that the acclimation of the biocathode resulted in performance improvement. Compositional alteration of the cathodic microbiota suggested that a Methanothermobacter-related methanogen and synergistetes- and thermotogae-related bacteria were selected during the acclimation. Cyclic voltammetry of the “acclimated” biocathode showed an augmented cathodic catalytic wave with a midpoint potential at ca. −0.35 V vs SHE. Moreover, the biocathode was able to catalyze electromethanogenesis at −0.35 V vs SHE. These results suggested that the ability of the biocathode to catalyze electromethanogenesis via direct electron transfer was enhanced by the acclimation. This study provides new technological and fundamental information on electromethanogenic bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) that may be extended to other BESs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3abacteria 3abiocatalysts 3abiocathodes 3abioelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3athermophilic microorganisms1 aKuramochi, Yoshihiro1 aFukushima, Naoya1 aMaeda, Haruo1 aSato, Kozo1 aKobayashi, Hajime0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Jan. 20, v. 49, no. 2 p.1225-1232dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50522333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013200163300001600295520163300311592002801944650003701972650001602009650003502025650001402060650001102074650001702085650004902102650001502151650002602166650002202192650001402214650001902228650000702247650002102254650002502275653002502300653003302325653003602358653002802394700002002422700001302442700001702455700001702472700001602489700001602505700001702521773012202538856008302660852000902743655001202752IND60750150420221119044144.0220314e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075015042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.1682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Zhuang10aAmorphous cobalt oxide decorated halloysite nanotubes for efficient sulfamethoxazole degradation activated by peroxymonosulfate  ap. 857-868.  aIn this study, a new hollow nanotube material, 30% Co–CHNTs was prepared by the impregnation–chemical reduction–calcination method. This material can be used as a peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator to catalyse the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The best reaction conditions that correspond to the degradation rate of SMX, up to 97.5%, are as follows: the concentration of SMX is 10 mg L⁻¹, the amount of catalyst is 0.20 g L⁻¹, the dosage is 1.625 mM, and the solution pH is 6.00. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) show that the calcined composites mainly stimulate an increase in the content of bivalent cobalt in PMS and reduce the leaching of cobalt ions after the reaction. Additionally, the 30% Co–CHNTs + PMS reaction system exhibits a reasonable SMX degradation rate in a natural organic matter solution and excellent stability after three repeated experiments. Furthermore, the possible degradation mechanism in the 30% Co–CHNTs + PMS reaction system was analysed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and free-radical capture experiments, and it was observed that the non-radical degradation of ¹O₂ plays a leading role in SMX degradation. Finally, according to the nine degradation intermediates detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS), four possible SMX degradation routes were proposed. This study proved that a 30% Co–CHNTs heterogeneous catalyst is easily prepared, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly and has potential application in antibiotic wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantibiotics 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahalloysite 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ananotubes 3aorganic matter 3apH 3asulfamethoxazole 3awastewater treatment 0aHalloysite nanotubes 0aPeroxymonosulfate activation 0aDegradation of sulfamethoxazole 0aLow metal leaching rate1 aWang, Huaisheng1 aLi, Meng1 aFeng, Ligang1 aNiu, Jianrui1 aLi, Zaixing1 aJia, Xiuxiu1 aHu, Guangzhi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.857-868dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245009100209500002200300520103600322592002801358650002101386650001201407650002201419650001101441650000901452650002401461650001601485650001101501653002601512653001201538653001401550653001301564653001201577700002101589700002101610700002801631773007401659856008501733852000901818655001201827IND60656138020221119071855.0190809e20190805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065613802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1158922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Guangming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7941-972510aThermodynamic analysis of ejector cooling cycles with heat-driven feed pumping devices  aPre-press version  aThe paper presents the results of thermodynamic analysis of ejector cooling cycles with heat pumping devices which supply the working fluid to the vapor generator. Two variants of heat pumping devices are considered in which the feed pump is driven by (1) an expander and a turbine and (2) a turbine. A mathematical model for determining the energy and exergy characteristics of the pumping devices and ejector systems as a whole is proposed. Refrigerant R245ca is selected as an environmentally friendly low-boiling working fluid of the ejector cooling cycles. The paper analyzes the effect of condensing and generating temperatures on the characteristics of ejector cooling cycles for the air conditioning systems. It is shown that the use of the work obtained in the expander and turbine taking into account the irreversibility of the working processes in the pumping devices leads to a slight decrease in the energy efficiency of the proposed systems, and, at the same time, it significantly increases their exergic efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3acooling 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3aheat 3amathematical models 3atemperature 3avapors 0aEjector cooling cycle 0aEjector 0aFeed pump 0aExpander 0aTurbine1 aIerin, Volodymyr1 aVolovyk, Oleksii1 aShestopalov, Kostyantyn0 tEnergy.g2019 Aug. 05, dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1158923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009200165520103000257592002801287650003801315650001901353650001601372650001301388650000901401650001101410650001101421650002201432650001201454650001301466650001101479700002301490700002601513700002401539700002501563700002501588773012001613856007801733852000901811655001201820IND60757692820221120090550.0211125e20211107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075769282DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101127252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRacioppo, Angela 10aFish Loss/Waste and Low-Value Fish Challenges: State of Art, Advances, and Perspectives  aThe sustainability of fishery is a global challenge due to overfishing and reduced stocks all over the world; one of the leading factors of this threat is fish loss/waste. As a contribution to the global efforts towards a sustainable world, this review addresses the topic from different sides and proposes an overview of biorefinery approaches by discussing bioactive compounds that could be produced from fish loss (nitrogen compounds, lipids, minerals and pigments, and fish-based compounds such as chitosan). The second part of this review reports on the possibility of using loss or unwanted fish to design products for human consumption or for animal feeding, with a focus on economic criteria, consumers’ segmentation, and some examples of products. The final focus is on Food and Agriculture Organization FAO guidelines as a roadmap for the future with respect to solving this threat by addressing the problem from different sides (technology, skills, market, policy, social and gender equity, and infrastructures).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aanimal feeding 3abiorefining 3achitosan 3afish 3agender 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3anitrogen 3awastes1 aSperanza, Barbara 1 aCampaniello, Daniela 1 aSinigaglia, Milena 1 aCorbo, Maria Rosaria1 aBevilacqua, Antonio 0 tFoods.g2021 Nov. 07, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101127253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245016000207300002000367506007600387520164700463592002802110506003702138650001502175650001802190650001302208650001002221650003102231650001002262650000802272650001502280650002302295650001102318650001902329650002402348650001202372650000902384650001702393651001802410653001002428653002102438653002102459653002502480700002202505700002102527700002002548700002102568700002302589700001902612700002302631700002302654700001902677700001602696700001702712700002002729700002302749700002402772700002102796700002502817773017702842856007903019852000903098655001203107IND60172268520221207115715.0150602e20120911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017226852DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12035251092doi7 aPMC34431232pmcid7 a229273972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurley, Paula J.10aSecreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine-like 1 (SPARCL1) is down regulated in aggressive prostate cancers and is prognostic for poor clinical outcome  ap. 14977-14982.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among United States men. However, disease aggressiveness is varied, with low-grade disease often being indolent and high-grade cancer accounting for the greatest density of deaths. Outcomes are also disparate among men with high-grade prostate cancer, with upwards of 65% having disease recurrence even after primary treatment. Identification of men at risk for recurrence and elucidation of the molecular processes that drive their disease is paramount, as these men are the most likely to benefit from multimodal therapy. We previously showed that androgen-induced expression profiles in prostate development are reactivated in aggressive prostate cancers. Herein, we report the down-regulation of one such gene, Sparcl1 , a secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) family matricellular protein, during invasive phases of prostate development and regeneration. We further demonstrate a parallel process in prostate cancer, with decreased expression of SPARCL1 in high-grade/metastatic prostate cancer. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that SPARCL1 loss increases the migratory and invasive properties of prostate cancer cells through Ras homolog gene family, member C (RHOC), a known mediator of metastatic progression. By using models incorporating clinicopathologic parameters to predict prostate cancer recurrence after treatment, we show that SPARCL1 loss is a significant, independent prognostic marker of disease progression. Thus, SPARCL1 is a potent regulator of cell migration/invasion and its loss is independently associated with prostate cancer recurrence.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaggression 3acell movement 3acysteine 3adeath 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amen 3ametastasis 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aprostatic neoplasms 3arelapse 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3aUnited States 0aHevin 0asynaptic cleft 1 0aurogenital sinus 0aextracellular matrix1 aMarchionni, Luigi1 aSimons, Brian W.1 aRoss, Ashley E.1 aPeskoe, Sarah B.1 aMiller, Rebecca M.1 aErho, Nicholas1 aVergara, Ismael A.1 aGhadessi, Mercedeh1 aHuang, Zhenhua1 aGurel, Bora1 aPark, Ben Ho1 aDavicioni, Elai1 aJenkins, Robert B.1 aPlatz, Elizabeth A.1 aBerman, David M.1 aSchaeffer, Edward M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Sept. 11, v. 109, no. 37 p.14977-14982dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12035251093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011000168300001600278520158400294592002801878650002201906650001401928650001001942650001201952650001201964650001901976650001601995650001502011650001402026650001202040700002402052700001802076773010802094852000902202856008102211930003302292946001102325655001202336IND60438788820221118044047.0151023e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-006-0206-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkorupski, Peter10aPhotoreceptor spectral sensitivity in island and mainland populations of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris  ap. 485-494.  aMost species of flower-visiting Hymenoptera are trichromatic, with photoreceptor spectral sensitivity peaks in the UV, blue and green regions of the spectrum. Red flowers, therefore, should be relatively difficult to detect for such insects. Nevertheless, in population biological studies in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, the Sardinian island population (B. t. sassaricus) displayed significantly higher responses to red artificial flowers (in tests of innate colour choice and detectability) than several mainland populations of the same species (Chittka et al. in Cognitive ecology of pollination, pp 106–126, 2001; Popul Ecol 46:243–251, 2004). Since there is relatively little physiological data on population differences in sensory systems, we used intracellular recording to compare photoreceptor spectral sensitivity in B. t. sassaricus and the southern European and Mediterranean population, B. t. dalmatinus. The results show both populations to be UV–blue–green trichromats, but with a small but significant increase in long-wave sensitivity in island bees. Spectral peaks were estimated at 348, 435 and 533 nm (B. t. dalmatinus) and 347, 436 and 538 nm (B. t. sassaricus) for UV, blue and green receptors, respectively. There were no significant differences in UV and blue receptor sensitivities. We found no photoreceptors maximally sensitive to red spectral light in the Sardinian population and model calculations indicate that the behavioural population differences in colour responses cannot be directly explained by receptor population differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus terrestris 3acognition 3acolor 3aflowers 3ainsects 3aphotoreceptors 3apollination 3apopulation 3areceptors 3atesting1 aDöring, Thomas F.,1 aChittka, Lars0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2007 May, v. 193, no. 5 p.485-494dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-006-0206-63Available from publisher's site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02468naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015200175520107600327592002801403650002901431650002101460650001301481650001601494650001401510650001701524650001301541650001401554650001601568650000901584650001401593653002101607653000901628653001101637653002901648653002301677700001901700700002201719700002201741700005801763773010701821856008501928852000902013655001202022IND60734061720221122054849.0211213e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073406172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1090692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllegro, Angelica R.10aUptake and replication in Acanthamoeba castellanii of a virulent (pVAPA-positive) strain of Rhodococcus equi and its isogenic, plasmid-cured strain  aRhodococcus equi is a soil saprophytic bacterium and intracellular pathogen that causes pneumonia in foals. Strains of R. equi that are virulent in foals contain a plasmid that encodes a virulence-associated protein A (VapA) necessary for replication in macrophages. Because other intracellular pathogens survive and replicate inside amoebae, we postulated that the VapA-bearing plasmid (pVAPA) confers a survival advantage for R. equi against environmental predators like amoebae. To test this hypothesis, we compared phagocytosis by and survival in Acanthamoeba castellanii of isogenic strains of pVAPA-positive and pVAPA-negative R. equi. Phagocytosis of the pVAPA-negative strain by A. castellanii was significantly (P < 0.0001) greater than the pVAPA-positive strain. Intracellular replication of the pVAPA-positive strain in A. castellanii was significantly (P < 0.0001) greater than the pVAPA-negative strain during both 48 h and 9 days. These results indicate that the presence of the VapA plasmid reduces uptake and aids replication of R. equi in A. castellanii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba castellanii 3aRhodococcus equi 3abacteria 3amacrophages 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3aplasmids 3apneumonia 3asaprophytes 3asoil 3avirulence 0aRhodococcus equi 0aVapA 0aAmoeba 0aAcanthamoeba castellanii 0aBacterial survival1 aBarhoumi, Rola1 aBordin, Angela I.1 aBray, Jocelyne M.1 aCohen, Noah D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0384-29030 tVeterinary microbiology.g2021 June, v. 257 p.109069-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1090693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011100174300001600285520099300301592002801294650002701322650003101349650001801380650002001398650002001418650001801438650001901456650001801475650001601493650000901509650003701518650001701555650001701572650003501589650003001624650001101654650001001665650001201675700001901687700002001706700002001726773009901746856008501845852000901930655001201939IND60080829120221118134351.0140812e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008082912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2010.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Carolyn D.10aTick saliva regulates migration, phagocytosis, and gene expression in the macrophage-like cell line, IC-21  ap. 665-671.  aWe studied the effects of tick saliva on cell migration, cell signaling, phagocytosis, and gene expression in the murine macrophage cell line, IC-21. Saliva increased both basal- and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated migration in IC-21 cells. However, saliva did not affect PDGF-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Zymosan-mediated interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) activity increased when cells were pretreated with saliva. Saliva suppressed phagocytosis of zymosan particles by IC-21 cells. An RT² Profiler™ PCR Array revealed that saliva regulates gene expression in a manner consistent with an immune response skewed toward a Th2 reaction, which is characterized by production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Our results using IC-21 cells suggest that Dermacentor variabilis has evolved a mechanism for regulating macrophage function, which may contribute to the tick’s ability to modulate immune function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermacentor variabilis 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acell movement 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-4 3amacrophages 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aparasitology 3aphagocytosis 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asaliva 3aticks 3azymosan1 aPoole, Nina M.1 aCoons, Lewis B.1 aCole, Judith A.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2011 Mar., v. 127, no. 3 p.665-671dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2010.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011900172520203500291592002802326650001102354650001202365650001202377650002902389650001502418650001702433650001902450650001502469650003102484650001102515650001502526650002302541650001102564650001302575650000702588650001702595650000902612650000902621650001902630650001902649650000902668650001102677651002202688653001902710653002502729653001702754653002002771653002402791700002202815700002202837700002302859700002602882773010202908856008503010852000903095655001203104IND60647130120221117093051.0190628e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064713012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.1041162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBateman, Amber M.10aWater availability drives the effectiveness of inorganic amendments to increase plant growth and substrate quality  aIn a time when global climate variability threatens the sustainability and productivity of arid ecosystems, the development of effective strategies to recover and protect soil resources and biota is crucial for the survival of these landscapes. With 20% of arid systems degraded and estimates of up to 10 Mha of land degrading each year, this issue is of global importance. In the semi-arid Pilbara region of north-west Western Australia, climatic projections suggest reductions in annual rainfall and high unpredictability of rain events. However, as these ancient landscapes are already degraded due to meteorological processes and anthropogenic activities, such as mining, the rehabilitation of this land is severely challenging. Here, we present a case study that examines, under different rainfall scenarios, the effect of two inorganic amendments (gypsum and urea) on substrate quality and growth of two plant species (Acacia inaequilatera and Triodia wiseana) native to the Pilbara region. Through an extensive glasshouse experiment, two doses of inorganic amendments were tested and compared to unamended mining waste (overburden) substrates extracted from an iron-ore mine of moderately alkaline pH and low nitrogen status. Our results showed that the addition of urea (nitrogen-based fertiliser) produced a three-fold increase of plant growth in A. inaequilatera and up to a 25-fold increase in T. wiseana compared to unamended substrates when grown under the higher watering regime but this effect was not evident in the lower water regimes. The inorganic amendments decreased pH and increased EC, total nitrogen and N-mineralisation but did not have a significant effect on soil microbial activity. Overall, water was the dominant driver for determining the effectiveness of the substrate amendments to improve the quality of mine waste substrates and increase plant growth. This study contributes to unravelling the role of inorganic amendments in post-mining rehabilitation in arid regions faced with climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aTriodia 3aWiseana 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarid zones 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agypsum 3alandscapes 3amicrobial activity 3amining 3anitrogen 3apH 3aplant growth 3arain 3asoil 3asoil resources 3atotal nitrogen 3aurea 3awastes 3aWestern Australia 0aClimate change 0aSubstrate amendments 0aArid systems 0aSoil indicators 0aLand rehabilitation1 aErickson, Todd E.1 aMerritt, David J.1 aVeneklaas, Erik J.1 aMuñoz-Rojas, Miriam,0 tCatena.g2019 Nov., v. 182 p.104116-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.1041163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245009500210520167600305592002801981650001702009650001102026650000902037650001302046650001102059650001702070650001502087650001602102650001302118650001202131653001602143653001502159653001802174653001602192653001202208653002702220700006102247700002102308700002102329773010702350856008502457852000902542655001202551IND60734061820221122074141.0211213e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073406182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1090702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouetil, Laurent1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1516-666610aEquine respiratory viruses, airway inflammation and performance in thoroughbred racehorses  aEquine asthma is a common cause of poor performance in racehorses but it is unclear if respiratory viruses contribute to its etiology. The objective of the study was to determine if respiratory viruses were associated with clinical signs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology in Thoroughbred racehorses. Equine herpesviruses (EHV-1, 2, 4, 5) and equine rhinitis A and B viruses (ERBV, ERAV) genomes were quantified by qPCR in nasopharyngeal, tracheal, and BALF samples collected after racing. The relationships between virus detection and load and clinical signs, performance, BALF cytology, and environmental exposures were examined with generalized linear mixed models. Ninety-two samples were collected from 31 horses. EHV-1 and ERAV were not found; EHV-4 was detected in only one sample. EHV-2, EHV-5 and ERBV were more likely to be detected in upper airway samples than in BALF (P < 0.0001). Neither respiratory virus detection nor load was associated with clinical signs or performance. Nasopharyngeal detection and load of ERBV and tracheal detection and load of EHV-5 were associated with increased proportions of neutrophils in BALF (P < 0.003). However, nasopharyngeal detection and load of EHV-5 was not (P = 0.11). Nasopharyngeal detection and load of EHV-2 were associated with decreased BALF mast cell proportions. Respirable dust exposures were significantly higher in horses with detection of ERBV when compared to horses with no detectable ERBV (P < 0.001). Our results suggest that ERBV, EHV-2 and EHV-5 are commonly present in upper airways of healthy racehorses; however, the role they play in the etiology of equine asthma remains unclear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThoroughbred 3aasthma 3adust 3aetiology 3agenome 3ainflammation 3amast cells 3aneutrophils 3arhinitis 3aviruses 0aHerpesvirus 0aRhinovirus 0aEquine asthma 0aNasopharynx 0aTrachea 0aBronchoalveolar lavage1 aIvester, Kathleen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7873-03751 aBarnum, Samantha1 aPusterla, Nicola0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2021 June, v. 257 p.109070-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1090703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011100163300001800274520107800292592002801370650001401398650002501412650001301437650001101450650001301461650002401474650001101498650002301509650002401532650001301556700001501569700001201584700001801596700002001614700001501634700001701649773012601666856008201792852000901874655001201883IND60567860120221119220730.0170428e20170126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056786012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b120562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Guodian10aEffect of Benzyl Functionality on Microwave-Assisted Cleavage of Cα–Cβ Bonds in Lignin Model Compounds  ap. 1537-1545.  aThe effect of benzylic alcohol (CαOH) pretreatments on microwave-assisted cleavage of CαCᵦ bonds in lignin model compounds was investigated by combining experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level. The oxidization of CαOH to benzylic ketone (CαO) facilitated the cleavage of the CαCᵦ bond due to a greater decomposition rate constant and a lower barrier for the decomposition-determining step. The reduction of CαOH to benzylic hydrogen (CαH) resulted in no CαCᵦ bond being cleaved. Since the CαOH quickly reacted with methanol solvent, the etherification of CαOH to benzylic ether (CαOCH₃) had no effect on the CαCᵦ bond cleavage. The aromatic aldehyde would be obtained from the model compounds containing CαOH or CαOCH₃, while the model compound containing CαO would produce aromatic ester. The research also revealed that the microwave-assisted cleavage of CαCᵦ bonds followed a first-order kinetic and radical reaction mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acleavage (chemistry) 3ahydrogen 3alignin 3amethanol 3amicrowave treatment 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3areaction mechanisms 3asolvents1 aLin, Meilu1 aFan, Di1 aNing, Wenshan1 aOuyang, Xinping1 aQian, Yong1 aQiu, Xueqing0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Jan. 26, v. 121, no. 3 p.1537-1545dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b120563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245014100181500001900322520195700341592002802298650002202326650001102348650001402359650001002373650001502383650002102398650001102419650001402430650001402444650001102458650000902469650002302478651001402501651001002515653001702525653001802542653001902560653001302579700001702592700001602609700002602625773009102651856008402742852000902826655001202835IND60656138320221119072017.0200110e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065613832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2019.1514472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández Honaine, Mariana10aAnatomical traits, silica content and herbivory damage in leaves of invasive tree Ligustrum lucidum developed in novel and native ranges  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLigustrum lucidum is an invasive tree in many regions, but scarce work analyzes its anatomical or eco-functional traits and its relation with herbivores, an important issue to be addressed by invaders in new areas. On the other hand, amorphous silica accumulation is an important anti-herbivore component in grasses, but its role in eudicots has been little explored. To analyze if anatomical and eco-functional traits, silica accumulation and herbivory damage are modified by phenological stages or environmental conditions, and if herbivory damage is negatively correlated with silica content, we analyzed shade and sun leaves of different ages from adult trees in novel (Argentina) and native (China) areas. Leaves were scanned, dried and weighed for specific leaf area estimation. Herbivore damage was calculated as the proportion of leaf surface eaten. Silica content was quantified through calcination and digestion techniques. The results showed that leaves from China had higher SLA than leaves from Argentina, and shade or young leaves had higher SLA than sun or old leaves. Herbivory was higher in old leaves compared to young ones. Mean silica concentration was 1.73%; it was higher in leaves from Argentina than in leaves from China and it increased with leaf age. Differences in silica concentration or SLA between samples are probably due to environmental conditions such as pollution degree, soil Si content, water availability and / or temperatures. The age of the leaves affected the values of SLA, silica content and herbivory damage. Along the life of the leaves, silica content increased approximately five times in ten months: older leaves became thicker, with a higher silica content, and a higher herbivory damage. Considering the same age of the leaf, silica concentration and herbivory damage were not correlated, therefore it was not possible to associate the silicification process with an antiherbivore role in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLigustrum lucidum 3aadults 3adigestion 3aflora 3aherbivores 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3aphenology 3apollution 3asilica 3asoil 3aspecific leaf area 3aArgentina 3aChina 0aLeaf anatomy 0aLeaf ontogeny 0aSilicification 0aInvasion1 aMontti, Lía1 aQi, Weilong1 aOsterrieth, Margarita0 tFlora.g2019 Sept., v. 258 p.151447-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2019.1514473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006900169300001800238506011700256520150500373592002801878506003701906650001801943650002301961650001601984650001002000650001102010650001902021653002202040653003102062653003202093653002902125653003302154653001802187653001502205700001802220700001802238773012802256856008302384852000902467655001202476IND60769550520221207083659.0220314s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076955052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2022.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Syed Danish10aIdentification of piRNA disease associations using deep learning  ap. 1208-1217.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aPiwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a pivotal role in maintaining genome integrity by repression of transposable elements, gene stability, and association with various disease progressions. Cost-efficient computational methods for the identification of piRNA disease associations promote the efficacy of disease-specific drug development. In this regard, we developed a simple, robust, and efficient deep learning method for identifying the piRNA disease associations known as piRDA. The proposed architecture extracts the most significant and abstract information from raw sequences represented in a simplicated piRNA disease pair without any involvement of features engineering. Two-step positive unlabeled learning and bootstrapping technique are utilized to abstain from the false-negative and biased predictions dealing with positive unlabeled data. The performance of proposed method piRDA is evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. The piRDA is significantly improved in all the performance evaluation measures for the identification of piRNA disease associations in comparison to state-of-the-art method. Moreover, it is thus projected conclusively that the proposed computational method could play a significant role as a supportive and practical tool for primitive disease mechanisms and pharmaceutical research such as in academia and drug design.

Our iPOP analysis revealed various medical risks, including type 2 diabetes. It also uncovered extensive, dynamic changes in diverse molecular components and biological pathways across healthy and diseased conditions. Extremely high-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data, which provide the basis of our iPOP, revealed extensive heteroallelic changes during healthy and diseased states and an unexpected RNA editing mechanism. This study demonstrates that longitudinal iPOP can be used to interpret healthy and diseased states by connecting genomic information with additional dynamic omics activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA editing 3aautoantibodies 3agenomics 3amedicine 3ametabolomics 3amonitoring 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aphenotype 3aproteomics 3arisk 3atranscriptomics1 aMias, George I.1 aLi-Pook-Than, Jennifer1 aJiang, Lihua1 aLam, Hugo Y.K.1 aChen, Rong1 aMiriami, Elana1 aKarczewski, Konrad J.,1 aHariharan, Manoj1 aDewey, Frederick E.1 aCheng, Yong1 aClark, Michael J.,1 aIm, Hogune1 aHabegger, Lukas1 aBalasubramanian, Suganthi1 aO'Huallachain, Maeve1 aDudley, Joel T.,1 aHillenmeyer, Sara1 aHaraksingh, Rajini1 aSharon, Donald1 aEuskirchen, Ghia1 aLacroute, Phil1 aBettinger, Keith1 aBoyle, Alan P.1 aKasowski, Maya1 aGrubert, Fabian1 aSeki, Scott1 aGarcia, Marco1 aWhirl-Carrillo, Michelle1 aGallardo, Mercedes1 aBlasco, Maria A.1 aGreenberg, Peter L.,1 aSnyder, Phyllis1 aKlein, Teri E.,1 aAltman, Russ B.1 aButte, Atul J.1 aAshley, Euan A.,1 aGerstein, Mark1 aNadeau, Kari C.1 aTang, Hua1 aSnyder, Michael0 tCell.g2012 Mar. 16, v. 148, no. 6 p.1293-1307dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006100170300001600231520119400247536027801441592002801719596012901747650001301876650002401889650001301913650001801926651001601944653002101960653000801981653001301989653001502002653001902017700003902036700001602075773015402091856008602245852000902331655001202340IND60779435820221121093910.0220608e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943582DNAL7 a10.1080/01140671.2022.20548272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurdon, Jeremy10aDehydration and the ripening of ‘Hass’ avocado fruit  ap. 178-194.  aWater loss from fruit, including avocado, has been reported to accelerate ripening. ‘Hass’ avocado fruit were imaged by MRI shortly after harvest and the proton density (PD) and spin-spin relaxation time constant T ₂ data extracted for regions of interest. Water was then driven off at two rates (designated as Fast and Slow) with respiratory activity and ethylene production of the individual fruit monitored as non-destructive markers of ripening. Fruit from the Slow drying treatment ripened several days later, but with less water loss, than fruit from the Fast drying treatment. There was a correlation in the Slow drying treatment for fruit with higher PD and T ₂ values to take longer to ripen. This trend was clearest for the inner mesocarp data. However, there was a weaker, inverse, relationship for fruit in the Fast drying treatment. Therefore, the relationship between water content and ripening seems to be affected by the rate of water loss. It is concluded that the capacity for water loss to accelerate avocado fruit ripening is confirmed. It also appears that MRI data collected at harvest may be indicative of the time that a fruit would naturally take to ripen.  aThe authors gratefully acknowledge the New Zealand Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE; Contract C11X1305) for funding as part of the ‘Avocados for export – delivery on an industry vision’ research programme in conjunction with New Zealand Avocado.  aPublisher supplied data  aMBIE; Contract C11X1305cNew Zealand Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employmentdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004629 3aavocados 3aethylene production 3amesocarp 3awater content 3aNew Zealand 0aPersea americana 0aMRI 0aethylene 0awater loss 0awater mobility1 aBilling, David E.q(David Edward),1 aKerr, Karen0 tNew Zealand journal of crop and horticultural science.g2022 July 03, v. 50, no. 2-3 p.178-194dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000127x1175-87837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01140671.2022.20548273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04805naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009400170300001600264520384700280592002804127653002804155653001704183653001304200653002604213700002104239700001804260773014704278856008104425852000904506655001204515IND60128008020221121002152.0151114e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012800802DNAL7 a10.1614/IPSM-D-11-00083.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatlaga, David P.,10aAge-Dependent Demographic Rates of the Bioenergy Crop Miscanthus × giganteus in Illinois  ap. 238-248.  aSome plants being considered as bioenergy crops share traits with invasive species and have histories of spreading outside of their native ranges, highlighting the importance of evaluating the invasive potential before the establishment of large-scale plantings. The Asian grass Miscanthus × giganteus is currently being planted as a bioenergy crop in the north central region of the United States. Our goal was to understand the demographic rates and vegetative spread of this species in unmanaged arable lands in Illinois to compare with those of large-statured invasive grasses (LSIGs). We collected data from 13 M. × giganteus plantings in Illinois, ranging in age from 1 to 7 yr, recording tiller number, plant spatial extent, spikelet production, and plant survival over 4 yr. Additionally, to understand recruitment potential, we conducted a greenhouse germination experiment, and, to estimate establishment from rhizome fragments, field trials were performed. Miscanthus × giganteus demographic rates were age dependent. Spikelet production was high, with 1- and 4-yr plants producing an annual average of more than 10,000 and 180,000 spikelets plant⁻¹, respectively; however, data from our germination trial suggested that none of these spikelets had the potential to yield seedlings. On average, plants expanded vegetatively 0.15 m yr⁻¹. Tiller density within the center of a clone decreased with age, possibly leading to a “dead center” found among some LSIGs. Rhizome establishment increased with weight, ranging from 0 to 42%. Survival was low, 24%, for first-year plants but quickly climbed to an asymptote of 98% survival for 4-yr-old plants. Our results suggest that efforts should be made to eradicate plants that escape biomass production fields within a year of establishment, before the onset of high survival. Future work is needed to determine what types of natural and anthropogenic disturbances can fragment rhizomes, leading to regeneration.Nomenclature: Miscanthus × giganteus Greef et Deu ex Hodkinson et Renvoize, Giant miscanthus.Management Implications: As demand for alternative fuels continues to grow, biofuels from herbaceous perennial biomass crops will be an important component of the U.S. energy portfolio. Before growing such crops across wide areas, it is important to understand both the risks and benefits of such an action. Because of similarities between many bioenergy crops and plant invaders, and the onset of new projects to scale-up biomass production rapidly in the Midwest, it is important to understand the potential behavior of candidate species for bioenergy production outside of cultivation. We quantified the age-specific demographic rates of the Illinois clone variety of Miscanthus × giganteus, a leading bioenergy crop in the Midwest. All M. × giganteus demographic rates were strongly dependent on plant age. Spikelet production was low in first-year plants and rose to more than 180,000 spikelets per plant by the fourth year, but none yielded seedlings. Vegetative expansion of M. × giganteus was moderate compared with other large grasses; 4-yr-old plants were observed to have an average vegetative creep radius of 0.15 m yr⁻¹. Survival of first-year plants was low, 24%, but quickly rose to 97% by the fourth year. The lack of viable seed production and slow vegetative expansion in M. × giganteus observed in this study suggest that the sterile clonal cultivar for this bioenergy crop has low invasive potential in Illinois, assuming that the tough rhizomes are not fragmented by disturbance. However, several similarities between M. × giganteus and other large-statured invasive grasses suggest that caution must be taken when introducing this species, and the potential for rhizome establishment and dispersal must be explored in greater detail.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMiscanthus × giganteus 0abiofeedstock 0aIllinois 0arhizome establishment1 aSchutte, Brian J1 aDavis, Adam S0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2012 Apr., v. 5, no. 2 p.238-248dWeed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-72917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614/IPSM-D-11-00083.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100003400136245009400170300001600264520150800280592002801788653002201816653001801838653002701856653001501883700002401898700001901922700002701941700002501968700002201993700002702015700003402042700002002076773015502096856007202251852000902323655001202332IND60128995120221118015845.0151124e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012899512DNAL7 a10.2987/5667.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcíía-Rejóón, Julian E.10aGonotrophic Cycle Estimate for Culex quinquefasciatus in Méérida, Yucatáán, Mééxico  ap. 344-348.  aWest Nile virus (WNV) has been present in the Yucatáán State, Mééxico, since 2002. Culex quinquefasciatus, one of the main vectors of WNV transmission in the United States, is also common in Mexico and may be a key vector of WNV transmission to humans in the Yucatáán. The aim of this study was to determine the length of the gonotrophic cycle and the survival rates of Cx. quinquefasciatus from Méérida, Yucatáán, during the rainy versus the dry season. Mosquitoes were collected during 25-day periods in October (rainy season) and in April (dry season), and captured females were classified by abdominal appearance (freshly fed, late-stage fed, half gravid, and subgravid). To determine the age structure as nulliparous and parous females and to calculate the gonotrophic cycle through a time series and the mosquito survival, we used Davidson formulae. Also, vitellogenesis analysis to monitor egg maturity was conducted during both seasons. Cross-correlation data suggested a similar length of the gonotrophic cycle (4 days) in both seasons. Oogenic development required a minimum of 72 h in each season. However, survival of the mosquito population collected in the rainy season was significantly higher (0.91) with a mean temperature of 28 ±± 1.57°°C than was survival in the dry season (0.78) with a mean temperature of 29 ±± 1.10°°C. Survival, although higher during the rainy season, did not influence the length of the gonotrophic cycle of Cx. quinquefasciatus in Yucatáán.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGonotrophic cycle 0asurvival rate 0aCulex quinquefasciatus 0aYucatáán1 aFarfan-Ale, Jose A.1 aUlloa, Armando1 aFlores-Flores, Luis F.1 aRosado-Paredes, Elsy1 aBaak-Baak, Carlos1 aLoroño-Pino, Maria A.1 aFernáández-Salas, Ildefonso1 aBeaty, Barry J.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2008 Sept., v. 24, no. 3 p.344-348dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F5667.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011800155300001600273500001400289520097000303592002801273650002001301650001401321650001801335650002501353650001101378650001901389650002001408650001801428650001201446650001601458650001001474650002101484650002501505653001901530653001201549653003201561700002001593700001701613700002101630700002301651700002201674700002001696700001601716773018301732856007301915852000901988655001201997IND60692358720221119105553.0200502e20080123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069235872DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.705082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNAKAI, Yuji10aUp-Regulation of Genes Related to the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System in the Brown Adipose Tissue of 24-h-Fasted Rats  ap. 139-148.  aNAL-light  aThe functional balance between brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) is important for metabolic homeostasis. We compared the effects of fasting on the gene expression profiles in BAT, WAT and liver by using a DNA microarray analysis. Tissues were obtained from rats that had been fed or fasted for 24 h. Taking the false discovery rate into account, we extracted the top 1,000 genes that had been differentially expressed between the fed and fasted rats. In all three tissues, a Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the lipid and protein biosynthesis-related genes had been markedly down-regulated. The whole-body fuel shift from glucose to triacylglycerol and the induction of autophagy were also observed. There was marked up-regulation of genes in the ‘protein ubiquitination’ category particularly in BAT of the fasted rats, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome system was involved in saving energy as an adaptation to food shortage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA microarrays 3aautophagy 3abiotechnology 3abrown adipose tissue 3aenergy 3afood shortages 3agene expression 3agene ontology 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3aliver 3atriacylglycerols 3awhite adipose tissue 0aDNA microarray 0afasting 0aubiquitin-proteasome system1 aHASHIDA, Hiroko1 aKADOTA, Koji1 aMinami, Michiko,1 aShimizu, Kentarō,1 aMATSUMOTO, Ichiro1 aKato, Hisanori,1 aAbe, Keiko,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2008 Jan. 23, v. 72, no. 1 p.139-148dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.705083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01435naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002700136245014700163300001600310520035600326592002800682653001300710653001200723653002000735653001400755653002200769700002300791700001900814700001800833700002200851773015500873856007201028852000901100655001201109IND60128995220221118015722.0151124e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012899522DNAL7 a10.2987/5669.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Catherine L.

In southeastern North Carolina, several large, natural, lacustrine systems (i.e., Carolina bay lakes) exist within the geomorphological features known as Carolina bays. Within the current distribution of Carolina bays, Bladen and Columbus counties (North Carolina) contain the only known examples of Carolina bay lakes. The Carolina bay lakes can be split into two major divisions, the “Bladen Lakes Group” which is characterized as being relatively unproductive (dystrophic – oligotrophic), and Lake Waccamaw, which stands alone in Columbus County and is known for its high productivity and species richness. Although there have been several studies conducted on these unique lentic systems, none have documented the flora comprehensively. Over the 2013−2014 growing seasons, the littoral zone flora of Carolina bay lakes was surveyed and vouchered. Literature reviews and herbarium crawls complemented this fieldwork to produce an inventory of the vascular plant species. This survey detected 205 taxa (species/subspecies and varieties) in 136 genera and 80 vascular plant families. Thirty-one species (15.2%) are of conservation concern. Lake Waccamaw exhibited the highest species richness with 145 catalogued taxa and 26 species of conservation concern. Across all sites, the Cyperaceae (25 spp.), Poaceae (21 spp.), Asteraceae (13 spp.), Ericaceae (8 spp.), Juncaceae (8 spp.), and Lentibulariaceae (6 spp.) were the six most species-rich vascular plant families encountered. A guide to the littoral zone flora of Carolina bay lakes is presented herein, including dichotomous keys, species accounts (including abundance, habitat, phenology, and exsiccatae), as well as images of living species and vouchered specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aCyperaceae 3aEricaceae 3aJuncaceae 3aLentibulariaceae 3aPoaceae 3acoastal plains 3aflora 3ahabitats 3aherbaria 3ainventories 3alakes 3alentic systems 3alittoral zone 3aphenology 3aspecies richness 3asurveys 3avascular plants 3aGeorgia 3aNorth Carolina 0aNorth American southeastern Coastal Plain lakes 0afloristics 0aaquatic 0aemersed vegetation1 aKrings, Alexander1 aBraham, Richard R.,0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 4 p.e7964-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.4.e79643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008400166300001600250520196300266592002802229653002802257653002002285653002002305653001602325653002602341653002402367700002402391773013702415856008002552852000902632655001202641IND60130016420221120033022.0151126e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013001642DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-09-00075.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, Jack L.10aLack of Native Vegetation Recovery Following Biological Control of Leafy Spurge  ap. 553-563.  aLeafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) is an aggressive exotic species that has been successfully suppressed in a variety of situations using classical biological control (flea beetles; Aphthona spp.). This 9-yr study investigated patterns of vegetation responses following significant reductions in leafy spurge cover and density by flea beetles in southeastern Montana. We hypothesized that the vegetation following leafy spurge suppression would be dominated by species and plant functional groups able to persist through heavy infestations. Flea beetles were first released in 1998, and by 2006 leafy spurge foliar cover was reduced 80%% to 90%% compared to 1998 values on both release and nonrelease plots. Although total cover of the resident vegetation, excluding leafy spurge, increased 72%% to 88%%, relative cover of the functional groups (native forbs, native sedges, native grasses, and non-native species) was similar among years and between release and nonrelease plots. Mean diversity and mean species richness values did not differ among years or between release and nonrelease plots (P < 0.05), but mean diversity on both release and nonrelease plots was significantly less than noninfested plots, although richness was similar (P < 0.05). Indicator species analysis revealed that non-native Poa spp. replaced leafy spurge as the dominant species on release and nonrelease plots. Conversely, noninfested plots contained a variety of native species with high indicator values. Although total abundance of the resident vegetation in 2006 was significantly greater than 1998, plant species composition and relative cover showed little change for the duration of the study. Failure of the native vegetation to recover to a community that approached nearby noninfested conditions may be attributed to a variety of interacting scenarios, some of which may be ameliorated by treating infestations as soon as possible to avoid long-term residual effects.  aPublisher supplied data 0abiological weed control 0aEuphorbia esula 0aexotic invasive 0aflea beetle 0aNorthern Great Plains 0arestoration ecology1 aWacker, Stefanie D.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2010 Sept., v. 63, no. 5 p.553-563dSociety for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111/REM-D-09-00075.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009000169300001600259520206000275592002802335650002102363650001002384650001502394650001202409650001502421650002302436650002202459650002102481650001402502650001502516650002602531650001302557650001002570650001102580650001102591653002402602653001402626653002202640653002402662700002402686700002402710700002602734700001702760773012802777856008302905852000902988655001202997IND60128008220221121002141.0151114e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012800822DNAL7 a10.1614/IPSM-D-11-00050.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndress, Bryan A.10aGrassland Response to Herbicides and Seeding of Native Grasses 6 Years Posttreatment  ap. 311-316.  aHerbicides are the primary method used to control exotic, invasive plants. This study evaluated restoration efforts applied to grasslands dominated by an invasive plant, sulfur cinquefoil, 6 yr after treatments. Of the five herbicides we evaluated, picloram continued to provide the best control of sulfur cinquefoil over 6 yr. We found the timing of picloram applications to be important to the native forb community. Plots with picloram applied in the fall had greater native forb cover. However, without the addition of native perennial grass seeds, the sites became dominated by exotic grasses. Seeding resulted in a 20% decrease in exotic grass cover. Successful establishment of native perennial grasses was not apparent until 6 yr after seeding. Our study found integrating herbicide application and the addition of native grass seed to be an effective grassland restoration strategy, at least in the case where livestock are excluded.Nomenclature: Picloram, sulfur cinquefoil, Potentilla recta L.Management Implications: If the objective is simply to reduce abundance of an invasive plant for temporary control, one application of the proper herbicide may suffice. This study found that a one-time application of picloram effectively reduced sulfur cinquefoil for 6 yr.Although herbicide applications were successful at reducing sulfur cinquefoil abundance, they were was not successful at reducing overall exotic plant cover, as other exotics species, primarily annual grasses generally replaced sulfur cinquefoil.Simply seeding native perennial grasses into plots was effective at reducing sulfur cinquefoil abundance, and herbicide application combined with native grasses seeding provided best control of sulfur cinquefoil while at the same time increasing native species abundance.Seeding success appeared poor in the first 1 to 3 yr because of the slow growth and small size of native perennial grass species in the years immediately following seeding. Therefore, longer-term monitoring is needed to evaluate success of seeding efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotentilla recta 3aforbs 3agrass seed 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3alivestock 3amonitoring 3apesticide application 3apicloram 3aseeds 3asowing 3asulfur 0aPotentilla recta L. 0arangeland 0asulfur cinquefoil 0awildlife management1 aParks, Catherine G.1 aNaylor, Bridgett J.1 aRadosevich, Steven R.1 aPorter, Mark0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2012 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.311-316dWeed Science Society of Americax1939-747X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FIPSM-D-11-00050.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245011600195300001600311500001400327500002000341520170300361592002802064596007502092650001702167650001002184650001702194650002702211650001502238650002302253650001002276650001802286650001802304650002002322650001302342700001902355700001802374700001502392700001202407700001302419700001802432700001602450700001302466700001802479700001702497700001302514700001502527700001602542700005802558773012402616856007302740852000902813655001202822IND60714389820221118052955.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071438982DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.131582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBawa, George1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4225-162010aGibberellins and auxin regulate soybean hypocotyl elongation under low light and high‐temperature interaction  ap. 345-356.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoybean is an important oilseed crop grown globally.

Here, we report that gibberellins (GAs) and auxin are required for soybean hypocotyl elongation under low light and high‐temperature interaction. Our analysis indicated that low light and high‐temperature interaction enhanced the regulation of soybean hypocotyl elongation and that the endogenous GA₃, GA₇, indole‐3‐acetic acid (IAA), and indole‐3‐pyruvate (IPA) contents significantly increased. Again, analysis of the effect of exogenous phytohormones and biosynthesis inhibitors treatments showed that exogenous GA, IAA, and paclobutrazol (PAC), 2, 3, 5,‐triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) treatments significantly regulated soybean seedlings growth under low light and high‐temperature interaction. Further qRT‐PCR analysis showed that the expression level of GA biosynthesis pathway genes (GmGA3ox1, GmGA3ox2 and GmGA3) and auxin biosynthesis pathway genes (GmYUCCA3, GmYUCCA5 and GmYUCCA7) significantly increased under (i) low light and high‐temperature interaction and (ii) exogenous GA and IAA treatments. Altogether, these observations support the hypothesis that gibberellins and auxin regulate soybean hypocotyl elongation under low light and high‐temperature stress interaction.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0300209cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3agibberellins 3agrowth and development 3ahypocotyls 3aindole acetic acid 3alight 3aoilseed crops 3apaclobutrazol 3aseedling growth 3asoybeans1 aFeng, Lingyang1 aChen, Guopeng1 aChen, Hong1 aHu, Yun1 aPu, Tian1 aCheng, Yajiao1 aShi, Jianyi1 aXiao, Te1 aZhou, Wenguan1 aYong, Taiwen1 aSun, Xin1 aYang, Feng1 aYang, Wenyu1 aWang, Xiaochun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5845-55830 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 Nov., v. 170, no. 3 p.345-356dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245011500162300001600277500001500293520159400308592002801902650001401930650001601944650001201960650002301972650001101995650001502006650001502021650001102036650001502047650001402062650002002076650001902096650002502115650004402140650001602184650003502200650002202235650000902257650001702266650001502283653001702298700001602315700001702331700001802348700001302366700001902379773009202398856008502490852000902575655001202584IND4467865820221121032130.0141112e20120713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446786582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2012.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yan10aExogenous nitric oxide (NO) increased antioxidant capacity of cucumber hypocotyl and radicle under salt stress  ap. 118-127.  a2019-12-06  aExcessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salt stress can cause oxidative damage, nitric oxide (NO) is considered as a functional molecule in alleviating salt stress to plants through modulating antioxidant metabolism. In the present experiment, effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, on the growth, and antioxidant capacity of cucumber hypocotyls and radicles as well as root tip ultrastructure were studied under 100mM NaCl stress. NaCl treatment significantly induced accumulation of HâOâ and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in cucumber hypocotyls and radicles, and application of 100Î¼M SNP stimulated ROS-scavenging enzymes and increased Î±,Î±-diphenyl-Î²-picryllhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, chelating activity of ferrous ions and hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenging activity, resulting in lower lipid peroxidation induced by NaCl stress. The ultrastructure of the root tip cells was investigated, NaCl stress induced disturbance of mitochondria and the cell wall, and SNP treatment alleviated the ultrastructure disturbance induced by NaCl stress. The above effects of SNP were reversed by addition of hemoglobin (a NO scavenger), which indicated that the function of SNP alleviating lipid perioxidation in NaCl-treated cucumber hypocotyls and radicles depended on NO. Therefore, it can be concluded that the increasing antioxidant capacity by NO might be greatly responsible for its function in alleviating the inhibition of cucumber hypocotyls and radicles growth and cell ultrastructure damage by salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aroot tips 3acell growth 3aenzymes 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3ahypocotyls 3acell walls 3asodium 3ametabolism 3acucumbers 3asodium chloride 3aultrastructure 3aantioxidant activity 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3asalt stress 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aions 3anitric oxide 3ahemoglobin 0aantioxidants1 aLiu, Zezhou1 aShi, Qinghua1 aWang, Xiufeng1 aWei, Min1 aYang, Fengjuan0 tScientia horticulturae.g2012 July 13, v. 142 p.118-127dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2012.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009700173300001600270520226800286592002802554650001802582650002102600650002102621650001002642650002102652650001602673650002602689650002502715650002802740650001502768650000902783650001002792650001702802653000702819653000702826653000802833653000802841653000802849653000902857653001002866653000702876653000802883653001502891653001802906653002302924653000802947653001402955700002302969700001902992700002503011773010703036856008203143852000903225655001203234IND60584401420221122080848.0200503e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058440142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2017.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuarez-Tapia, Alfonso10aResidual N effect of long-term applications of cattle slurry using winter wheat as test crop  ap. 257-264.  aPrediction of optimum fertilizer N requirements depends on reliable estimates of the residual value of N accumulated in soil from historical inputs of mineral fertilizers and animal manures. Using plots embedded in the Askov long-term experiments and treated since 1973 with different rates of N in cattle slurry (50, 100 and 150kg total-Nha⁻¹ termed ½, 1 and 1½ SLU), we estimated the residual N value over two consecutive growth periods (2014/2015 and 2015/2016). We used winter wheat as test crop and soils with a history of mineral fertilizers only (1 PK (no N)) and 1 NPK (100kgNha⁻¹) as reference treatments. In the test years, the customary nutrient treatments were withheld and each plot divided into six subplots randomly allocated increasing rates of mineral fertilizer N (0–250kgNha⁻¹). The winter wheat yielded more in the first test year due to crop rotational effects and more benign climatic conditions, substantiating that more test years are needed when estimating residual N effects. The residual value of N added previously with NPK was negligible. In the first year, grain yields at N optimum were similar for NPK and SLU, but the amount of fertilizer N needed to reach optimum yield was 36kgNha⁻¹ smaller for SLU than for NPK. In the second year, wheat grown on 1 NPK and 1 SLU soils showed similar yield optimum and N optimum. The same N optimum was found for 1½ SLU, but this treatment provided a higher grain yield. For unfertilized wheat, grain yields differed little between previous treatments (except for ½ SLU in the second test year). The average N-offtake in grain and straw did not differ between 1 PK and 1 NPK whereas wheat previously supported by 1 SLU removed 6.7kgNha⁻¹ more. For unfertilized wheat, N offtakes in the first wheat crop were similar for PK and NPK; wheat grown on previous SLU plots removed more N. In the second test year differences were not significant. Excluding ½ SLU, the N use efficiency ranged from 0.60 to 0.74kgNkg⁻¹N with little difference between previous treatments and years. Interactions between added N and historical N inputs illustrate that residual N effects are of little predictive value for productive cropping systems when based solely on unfertilized test crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle manure 3aclimatic factors 3acropping systems 3acrops 3afertilizer rates 3agrain yield 3along term experiments 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aprediction 3asoil 3astraw 3awinter wheat 0aAM 0aDM 0aLTE 0aNPK 0aNUE 0aNnew 0aNprev 0aPK 0aSLU 0aN response 0aAnimal manure 0aMineral fertilizer 0aNUE 0aAskov-LTE1 aThomsen, Ingrid K.1 aRasmussen, Jim1 aChristensen, Bent T.0 tField crops research.g2018 May 15, v. 221 p.257-264dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04342naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013600163300001500299500001500314520224200329592002802571650002502599650002502624650001702649650001502666650001202681650002602693650002102719650002702740650002402767650001202791650001302803650001202816650002802828650002302856650001102879650001902890650002002909650001502929650002002944650002402964650002502988650002003013650002703033650001903060650001903079650000903098651001003107653002803117653001503145653002603160653002503186653001803211653002203229653000703251700002003258700001803278700001903296700001503315700001803330700002803348700002003376700001703396773010403413856008203517852000903599655001203608IND60584401520221122080807.0190403e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058440152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2017.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Yan-Jie10aAlfalfa forage yield, soil water and P availability in response to plastic film mulch and P fertilization in a semiarid environment  ap. 94-103.  a2019-12-06  aAlfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is an important forage legume in farming and animal husbandry systems in semiarid areas. However, its forage yields in dryland farming areas are usually very low due to water shortages and low soil phosphorus (P) availability. This study assessed the effects of plastic film mulch and P fertilization on alfalfa forage yield and shoot P uptake in response to improved soil moisture and soil P availability in a dryland farming system of northwest China. A six-year field experiment, which commenced in 2011, was conducted at Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, China in randomized blocks of split-plot design with two mulch treatments—plastic film mulch with ridge and furrow (M) and no plastic film mulch with flat planting (NM)—as the main plots, and four P levels—0, 9.73, 19.3, 28.9kg P ha−1—as split plots. Alfalfa forage yield and shoot P uptake and concentration increased linearly with increasing P level in the NM treatment. In the M treatment, shoot P concentration also increased linearly with increasing P level, but shoot P uptake and forage yield were well-fitted by a quadratic model with P level as the independent variable and a lower physiological P use efficiency at high P level. Alfalfa forage yield and water use efficiency increased with plastic film mulch. Soil water content in the upper 1m of soil increased with plastic film mulch and was higher in the 2014 growing season and in April 2015 due to more rainfall. However, at 1–5m soil depth, the soil water content decreased with plastic film mulch and P fertilization but increased at high P levels with plastic film mulch. Soil pH decreased with plastic film mulch and P fertilization, with a stronger effect from the latter, which is beneficial for improving soil P availability. Soil available P, mostly derived from inorganic P, increased with P fertilization and was lower in M than NM treatments due to alfalfa uptake and competition with soil microorganisms. We concluded that plastic film mulch and P fertilization, of about 16.1 or 17.5kg P ha−1, was an appropriate combination to improve soil water condition and soil P availability for increased alfalfa forage yield or shoot P uptake in this semiarid region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplastic film mulches 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aforage yield 3asoil depth 3aalfalfa 3afield experimentation 3aanimal husbandry 3afertilizer application 3asoil microorganisms 3afurrows 3aplanting 3asoil pH 3anutrient use efficiency 3asoil water content 3amodels 3aforage legumes 3adryland farming 3asoil water 3awater shortages 3aexperimental design 3awater use efficiency 3aMedicago sativa 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3asemiarid zones 3agrowing season 3arain 3aChina 0aPhosphorus availability 0aphosphorus 0aShoot P concentration 0aPhosphatase activity 0aSoil moisture 0aMedicago sativa L 0apH1 aHan, Cheng-Long1 aFan, Jing-Wei1 aShi, Xiao-Peng1 aKong, Meng1 aShi, Xiao-Yan1 aSiddique, Kadambot H.M.1 aZhao, Yang-Yang1 aLi, Fengmin,0 tField crops research.g2018 Jan., v. 215 p.94-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009400168300001600262520142000278536011401698592002801812596001301840650001501853650001701868650001501885650002601900650001401926650004301940650001201983650001601995650001602011653002402027653001602051653004102067700001802108700001802126773013802144856008602282852000902368655001202377IND60779436220221121093921.0220608e20220504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943622DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2022.20563932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Haifeng10aResidues and degradation dynamics of pymetrozine and chlorpyrifos in rice field ecosystem  ap. 339-349.  aField trials were conducted in Guangzhou, Nanning, and Nanjing in two consecutive years to evaluate the terminal residue levels and dissipation trend of pymetrozine and chlorpyrifos in rice ecosystem. Analyses were carried out by high-performance-liquid-chromatography for pymetrozine and gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry for chlorpyrifos, achieved good linear relationship over range from 0.01 to 5.0 mg·kg⁻¹ for both (r > 0.9998). Average recoveries were 86.0% to 106.0% for pymetrozine, and 79.7% to 102.3% for chlorpyrifos at the spiking levels of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg·kg⁻¹. Half-lives of pymetrozine in paddy water, paddy soil and rice plant were 0.35–2.81, 2.69–6.95 and 1.22–3.70 days, while that of chlorpyrifos were 0.86–1.88, 3.09–6.86 and 0.58–2.84 days. Final residues of pymetrozine and chlorpyrifos in brown rice ranged from less than 0.6 to 26.0 μg·kg⁻¹ and 14.3 to 191.6 μg·kg⁻¹, respectively. It is recommended that 25% pymetrozine and chlorpyrifos suspension be sprayed twice at the intervals of 10 days with dosages ranging from 375 (maximum recommended dosage) to 562.5 g a.i.·ha⁻¹ (1.5 times of the maximum recommended dosage). The rice can be harvested safely 15 days after the last application of pymetrozine and chlorpyrifos. The research results help ensures the safe application of pymetrozine and chlorpyrifos in rice ecosystem.  aThis research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant numbers 31071702.  aPublisher supplied data  a31071702 3abrown rice 3achlorpyrifos 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental science 3ahalf life 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3apymetrozine 0aPesticides residues 0afield trial 0agas chromatography-mass spectrometry1 aChen, Guiquan1 aYang, Xiaoyun0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2022 May 4, v. 57, no. 5 p.339-349dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2022.20563933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010700167300001400274520201500288592002802303653001902331653002202350653002602372653002702398700001802425700002202443700002202465700001702487773013402504856008002638852000902718655001202727IND60130017320221120033023.0151126e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013001732DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-10-00159.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Kevin B.10aGenetic Improvement and Diversity in Snake River Wheatgrass (Elymus wawawaiensis) (Poaceae: Triticeae)  ap. 76-84.  aWith the increased emphasis on using native plant materials in range revegetation programs in the western United States it is critical to identify genetically similar groups and develop native grasses that are competitive with invasive weeds, easy to establish, and persistent, and that produce high seed yield. A grass that shows appreciable drought tolerance on arid rangelands is Snake River wheatgrass (Elymus wawawaiensis J. Carlson & Barkworth). This study was designed to estimate genetic relationships and underlying genetic components for seed and forage trait improvement between plant introductions (PIs) of Snake River wheatgrass, 28 half-sib Snake River wheatgrass families (HSFs), and cultivars Secar and Discovery at Nephi, Utah, between 2005 and 2006. Based on molecular genetic diversity data in Snake River wheatgrass, with the exception of the PIs originating from Enterprise, Oregon, all other collections and cultivars are not genetically different and represent a common gene pool from which to develop improved Snake River wheatgrass germplasm. Selection in Snake River wheatgrass for total seed yield (g · plot⁻¹), 100-seed weight (g), and seedling emergence from a deep planting depth had a positive effect. Further increases through selection and genetic introgression from hybridization with PIs will likely increase seed yield and 100-seed weight, but will not increase seedling emergence. Increases in dry matter yield (DMY) were observed after two cycles of selection in the HSFs compared to the PIs. There remains considerable genetic and phenotypic variation to further increase DMY in Snake River wheatgrass through selection and hybridization. Trends in forage nutritional quality were not observed after two cycles of selection in the HSFs or the PIs and will not likely result in improvement. Through recurrent selection, populations of Snake River wheatgrass have been and can be developed to more effectively establish and compete on annual weed–infested rangelands.  aPublisher supplied data 0aforage quality 0agenetic diversity 0agermplasm improvement 0aseedling establishment1 aMott, Ivan W.1 aRobins, Joseph G.1 aWaldron, Blair L.1 aNelson, Mark0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2012 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.76-84dSociety for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111/REM-D-10-00159.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011400169300001600283520084200299592002801141650001201169650001901181650002201200650001901222650001201241653003601253653003801289653003401327700002001361773009701381856008501478852000901563655001201572IND60486044720221120110104.0160218e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604472DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2015.10953802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShreck, Brian14aThe Public and Its Climate: Exploring the Relationship Between Public Discourse and Opinion on Global Warming  ap. 509-524.  aWe use original data from a national public opinion survey to analyze the relationships between citizens’ engagement in public discourse on climate change and their beliefs about the existence of anthropogenic climate change and support for climate change-oriented policies. We find that engagement in discourse is positively associated with strong beliefs affirming the reality of climate change. We also find that engagement in public discourse is strongly associated with strength of opinion on both sides of the debate on climate change-oriented policy preferences, suggesting an association between public discourse and polarization. The results will be of interest to scholars of deliberative and discursive democracy and climate communication proponents who advocate for increased public discussion of the complex policy issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aglobal warming 3aissues and policy 3apublic opinion 3asurveys 0aClimate communication/discourse 0adeliberative/discursive democracy 0aglobal warming/climate change1 aVedlitz, Arnold0 tSociety & natural resources.g2016 May 3, v. 29, no. 5 p.509-524dRoutledgex1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2015.10953803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245007300173500002200246520172800268592002801996650001402024650002002038650001202058650001502070650000902085650001102094650001002105650002302115653002402138653002502162653001902187653001902206653001702225700002202242700003302264700001802297700002002315700001902335700002602354773011402380856005302494852000902547655001202556IND60795451220221122051731.0221004e20221002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079545122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2022.1057532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Allison F.10aVocal expression of emotions in farmed spotted paca (Cuniculus paca)  aPre-press version  aVocal emissions in non-human mammals can be used as non-invasive indicators of animal emotion and welfare. Therefore, we aimed to validate the use of acoustic parameters as indicators of affective states and welfare in farmed spotted paca (Cuniculus paca). We recorded the vocalizations of 36 pacas, living in 12 groups (two females and one male/group), during four distinct experiences that were assumed to generate different affective states (negative, positive, ambiguous, and highly positive). Spotted pacas emitted more snorts, either as single elements or phrases, when experiencing a negative affective state. Four acoustic parameters of snorts, roars, and barks, which were recorded during all experiences, differed according to the affective valence assumed to be experienced by the spotted pacas. During the negative condition – morning cleaning routine spotted pacas emitted many more snort calls, which are characterized by a shift in the mean amplitude towards a higher level of intensity and as well as by a shift in the energy distribution (Q75) towards a higher frequency than those emitted in the positive condition compared to those emitted in the assumed positive valence condition – feeding time with the regular diet. These call-characteristics, along with the increase in the mean amplitude of snort calls from the lowest to the highest arousal levels, may thus reflect negative affective state and arousal in spotted paca. Therefore, the increase in the overall emission of snorts together with changes in their acoustic parameters may be valuable as indicators of negative emotions of C. paca, and thus have potential as an automated and non-invasive tool for welfare assessment in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanimal behavior 3aanimals 3aautomation 3adiet 3aenergy 3amales 3awelfare assessment 0aAcoustic parameters 0aAnimal communication 0aAnimal emotion 0aAnimal welfare 0aBioacoustics1 aLima, Stella G.C.1 aNogueira-Filho, Sérgio L.G.1 aHeld, Suzanne1 aPaul, Elizabeth1 aMendl, Michael1 aNogueira, Selene S.C.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2022 Oct. 02,  p.105753-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2022.105753  aDNAL 7aarticle04995naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009100165300001600256500001500272520293900287592002803226650002003254650001403274650001803288650002003306650001003326650001003336650001703346650004103363650001603404650001703420650001503437650001103452650002003463650001303483650001203496650002303508650003103531650002803562650002503590650002303615650001703638650002103655650001803676650001303694650001203707650002503719650001303744650002103757650002103778650001503799650001803814650002303832650001303855650002403868651001003892653003703902653001803939653001003957653001103967700002103978700001903999700001704018700001804035773010504053856008204158852000904240655001204249IND60584401720221122080854.0190403e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058440172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2017.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Jianlong10aTechnologies and theoretical basis of light and simplified cotton cultivation in China  ap. 142-148.  a2019-12-06  aSince the beginning of the 21st century, the rapid economic development and accelerated urbanization of China have caused major changes to the country's cotton cultivation technology. China has not replicated the completely mechanized approach used in developed countries. Rather, taking into account the underdeveloped economy and family-scale based cotton growing, China has established and implemented a light and simplified system of sustainable cotton production. Light and simplified cultivation (LSC) involves using modern agricultural equipment and technology adapted to the local economic level and mode of management of cotton production instead of manual operations. This method reduces labor intensity, simplifies cultivation management, reduces the frequency of field operations, integrates agricultural machinery and agronomic technology, and uses high-quality seeds and improved techniques to achieve light, simplified, and cost-effective cotton production. Cotton LSC includes the following key technologies: Single-seed precision sowing, simplified plant pruning, light and simplified fertilization, water and fertilization integration technology, and plant population structure control. Single seed precision sowing technology ensures robust seedling growth via differential expression of the key genes controlling hook formation and hypocotyl elongation at seed germination. Cotton planting at a relatively high plant density inhibits the growth of vegetative branches via differential expression of genes for hormone metabolism and compartmentation of hormones within a cotton plant. The high and stable yield of LSC lies in the adaptive coordination between the cotton yield components and between the biomass and the harvest index. According to the appropriate leaf area index and its dynamics, quantitative indicators such as suitable plant height, the ratio of fruiting nodes to branches in number, and the ratio of seed cotton to stalks in weight can produce plant populations with high solar efficiency. The basis of light and simplified fertilization is that the absorption of fertilizer N by cotton is concentrated within 20days after flowering, and the fertilizer applied at early flowering was mainly distributed to reproductive organs and had higher N use efficiency than that applied at other stages. The water saving mechanism of partial root-zone irrigation is that methyl jasmonate serves as a signal substance to enhance the water absorption from the hydrated root side. Future development of cotton cultivation must include an in-depth investigation of the ecophysiology of LSC to further reform and optimize the planting systems and patterns. Innovation in cultivation technologies, development of new materials and equipment, and integration of agronomic technology and materials may provide solid theoretical and technical support for LSC and promote the sustainable cotton production in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseedling growth 3aflowering 3amechanization 3aleaf area index 3alabor 3agenes 3awater uptake 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aseed cotton 3aurbanization 3ahypocotyls 3asowing 3agene expression 3aplanting 3apruning 3ahormone metabolism 3agene expression regulation 3anutrient use efficiency 3apopulation structure 3awater conservation 3aplant height 3amethyl jasmonate 3aharvest index 3abranches 3abiomass 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ahormones 3aseed germination 3aroot zone drying 3aabsorption 3aecophysiology 3acost effectiveness 3afruiting 3adeveloped countries 3aChina 0aLight and simplified cultivation 0aEcophysiology 0aseeds 0aCotton1 aKong, Xiangqiang1 aZhang, Dongmei1 aLi, Weijiang1 aDong, Hezhong0 tField crops research.g2017 Dec., v. 214 p.142-148dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245015800185300001600343520145000359592002801809650002801837650002201865650001701887650001501904650002501919650001701944650002501961650001401986650001302000650002602013650002002039650001002059650002302069650002502092653002702117653003002144653004602174653002102220700003702241700003102278700003802309700002802347700003502375700002702410700002502437773013802462856008602600852000902686655001202695IND60779436420221121093858.0220608e20220504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943642DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2022.20600292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuitimea-Cantúa, Génesis V.14aThe aflatoxin inhibitors capsaicin and piperine from Capsicum chinense and Piper nigrum fruits modulate the antioxidant system in Aspergillus parasiticus  ap. 358-368.  aSeveral aflatoxin inhibitors can modulate the antioxidant system in fungi. In this work, the effect of the ethanolic extract of Capsicum chinense and Piper nigrum fruits, capsaicin, and piperine on the expression of the aflE, aflG, aflH, aflI, aflK, aflL, aflO, aflP, and aflQ genes involved in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus parasiticus were studied by qRT-PCR analysis. As well as, the effect on the expression of fungal antioxidant genes (sod1, catA, and cat2) and enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Results reveal that the highest (p < 0.05) radial growth inhibition (68 and 86%) and aflatoxins production inhibition (73 and 80%) was observed with capsaicin and piperine respectively, at 300 µg/mL, instead of the ethanolic extract at the same concentration. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that compounds and extracts at 300 µg/mL induced a down-regulation of aflatoxin genes and an up-regulation on the fungal antioxidant genes. CAT activity increased by 23.15, 36.65, 51.40, and 65.50%, in the presence of C. chinense and P. nigrum extract, capsaicin, and piperine exposure, respectively. While SOD activity was not significantly impacted (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the capsaicin and piperine, two antifungal and anti-aflatoxigenic compounds produce an up-regulation of antioxidant defense genes accompanied by an enhancement of catalase enzymatic activity in A. parasiticus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aCapsicum chinense 3aPiper nigrum 3aaflatoxins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiochemical pathways 3acapsaicin 3acatalase 3aenvironmental science 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3agrowth retardation 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aAflatoxin biosynthesis 0aantioxidant defense genes 0aCapsicum chinense and Piper nigrum fruits 0aqRT-PCR analysis1 aLeija Gutiérrez, Héctor Manuel1 aBuitimea-Cantúa, Nydia E.1 adel Refugio Rocha-Pizaña, María1 aGarcía-Triana, Antonio1 aHernández Morales, Alejandro,1 aMagaña-Barajas, Elisa1 aMolina-Torres, Jorge0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2022 May 4, v. 57, no. 5 p.358-368dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2022.20600293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245010700205300001600312506007600328520153900404592002801943506003701971650001902008650002302027650002102050650001502071650002702086650003002113650002302143650002302166650002302189650001502212650002702227650002502254650001202279650001702291650001702308650002102325650001402346650001102360651001202371700002002383700002802403700002202431700002102453773012902474856007802603852000902681655001202690IND60649249020221207081728.0190703e20131104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064924902DNAL7 a10.3390/insects40406312doi7 aPMC45535072pmcid7 a264625272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGouli, Vladimir10aEntomopathogenic Fungi Associated with Exotic Invasive Insect Pests in Northeastern Forests of the USA  ap. 631-645.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMycopathogens of economically important exotic invasive insects in forests of northeastern USA have been the subject of research at the Entomology Research Laboratory, University of Vermont, for the last 20 years. Elongate hemlock scale, European fruit lecanium, hemlock woolly adelgid and pear thrips were analyzed for the presence of mycopathogens, in order to consider the potential for managing these pests with biological control. Fungal cultures isolated from insects with signs of fungal infection were identified based on morphological characters and DNA profiling. Mycopathogens recovered from infected insects were subdivided into three groups, i.e., specialized entomopathogenic; facultative entomopathogens; ubiquitous opportunistic contaminants. Epizootics were caused by fungi in the specialized group with the exception of M. microspora, P. marquandii and I. farinosa. Inoculation of insects in laboratory and field conditions with B. bassiana, L. muscarium and Myriangium sp. caused insect mortality of 45 to 95%. Although pest populations in the field seemed severely compromised after treatment, the remnant populations re-established themselves after the winter. Although capable of inducing high mortality, a single localized aerial application of a soil-dwelling fungus does not maintain long-time suppression of pests. However, it can halt their range expansion and maintain populations below the economic threshold level without the use of expensive insecticides which have a negative impact on the environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAdelges tsugae 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aFiorinia externa 3aMyriangium 3aParthenolecanium corni 3aTaeniothrips inconsequens 3aaerial application 3abiological control 3aeconomic threshold 3aentomology 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3ainvasive species 3amortality 3awinter 3aVermont1 aGouli, Svetlana1 aMarcelino, José A.

Vegetation management may alter groundwater recharge if ET is altered due to changes in vegetation type or cover. This study quantifies changes in groundwater recharge following vegetation cover change from native woodland to pasture in a semiarid region of southwest Texas. The Carrizo–Wilcox aquifer is a valuable groundwater resource in this area, where overuse by dependent farming practices has lowered aquifer levels significantly in the last 85 yr. Combining data from short-term (30 mo) monitoring of the changes in soil moisture and long-term (5–30 yr) changes in total soil chloride indicated deep drainage increased slightly where land had been cleared of vegetation. Annual recharge rates below rooting depths (standardized to 155 cm) averaged only 0.72 ± 0.2 mm · yr⁻¹ (mean ± SE) in areas not cleared of woody vegetation, as estimated by chloride mass balance. Upon clearing, 72%% of the total chloride naturally occurring in the soil profile was flushed away within 30 yr, leading to an estimated 2.59 ± 1.7 mm · yr⁻¹ additional recharge. Deep soil moisture in recently cleared land increased by up to 17%% during the growing season of wet years (double the average rainfall) but did not increase in dry or normal precipitation years, providing supporting evidence that more water penetrated below the roots under certain environmental conditions. These results demonstrate that brush management can increase recharge by modest, but measurable, amounts depending on site-specific soil characteristics and degree of reduction in vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 0abrush management 0aCarrizo–Wilcox aquifer 0achloride mass balance 0adeep drainage 0anatural tracer 0asoil water balance1 aBarre, David A.1 aOwens, M.

We also obtained 100%% adult emergence inhibition with 0.1%% slow-release sand formulations of pyriproxyfen and diflubenzuron. In a simulated field study, the granular sand formulations of pyriproxyfen, diflubenzuron, and temephos remained active for over 4 mo.

This phenomenon is known as vernalization and has been widely studied in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana as well as in monocots. Through the repression of floral activator genes, vernalization prevents flowering in winter. In Arabidopsis, FLOWERING LOCUS C or FLC is the key repressor during vernalization, while in monocots vernalization is regulated through VRN1, VRN2 and VRN3 (or FLOWERING LOCUS T). Interestingly, VRN genes are not homologous to FLC but FLC homologs are found to have a significant role in vernalization response in cereals. The presence of FLC homologs in monocots opens new dimensions to understand, compare and retrace the evolution of vernalization pathways between monocots and dicots. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism of vernalization‐induced flowering along with epigenetic regulations in Arabidopsis and temperate cereals. A better understanding of cold‐induced flowering will be helpful in crop breeding strategies to modify the vernalization requirement of economically important temperate cereals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aLiliopsida 3adimensions 3aepigenetics 3aevolution 3aflowering 3agenes 3agrains 3aloci 3amodels 3aplant breeding 3avarieties 3avernalization 3awinter1 aGeuten, Koen1 aGiri, Balendu Shekhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5167-91541 aVarma, Ajit0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 Nov., v. 170, no. 3 p.373-383dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245012900198300001600327500001400343500002000357520160000377592002801977596002702005596004502032650004402077650002202121650002202143650001502165650001302180650001302193650001002206650001202216650002802228650001802256650002402274650001902298650000902317650001102326650002202337650001802359650002002377650003302397650001602430650001402446650001002460650000902470650002102479650001502500700006602515700005102581700006602632700006602698700005702764700005502821773012402876856007303000852000903073655001203082IND60714390320221118052956.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071439032DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.131672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRead, Thea Lund1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5938-820110aOptimising the foliar uptake of zinc oxide nanoparticles: Do leaf surface properties and particle coating affect absorption?  ap. 384-397.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFoliar absorption of zinc (Zn) is limited by several barriers, the first of which is the leaf cuticle. In this study, we investigated the absorption of Zn from Zn oxide nanoparticles (ZnO‐NPs) in wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Gladius) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus cv Hyoleic 41) to determine the importance of NP surface coating for Zn absorption. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed a higher polysaccharide content in the wheat cuticle than sunflower, indicated by a more pronounced glycosidic bond at 1020 cm⁻¹, but wax and cutin content were similar. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that trichome density was twice as high in wheat (3600 ± 900 cm⁻²) as in sunflower (1600 cm⁻²) and stomatal density four times higher in sunflower (6400 ± 800 cm⁻² in wheat and 22 900 cm⁻² in sunflower). Suspensions of ZnO‐NPs with coatings of different hydrophobicity were applied to leaves to compare Zn absorption using X‐ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP‐MS). Absorption of Zn was similar between wheat and sunflower when Zn was applied at 1000 mg Zn l⁻¹, but much less Zn was absorbed from all ZnO products than from soluble Zn fertiliser. Particle coating did not affect Zn absorption, but it may facilitate particle adhesion to leaves, providing a longer‐term source of resupply of Zn ions to the leaves. Differences in leaf surface characteristics did not affect Zn absorption, indicating that the cuticle is the main pathway of absorption under these conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Synchrotron  aLP130100741cAustralian Research Council 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHelianthus annuus 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabsorption 3aadhesion 3acoatings 3acutin 3adensity 3afluorescence microscopy 3afoliar uptake 3aglycosidic linkages 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3ananoparticles 3apolysaccharides 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asuspensions 3atrichomes 3awheat 3azinc 3azinc fertilizers 3azinc oxide1 aDoolette, Casey Louise1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8092-35201 aLi, Cui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9885-36741 aSchjoerring, Jan Kofod1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2852-32981 aKopittke, Peter Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4948-18801 aDonner, Erica1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6465-22331 aLombi, Enzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3384-03750 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 Nov., v. 170, no. 3 p.384-397dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01540naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245008200164500001900246520043500265592002800700650001600728650001700744651001200761651001200773651001600785651001300801651001000814653001700824653002000841653001100861700002200872700001900894700002400913700002000937773011200957856007601069852000901145655001201154IND60728564420221121025032.0210308e20160606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072856442DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.4.e80132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDale-Skey, Natalie10aChecklist of British and Irish Hymenoptera - Chalcidoidea and Mymarommatoidea  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground A revised checklist of the British and Irish Chalcidoidea and Mymarommatoidea substantially updates the previous comprehensive checklist, dating from 1978.

It has been reported that 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a highly persistent herbicide in the environment that is responsible for neurotoxic changes in different myenteric neuronal subpopulations. The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of 2,4-D on myenteric neurons in the colon of Rattus norvegicus for the first time. A dose of 2,4-D (5 mg/kg/day) was administered to the experimental group (2,4-D) for 15 days. Then, the proximal colon was collected and submitted to Giemsa and NADPH-d histochemical techniques for the disclosure of total and nitrergic neurons. The 2,4-D group presented a higher density of total neurons (p = 0.05, t-test), which together with the maintenance of nitrergic neuronal density, may be related to the increase in the expression of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by colocalization, responsible for stimulating the intestinal smooth muscle and increasing the chances of the expulsion of the harmful content present in the lumen. Over 15 days, the neurotoxic effects of 2,4-D in the myenteric plexus influenced an increase in the general population of myenteric neurons in the colon.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aRattus norvegicus 3aacetylcholine 3acolon 3aenvironmental science 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotransmitters 3asmooth muscle 3at-test 0aAgricultural defensive 0aintestine 0amyenteric plexus 0aneuronal plasticity1 aPorto, Gisele da Silva1 aPereira, Joice Naiara Bertaglia1 aGonçalves, Alexandre Rodrigo Nascimento1 aMarinsek, Gabriela Pustiglione1 aStabille, Sandra Regina1 aFavetta, Paula Montanhini1 aGermano, Ricardo de Melo1 aMari, Renata de Britto0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2022 May 4, v. 57, no. 5 p.421-429dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2022.20646743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002500136245010400161300001600265520096800281592002801249653002301277653001801300653001901318653001901337653002301356700002101379700002401400700003501424700002601459700002201485700002601507773015501533856007201688852000901760655001201769IND60128996120221118015728.0151124e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012899612DNAL7 a10.2987/5705.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstallo, Elizabet L.10aModels for Predicting Aedes aegypti Larval Indices Based on Satellite Images and Climatic Variables  ap. 368-376.  aForecasting models were developed for predicting Aedes aegypti larval indices in an endemic area for dengue (cities of Tartagal and Oráán, northwestern Argentina), based on the Breteau and House indices and environmental variables considered with and without time lags. Descriptive models were first developed for each city and each index by multiple linear regressions, followed by a regional model including both cities together. Finally, two forecasting regional models (FRM) were developed and evaluated. FRM₂ for the Breteau index and House index fit the data significantly better than FRM₁. An evaluation of these models showed a higher correlation FRM₁ than for FRM₂ for the Breteau index (R == 0.83 and 0.62 for 3 months; R == 0.86 and 0.67 for 45 days) and the House index (R == 0.85 and 0.79 for 3 months; R == 0.79 and 0.74 for 45 days). Early warning based on these forecasting models can assist health authorities to improve vector control.  aPublisher supplied data 0aForecasting models 0aAedes aegypti 0alarval indices 0aremote sensing 0aclimatic variables1 aLamfri, Mario A.1 aScavuzzo, Carlos M.1 aAlmeida, Francisco F.

Immature oocytes were randomly divided into three groups: fresh oocytes (negative control), oocytes vitrified in liquid nitrogen (LN group, positive control), and oocytes vitrified in LHe (LHe group). In Experiment 1, the proportions for normal morphology, maturation, cleavage, and blastocyst were greater in the LHe group than in the LN group (88.3% compared with 79.1%, 51.7% compared with 43.3%, 42.6% compared with 33.0%, and 11.0% compared with 4.7%, respectively; P<0.05), and the rates of oocyte development were greater in the control group (100%, 72.8%, 64.3%, and 40.3%) than in the vitrified groups (P<0.05). In Experiment 2, the effect of vitrification by LHe and LN on cytoskeleton of cattle oocytes was examined. The cytoskeleton had varying degrees of damage, and the negative influence of LHe vitrification on the cytoskeleton was less than that of LN vitrification (P<0.05), and the vitrified group had greater cytoskeleton degeneration than the control group (P<0.05). In conclusion, LHe vitrification reduced the negative effect of cryoinjury on cytoskeleton structure and improved the viability of immature oocytes of cattle compared with LN vitrification.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3acytoskeleton 3ahelium 3aliquids 3anitrogen 3aoocytes 3aviability 3avitrification 0aCattle immature oocyte 0aVitrification 0aLiquid helium 0aCytoskeleton1 aYu, Xue Li1 aZhang, Fan1 aWu, Hua1 aPei, Xu Zhe1 aLi, Xiao Xia1 aLi, Ying Hua0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2017 Dec., v. 187 p.91-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014600168300001600314520090300330536047301233592002801706596001701734596001501751596001501766596001301781596003301794650001501827650001201842650002601854650000901880650001901889650002401908650001601932650001301948653003001961653002801991700002102019700001502040700001602055773013802071856008602209852000902295655001202304IND60779436820221121093906.0220608e20220504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943682DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2022.20715612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zixuan10aPivotal roles of nanoscale zerovalent iron supported on metal-organic framework material in cadmium (II) migration and transformation in soil  ap. 430-440.  aCadmium (Cd) contamination in soils is of great concern, and therefore the development of effective remediation technologies for cadmium contamination is urgent. In our study, nano zero-valent iron (NZVI) supported by metal-organic framework (MOF) materials (MOF-NZVI) were prepared using NaBH₄ and FeCl₃ to try to solve the soil Cd remediation problem. Herein, the effects and the mechanism of MOF-NZVI for the immobilization of Cd in contaminated soil was investigated. The results showed that MOF-NZVI was capable of converting Cd in soil from weak acid extractable and reducible fractions to oxidizable and residual states, thus effectively reducing the toxicity of Cd in soil. FTIR and XRD analysis confirmed that the dominant reaction mechanism between MOF-NVZI and Cd is adsorption with complexation, and the stabilization of Cd is achieved by the formation of compounds such as FeOCdOH.  aThis work was financially supported by the Youth Scientific Research Talent Support Program of Tianjin Normal University (135302RC1706), Young and Middle-aged Backbone Innovative Talents Training Project Foundation of Tianjin (135305JF76), the Second Level Candidates for the “131 Talent Plan” in Tianjin (135305QR06), National Natural Science Foundation of China (21307090) and Tianjin Municipal Natural Science Foundation of China (18JCYBJC96600, 14JCZDJC41000).  aPublisher supplied data  a135302RC1706  a135305JF76  a135305QR06  a21307090  a18JCYBJC96600a14JCZDJC41000 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3acoordination polymers 3airon 3apolluted soils 3areaction mechanisms 3aremediation 3atoxicity 0aNanoscale zerovalent iron 0ametal-organic framework1 aZhang, Zhengchao1 aWang, Peng1 aLiu, Tingyi0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2022 May 4, v. 57, no. 5 p.430-440dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2022.20715613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245008900159300001600248520154000264592002801804653002801832653000801860653002301868653001601891653002201907700002201929700002501951700002601976773015502002856007202157852000902229655001202238IND60128996220221118015744.0151124e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012899622DNAL7 a10.2987/5707.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, W. Clint10aEffects of Wind Speed on Aerosol Spray Penetration in Adult Mosquito Bioassay Cages1  ap. 419-426.  aBioassay cages are commonly used to assess efficacy of insecticides against adult mosquitoes in the field. To correlate adult mortality readings to insecticidal efficacy and/or spray application parameters properly, it is important to know how the cage used in the bioassay interacts with the spray cloud containing the applied insecticide. This study compared the size of droplets, wind speed, and amount of spray material penetrating cages and outside of cages in a wind tunnel at different wind speeds. Two bioassay cages, Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology (CMAVE) and Circle, were evaluated. The screen materials used on these cages reduced the size of droplets, wind speed, and amount of spray material inside the cages as compared to the spray cloud and wind velocity outside of the cages. When the wind speed in the dispersion tunnel was set at 0.6 m/sec (1.3 mph), the mean wind speed inside of the CMAVE Bioassay Cage and Circle Cage was 0.045 m/sec (0.10 mph) and 0.075 m/sec (0.17 mph), respectively. At air velocities of 2.2 m/sec (4.9 mph) in the dispersion tunnel, the mean wind speed inside of the CMAVE Bioassay Cage and Circle Cage was 0.83 m/sec (1.86 mph) and 0.71 m/sec (1.59 mph), respectively. Consequently, there was a consistent 50––70%% reduction of spray material penetrating the cages compared to the spray cloud that approached the cages. These results provide a better understanding of the impact of wind speed, cage design, and construction on ultra-low-volume spray droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSentinel mosquito cages 0aULV 0adroplet deposition 0awind tunnel 0alaser diffraction1 aFritz, Bradley K.1 aFārūq, Muḥammad,1 aCooperband, Miriam F.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2008 Sept., v. 24, no. 3 p.419-426dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F5707.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245012300185300001400308520142000322592002801742650001201770650001701782650000901799650002401808650002001832650001701852653001101869653001701880653003001897653001701927653003001944700003801974700003302012700003902045700002102084700004002105700003802145700002802183700002302211700002702234773011902261856008502380852000902465655001202474IND60486045320221120110050.0160218e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604532DNAL7 a10.1080/21551197.2015.11253252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBárbara Pereira Costa, Aline10aNutritional Risk is Associated with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in Community-dwelling Older Persons: The PAINEL Study  ap. 43-51.  aMalnutrition is a risk factor for noncommunicable diseases related to ageing, and it can also contribute to musculoskeletal health. This study investigated whether nutritional risk is associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain in community-dwelling older persons. Nutritional risk was assessed by the DETERMINE Checklist. Chronic musculoskeletal pain was defined as the presence of pain in the past six months that did not disappear for at least 30 consecutive days. Multivariate logistic regression including confounding variables was used for the analysis. The sample was comprised of 383 participants (age 75.6 ± SD 6.1); the majority were at moderate-to-high nutritional risk (69%) and approximately one third presented chronic musculoskeletal pain (30%). The nutritional risk score was independently associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain: adding one unit in the risk score produces an 11% increment in the odds of presenting pain (OR 1.109, 95% CI 1.022–1.204). Individuals classified into moderate- or high-risk categories also had substantially higher odds (∼90%) of presenting chronic musculoskeletal pain when compared to those in the low-risk category, although our findings were only marginally significant. This is the first study to demonstrate the association between nutritional risk and chronic musculoskeletal pain above and beyond the contributed effects from relevant confounders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelderly 3amalnutrition 3apain 3aregression analysis 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 0aAgeing 0achronic pain 0acommunity-dwelling elders 0amalnutrition 0amusculoskeletal disorders1 aAndrade Carneiro Machado, Luciana1 aMarcos Domingues Dias, João1 aKeller Coelho de Oliveira, Adriana1 aUde Viana, Joana1 ada Silva, Sílvia Lanziotti Azevedo1 aGonçalves Pereira Couto, Flávia1 aLustosa Torres, Juliana1 aMendes, Liliane P.1 aCorrea Dias, Rosangela0 tJournal of nutrition in gerontology and geriatrics.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 35, no. 1 p.43-51dRoutledgex2155-12007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21551197.2015.11253253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002400172245012300196300001600319520170400335592002802039650002702067650002302094650001002117650001302127650001202140650001002152650002502162650002502187650003502212650001502247650001902262650001402281650003002295650001802325650001602343650002302359650001602382650004202398650001502440650006702455650001402522650003002536650002402566650002402590650002302614651001702637700001802654700001902672773012002691856008902811852000902900655001202909IND4468849820221120032705.0141111e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446884982DNAL7 a221372502pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMtshali, Phillip S.10aIdentification and characterization of Lactobacillus florum strains isolated from South African grape and wine samples  ap. 106-113.  aA total of 213 strains of lactic acid bacteria were examined in this study. Among these, 30 strains previously isolated from South African grape and wine samples remained unidentified. The identification of these isolates was performed by BLAST and phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA gene sequences, which indicated that the isolates belonged to Lactobacillus florum. In this work, we also designed a discriminative species-specific primer FLOR targeting the 16S rDNA gene of Lb. florum. The validity and specificity of this primer was confirmed. Of particular interest in this study was to further evaluate the identified strains for the presence of genes encoding enzymes of oenological relevance. Reference strains included three flower-associated Lb. florum (F9-1ᵀ, F9-2 and F17) and two Lactobacillus lindneri (AWRI B530 and DSM 20691) strains. Lb. lindneri strains were incorporated as being the closest relatives of Lb. florum. PCR detection results revealed that all Lb. florum strains and Lb. lindneri AWRI B530 (grape isolate) possessed the majority of the tested genes relative to DSM 20691 (beer isolate); these enzyme-encoding genes included malolactic enzyme, peptidases (PepC, PepI, PepN), citrate lyase (α- and β-subunits), phenolic acid decarboxylase and arginine deiminase pathway enzymes (arginine deiminase and ornithine transcarbamylase). Sequence verification of PCR-generated fragments was performed by sequencing. The sequence data were used to construct the phylogenetic trees, which indicated that our Lb. florum isolates cluster with other Lb. florum strains of flower origin but rather distinct from other LAB species, with Lb. lindneri being the next closest species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus lindneri 3aarginine deiminase 3abeers 3acitrates 3aflowers 3agenes 3alactic acid bacteria 3anucleotide sequences 3aornithine carbamoyltransferase 3apeptidases 3aphenolic acids 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3awine grapes 2aBeerxmicrobiology 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHydrolases 2aLactobacillusxenzymologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVitisxmicrobiology 2aWinexmicrobiology 0aSouth Africa1 aDivol, Benoit1 adu Toit, Maret0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 153, no. 1-2 p.106-113dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011400172300001800286520101200304592002801316650002001344650001301364650001401377650002801391650002901419651001001448653001901458653001401477653000801491653002401499700002101523700002601544773011801570856008601688852000901774655001201783IND60779437020221121093850.0220614e20220319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077943702DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2020.17835772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Dipankar13aAn assessment of temporal RADARSAT-2 SAR data for crop classification using KPCA based support vector machine  ap. 1547-1559.  aCrop discrimination with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data primarily depends on the characterization of crop geometry using radar backscatter response. Differences in phenological development of crops lead to dissimilar temporal signatures of backscatter intensities, which may influence the separability of the crop classes. This principle leads to multi-date classification approach. In this work, kernel principal component (KPCA) is adopted for feature selection from multi-date datasets, and the selected features are used for classification using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The classification is investigated for both the KPCA-based SVM and only SVM approaches using quad-pol C-band RADARSAT-2 data acquired over the test site in Vijayawada, India. KPCA-based SVM classification shows an overall accuracy of 89%, which is better than 82% obtained using the SVM-based classification. The proposed methodology effectively incorporates the temporal crop information during classification.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ageometry 3aphenology 3asupport vector machines 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aIndia 0aMulti-temporal 0aphenology 0aSAR 0acrop classification1 aWinīta Kumāra,1 aRao, Yallamanchili S.0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Mar. 19, v. 37, no. 6 p.1547-1559dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2020.17835773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169300001600276520106300292592002801355650001601383650002201399650001901421650001101440650001501451650001101466650001701477650000901494650001701503650001301520650002101533653001501554653001701569653001201586653001901598653002601617700002001643700002101663700001701684700001801701700002201719700002201741773011401763856008501877852000901962655001201971IND60607582920221121034758.0180731e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060758292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.08.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Manasi12aA study on metabolic prowess of Pseudomonas sp.

RPT 52, was isolated from an agricultural field by soil enrichment technique. The bacterial strain was able to metabolize three different chlorinated pesticides; imidacloprid, endosulfan and coragen (belonging to neonicotinoid, organochlorine and anthranillic diamide categories, respectively). RPT 52 was able to degrade 46.5%, 96.6%, 92.7% and 80.16% of 0.5mM of imidacloprid, endosulfan α, endosulfan β and coragen, respectively, in minimal medium over a period of 40h, when provided as sole source of carbon and energy. Degradation kinetics showed that imidacloprid, endosulfan α and endosulfan β followed first order kinetics whereas coragen followed zero order kinetics. Toxicity studies show reduction in toxicity of the parent compound when degraded by RPT 52. Laboratory scale, soil microcosm studies showed that strain RPT 52 is a suitable candidate for bioremediation of endosulfan and coragen contaminated sites.

The institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework was employed to identify the conflicts between the central government and the local government as well as the developers and homebuyers in the formal/informal stage. The analysis shows that, with the implementation of the policy, problems such as fiscal crises, property inflation, and illegal construction will appear as a result of actors’ interactions. The study also highlights that industrial land transfer inside the boundary should be controlled in a reasonable range and that a land value tax should be introduced during the implementation of the urban development boundary policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aindustrial sites 3ainflation 3aissues and policy 3aland values 3alocal government 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aWang, Wei 1 aWu, Yuzhe 1 aPeng, Yi 1 aZhang, Linlin 0 tLand.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100808553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001800136245007000154300001600224520131800240592002801558653001501586653002101601653001901622653001301641653001501654653002001669653003201689700002101721700002301742700002701765773015501792856007201947852000902019655001202028IND60128996620221118015754.0151124e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012899662DNAL7 a10.2987/5748.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRochlin, Ilia10aSalt Marsh as Culex salinarius Larval Habitat in Coastal New York  ap. 359-367.  aCulex salinarius is considered one of the most likely bridge vectors involved in the human transmission cycle of West Nile virus (WNV) and eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus (EEEV) in the northeastern USA. The larval habitats of this species in the coastal region of New York State are currently poorly known. Between 2005 and 2007, a larval survey was carried out to identify and characterize possible larval habitats in Suffolk County, encompassing natural and man-made freshwater wetlands, artificial containers, and salt marshes. Only relatively undisturbed salt marsh yielded Cx. salinarius larvae in considerable numbers from several sites over a period of 2 years. The immature stages of this species were found associated with Spartina patens and S. alterniflora of the upper marsh at salinities ranging from 4.3 to 18.8 parts per thousand. Both heavily impacted and relatively undisturbed salt marshes produced several hundreds of adult Cx. salinarius per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light trap per night, an order of magnitude higher than CDC light traps deployed at upland sites. The ability of Cx. salinarius to use both heavily impacted and relatively undisturbed salt marshes for reproduction has significant repercussions for marsh restoration and vector control practices.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSalt marsh 0aCulex salinarius 0alarval habitat 0asalinity 0avegetation 0aWest Nile virus 0aeastern equine encephalitis1 aDempsey, Mary E.1 aCampbell, Scott R.1 aNinivaggi, Dominick V.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2008 Sept., v. 24, no. 3 p.359-367dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F5748.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011700165300001400282520159600296592002801892650002101920650002101941650001101962650002301973650002301996650001902019650002102038650001102059650001202070650000902082650000902091650002302100650001602123650002302139650001902162650002902181650002002210650001602230650001402246650001002260650000902270650001002279650001202289650001202301651001002313700001702323700001702340700001502357773015902372856008102531852000902612655001202621IND60685887720221120100605.0200311e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068588772DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000200262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonhof, M. J.10aFarmers’ Perceptions of Importance, Control Methods and Natural Enemies of Maize Stemborers at the Kenya Coast  ap. 33-42.  aA survey among 240 resource-poor farmers at the Kenya coast indicated that insect pests were considered to be the main production constraint. Over 70% of respondents mentioned stemborers to be the most important insect pest. Unlike the eggs and adults, stemborer larvae and pupae were frequently seen by farmers. Alternative gramineous host plants for pests were common near maize fields and were often not destroyed until after the first rains. Nearly all farmers left dry stems and stubble in the field after harvest. Farmers knew of many methods for controlling stemborers, but only 32 and 56% of farmers in Kilifi and Kwale Districts, respectively, used any of the methods. Chemical control was the most popular control method, being applied regularly by 19 and 38% of farmers in Kilifi and Kwale Districts, respectively. Traditional methods and cultural control methods were seldom used. Approximately 50% of farmers had heard of beneficial insects, with farmers collectively mentioning 17 predators of stemborers. Cocoons of the parasitoids Cotesia flavipes, released in a biological control programme in the study area in 1993, and the indigenous Cotesia sesamiae had been seen by 33% of respondents, but none knew what these were. The results of the present study stress the need to educate farmers about the biology and ecology of stemborers and the role of natural enemies. Also, after effective control methods suitable for resource-poor farmers have been identified, both groups should be trained in pest management methods, for example through the Farmers Field School approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCotesia flavipes 3aCotesia sesamiae 3aadults 3abeneficial insects 3abiological control 3aboring insects 3achemical control 3acoasts 3acocoons 3acorn 3aeggs 3afarmers' attitudes 3ahost plants 3aindigenous species 3ainsect control 3alimited resource farmers 3anatural enemies 3aparasitoids 3apredators 3apupae 3arain 3astems 3astubble 3asurveys 3aKenya1 avan Huis, A.1 aKiros, F.

During the last glaciation, the south-eastern part of the Baltic Region had been covered by ice on a form of three ice streams, which, in its continental part, were dividing into smaller substreams and lobes differently named in the scientific literature. The goal of the present study is to discuss the glacial multilayerness of the Pleistocene strata in the SE Baltic Region as a phenomenon of palaeo-ice streams, substreams and lobes in the contact zone. The material of previous researches is analysed, as well as published data and new findings of the authors are used. The material available on the Middle Pleistocene Žemaitija till occurring at the depths from 10 to 175 m along the NW–SE distribution of the deposits shows differences in petrographic composition of gravel and pebble beds for the western and eastern sectors. The deposits of the Middle Pleistocene occurring at the surface the Ashmyany Upland and the Lida Plain in this region are thought to be a result of two different asynchronous ice substreams. In the area of the last (Nemunas) glaciation, the ice sheet of two stages – maximum Grūda and the younger Baltija – also formed tills differing in features and composition, thus, testifying the result of different ice streams and substreams. The statistical correlation analysis for the most widely occurring palaeosurfaces of tills in the South Lithuania revealed that the positive coefficient of adjacent surfaces was increasing with the occurrence depth. A conclusion is made that different dynamic activity of ice streams and substreams is a natural and objective phenomenon. Therefore an ice stream, substream or a lobe of the same glaciation but of different stages (phases) could move into a depression formed by another (adjacent) substream or lobe. The multilayered character of the Pleistocene strata in the South Lithuania can be explained by different manifestation of glacial till layers formed by ice streams, substreams or lobes of the same glaciation but of different stages (phases). Application of this conception makes easier the stratigraphic interpretation of the Pleistocene deposits in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglacial till 3aglaciation 3agravel 3ahighlands 3aice 3astratigraphy 3astreams 3atopography 3aLithuania 0aPleistocene 0aStratigraphy 0aIce stream 0aContact zone 0aTill 0aBaltic region1 aKarmaza, Bronislavas1 aPukelytė, Violeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4913-56571 aKarmazienė, Danguolė0 tQuaternary international.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 501 p.21-32dElsevier LtdaElsevier Ltd and INQUAwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245007300209300001600282500001100298506007600309520173500385592002802120506003702148650001302185650001102198650001602209650001102225650001402236650001202250650001202262773013002274856008202404852000902486655001202495IND60610574220221207133525.0190528e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061057422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-017-2744-32doi7 aPMC61326502pmcid7 a292184032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolls, Edmund T.14aThe storage and recall of memories in the hippocampo-cortical system  ap. 577-604.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA quantitative computational theory of the operation of the hippocampus as an episodic memory system is described. The CA3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network (1) to enable rapid one-trial associations between any spatial location (place in rodents or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward and (2) to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The theory is extended to associations between time and object or reward to implement temporal order memory, which is also important in episodic memory. The dentate gyrus performs pattern separation by competitive learning to create sparse representations producing, for example, neurons with place-like fields from entorhinal cortex grid cells. The dentate granule cells generate, by the very small number of mossy fibre connections to CA3, a randomizing pattern separation effect that is important during learning but not recall and that separates out the patterns represented by CA3 firing as being very different from each other. This is optimal for an unstructured episodic memory system in which each memory must be kept distinct from other memories. The direct perforant path input to CA3 is quantitatively appropriate for providing the cue for recall in CA3 but not for learning. The CA1 recodes information from CA3 to set up associatively learned backprojections to the neocortex to allow the subsequent retrieval of information to the neocortex, giving a quantitative account of the large number of hippocampo-neocortical and neocortical-neocortical backprojections. Tests of the theory including hippocampal subregion analyses and hippocampal NMDA receptor knockouts are described and support the theory.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrimates 3acortex 3ahippocampus 3amemory 3aneocortex 3aneurons 3arodents0 tCell and tissue research.g2018 Sept., v. 373, no. 3 p.577-604dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-017-2744-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04065naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001700188245011400205300001100319506007600330520170200406592002802108596005902136596005902195596005902254596010302313596006902416596006402485596008402549506003702633650001302670650001802683650002002701650002202721650002202743650000902765650002102774650001302795650001802808650001502826650001902841650001302860650002002873650004302893650002802936650003502964650001802999650001103017700001403028700001703042700001703059700001403076700001803090700001603108700001503124700001603139700001703155700001903172773009803191856008103289852000903370655001203379IND60644601720221207130014.0200527e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064460172DNAL7 a310969102pmid7 aPMC65243002pmcid7 a10.1186/s12863-019-0749-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Qiang10aIn silico genome-wide miRNA-QTL-SNPs analyses identify a functional SNP associated with mastitis in Holsteins  ap. 46.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target binding sites affect miRNA function and are involved in biological processes and diseases, including bovine mastitis, a frequent inflammatory disease. Our previous study has shown that bta-miR-2899 is significantly upregulated in the mammary gland tissue of mastitis-infected cow than that of healthy cows. RESULTS: In the present study, we used a customized miRNAQTLsnp software and identified 5252 SNPs in 691 bovine pre-miRNAs, which are also located within the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that are associated with mastitis and udder conformation-related traits. Using luciferase assay in the bovine mammary epithelial cells, we confirmed a candidate SNP (rs109462250, g. 42,198,087 G > A) in the seed region of bta-miR-2899 located in the somatic cell score (SCS)-related QTL (Chr.18: 33.9–43.9 Mbp), which affected the interaction of bta-miR-2899 and its putative target Spi-1 proto-oncogene (SPI1), a pivotal regulator in the innate and adaptive immune systems. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that the relative expression of SPI1 in the mammary gland of AA genotype cows was significantly higher than that of GG genotype cows. The SNP genotypes were associated with SCS in Holstein cows. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, miRNA-related SNPs, which influence the susceptibility to mastitis, are one of the plausible mechanisms underlying mastitis via modulating the interaction of miRNAs and immune-related genes. These miRNA-QTL-SNPs, such as the SNP (rs109462250) of bta-miR-2899 may have implication for the mastitis resistance breeding program in Holstein cattle.  aPublisher supplied data  a31771374cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31672397cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31671286cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aJQ201709cShandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China  a2018ZX08007001-002cMajor Project of National Transgene in China  aCARS-36cNational Cow Industrial Technology System of China  a2017GNC10120cShandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3abinding sites 3abovine mastitis 3abreeding programs 3acomputer software 3acows 3aepithelial cells 3agenotype 3aimmune system 3aluciferase 3amammary glands 3amicroRNA 3aproto-oncogenes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asomatic cells 3audders1 aZhao, Han1 aLi, Rongling1 aZhang, Yaran1 aLiu, Yong1 aWang, Jinpeng1 aWang, Xiuge1 aJu, Zhihua1 aLiu, Wenhao1 aHou, Minghai1 aHuang, Jinming0 tBMC genetics.g2019 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.46-46dBioMed CentralwJournal:2166x1471-21567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-019-0749-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245007200211300001600283520112400299592002801423596003401451596007701485596009001562650001301652650002801665650001501693650001401708650000901722650000701731650001401738650000901752700005901761700005901820700006201879773010901941856008302050852000902133655001202142IND60765830520221117104409.0220203e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04342-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGusenbauer, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3520-373210aLocal force titration of wood surfaces by chemical force microscopy  ap. 763-776.  aChemical force microcopy, a variation of atomic force microscopy, opened the door to visualize chemical nano-properties of various materials in their natural state. The key function of this method is given by translating adhesion forces between a functionalized tip and the sample to chemical surface behavior. In force titration, these adhesion forces are studied in different pH buffers, which allows estimating the pKₐ value of the analyzed surface. Herein, we report the use of this method to study natural and chemically treated wood surfaces, which are of interest in sustainable material design. First, we show varying adhesion phenomena of OH- and COOH-functionalized tips on native spruce wood cells. Then, we demonstrate how peak force tapping with chemically functionalized tips can be used to estimate the pKₐ value of gold substrates (pKₐ ≈ 5.2) and different wood cell wall layers with high spatial resolution. Additionally, the swelling behavior of wood samples is analyzed in varying pH buffers. With the applied method, chemical surface properties of complex natural substrates can be analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data  aI 2247caustrian science fund  aSC16-004cgesellschaft für forschungsförderung niederösterreich m.b.h  a160041cschweizerischer nationalfonds zur förderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell walls 3acellulose 3agold 3apH 3atitration 3awood1 aPeter, Karolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6288-79791 aCabane, Etienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5613-88161 aKonnerth, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3826-85660 tCellulose.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 2 p.763-776dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04342-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245010300193300001600296500001500312520099000327592002801317650001301345650001501358650001601373650003001389650001901419650003001438650001701468650001501485650001201500650001901512650004201531650001301573650002801586650002901614653001001643700002001653700001801673700002001691773010101711856008101812852000901893655001201902IND50070572220221119224359.0150210e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007057222DNAL7 a240970492pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-013-9930-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathod, Jayant Pralhad10aAgrobacterium-mediated transformation of promising oil-bearing marine algae Parachlorella kessleri  ap. 141-146.  a2019-12-06  aParachlorella kessleri is a unicellular alga which grows in fresh as well as marine water and is commercially important as biomass/lipid feedstock and in bioremediation. The present study describes the successful transformation of marine P. kessleri with the help of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Transformed marine P. kessleri was able to tolerate more than 10 mg l⁻¹hygromycin concentration. Co-cultivation conditions were modulated to allow the simultaneous growth of both marine P. kessleri and A. tumefaciens. For co-cultivation, P. kessleri was shifted from Walne’s to tris acetate phosphate medium to reduce the antibiotic requirement during selection. In the present study, the transfer of T-DNA was successful without using acetosyringone. Biochemical and genetic analyses were performed for expression of transgenes by GUS assay and PCR in transformants. Establishment of this protocol would be useful in further genetic modification of oil-bearing Parachlorella species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3atransgenes 3aantibiotics 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3abioremediation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atransfer DNA 3afeedstocks 3abiomass 3aacetosyringone 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxphysiology 2aBiofuels 2aChlorophytaxphysiology 2aGene Transfer Techniques 0aAlgae1 aPrakash, Gunjan1 aPandit, Reena1 aLali, Arvind M.0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2013 Nov., v. 118, no. 1-2 p.141-146dSpringer-Verlagx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-013-9930-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245013900202300001200341506007600353520132800429592002801757596005901785596008901844596008901933596007002022506003702092650001202129650002302141650000902164650001802173650001802191650000902209650001402218650001002232650002202242650003502264650002002299700001402319700001902333700001602352700001502368700001802383700002002401700001102421700001702432773010502449856008202554852000902636655001202645IND60644601820221207115044.0210119e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064460182DNAL7 a310969012pmid7 aPMC65214862pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-019-1811-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Yixin10aCandidate loci for the kernel row number in maize revealed by a combination of transcriptome analysis and regional association mapping  ap. 201.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The kernel row number (KRN) of an ear is an important trait related to yield and domestication in maize. Exploring the underlying genetic mechanisms of KRN has great research significance and application potential. RESULTS: In the present study, N531 with a KRN of 18–22 and SLN with a KRN of 4–6 were used as the recurrent parent and the donor parent, respectively, to develop two introgression lines (ILs), IL_A and IL_B, both of which have common negative-effect alleles from SLN on chromosomes 1, 5 and 10 and significantly reduced inflorescence meristem (IM) diameter and KRN compared with those of N531. We used RNA-Seq to investigate the transcriptome profiles of 5-mm immature ears of N531, IL_A and IL_B. We identified a total of 2872 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between N531 and IL_A, 2428 DEGs between N531 and IL_B and 1811 DEGs between IL_A and IL_B. A total of 1252 DEGs were detected as overlapping DEGs, and 89 DEGs were located on the common introgression fragments. Furthermore, three DEGs (Zm00001d013277, Zm00001d015310 and Zm00001d015377) containing three SNPs associated with KRN were identified using regional association mapping. CONCLUSIONS: These results will facilitate our understanding of ear development and provide important candidate genes for further study on KRN.  aPublisher supplied data  a91735306cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFD0100103cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China  a2016YFD0100303cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China  aCAAS Innovation ProgramcChinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3acorn 3adomestication 3aintrogression 3aloci 3ameristems 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscriptomics1 aChen, Lin1 aLi, Yong-Xiang1 aLi, Chunhui1 aShi, Yunsu1 aSong, Yanchun1 aZhang, Dengfeng1 aLi, Yu1 aWang, Tianyu0 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.201-201dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-1811-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245012500179300001600304520124600320592002801566650002201594650002601616650002401642650001101666650001501677650001601692650001601708650000901724650001501733650001801748653003101766653004201797653003701839653003801876653001801914653000801932653000801940653000701948653000701955653000801962653000801970653000701978653000901985653000801994653000802002653000802010653000802018653000802026653000802034653000702042700001402049700001802063773009602081856008502177852000902262655001202271IND60567458620221118234526.0180831e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056745862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichailides, Constantine10aExperimental study of the functionality of a semisubmersible wind turbine combined with flap-type Wave Energy Converters  ap. 675-690.  aIn the present paper the functionality of the Semisubmersible wind energy and Flap-type wave energy Converter (SFC) is examined experimentally. In order to study the functionality of the SFC, the focus is on operational environmental conditions. SFC is a combined concept that utilizes offshore wind energy and ocean wave energy for power production. Details are presented as far as the physical modelling of the wind turbine with the use of a redesigned small-scale rotor and of the Power Take-Off mechanism of the Wave Energy Converters (WECs) with the use of a configuration that is based on a mechanical rotary damper. Tests with quasi-static excitation, motion decay, regular and irregular waves without and with wind that is uniform are conducted on an 1:50 scale physical model. The experimental data are compared with numerical predictions obtained by a fully coupled numerical model using Simo/Riflex tool. A good agreement is observed between experimental and numerical predictions. The combined operation of WECs doesn't affect the tension of mooring lines nor the acceleration of nacelle and the bending moment in tower's base. The produced power of the WECs of the SFC and consequently the functionality of the SFC is estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3aenvironmental factors 3amathematical models 3aoceans 3aprediction 3awater power 3awater waves 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aOffshore combined concepts 0aSemisubmersible floating wind turbine 0aFlap-type wave energy converters 0aPower take-off physical modelling 0aFunctionality 0aCOG 0aECN 0aEC 0aEU 0aFWT 0aMWL 0aML 0aNREL 0aOWC 0aPTO 0aRAO 0aSFC 0aSTC 0aWEC 0aWG1 aGao, Zhen1 aMoan, Torgeir0 tRenewable energy.g2016 Aug., v. 93 p.675-690dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245010000204300001800304520128200322592002801604650001501632650001401647650001101661650001501672650001901687650001601706650001901722650001601741650004401757650000901801650001301810650001901823700005801842700005601900700005901956700006102015700006002076700005902136700002502195700005902220700005902279773011102338856008302449852000902532655001202541IND60765830720221117104341.0220203e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04338-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJusner, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8152-443310aAnalyzing the effects of thermal stress on insulator papers by solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy  ap. 1081-1095.  aMillion tons of cellulosic paper have been used for insulating coils in oil-filled electrical power transformers, thereby assuring the electricity supply for our societies. The high working temperatures in transformers constantly degrade paper insulators throughout their service life of up to 40 years. We approached the structural changes in oil-immersed cellulosic paper samples upon thermal stress in a study that compared unbleached softwood Kraft paper used as insulator paper with pure cotton cellulose paper. The model experiments used a thermal treatment in transformer oil at 170 °C for up to 14 days. The samples were characterized by means of ¹³C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy, mainly based on deconvolution of the C4 resonance. An automated, fast, and reproducible C4 resonance deconvolution employing the “Peak Analyzer” tool of OriginPro 2020 (OriginLab Corporation, USA) was developed and used to exploit ¹³C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy for the characterization of thermally stressed paper samples. Our results show that thermally induced structural changes depend heavily on the composition of paper, that hornification and coalescence of fibrils take place, and that the allomorph composition of cellulose crystallites is altered under the given conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acellulose 3acotton 3adurability 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aheat treatment 3akraft paper 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3asoftwood 3athermal stress1 aBacher, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4307-48491 aSimon, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0847-04671 aBausch, Florian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7076-23561 aKhaliliyan, Hajar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3247-21391 aSchiehser, Sonja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9587-26231 aSumerskii, Ivan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1044-45051 aSchwaiger, Elisabeth1 aPotthast, Antje1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1981-22711 aRosenau, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6636-92600 tCellulose.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 2 p.1081-1095dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04338-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014600157520130700303592002801610650001201638650001501650650002001665650001901685650001901704650002401723700001901747700001901766700001901785700001701804773012801821856007501949852000902024655001202033IND60703877720221119130611.0200721e20200322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070387772DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120610232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jinxin 10aEvaluation of Land Surface Temperature Retrieval from Landsat 8/TIRS Images before and after Stray Light Correction Using the SURFRAD Dataset  aLandsat 8/thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) is suffering from the problem of stray light that makes an inaccurate radiance for two thermal infrared (TIR) bands and the latest correction was conducted in 2017. This paper focused on evaluation of land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from Landsat 8 before and after the correction using ground-measured LST from five surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD) sites. Results indicated that the correction increased the band radiance at the top of the atmosphere for low temperature but decreased such radiance for high temperature. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of LST retrieval decreased by 0.27 K for Band 10 and 0.78 K for Band 11 using the single-channel algorithm. For the site with high temperature, the LST retrieval RMSE of the single-channel algorithm for Band 11 even reduced by 1.4 K. However, the accuracy of two of three split-window algorithms adopted in this paper decreased. After correction, the single-channel algorithm for Band 10 and the linear split-window algorithm had the least RMSE (approximately 2.5 K) among five adopted algorithms. Moreover, besides SURFRAD sites, it is necessary to validate using more robust and homogeneous ground-measured datasets to help solely clarify the effect of the correction on LST retrieval.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3asurface temperature1 aRen, Huazhong 1 aZheng, Yitong 1 aLu, Shangzong 1 aDong, Jiaji 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 22, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120610233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245019400176300001600370520171200386592002802098650002902126650002002155650001202175650002602187650001302213650001402226650002902240650002102269650001302290650001602303650002002319650002202339650001402361650003502375651001002410653003802420653002602458653001002484653001702494653001602511653000802527700001702535700002002552700001902572700001902591700002302610700002102633700001802654700002402672700001902696773013302715856009002848852000902938655001202947IND60630399420221123035409.0190326e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063039942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagano, Noriyuki10aPopulation-level transition of capsular polysaccharide types among sequence type 1 group B Streptococcus isolates with reduced penicillin susceptibility during a long-term hospital epidemic  ap. 203-210.  aOver a 35-month period, group B Streptococcus isolates with reduced penicillin susceptibility (PRGBS) were detected from elderly patients at a regional hospital in Japan, accompanying population-level transition of PRGBS serotypes. The genetic relatedness of 77 non-duplicate PRGBS from 73 patients was analysed. Serotype III PRGBS predominated (16 serotype III/1 serotype Ib) in the first 9 months (period I), then 3 serotype Ib isolates appeared transiently for the next 3 months (period II), which was replaced predominantly by serotype Ia (20 serotype Ia/1 serotype III/1 non-typeable) for 9 months (period III). In the last 14 months (period IV), besides 25 serotype Ia isolates, 10 serotype III were also identified. Serotypes III and Ia isolates, belonging to ST1, shared G329V, G398A, V405A and G429D substitutions in penicillin-binding protein 2X. Of three strains subjected to whole-genome sequencing, serotype III strain SU12 (period I) had a higher degree of genomic similarity with serotype Ia strain SU97 (period III) than serotype Ib strain SU67 (period II) based on average nucleotide identity and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Analysis of the cps gene clusters and the upstream and downstream flanking sequences revealed that disruption of the hyaluronidase gene located upstream of cpsY by insertion of IS1548 was found in strain SU12, whereas ΔISSag8 was inserted between tRNA-Arg and rpsA genes located downstream of cpsL in strain SU97. Interestingly, most serotype III PRGBS re-emerging in period IV had this tRNA-Arg–ΔISSag8–rpsA region. Capsular switching and nosocomial transmission may possibly contribute to population-level serotype replacement among ST1 PRGBS isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3across infection 3aelderly 3agenetic relationships 3agenomics 3ahospitals 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3amultigene family 3apatients 3apenicillins 3apolysaccharides 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aJapan 0aReduced penicillin susceptibility 0aGroup B Streptococcus 0aPRGBS 0aSerotype III 0aSerotype Ia 0aST11 aKoide, Shota1 aHayashi, Wataru1 aTaniguchi, Yui1 aTanaka, Hayato1 aMaeyama, Yoshihiko1 aSuzuki, Masahiro1 aKimura, Kouji1 aArakawa, Yoshichika1 aNagano, Yukiko0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2019 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.203-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245007800165300001800243500002000261520171500281592002801996650002302024650002102047650001202068650001102080650001602091650000902107650001402116650001202130650001302142650001102155650001902166650001102185700002702196700002402223700005702247700002402304773015002328856007302478852000902551655001202560IND60600036220221122160522.0180702e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060003622DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.55542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuwaleerat, Tharatron10aEnhanced production of carotenoids and lipids by Rhodococcus opacus PD630  ap. 2160-2169.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Low‐value waste organics can be upgraded to higher‐value products using microorganisms. The bacterium Rhodococcus opacus PD630 was used to produce colorants (carotenoids) and lipids (potential fuel oils) from glycerol. RESULTS: Submerged culture of R. opacus PD630 produced carotenoids and lipids on glycerol as the primary carbon source, although supplementation with glucose was necessary. A 1:1 mixture (50 g L‐¹ each) of glucose and glycerol in a batch culture afforded a final biomass concentration of nearly 9.0 g L‐¹, a carotenoids concentration of 0.75 mg L‐¹ and a lipids concentration of nearly 2.2 g L‐¹. Compared with using only glycerol (100 g L‐¹) in the medium, the final biomass concentration was nearly 4‐fold greater, the carotenoids concentration was 7.5‐fold greater and the lipids concentration was 8.6‐fold greater when a 1:1 mixture of glucose and glycerol was used. A combination of glucose (70 g L‐¹), glycerol (30 g L‐¹) and ammonium acetate (4.32 g L‐¹) further increased the final biomass concentration to nearly 10.2 g L‐¹. With this formulation, the carotenoids concentration rose to 0.99 mg L‐¹ and lipids concentration rose to nearly 2.4 g L‐¹ in batch culture. A repeated fed‐batch operation with an optimal feeding regimen raised the final biomass concentration to 12.1 g L‐¹. The final concentration of carotenoids was 0.7 mg L‐¹ and the final lipids concentration was nearly 4.9 g L‐¹. CONCLUSION: Glycerol can partly displace the more expensive glucose in production of carotenoids and lipids from R. opacus PD630. Biomass with ∼40% lipids (dry basis) can be produced. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodococcus opacus 3aammonium acetate 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarotenoids 3adyes 3afuel oils 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3alipids 3amicroorganisms 3awastes1 aThanapimmetha, Anusith1 aSrisaiyoot, Maythee1 aChisti, Yusuf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0826-70121 aSrinophakun, Penjit0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 93, no. 8 p.2160-2169dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.55543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245013500176300001600311520070300327592002801030650002301058650002901081650002601110650001601136650002501152650001701177650003701194650001401231650001301245650000901258653002301267653003101290653001001321653006301331653003701394653003901431700002201470700002101492700002201513700002001535773013201555856009001687852000901777655001201786IND60630399520221117164020.0190502e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063039952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrillon, Antoine10aBreakpoint to MIC quotient: A parameter to rapidly evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of β-lactams on Enterobacteriaceae  ap. 674-677.  aMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) do not completely predict the bactericidal nature of the antimicrobial agent.

Among these, nanocellulose has incurred great interest because of its exceptional properties and wide range of potential applications, including in Pickering emulsions. However, the production cost of these cellulosic materials has limited their application. In this study, the capability of a new type of cheaper cellulosic material, cellulose filaments (CFs), in formulating stable oil in water Pickering emulsions was investigated and compared with three conventional nanocelluloses, namely cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and TEMPO-oxidized CNFs (TEMPO-CNFs). Results showed that CFs can provide stable surfactant-free emulsions over wide ranges of salt concentration (0–500 mM) and pH (2–10), as indicated by the near-constant oil droplet size and dewatering index of the emulsions. This is due to the ability of CFs to strongly adsorb to the oil and water interface, as evidenced by Cryo-SEM and visualized through labelled CFs with engineered carbohydrate-binding module (CBM2a) conjugated with green fluorescent protein (CBM2a-eGFP) under fluorescent microscopy. Compared to the emulsions stabilized by other types of nanocelluloses, the CF-stabilized emulsion demonstrated a larger average droplet size and comparable (with CNFs) or better (than CNCs and TEMPO-CNFs) stability, which is partially attributed to the higher viscosity of continuous phase in the presence of CFs. The results of this study demonstrate the use of CFs as a novel and cheaper cellulosic material for stabilizing emulsions, which opens the door to a range of markets from the food industry to engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrate binding 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3adewatering 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3afluorescence microscopy 3afood industry 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ananocrystals 3aoils 3apH 3asalt concentration 3aviscosity1 aPrathapan, Ragesh1 aTelmadarreie, Ali1 aLi, Jia1 aGourlay, Keith1 aMinhas, Gurminder1 aLü, Qingye,1 aBryant, Steven L.1 aHu, Jinguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8033-71020 tCellulose.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 2 p.985-1001dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04320-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245011900167300001600286520105000302592002801352650002401380650001101404650002501415650001301440650001901453650002501472650002201497653003001519653001401549653002601563653002301589700001401612700001601626700001801642700001901660700002101679773009101700856009001791852000901881655001201890IND60613328320221116182417.0200614e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061332832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Ke10aInterface and mechanical/thermal properties of graphene/copper composite with Mo2C nanoparticles grown on graphene  ap. 267-279.  aMo₂C nanoparticles grown on reduced graphene oxide (Mo₂C@RGO) were used to prepare the Mo₂C@RGO/Cu composite. The Mo₂C nanoparticles played a bridging role in not only being firmly attached on RGO but also forming a semi-coherent interface with the Cu matrix, leading to strong interfacial bonding of the composites. The 1 vol% Mo₂C@RGO/Cu composite exhibited a yield strength of 238 MPa, 58% and 127% higher than that of 1 vol% RGO/Cu composite and pure Cu, respectively. The strengthening mechanism of Mo₂C@RGO/Cu composite relied on the dual role of Mo₂C nanoparticles that not only enhanced the load transfer strengthening of RGO but also provided the possible Orowan strengthening themselves. Nevertheless, the Mo₂C@RGO/Cu composite showed a drop in coefficient of thermal expansion but a reduced thermal conductivity compared to pure Cu and the RGO/Cu composite. This study provides new insights into the interface structure, strengthening mechanism and thermal behavior of carbide-modified graphene/metal composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3athermal conductivity 3athermal expansion 0aGraphene/metal composites 0aInterface 0aMechanical properties 0aThermal properties1 aWang, Fan1 aLi, Yu-biao1 aWang, Xiao-hu1 aHuang, Da-jian1 aGeng, Zhong-rong0 tComposites.g2018 June, v. 109 p.267-279dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015900157300001600316520158100332592002801913653003501941653001801976653002701994700001702021700001902038773011402057856007502171852000902246655001202255IND60128485920221117160644.0151115e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012848592DNAL7 a10.2317/0503.18.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, T.

We hypothesized that the paths that western corn rootworm larvae use to find their host from an individual point source (location where agar containing eggs is injected into the soil) in artificial infestations in the field may be limited and become obstructed by early hatching larvae. To evaluate our hypothesis, we tested two infestation levels (400 or 800 eggs/plant) each with five infestation patterns (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 infestation points around the plant). An effect of infestation pattern was observed. Root damage on the 0 to 3 scale from an infestation of 400 viable western corn rootworm eggs increased significantly from 0.12 ±± 0.03 to 0.74 ±± 0.23 when the number of infestation points around the plant was increased from 1 to 16 at one location. Root damage from an infestation of 800 viable eggs increased from 0.18 ±± 0.11 to 0.56 ±± 0.15 as the number of point sources increased from 2 to 16 at the same location. In addition, larval recovery increased significantly from an average of 1.67 ±± 0.49 to 6.22 ±± 0.83 when the number of point sources increased from 1 to 8 for 400 viable eggs at one of the locations. However, there were no significant differences in adult emergence.

The CLAMP analysis of 27 different morphotypes of fossil leaves indicates a mean annual temperature (MAT) of 24.1 °C ± 2.8 °C; a cold month mean temperature (CMMT) of 18.9 °C ± 4 °C and a warm month mean temperature (WMMT) of 27.8 °C ± 3.3 °C. The analysis also suggests a weak monsoonal climate (the monsoon index, MSI 46.7; present MSI 52) with growing season precipitation (GSP) of 1819 ± 916 mm (present GSP 2490 mm). Here we also compare palaeoclimate estimates of the latest Miocene-Pliocene Siwalik Group flora from Bhutan (c. 6 to 3.8 Ma) with those of previously investigated Siwalik Group floras from the Miocene-Pleistocene of Arunachal, India and Miocene Siwalik floras of Darjeeling, India which characterise the monsoon signature at the time of deposition. Since all the Siwalik floras of the eastern Himalaya (Darjeeling and Arunachal Pradesh) spanning the mid-Miocene to Pleistocene yield almost the same values we suggest that overall the eastern Himalayan Siwalik climate appears to have been remarkably uniform over the past 15 million years. The MAT result of the Bhutan Siwalik flora differs by just 0.6 °C from Arunachal and 1.2 °C from Darjeeling Siwalik floras. For all Siwalik fossil assemblages, WMMTs, CMMTs and LGSs (length of the growing season) are similar and consistent (WMMTs around 28 °C, CMMTs around 18 °C and LGSs around 12 months). Similarly, the mean annual relative humidity (RH) and specific humidity (SH) appear to have been uniformly around 80% and 14 g/kg respectively throughout the Neogene of the eastern Himalayan Siwaliks. Changes in the monsoon index suggest that in both Bhutan and Arunachal sub-Himalaya, there has been little change in the intensity of the monsoon since mid-Miocene time, while further west in the Darjeeling area precipitation seasonality has increased since the mid-Miocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3aclimate 3acold 3aflora 3afossils 3agrowing season 3aleaf analysis 3aleaves 3amonsoon season 3amorphs 3apaleoclimatology 3arelative humidity 3aspecific humidity 3atemperature 3aBhutan 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aFossil leaves 0aCLAMP 0aNeogene 0aPrecipitation seasonality 0aMSI 0aEastern Bhutan1 aBera, Meghma1 aSpicer, Robert A.1 aSpicer, Teresa E.V.1 aBera, Subir0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 514 p.326-335dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011900166300001600285520148400301592002801785650001701813650001001830650001601840650001101856650001501867650001001882650003301892650001401925650001801939650000901957651002301966700002101989700001902010700002002029773011802049856008102167852000902248655001202257IND60615234620221119084745.0181009e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061523462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-008-1011-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirose, Mamiko10aPhylogenetic analyses of potentially free-living Symbiodinium spp. isolated from coral reef sand in Okinawa, Japan  ap. 105-112.  aThe existence of “free-living” Symbiodinium that can form symbioses with hosts is implied by the presence of hosts that produce Symbiodinium-free gametes and expulsion and/or expelled symbiotic algae from host. However, it is still unclear if potentially symbiotic Symbiodinium are found “free-living” in the coral reef environment. Sixteen Symbiodinium strains were established from samples taken from three sampling locations of coral reef sand in Okinawa, Japan. Phylogenetic analyses of the partial large subunit ribosomal DNA (28S-rDNA) and the internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) conclusively showed that all 16 isolates belonged to Symbiodinium clade A sensu Rowan and Powers (1991). The lack of other Symbiodinium clades besides clade A in this study may be due to other clades not being readily culturable under culture conditions used here. The new isolates could be phylogenetically divided into four groups, though no sequences were identical to previously reported Symbiodinium. Two of the four groups were closely related to symbiotic Symbiodinium clade A isolated from a variety of host species. One isolate group formed a highly supported monophyly with Symbiodinium types that have previously been characterized as “free-living”. The remaining isolate group, although within clade A, was quite divergent from other clade A Symbiodinium. These results indicate that novel diversity of free-living Symbiodinium exists in coral sand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSymbiodinium 3aalgae 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3agerm cells 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amonophyly 3aribosomal DNA 3asand 3aRyukyu Archipelago1 aReimer, James D.1 aHidaka, Michio1 aSuda, Shoichiro0 tMarine biology.g2008 July, v. 155, no. 1 p.105-112dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-008-1011-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015500157300001600312520178100328592002802109653002202137653002102159653002502180653001102205653001302216653001702229700002002246700002002266700002102286773011402307856007502421852000902496655001202505IND60128486020221123040153.0151115e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012848602DNAL7 a10.2317/0504.06.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibbs, Denise10aMonarch Butterfly (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) Migration Monitoring at Chincoteague, Virginia and Cape May, New Jersey: A Comparison of Long-term Trends  ap. 156-164.  aThe recent increase in illegal logging of the eastern North American monarch butterfly population's overwintering site in central Mexico has emphasized the need for accurate long-term population monitoring tools, especially for this population. One way to obtain indices of annual population size is to record the numbers of monarchs passing by fixed points along the migration route each year, using standardized censusing methods. This methodology has been employed at several sites in eastern North America; however, long-term trends obtained from these sites have never been compared. From 1997 through 2004, the numbers of migrating monarchs were censused daily at the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge, VA, and 100 km directly north at Cape May, NJ, each fall using similar methodologies. We compared the daily census counts from these sites to determine if each site recorded similar daily and yearly numbers of monarchs, and if the year-to-year trends obtained from each site reflected the same patterns over the eight year period (1997––2004). From comparisons of 210 days during which both sites were operated simultaneously, we found that consistently more monarchs were counted at the Cape May than at the Chincoteague site. This may indicate a greater preference for Cape May as a stopover site or its proximity to the tip of the peninsula where monarchs accumulate in unfavorable weather. However, the year-to-year trends were the same at both sites, with each site showing fluctuating numbers of monarchs from year to year with the lowest numbers in 2004. These results indicate the strengths of migration monitoring as a population monitoring tool, and suggest that future monitoring sites be widely separated to minimize redundancy in data collection.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMonarch butterfly 0aDanaus plexippus 0amigration monitoring 0acensus 0aCape May 0aChincoteague1 aWalton, Richard1 aBrower, Lincoln1 aDavis, Andrew K.0 tJournal of the Kansas Entomological Society.g2006 Apr., v. 79, no. 2 p.156-164dThe Societyx0022-85677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2317%2F0504.06.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001900160245010300179300001800282520182100300592002802121650002102149650001902170650000902189650001902198650001502217650001302232650001602245650001102261650002802272650002602300650004702326650001202373650002502385650002102410650001102431650002002442650000902462650002102471650003902492650001702531650001002548700001902558700001802577700001902595700001402614773010502628856008102733852000902814655001202823IND4477022720221122064606.0120502e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447702272DNAL7 a220800052pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2011-015842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasteel, S. N.10aBroiler breeder manure phosphorus forms are affected by diet, location, and period of accumulation  ap. 2689-2696.  aPhosphorus (P) modifications of poultry diets have successfully decreased the total P (TP) in manures, but the effects on manure water-soluble P (WSPM) remain unclear. Our objectives were to characterize P forms in broiler breeder manures as affected by dietary P modification, location within the pen, and manure accumulation period. Two diets were formulated with and without phytase to attain 0.40% available P (AvP) during the breeder laying phase (22–64 wk of age). Manure was collected after accumulation periods of 48 h, 3 wk, and 39 wk in locations under the feeder and drinker and underthe common area (between the feeder and drinker) of the pen. The TP, WSPM, orthophosphate, and phytate in manure were measured. Broiler breeders that were fed phytase with a simultaneous reduction in nonphytate P (NPP) produced manures with 15% lower TP than those fed a traditional diet, but did not change WSPM when averaged over manure accumulation periods and locations within the pen. Regardless of diet, location within the pen, or accumulation period (r2 = 0.76), the WSPM increased linearly as the manure moisture increased. As manure accumulation periods increased (48 h, 3 wk, and 39 wk), TP manure concentrations increased (11.9, 13.2, and 17.3 g/kg, respectively), orthophosphate proportions increased (73.2, 80.1, and 91.0%, respectively), and phytate proportions decreased (23.1, 17.0, and 6.7%, respectively). The mineralization of phytate and other organic complexes, which drive off carbon dioxide, presumably contributed to the increased orthophosphate and TP concentrations. Keeping breeder manures dry helps to avoid the mineralization of phytate to orthophosphate; this mineralization increased WSPM in our study, and thus increased the potential for elevated P loss in runoff when surface applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler breeders 3acarbon dioxide 3adiet 3amineralization 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3arunoff 2a6-Phytasexpharmacology 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aManurexanalysis 2aPhosphorusxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aWater1 aMaguire, R.

The as synthesized as well as modified sheets are then investigated for the photo-reduction of water under sunlight irradiation using different alcohols as hole-scavengers. Structural and morphological studies manifest the formation of well-defined sheet structure of TiO₂ with average dimensions of 55 nm × 46 nm. The measured d spacing of 0.34 nm and 0.23 nm corresponds to (101) and (001) facets of anatase TiO₂. The presence of Au and Pt was confirmed by electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. TiO₂ nanosheets (TNST's) with 0.4 and 0.75 wt % of Au and Pt (Au₀.₄/Pt₀.₇₅-TNSTs), respectively were found to exhibit higher efficiency. Furthermore, photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting studies revealed the increase in photocurrent from 2 mA at 0.5 V to 4.5 mA at 0.65 V for Au₀.₄/Pt₀.₇₅-TNST photoelectrodes, which otherwise was 0.15 mA for the bare TNST photoelectrodes at the same potential. The observed PEC performance was well supported by impedance analysis, wherein Au₀.₄/Pt₀.₇₅-TNSTs (338 Ω) are found to exhibit lower resistance in comparison to bare TNST (737 Ω), which could be due to brilliant photo conductance and interfacial charge transfer properties of Au₀.₄/Pt₀.₇₅-TNSTs. Photocatalytically the Au₀.₄/Pt₀.₇₅-TNST produced ∼143 μmol h¹ of H₂ gas under direct sunlight irradiation, which is found equivalent to 16.1% apparent quantum efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalcohols 3adimensions 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3agold 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoelectrodes 3aphotoreduction 3aplatinum 3asolar radiation 3aspatial distribution 3asynthesis 3atitanium dioxide 3awater 0aTiO2 nanosheets 0aAu/Pt NPs 0aPlasmonics 0aWater splitting1 aPooja, D.1 aKumar, Praveen1 aSingh, Satnam1 aPal, Bonamali0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Feb. 20, v. 175 p.394-401dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008700167300001800254520159600272592002801868596007001896596006701966650003002033650001202063650002302075650001102098650002102109650001502130650001502145650001902160650001502179650001702194650002402211650001502235651001602250700001802266700001802284700001902302773016202321856008202483852000902565655001202574IND60610574920221123035233.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061057492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-018-1537-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Seo Yeon,10aEvaluation of multi-sensor satellite data for monitoring different drought impacts  ap. 2551-2563.  aDrought is a natural disaster that significantly affects human life; therefore, precise monitoring and prediction is necessary to minimize drought damage. Conventional drought monitoring is based predominantly on ground observation stations; however, satellite imagery can be used to overcome the disadvantages of existing monitoring methods and has the advantage of monitoring wide areas. In this research, we assess the applicability of drought monitoring based on satellite imagery, focusing on historic droughts in 2001 and 2014, which caused major agricultural and hydrological issues in South Korea. To assess the applicability and accuracy of the drought index, drought impact areas in the study years were investigated, and spatiotemporal comparative analyses between the calculated drought index and previously affected areas were conducted. For drought monitoring based on satellite imagery, we used hydro-meteorological factors such as precipitation, land surface temperature, vegetation, and evapotranspiration, and applied remote sensing data from various sensors. We verified the effectiveness of using precipitation data for meteorological drought monitoring, vegetation and land surface temperature data for agricultural drought monitoring, and evapotranspiration data for hydrological drought monitoring. Moreover, we confirmed that the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) can be indirectly applied to agricultural or hydrological drought monitoring by determining the temporal correlation between SPI, calculated for various time scales, and satellite-based drought indices.  aPublisher supplied data  a17AWMP-B079625-04cMinistry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport  aNRF-2017R1D1A1A02018546cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3ahumans 3ahydrometeorology 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspatial data 3asurface temperature 3avegetation 3aSouth Korea1 aSur, Chanyang1 aKim, Jong-Suk1 aLee, Joo Heon,0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2018 Sept., v. 32, no. 9 p.2551-2563dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-018-1537-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245008600168300001600254520100600270592002801276650002401304650001301328650001701341650002401358650001301382650001501395653002101410653002901431653002801460653003001488700002001518700001501538700003101553700002301584700001601607773009101623856009001714852000901804655001201813IND60613328620221116182311.0200614e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061332862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoto, A.10aLow velocity impact and compression after impact simulation of thin ply laminates  ap. 413-427.  aNumerical simulations can help in the understanding of the damage sequence of polymer based composite laminates during an impact event, which is a difficult experimental task when dealing with a large number of plies. Low velocity impact and compression after impact in thin ply fabric laminates are studied through numerical simulations in which special attention has been devoted towards the computational efficiency. The impact results show the importance of delamination during the damage initiation, which takes place at few interfaces. After damage initiation, delamination and fiber breakage propagate until a last stage which is mainly governed by fiber breakage. Compression after impact shows a brittle behaviour with almost no damage propagation prior to failure. The numerical models indicate that matrix cracking effects can be assumed negligible for the studied thin ply laminates while delamination and especially the fiber constitutive law shape are important for accurate predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3acracking 3adelamination 3amathematical models 3apolymers 3aprediction 0aImpact behaviour 0aCompression after impact 0aFinite element analysis 0aPolymer-matrix composites1 aGonzález, E.V.1 aMaimí, P.1 aMartín de la Escalera, F.1 aSainz de Aja, J.R.1 aAlvarez, E.0 tComposites.g2018 June, v. 109 p.413-427dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006700174300001600241500001400257520139100271592002801662650001101690650001301701650002501714650001301739650001201752650001101764650002501775650001201800650002601812650002101838653001801859653003001877653004101907653001501948700002201963700003101985773011302016856008502129852000902214655001202223IND60719491920221119031737.0201202e20180220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelisser, Fernando10aEfficient self-compacting concrete with low cement consumption  ap. 324-332.  aNAL-light  aSelf-compacting concretes (SCCs) must have high fluidity, cohesion and should not segregate. These characteristics of fresh concrete increase the cost of production, particularly for lower projected strengths. In this work, a low Portland cement composition of SCC, with added metakaolin and fly ash (binary and ternary blended cements) was studied to evaluate its rheological and mechanical properties. Materials suitable for the mixture of the SCC were selected, characterized and the maximum packing density of the aggregates was determined. A SCC with a low compressive strength of 28.6 MPa and a cement consumption index of 10.2 kg m⁻³. MPa⁻¹ was produced; these values are among the lowest obtained for this type of concrete. An index of 7.8 kg m⁻³. MPa⁻¹ has been obtained for SCCs with higher compressive strength (67 MPa). Having defined a dosage strength of 25 MPa, a composition of 1:7.45 (cement:aggregates ratio) was obtained, with cement consumption of 222 kg/m³ (+49.4 kg fly ash and metakaolin) and a cement consumption index (binder index) of 10.8 kg m⁻³. MPa⁻¹. The results show that it is feasible to produce low strength SCC, with the necessary fluidity and reduced binder consumption, when mineral additions of metakaolin and fly ash are used. This makes SCC more efficient, with important reductions in costs and environmental impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3acohesion 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3adensity 3adosage 3aenvironmental impact 3afly ash 3amechanical properties 3aproduction costs 0aEco-efficient 0aSelf-compacting concretes 0aSupplementary cementitious materials 0aMetakaolin1 aVieira, Alexandre1 aBernardin, Adriano Michael0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Feb. 20, v. 175 p.324-332dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03772naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005900188245007100247300001100318500001100329506007600340520212400416592002802540596005102568506003702619650001602656650002002672650002002692650001402712650000902726650002202735650002402757650003702781650002502818650002502843650002202868650001002890650001802900700001502918700002302933700002202956700002002978700001902998773015903017856008103176852000903257655001203266IND60644602420221207114957.0200721e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064460242DNAL7 a310970362pmid7 aPMC65242352pmcid7 a10.1186/s12966-019-0804-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, Kate E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8301-139110aActivity-related behavior typologies in youth: a systematic review  ap. 44.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Clusters of adolescents differentiated by patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior (activity-related typologies) are common. Understanding both the characteristics of adolescents and modifiable correlates of these typologies, can help to develop interventions for those most at risk. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the socio-demographic characteristics and modifiable correlates of activity-related behavioral typologies among adolescents. METHODS: A systematic search of seven electronic databases was conducted to identify quantitative studies using person-oriented statistical approaches to identify activity-related behavioral typologies among 12–18 year-olds. This systematic review was registered in Prospero (registration number: CRD42016046879). RESULTS: Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria and were classified according to three sub-themes based on behaviors included in the typologies (1. physical activity and sedentary behavior only; 2. physical activity, sedentary behavior and risk-related behaviors; 3. physical activity, sedentary behavior and diet). Studies were mostly cross-sectional and relied on self-report measures. Methods were considerably heterogeneous, however results revealed some consistency in typologies within specific groups. For example, typologies characterized by unhealthy behavior patterns (e.g., characterized by physical inactivity, high sedentary behavior and poor diet or high risk-related behaviors) comprised more older adolescents. With the exception of socio-demographics (age, sex, body mass index and socio-economic status), very few correlates have been studied to date (mostly school-related behavioral factors and intrapersonal influences), with evidence largely from typologies comprised of physical activity, sedentary behavior and diet. CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed to assess a range of modifiable correlates associated with activity-related behavior typologies among adolescents. This will allow for more targeted interventions, to achieve long-lasting, positive behavior change in adolescent populations.  aPublisher supplied data  a100046cNational Heart Foundation of Australia0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3abehavior change 3abody mass index 3adatabases 3adiet 3aphysical activity 3asedentary lifestyle 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asocioeconomic status 3astatistical analysis 3asystematic review 3ayouth 3ayouth at risk1 aSalmon, Jo1 aCostigan, Sarah A.1 aVillanueva, Karen1 aBrown, Helen L.1 aTimperio, Anna0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.44-44dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-019-0804-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012800174300001600302500001400318520173200332592002802064650001702092650001902109650001602128650001102144650001502155650001302170650001002183650001302193650002902206650001402235650001202249650001002261650001602271653002002287653002102307653003402328653001702362653002102379653003302400700002002433700001602453773011302469856008502582852000902667655001202676IND60719492020221119031917.0201202e20180220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehman, Hassam Ur,10aInfluence of technical failures on the performance of an optimized community-size solar heating system in Nordic conditions  ap. 624-640.  aNAL-light  aThere is a substantial need to accelerate the advancement and implementation of clean energy technologies in order to solve the challenges of the energy crisis and climate change. Solar heating technology is a feasible solution among clean energy technologies. In real conditions such complex systems often suffer from different kinds of technical failures and deviations reducing the system performance. This paper focuses on the challenges of a solar district heating system at high latitudes, proposes an optimized solution and investigates the influence of possible failures in planning, implementation and operation phase. The configuration proposed is a heat pump connected between two tanks, using solar-charged borehole storage to directly charge the lower temperature tank. Dynamic simulations were performed and a multi-objective optimization was carried out. The impact of the considered system solutions on the renewable energy fraction, purchased electricity and investment cost as a function of demand, solar thermal and photovoltaic areas, tanks and borehole volumes have been evaluated. The influence of 10 different technical failures was investigated. The study showed that in the optimized system, the most serious faults were i) de-stratification of the storage tanks (23–35% increase in annual purchased electricity) ii) on-off instead of variable speed control of the solar circulation pump (1–22% increase) and iii) reduction in heat pump performance (7–21%). These numbers of course depend on the initial assumptions, but still they show the magnitude of performance reduction some failures can achieve. Therefore, these parameters need to be considered during the implementation of such a system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclean energy 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aheat pumps 3alatitude 3apaper 3aplanning 3arenewable energy sources 3asolutions 3astorage 3atanks 3atemperature 0aSolar Community 0aSeasonal storage 0aSolar district plant failures 0aCold climate 0aDistrict heating 0aMulti-objective optimization1 aHirvonen, Janne1 aSirén, Kai0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Feb. 20, v. 175 p.624-640dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001900170245014300189300001600332520100100348592002801349650002501377650001701402650001301419650002101432650001201453650001401465650001501479650001501494650004301509650001301552650001901565650001001584650007901594650002401673650002801697650006901725650007701794650006701871650003101938650007401969650007102043650002102114651002102135651001702156700002002173700001802193773008802211856008702299852000902386655001202395IND4450655720221119022413.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445065572DNAL7 a211769272pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlGamdi, Noura10aTea prepared from Anastatica hirerochuntica seeds contains a diversity of antioxidant flavonoids, chlorogenic acids and phenolic compounds  ap. 248-254.  aHPLC–PDA–MS² was used to identify phenolic and polyphenolic compounds in an herbal tea made from seeds of Anastatica hirerochuntica, a plant found in the Sahara–Arabian deserts and used to treat a variety of ailments. Twenty compounds comprising a series of flavone C- and O-linked glycosides, phenolic acids, chlorogenic acids and flavonols were identified or partially identified on the basis of co-chromatography with reference compounds and MS² and MS³ fragmentation patterns. The flavones were the principal components, occurring as luteolin, apigenin and diosmetin conjugates. The antioxidant potential of individual compounds in Anastatica was assessed using HPLC with an on-line ABTS ⁺ detection system. This revealed that 14 compounds exhibited antioxidant activity. The highest contribution to the antioxidant capacity of the tea, 56%, came from 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and caffeoyl- and dicaffeoylquinic acids while 6-C-glucosides of luteolin and apigenin contributed 41%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapigenin 3achlorogenic acid 3adeserts 3aflavonols 3aglycosides 3aherbal tea 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aluteolin 3aphenolic acids 3aseeds 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aBrassicaceaexchemistry 2aChlorogenic Acidxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aGlycosidesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aHydroxybenzoatesxanalysis 2aPhenolsxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aSeedsxchemistry 0aAfrica, Northern 0aSaudi Arabia1 aMullen, William1 aCrozier, Alan0 tPhytochemistry.g2011 Feb., v. 72, no. 2-3 p.248-254dElsevier Ltdx0031-94227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006400172500002200236506011700258520153200375592002801907506003701935650001001972650001701982650001201999650001702011650002102028650001002049650001502059650001602074650001402090650001902104653001602123653002502139653002702164653001902191653002102210653001502231653002002246653002902266653002302295653002202318700001802340700003102358700002502389700002202414700002102436700001902457700001802476773010802494856005102602852000902653655001202662IND60770195320221207132157.0220314e20220304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077019532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.semcdb.2022.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRieseberg, Tim P.10aCrossroads in the evolution of plant specialized metabolism  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aThe monophyletic group of embryophytes (land plants) stands out among photosynthetic eukaryotes: they are the sole constituents of the macroscopic flora on land. In their entirety, embryophytes account for the majority of the biomass on land and constitute an astounding biodiversity. What allowed for the massive radiation of this particular lineage? One of the defining features of all land plants is the production of an array of specialized metabolites. The compounds that the specialized metabolic pathways of embryophytes produce have diverse functions, ranging from superabundant structural polymers and compounds that ward off abiotic and biotic challenges, to signaling molecules whose abundance is measured at the nanomolar scale. These specialized metabolites govern the growth, development, and physiology of land plants—including their response to the environment. Hence, specialized metabolites define the biology of land plants as we know it. And they were likely a foundation for their success. It is thus intriguing to find that the closest algal relatives of land plants, freshwater organisms from the grade of streptophyte algae, possess homologs for key enzymes of specialized metabolic pathways known from land plants. Indeed, some studies suggest that signature metabolites emerging from these pathways can be found in streptophyte algae. Here we synthesize the current understanding of which routes of the specialized metabolism of embryophytes can be traced to a time before plants had conquered land.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgae 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aembryophytes 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflora 3afreshwater 3ametabolites 3amonophyly 3aphotosynthesis 0aCharophytes 0aEarliest land plants 0aSpecialized metabolism 0aApocarotenoids 0aPhenylpropanoids 0aExaptation 0aPlant evolution 0aPlant terrestrialization 0aStreptophyte algae 0aStress physiology1 aDadras, Armin1 aFürst-Jansen, Janine M.R.1 aDhabalia Ashok, Amra1 aDarienko, Tatyana1 ade Vries, Sophie1 aIrisarri, Iker1 ade Vries, Jan0 tSeminars in cell & developmental biology.g2022 Mar. 04, dElsevier LtdwJournal:28470x1084-95217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2022.03.004  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245007000164300001600234520166300250592002801913650002001941650002201961650001601983650002901999700001502028773009802043856008502141852000902226655001202235IND4460470720221119022547.0141110e20110805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446047072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.05.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshkar, F.12aA broader look at bivariate distributions applicable in hydrology  ap. 451-461.  aIn hydrology, one often needs to model two dependent variables; regardless of the marginal distribution that each of them follows, while still taking account of the dependence structure that exists between them. In this respect, the use of copulas to model the dependence between the two variables has been found to be attractive. However, the use of copulas for bivariate modeling in previous applications has been restrictive, in the sense that it has focused exclusively on copulas expressible by a simple mathematical form, while ignoring a wide class of other bivariate models that are available to the practitioner. These other models were not given the attention that they deserve, because it was wrongly assumed that they are not flexible enough to allow for different marginal distribution families to be chosen for the two variables that are being modeled. In this article, we shed more light on this class of models, by presenting three specific members of this class, and showing their usefulness through hydrological applications. The results of these applications show that the suggested models have their own dependence structures, and need to be given the same level of consideration in hydrology as the more popular copula models. There is in fact a need in hydrology to consider a wide variety of bivariate models, especially if each model has its own distinctive dependence structure, and given the wide variety of dependence structures that the hydrologist might encounter. The main purpose of this paper is therefore to encourage the exploration of a wider class of potentially useful bivariate models that hydrologists need to consider.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrologic data 3ahydrologic models 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution1 aAucoin, F.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2011 Aug. 5, v. 405, no. 3-4 p.451-461dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04155naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008800164300001800252520256200270592002802832596004202860650001302902650001502915650001102930650001102941650002002952650002502972650003902997650001703036650001003053650001503063650005003078650001503128650001403143650001703157650001103174650001103185650002503196650001203221650001103233651001003244651001803254700001903272700001903291700001603310700001703326700001703343773016203360856008203522852000903604655001203613IND60610575320221117163512.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061057532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-018-1575-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiyuan10aMonitoring temporal–spatial variations of AOD over the Yangtze River Delta, China  ap. 2619-2632.  aAerosol can induce visibility reduction, affect radiation balance and modify cloud property on the environmental effect, and show the harmful effects on human health. Insight of aerosol becomes an integral task in the process of control measures for environmental pollution. The present study provided an analysis of temporal–spatial variations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) using the MOD04 level-2 in collection 6 (C6) with the deep blue retrieval algorithm from January 2005 to December 2015 over Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China. The AOD validations between MODIS and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) were estimated by the methods of regression, correlation. Then, the periodic features and trends of AOD and angstrom exponent (AE) were explored with the wavelet transformation (WT) procedure. Further, the variations of AOD and AE spatial distribution on multi-time scales (annual, monthly and season) were demonstrated. Meantime, the sources of AOD are discussed. It was found that the daily AOD from MODIS has a strong correlation relationship (slope = 0.9838, r = 0.84) with AERONET over YRD. The variations of both AOD and AE on time series have been distinct temporal periodic (12, 6 and 4 months) characteristics, and show the decreasing trends on annual and semi-annual periods. On annual, the AOD on spatial distribution is slowly declining from the northwest towards the southeast, and the AE on spatial distribution is gradually decreasing from the northwest to the southeast and from the land to the coast. The variations both inter-annual AOD and AE on spatial distribution show the inverse trends, respectively. On monthly, the means of AOD range from minimum 0.46 in January to maximum 0.90 in July, and the variations of spatial distribution mainly occur in the north parts of Yangtze River and some scattered areas with high terrain and south coast. The means of AE range from minimum 1.13 in October to maximum 1.58 in April, and the variations of spatial distribution are mainly found in the south of Henan, the north of Jiangsu, the coast belt and the riverside of Yangtze River and the high terrain regions. On seasonality, the means of AOD reaches its maximum 0.68 in summer and minimum 0.50 in winter, and the variations of spatial distribution mainly occur in the coast belt, the north parts of Hongze Lake and the south parts with high terrain. The means of AE reaches its maximum 1.48 in spring and minimum 1.25 in autumn, and the variations of spatial distribution were shown the similarity with that of monthly.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC0210000cNational Key R&D Plan 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3aautumn 3acoasts 3acontrol methods 3aenvironmental impact 3agovernmental programs and projects 3ahuman health 3alakes 3alandscapes 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3apollution 3ariver deltas 3aspring 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3awavelet 3awinter 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aGuo, Zhongyang1 aWang, Yuanyuan1 aChen, Yihui1 aZheng, Xuman1 aXu, Xiaoning0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2018 Sept., v. 32, no. 9 p.2619-2632dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-018-1575-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245016000162500002200322520133300344592002801677650000801705650002501713650001401738650002801752650002901780650001501809650001901824650001901843650001301862650001501875650001701890650001101907653002701918653003801945653002901983653002102012700001602033700001202049700001602061773006802077856008102145852000902226655001202235IND60570512120221121155048.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057051212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Meng10aAgNPs-3D nanostructure enhanced electrochemiluminescence of CdSe quantum dot coupled with strand displacement amplification for sensitive biosensing of DNA  aPre-press version  aA novel strategy using Ag nanoparticles-3D (AgNPs-3D) nanostructure enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) coupled with strand displacement amplification (SDA) for sensitive biosensing of DNA was successfully designed. The prepared CdSe QDs with intense ECL were assembled on the poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites modified electrode, then gold nanoparticles (NPs) as the quenching probe was conjugated to the QDs, ECL signal was efficiently quenched. The target DNA induced cycling SDA and generated a large number of DNA s1. The released DNA s1 could open the hairpin DNA with quenching probe. So the presence of low levels of target DNA can potentially result in a significant enhancement of ECL signal. Furthermore, large number of AgNPs were then in situ reduced in the 3D DNA skeleton on the electrode, which dramaticlly enhanced ECL signal of QDs owing to the excellent electrical conductivity, and the much amplified ECL signal change has a quantitative relation with the target DNA. So by combining the AgNPs-3D nanostructure and cycling SDA to achieve greatly amplified detection of DNA, the promising ECL strategy could provide a highly sensitive platform for various biomolecules and has a good prospect for clinical diagnosis in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3achlorides 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrodes 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananosilver 3aquantum dots 3asilver 0aAgNPs-3D nanostructure 0aStrand displacement amplification 0aElectrochemiluminescence 0aCdSe quantum dot1 aJie, Guifen1 aTan, Lu1 aNiu, Shuyan0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245013800157300001300295520158600308592002801894650001401922650001101936650000901947650001401956650001201970650001201982650001401994650001002008650002002018650001602038650001202054650002302066650001402089650001402103650001802117650001302135650001602148651001002164653001902174653003002193653001602223653002402239653001502263653002502278653001402303700001902317700001702336700001602353773010502369856007702474852000902551655001202560IND60560922920221120185639.0170112e20161027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092292DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-00382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, V.10aSeasonal niche partitioning and coexistence of amphimictic and parthenogenetic lineages of Heterocyprisbarbara (Crustacea: Ostracoda)  ap. 7-14.  aSympatry of amphimictic and parthenogenetic lineages in species with mixed reproductive systems is rarely observed in nature. On Lampedusa Island (Pelagie Islands, Italy), amphimictic and parthenogenetic lineages of Heterocypris barbara (Gauthier and Brehm, 1928) co-occur in a temporary pond. Their sympatric persistence calls for an ecological differentiation. We investigated the role of seasonal variation of temperature and photoperiod conditions by two different approaches: microcosms set up by inundation of dry sediments from the temporary pond and life-table experiments. Microcosms recreate conditions similar to the field and in their sediments random samples of resting eggs of both amphimictic and parthenogenetic females are stored. Life-table experiments supplied individual-based estimates of survivorship, adult life span, fecundity, and sex ratio in the progeny. We carried out the experiments at 24 °C and a photoperiod of 12 h light (L) : 12 h dark (D) (simulating fall conditions) and at 16 °C and a photoperiod of 10 h L : 14 h D (simulating winter conditions). Males and amphimictic females were the most numerous forms at 24 °C and 12 h L : 12 h D; parthenogenetic females were dominant at 16 °C and 10 h L : 14 h D. Life-table experiments showed that amphimictic forms do not complete development at 16 °C and 10 h L : 14 h D. Our results suggest that sympatry of amphimictic and parthenogenetic females in the field depends on seasonal niche partitioning and the storage effect of resting eggs that allows survival through adverse-season conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstracoda 3aadults 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3aislands 3alongevity 3amales 3aparthenogenesis 3aphotoperiod 3aprogeny 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3asex ratio 3asurvival rate 3asympatry 3atemperature 3aItaly 0astorage effect 0arecruitment from egg bank 0ahydroperiod 0aseasonal succession 0amicrocosms 0aHeterocypris barbara 0aostracods1 aMartorella, A.1 aScudieri, D.1 aMenozzi, P.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2016 Oct. 27, v. 95, no. 1 p.7-14dNRC Research Pressx1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-00383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011500166520130000281592002801581650003101609650001401640650001501654650001901669650001501688650001601703650001601719650001601735700002101751700002801772700002501800700002301825773012801848856007501976852000902051655001202060IND60703878620221119130420.0200721e20200323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070387862DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120610312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Adderio, Leo  Pio12aA Combined IR-GPS Satellite Analysis for Potential Applications in Detecting and Predicting Lightning Activity  aContinuous estimates of the vertical integrated precipitable water vapor content from the tropospheric delay of the signal received by the antennas of the global positioning system (GPS) are used in this paper, in conjunction with the measurements of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) radiometer and with the lightning activity, collected here by the ground-based lightning detection network (LINET), in order to identify links and recurrent patterns useful for improving nowcasting applications. The analysis of a couple of events is shown here as an example of more general behavior. Clear signs appear before the peak of lightning activity on a timescale from 2 to 3 h. In particular, the lightning activity is generally preceded by a period in which the difference between SEVIRI brightness temperature (TB) at channel 5 and channel 6 (i.e., ∆TB) presents quite constant values around 0 K. This trend is accompanied by an increase in precipitable water vapor (PWV) values, reaching a maximum in conjunction with the major flash activity. The results shown in this paper evidence good potentials of using radiometer and GPS measurements together for predicting the abrupt intensification of lightning activity in nowcasting systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal positioning systems 3alightning 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atemperature 3atroposphere 3awater vapor1 aPazienza, Luigi 1 aMascitelli, Alessandra 1 aTiberia, Alessandra 1 aDietrich, Stefano 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 23, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120610313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007100166300001300237520102300250592002801273650001401301650002401315650002301339650001101362650001301373650001301386650001301399650001101412650002901423653002901452653002101481653002101502653002601523653002601549700006601575700001401641773009401655856008501749852000901834655001201843IND60567459520221118234758.0180831e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056745952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.04.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, M.10aRobust economic model predictive control of a community micro-grid  ap. 3-17.  aIn this paper we propose a novel economic robust predictive controller for periodic operation.

The haplotypes from the spring wheat region samples clustered into one group, and the majority of winter wheat region samples clustered into another group. However, the haplotypes in the Chang'an population in Shaanxi Province (SC) appeared synchronously in each group. Thus, the distribution area of the SC population became a transition place of haplotype distribution.

Yet little information regarding the role of NF-Y in regulating fruit ripening is available. In this study, a total of 44 NF-Y genes (14 MaNF-YAs, 16 MaNF-YBs, and 14 MaNF-YCs) were isolated and confirmed from the banana genome. Their distribution on chromosomes, gene structures, phylogenetic relationship with other species, cis-acting elements, genome synteny and tissue-specific expression were characterized. Furthermore, it was found that expression of six MaNF-Ys, i.e. MaNF-YA5/B1/B2/C9/C11/C14, were up-regulated as harvested fruit ripened, and their expression were accelerated by ethylene, but delayed by 1-MCP. In contrast, harvested banana fruit ripening was accompanied by down-regulation of MaNF-YA1/A3/A6/B3/B6/C2/C5. Ethylene accelerated their down-regulation while 1-MCP delayed the process. These results indicated that MaNF-YA5/B1/B2/C9/C11/C14 and MaNF-YA1/A3/A6/B3/B6/C2/C5 were implicated in the regulation of harvested banana fruit ripening, functioning as transcriptional activators and repressors, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3abananas 3achromosomes 3aethylene 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3aregulatory sequences 3aripening 3astress response 3atransactivators 0aBanana 0aNuclear factor Y 0aFruit ripening1 aWu, Fuwang1 aJiang, Guoxiang1 aXiao, Lü,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4413-58851 aLi, Zhiwei1 aDuan, Xuewu1 aJiang, Yueming0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2019 May, v. 151 p.98-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010700170300001400277520116700291592002801458650001401486650001501500650001101515650002901526653002101555653002401576653002401600653002501624653003301649700002201682773009501704856008501799852000901884655001201893IND60567459620221118234635.0180831e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056745962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, James T.12aA model-based framework for fault estimation and accommodation applied to distributed energy resources  ap. 35-43.  aThis paper presents the development and approach of a model-based fault identification and accommodation framework applied to sampled-data controlled distributed energy resources subject to control actuator faults. The main objective of the proposed approach is to handle faults that degrade stability as well as performance, while remaining robust to false alarms. The proposed method allows for dual fault detection and estimation, through the use of an embedded system model that minimizes the residual between the estimated and sampled states at each sampling period by adjusting a fault parameter in the embedded model over a past horizon. The resulting fault parameter estimate is then used by the control system to find an optimal fault accommodation strategy by minimizing a predefined performance metric whilst ensuring closed-loop stability. The developed fault accommodation framework is then applied to a simulated model of a solid oxide fuel cell subject to both stability and performance degrading faults in the control actuators. A discussion of some of the practical implementation issues associated with the developed framework is also included.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3afuel cells 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 0aFault estimation 0aFault accommodation 0aModel-based control 0aSampled-data systems 0aDistributed energy resources1 aEl-Farra, Nael H.0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Jan., v. 100 p.35-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03430naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013900163300001800302520185700320592002802177596005902205596005902264650002302323650001902346650002302365650001302388650001202401650002902413650001302442650001802455650001302473650000902486650002202495650001202517650000902529650001002538650001602548650001502564651001002579700001702589700001802606700001402624700001202638700002102650773016202671856008202833852000902915655001202924IND60610575720221123035314.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061057572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-018-1586-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ronghua12aA simulation–optimization modeling approach for watershed-scale agricultural N2O emission mitigation under multi-level uncertainties  ap. 2683-2697.  aIn this research, an integrated simulation–optimization modeling approach (ISOMA) was developed for supporting agricultural N₂O emission mitigation at the watershed scale. This approach can successfully combine soil N₂O emission simulation and the consequential mitigation management within a general modeling framework. Also, uncertainties associated with the key soil parameter can be effectively reflected and addressed through adoption of Monte Carlo analysis for the simulation results. The Monte Carlo simulated results were then used to generate fuzzy membership functions that can be consequentially used for emission mitigation management, reflecting the combined uncertainties for N₂O emission simulation and mitigation management. The developed ISOMA was then applied to a reservoir watershed in Miyun county of Beijing municipality. In the studying watershed, the simulation model was calibrated and verified. Then, N₂O emission from multiple agricultural land-use patterns were predicted. The amounts of N₂O emission of four land use patterns (i.e., cash tree, orchard, cropland, and natural forest) were (536.9, 590.8, 653.1), (237.7, 254.4, 275.9), (79.5, 100.7, 105.1), (33.0, 47.3, 61.1) kg CO₂ eq ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, respectively. Two scenarios (i.e., G₁ and G₂) were set up according to development priorities of local economy and society. Meanwhile, multiple credibility levels were considered according to the risk of N₂O emission. The land use patterns could be adjusted according to solutions of ISOMA. The developed methods could help regional manager choose various production patterns with cost-effective agriculture N₂O emission management schemes in the Miyun reservoir watershed. The manager also can obtain deeply insights into the tradeoffs between agricultural benefits and system reliabilities.  aPublisher supplied data  a51522901cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51421065cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aMonte Carlo method 3acarbon dioxide 3acost effectiveness 3acropland 3aforests 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland use 3anitrous oxide 3aorchards 3arisk 3asimulation models 3asociety 3asoil 3atrees 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aCai, Yanpeng1 aYang, Zhifeng1 aTan, Qian1 aXu, Wen1 aRong, Qiangqiang0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2018 Sept., v. 32, no. 9 p.2683-2697dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-018-1586-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012000169300001400289520136300303592002801666650001001694650001601704650001201720650001701732650001101749650001301760650001001773650001501783650001301798650001901811650001501830650003101845650001401876650001601890651001201906700001801918700001601936700001601952700002101968700001401989773011602003856008102119852000902200655001202209IND60615235420221119084657.0181009e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061523542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-008-1009-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrban-Malinga, B.10aGradients in biodiversity and macroalgal wrack decomposition rate across a macrotidal, ultradissipative sandy beach  ap. 79-90.  aThe decomposition process of, and the meiobenthic and nematode colonization on, stranded macroalgae were studied along a macrotidal, ultradissipative sandy beach gradient at De Panne (Belgium). The horizontal patterns of macro- and meiofaunal densities and diversity in this beach have been well-documented. Defaunated Fucus detritus was buried in situ in litter bags, 10–15 cm under the sediment surface, at seven stations across the beach profile. Colonization by (meio)fauna and organic matter decomposition rates measured as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and dry weight loss, were studied after 10, 21 and 52 days of incubation. Algal detritus was colonized mainly by nematodes dominated by Rhabditidae, Sabatieria, Dorylaimoidea, Monhystera, Paracanthonchus and Daptonema. Organic matter weight loss was slowest at the higher and lower shore and fastest in the mid-shore, in line with the horizontal pattern of nematode diversity in the beach sediment. However, there was no consistent relationship between nematode diversity inside the litter bags and organic matter weight loss, prohibiting an unequivocal conclusion on whether the observed parallel between extant nematode diversity and organic matter decomposition rate indicates a causal relationship or follows from the fact that both are governed by the same set of physicochemical conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFucus 3aRhabditidae 3abeaches 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3adetritus 3afauna 3amacroalgae 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aphysicochemical properties 3asediments 3aweight loss 3aBelgium1 aGheskiere, T.1 aDegraer, S.1 aDerycke, S.1 aOpalinski, K.

This study was conducted to evaluate the influence of TYMS polymorphisms on the survival of Portuguese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy. Our results showed no statistically significant differences between VNTR genotypes; although, considering the SNP C>G, homozygotes 3RG presented a better prognostic at 36 months (p = 0.004) and overall survival (p = 0.003) when compared to 2R3RG patients. Patients with “median/high expression genotypes” demonstrated a better survival at 12 months (p = 0.041) when compared to “low expression genotypes”. Furthermore, 6 bp− carriers (p = 0.006) showed a better survival at 12 months when compared to 6 bp+ homozygotes patients. When analyzing TYMS haplotypes, better survival at 12 months was observed for patients carrying haplotypes with the 6 bp− allele (2R6 bp−; p = 0.026 and 3RG6 bp−; p = 0.045). This is the first report that evaluates the three major TYMS polymorphisms in the therapeutic outcome of NSCLC in Portugal. According to our results, the TYMS polymorphisms may be useful tools to predict which advanced NSCLC patients could benefit more from platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3ahaplotypes 3athymidylate synthase 3alung neoplasms 3aminisatellite repeats 3apatients 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aSeabra, Vítor1 aMartins, Sandra1 aCoelho, Ana1 aAraújo, Antônio,1 aMedeiros, Rui0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.3349-3357dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3197-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01962naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005200168300001300220520075000233592002800983650001601011650002001027650001101047650002501058650001801083650001201101650001101113650001201124653001901136653001501155653001401170653001401184653001701198653004101215653003601256700001701292700002501309773011501334856008201449852000901531655001201540IND60549543520221118001309.0200809e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054954352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2016.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Trevor10aDiversity of large DNA viruses of invertebrates  ap. 4-22.  aIn this review we provide an overview of the diversity of large DNA viruses known to be pathogenic for invertebrates.

In this study, ricinoleic acid was autoxidized in the presence of silver nitrate in order to prepare ricinoleic acid macroperoxide initiator with silver nanoparticles (PriciAg). Beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) sapwood samples were impregnated with the solution of PriciAg under vacuum in a small-scale impregnation container. Thermal polymerization of styrene with PriciAg was carried out inside the Beech sapwood samples leading to wood composite material containing polystyrene-g-ricinoleic acid with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). The decay test of wood treated with AgNPs against white-rot (Trametes versicolor) fungus was then investigated. Insect resistance was performed with Trichoferus holosericeus Rossi. In addition, the leaching test was carried out according to the EN 84 standard and silver content in leached water measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis (AWPA A7). Chemical characterization of the modified wood was characterized using FTIR-ATR technique. The nano silver obtained via environmentally friendly processes exhibited high potential activity against white rot fungus. In addition, the AgNPs showed a higher resistance to leaching because of the polystyrene, as demonstrated by the resistance of treated samples to decay compared with that of the control. Leached and unleached test samples indicated the same mass loss after decay tests. FTIR spectra showed that characteristic peak values of polystyrene and ricinoleic acid appeared at 2980 cm⁻¹and 1728 cm⁻¹, respectively in the impregnated wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. orientalis 3acellulose 3acomposite polymers 3ainsect resistance 3ananosilver 3apollution 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3aricinoleic acid 3asapwood 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3astyrene 3awhite-rot fungi 3awood 3awood impregnation1 aSivrikaya, Hüseyin1 aHazer, Baki1 aPalanti, Sabrina0 tCellulose.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 2 p.1149-1161dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04341-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245007700161300001200238520142900250592002801679650001601707650000901723650001601732650001401748650001501762650000901777650002001786650001101806650001101817650002201828653001701850653001601867653002001883653000901903653001601912653002001928653001901948653002701967700001801994700001702012700001602029773010402045856007702149852000902226655001202235IND60560923320221120180447.0170112e20161122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092332DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-01442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElvidge, C.K.10aSocial cues may advertise habitat quality to refuge-seeking conspecifics  ap. 1-5.  aIndividuals travelling through landscapes may use the presence of conspecifics to evaluate habitat quality. Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L., 1758) are usually territorial and exhibit some degree of density-dependent regulation in wild populations. They are also vulnerable to heat stress and may need to locate a thermal refuge to offset metabolic costs above certain temperature thresholds. During July 2010, a heat wave resulted in water temperatures in the Miramichi River system exceeding 30 °C. During this period, salmon parr were observed aggregating in cold-water refugia at densities several orders of magnitude greater than usual. We tested whether groups of wild-caught salmon parr held at high densities (160 parr/m²) would have an attractant effect on free-swimming parr at three sites differing in temperature between 16.5 and 24 °C. Although neither temperature nor site influenced the number of parr that we observed, there were significantly more parr in close proximity (<1 m) to the artificial aggregations than to the controls. These results suggest that social cues from high-density aggregations of conspecifics during extreme temperature events may advertise the location of thermal refugia to others. Understanding how heat-stressed salmon locate refugia may prove valuable to ongoing conservation efforts given the likelihood of increasingly frequent and extreme high-temperature events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ajuveniles 3alandscapes 3aparr 3arefuge habitats 3arivers 3asalmon 3awater temperature 0aaggregations 0aSalmo salar 0aAtlantic salmon 0aparr 0aheat stress 0ainformation use 0aterritoriality 0athermal refuge/refugia1 aCooke, E.L.L.1 aCunjak, R.A.1 aCooke, S.J.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2016 Nov. 22, v. 95, no. 1 p.1-5dNRC Research Pressx1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-01443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013300169500002200302520194000324592002802264650001502292650002502307650001502332650002002347650002302367650001802390650003302408650002002441650002202461650001102483650001102494650001102505650001902516653004502535653003802580653002702618653003302645653002302678653001502701700002102716700002302737700002402760700002102784773006802805856008102873852000902954655001202963IND60570512520221121155138.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057051252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChisvert, Alberto10aIntroducing a new and rapid microextraction approach based on magnetic ionic liquids: Stir bar dispersive liquid microextraction  aPre-press version  aWith the aim of contributing to the development and improvement of microextraction techniques, a novel approach combining the principles and advantages of stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) is presented. This new approach, termed stir bar dispersive liquid microextraction (SBDLME), involves the addition of a magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) and a neodymium-core magnetic stir bar into the sample allowing the MIL coat the stir bar due to physical forces (i.e., magnetism). As long as the stirring rate is maintained at low speed, the MIL resists rotational (centrifugal) forces and remains on the stir bar surface in a manner closely resembling SBSE. By increasing the stirring rate, the rotational forces surpass the magnetic field and the MIL disperses into the sample solution in a similar manner to DLLME. After extraction, the stirring is stopped and the MIL returns to the stir bar without the requirement of an additional external magnetic field. The MIL-coated stir bar containing the preconcentrated analytes is thermally desorbed directly into a gas chromatographic system coupled to a mass spectrometric detector (TD-GC-MS). This novel approach opens new insights into the microextraction field, by using the benefits provided by SBSE and DLLME simultaneously, such as automated thermal desorption and high surface contact area, respectively, but most importantly, it enables the use of tailor-made solvents (i.e., MILs). To prove its utility, SBDLME has been used in the extraction of lipophilic organic UV filters from environmental water samples as model analytical application with excellent analytical features in terms of linearity, enrichment factors (67–791), limits of detection (low ng L−1), intra- and inter-day repeatability (RSD<15%) and relative recoveries (87–113%, 91–117% and 89–115% for river, sea and swimming pool water samples, respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3aanalytical chemistry 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3aionic liquids 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amagnetic fields 3amass spectrometry 3amixing 3amodels 3arivers 3aswimming pools 0aDispersive liquid-liquid microextraction 0aMagnetic-assisted microextraction 0aMagnetic ionic liquids 0aStir bar sorptive extraction 0aThermal desorption 0aUV filters1 aBenedé, Juan L.1 aAnderson, Jared L.1 aPierson, Stephen A.1 aSalvador, Amparo0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001700158245013300175300001600308520110000324592002801424650002501452650001201477650001301489650003501502650002001537650001001557650001501567650005201582650001101634650004301645650002401688650002401712650003801736650002901774650001801803650002801821650001401849650003901863650004701902650002701949700002201976700002301998773010602021856004002127852000902167655001202176IND50069930220221119105050.0131018e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006993022DNAL7 a235171822pmid7 a10.1111/ppl.120522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLao, Xintian10aTwo cytosolic aldolases show different expression patterns during shoot elongation in Moso bamboo, Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel  ap. 422-431.  aIn fast‐growing Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel), cytosolic fructose 1,6‐bisphosphate aldolase (aldolase; EC 4.2.2.13) was more highly active in elongating tissues than in tissues that had already finished elongating. It is well known that the removal of the culm sheath prevents bamboo from elongating. When the sheath was removed from the culm, the aldolase activity was gradually reduced over time. Two isozyme genes for aldolase, PpAldC1 and PpAldC2, were cloned from the elongating tissues of Moso bamboo. Gene expression analysis using a semi‐quantitative reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction revealed that PpAldC1 was highly expressed in elongating tissues but was hardly detected in elongated internodes, while PpAldC2 seemed to be expressed constitutively in both elongating and elongated tissues. Promoter analysis revealed that the expression of PpAldC1 was induced by gibberellin. These results indicated that the two genes for cytosolic aldolase in Moso bamboo showed different expression patterns and that one of them was involved in shoot elongation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3abamboos 3afructose 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainternodes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ashoots 2aAldehyde-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCytosolxenzymology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGibberellinsxmetabolism 2aGlucuronidase 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & development 2aPoaceaexenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aAzuma, Jun‐ichi1 aSakamoto, Masahiro0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2013 Nov., v. 149, no. 3 p.422-431dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.12052  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245014000158300001600298500001900314520179000333592002802123650001702151650001602168650001602184650001502200650001702215650001102232650002002243650001302263650001102276650001102287650002402298650001802322650001302340651001602353653002002369653002002389653002902409700002002438700002602458700002802484700001702512773010202529856007102631852000902702655001202711IND60695705520221120142842.0200518e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069570552DNAL7 a10.2216/15-93.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalkis, Neslihan10aDinoflagellate resting cysts in recent marine sediments from the Gulf of Gemlik (Marmara Sea, Turkey) and seasonal harmful algal blooms  ap. 187-209.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThirty-four dinoflagellate cyst taxa were found in surface sediment (0–2 cm) at five stations (60–100-m water depth) in the Gulf of Gemlik, Marmara Sea, during four seasons from August 2011 to May 2012. Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Operculodinium centrocarpum and Selenopemphix quanta dominated cyst assemblages in the polluted gulf, where nutrient-rich surface water was stratified during most seasons and bottom water was hypoxic. Twelve cyst taxa were incubated and produced motile cells that reproduced and survived 14–15 days. Highest cyst species number (33) occurred in summer; maximum number of cysts (living and empty) per cm³ wet sediment was in spring, with the annual range from 1520 (fall) to 108,000 (spring). Nine taxa (Brigantedinium simplex, L. machaerophorum, O. centrocarpum, S. quanta, Spiniferites mirabilis, Spiniferites ramosus, cysts of Alexandrium sp., Scrippsiella trifida and S. trochoidea) were found in all seasons at all stations. The harmful dinoflagellates L. machaerophorum and cysts of S. trochoidea and Alexandrium sp. were the most abundant species. The cyst of the toxic species, Cochlodinium sp., is reported for the first time from Turkey. Other HAB species included A. tamarense, Protoceratium reticulatum, Heterocapsa triquetra and Gymnodinium catenatum/nolleri. Relative abundance of potentially toxic dinoflagellates (74%–92% of total cysts cm⁻³) was always higher than nontoxic species, and percentage abundance of cysts cm⁻³ produced by autotrophs (19/34 total species) almost always exceeded those of heterotrophs. Although distributions of the resting cyst taxa were significantly influenced by surface temperature, dissolved oxygen and total water depth, surface salinity was the strongest predictor for cyst occurrences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCochlodinium 3aGymnodinium 3aHeterocapsa 3aautotrophs 3aheterotrophs 3aoxygen 3apoisonous algae 3asalinity 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3aMarmara Sea 0aDinoflagellates 0aMarine sediment 0aToxic and nontoxic cysts1 aBalci, Muharrem1 aGiannakourou, Antonia1 aVenetsanopoulou, Amalia1 aMudie, Petra0 tPhycologia.g2016 Mar. 1, v. 55, no. 2 p.187-209dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/15-93.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245005900163300001600222520143100238592002801669650002001697650000801717650001801725650001901743650001801762650002301780650001901803650001001822650001101832650001901843650002201862650001801884650002901902700001801931700001701949700001701966700001801983700001602001773009702017856008102114852000902195655001202204IND60548386020221119220430.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054838602DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-016-9623-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Weiyuan10aTumour suppressive function of HUWE1 in thyroid cancer  ap. 395-405.  aHUWE1 (the HECT, UBA, and WWE domain-containing protein 1) is an ubiquitin E3 ligase which plays an important role in coordinating diverse cellular processes. It has been found to be dysregulated in various cancer type and its functions in tumorigenesis remain controversial. The potential tumour suppressive role of HUWE1 in thyroid cancer development was investigated by knocking down HUWE1 in three authentic thyroid cancer cell lines, WRO, FTC133 and BCPAP, followed by various functional assays, including cell proliferation, scratch wound healing and invasion assays. Xenograft experiment was performed to examine in vivo tumour suppressive properties of HUWE1. Small-interfering RNA mediated knockdown of HUWE1 promoted cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion in thyroid cancer cells. Overexpression of HUWE1 conferred partial sensitivity to chemo drugs interfering with DNA replication in these cells. Moreover, HUWE1 was found to be down-regulated in human thyroid cancer tissues compared with matched normal thyroid tissues. In addition, overexpression of HUWE1 significantly inhibited tumour growth in vivo using xenograft mouse models. Mechanistic investigation revealed that HUWE1 can regulate p53 protein level through its stabilization. HUWE1 functions as a tumour suppressor in thyroid cancer progression, which may represent a novel therapeutic target for prevention or intervention of thyroid cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3aRNA 3aanimal models 3acarcinogenesis 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3adisease course 3adrugs 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3athyroid neoplasms 3atissue repair 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aZhao, Pengxin1 aZang, Leilei1 aZhang, Kaili1 aLiao, Haiying1 aHu, Zhigang0 tJournal of biosciences.g2016 Sept., v. 41, no. 3 p.395-405dSpringer Indiax0250-59917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-016-9623-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03842naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012800164520218700292592002802479650001302507650001502520650001902535650001502554650001002569650001102579650002802590650001402618650001902632650001702651650002002668650003602688650001802724650003202742650003702774653001802811653002602829653003102855653002402886653000902910653001102919700001802930700002702948700002902975700001503004700002103019700001803040700002303058700001803081773009803099856008203197852000903279655001203288IND60739122620221121234818.0220830e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073912262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1196582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOoi, Bee Kee10aIn vitro evaluation of the involvement of Nrf2 in maslinic acid-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in atheroma pathogenesis  aMaslinic acid (MA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene known to exert cardioprotective effects. This study aims to investigate the involvement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) for MA-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in atheroma pathogenesis in vitro, including evaluation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced monocyte recruitment, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced scavenger receptors expression, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ĸB) activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) and human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) macrophages. An in vitro monocyte recruitment model utilizing THP-1 and HUVECs was developed to evaluate TNF-α-induced monocyte adhesion and trans-endothelial migration. To study the role of Nrf2 for MA-mediated anti-inflammatory effects, Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 was used as the pharmacological inhibitor. The expression of Nrf2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), and scavenger receptor type A (SR-A) in HUVECs and THP-1 macrophages were investigated using RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The NF-κB activity was determined using NF-κB (p65) Transcription Factor Assay Kit. The results showed opposing effects of MA on Nrf2 expression in HUVECs and THP-1 macrophages. MA suppressed TNF-α-induced Nrf2 expression in HUVECs, but enhanced its expression in THP-1 macrophages. Combined effects of MA and ML385 suppressed MCP-1, VCAM-1, and SR-A expressions. Intriguingly, at the protein level, ML385 selectively inhibited SR-A but enhanced CD36 expression. Meanwhile, ML385 further enhanced MA-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activity in HUVECs. This effect, however, was not observed in THP-1 macrophages. MA attenuated foam cell formation by suppressing VCAM-1, MCP-1, and SR-A expression, as well as NF-κB activity, possibly through Nrf2 inhibition. The involvement of Nrf2 for MA-mediated anti-inflammatory effects however differs between HUVECs and macrophages. Future investigations are warranted for a detailed evaluation of the contributing roles of Nrf2 in foam cells formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acell lines 3achemokine CCL2 3afoam cells 3afoams 3ahumans 3alow density lipoprotein 3amonocytes 3aneoplasm cells 3apathogenesis 3aprotein content 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atriterpenoids 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avascular cell adhesion molecules 0aMaslinic acid 0aMonocytes recruitment 0aTransendothelial migration 0aScavenger receptors 0aNrf2 0aNF-κB1 aPhang, Su Wen1 aYong, Phelim Voon Chen1 aChellappan, Dinesh Kumar1 aDua, Kamal1 aKhaw, Kooi-Yeong1 aGoh, Bey Hing1 aPusparajah, Priyia1 aYap, Wei Hsum0 tLife sciences.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 278 p.119658-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1196583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245014100167500001400308520127900322592002801601650002801629650003101657650002101688650002901709650002701738650001301765650002301778650003001801650001401831650001201845650001101857650001901868650002201887650001601909700002401925700003301949700002101982773012302003856008002126852000902206655001202215IND60718808620221120193713.0201126e20201121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071880862DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy101118292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedele, Giorgia 14aThe Colonization of Grape Bunch Trash by Microorganisms for the Biocontrol of Botrytis cinerea as Influenced by Temperature and Humidity  aNAL-light  aSix commercial biocontrol agents (BCAs: Aureobasidium pullulans, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. amyloliquefaciens plantarum, B. subtilis, Metschnikowia fructicola, or Trichoderma atroviride) were applied to bunch trash that was then incubated at one of five temperatures (T, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C) and one of five relative humidity levels (RH, 60, 80, 90, 95, and 100%). After 1 to 13 days of incubation (BCA colonization period), the number of colony forming units (CFUs) was assessed. The colonization of bunch trash in response to T/RH conditions and BCA colonization period differed among the BCAs; the coefficients of variation among the BCAs ranged from 104.6 to 397.7%. Equations were developed that accounted for the combined effects of the T, RH, and BCA colonization period on BCA colonization of bunch trash. Assuming that the equations, which had an R² > 0.87, correctly predict BCA growth under field conditions, they would help farmers select the BCA to be used for a specific application based on weather conditions at the time of treatment and in the following days. The equations would also help predict how long an early season BCA application remains effective and thereby help farmers decide whether and when a second BCA application may be needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aMetschnikowia fructicola 3aTrichoderma atroviride 3aagronomy 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aequations 3afarmers 3agrapes 3amicroorganisms 3arelative humidity 3atemperature1 aBrischetto, Chiara 1 aGonzález-Domínguez, Elisa 1 aRossi, Vittorio 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Nov. 21, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy101118293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245011500203506007600318520105100394592002801445506003701473650002101510650001201531650001201543650002001555650001901575650002101594650000901615650002701624650001501651650003001666653001901696653001401715653002101729653002001750653000801770653002501778700001701803700002101820773010701841856007801948852000902026655001202035IND60124944120221207051136.0151030e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012494412DNAL7 a10.3732/apps.13000302doi7 aPMC41036022pmcid7 a252025982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Oscar J.10aIsolation and Characterization of Microsatellite Loci from Amur Honeysuckle, Lonicera maackii (Caprifoliaceae)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPremise of the study: Lonicera maackii (Caprifoliaceae) is one of the most problematic invasive shrubs in forests of the eastern United States. Microsatellite markers could serve to test putative source-sink relationships among populations to determine whether invasions progress along expanding fronts or through long-distance dispersal events followed by local expansion. Methods and Results: Eleven microsatellite loci were developed for Amur honeysuckle using a modified magnetic bead protocol. Six loci were screened across 158 individuals from seven populations and were shown to be variable, with the number of alleles per locus ranging from seven to 16. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.655 to 0.757. Five additional loci were screened using 68 individuals from three different populations, with seven to 12 alleles per locus and observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.682 and 0.831. Conclusions: These microsatellite markers will help to elucidate the genetic structure and patterns of dispersal of L. maackii in its invasive range.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLonicera maackii 3aalleles 3aforests 3agenetic markers 3aheterozygosity 3ainvasive species 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation 3asource-sink relationships 0aCaprifoliaceae 0agene flow 0aLonicera maackii 0amicrosatellites 0aPCR 0apopulation structure1 aMcNutt, Erin1 aBarriball, Kelly0 tApplications in plant sciences.g2014 Feb., v. 2, no. 2dBotanical Society of Americax2168-04507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732%2Fapps.13000303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245011400157300001600271500001900287520125500306592002801561650001601589650001001605650001801615650001401633650001401647650002501661650001401686653002001700653001301720653001501733653000901748653001501757653001701772653002701789653002001816700001801836700002301854700001601877773010201893856007101995852000902066655001202075IND60695705620221120142838.0200518e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069570562DNAL7 a10.2216/15-94.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, So Young10aWynneophycus geminatus gen. & comb. nov.

(Delesseriaceae, Ceramiales) is a new monotypic genus based on Hypoglossum geminatum Okamura, a species originally described from Japan. Wynneophycus geminatus (Okamura) comb. nov. is characterized by a discoid holdfast, erect or decumbent monostromatic blades with percurrent midribs, production of new blades from the midrib axial cells and absence of microscopic veins. In addition, it has apical cell division, several orders of lateral cell rows and paired transverse periaxial cells and formation of second-order cell rows from lateral cells with all forming third-order cell rows, with the midrib becoming corticated and forming a subterete stipe below as the blade wings are lost. Distinctive features of the new genus include tetrasporangia initiated from and restricted to single rows of second-order cells arranged in a single layer, cover cells developing prior to the tetrasporangia and an absence of intercalary cell divisions. Phylogenetic analyses of rbcL and large-subunit rDNA sequence data support the separation of Wynneophycus from Hypoglossum. We herein report on W. geminatus gen. & comb. nov. and delineate the new tribe Wynneophycuseae within the subfamily Delesserioideae of the family Delesseriaceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypoglossum 3aJapan 3acell division 3anew genus 3anew tribe 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 0aDelesserioideae 0aLSU rDNA 0aMorphology 0arbcL 0aRhodophyta 0aWynneophycus 0aWynneophycus geminatus 0aWynneophycuseae1 aWon, Boo Yeon1 aFredericq, Suzanne1 aCho, Tae Oh0 tPhycologia.g2016 Mar. 1, v. 55, no. 2 p.165-177dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/15-94.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245009500206300001300301520130700314592002801621653003101649653002701680653002101707653002101728653002201749653002101771653001501792653001801807700001801825700002101843700001901864773009801883856008101981852000902062655001202071IND60557689120221120204850.0161103e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055768912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dcn.2016.04.0032doi7 aPMC69877022pmcid7 a274903042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabibi, Assal10aNeural correlates of accelerated auditory processing in children engaged in music training  ap. 1-14.  aSeveral studies comparing adult musicians and non-musicians have shown that music training is associated with brain differences. It is unknown, however, whether these differences result from lengthy musical training, from pre-existing biological traits, or from social factors favoring musicality. As part of an ongoing 5-year longitudinal study, we investigated the effects of a music training program on the auditory development of children, over the course of two years, beginning at age 6–7. The training was group-based and inspired by El-Sistema. We compared the children in the music group with two comparison groups of children of the same socio-economic background, one involved in sports training, another not involved in any systematic training. Prior to participating, children who began training in music did not differ from those in the comparison groups in any of the assessed measures. After two years, we now observe that children in the music group, but not in the two comparison groups, show an enhanced ability to detect changes in tonal environment and an accelerated maturity of auditory processing as measured by cortical auditory evoked potentials to musical notes.

EAᵤ and EC did not respond to aeration of the suspensions or to the presence of sucrose as a reducing agent. EPₜ responded to these conditions, but did not correspond to the electrode potentials of the Mn²⁺-Mn oxide, O₂-H₂O, or H⁺-H₂ couples. It is concluded that EPₜ is a mixed potential whose major components are the O₂-H₂O couple in aerated suspensions or the H⁺-H₂ couple in anaerobic suspensions, but whose value is not related to the Nernstian distribution of oxidized and reduced species. Although EPₜ is a qualitative measure of the oxidation-reduction conditions in the soil, it has no quantitative significance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aelectrodes 3agold 3agraphene 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3areducing agents 3asoil 3asucrose0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1968 Mar., v. 32, no. 2 p.211-215dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1968.03615995003200020019x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245020500178520195900383592002802342650002202370650002002392650002302412650002302435650001502458650002102473650002402494650001602518650001502534650001602549650001502565651001602580653001502596653002102611653001702632653001602649653001402665700002202679700002402701773010302725856008902828852000902917655001202926IND60775584520221120132028.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077558452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2022.1049262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaunders, Thomas E.10aRetrospective host-specificity testing shows Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) and the native Trissolcus oenone (Dodd) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) have overlapping physiological host ranges in New Zealand  aRetrospective host range testing is essential for understanding the physiological host range of introduced biological control agents (BCAs) and updating forecasts of non-target risks. It is especially important to conduct this work if there was no host range testing prior to release of the agent. Trissolcus basalis Wollaston was released in New Zealand in 1949 against green vegetable bug (Nezara viridula [L.]), but host range testing was never undertaken, and subsequent work in the 1960s was only of a qualitative nature and remains incomplete. The host-parasitoid complex between New Zealand pentatomids, T. basalis, and the native pentatomid parasitoid Trissolcus oenone Dodd, is therefore poorly understood. We conducted no-choice oviposition tests between the two resident Trissolcus species and all available New Zealand pentatomid species to characterise the physiological (=fundamental) host ranges of these parasitoids. We present the results of the first retrospective host-specificity study on T. basalis in New Zealand. Our results show T. basalis attacks and develops in all nine pentatomid taxa we exposed it to (including the endemic alpine species Hypsithocus hudsonae Bergroth), while T. oenone attacks and develops in seven out of eight pentatomid species we tested it against (and its capacity to attack H. hudsonae remains unknown). Parasitism efficiencies for all treatments exceeded 60%, while development times were similar for both parasitoids regardless of host. We discuss the importance of physiological host range testing for understanding potential non-target effects. Trissolcus japonicus Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) was recently approved for release in New Zealand against brown marmorated stink bug Halyomorpha halys Stål (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), subject to its potential establishment, and we examine our results in the context of potential competition between introduced parasitoids for non-target species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalyomorpha halys 3aNezara viridula 3aTrissolcus basalis 3abiological control 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3anontarget organisms 3aoviposition 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3avegetables 3aNew Zealand 0aHost range 0aNon-target risks 0aPentatomidae 0aOviposition 0aNo-choice1 aAvila, Gonzalo A.1 aHolwell, Gregory I.0 tBiological control.g2022 July, v. 170 p.104926-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2022.1049263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002800188245016600216300001400382520174600396592002802142653003002170653001602200653001302216653002802229653006502257653001602322700002402338700002602362700002702388700002602415700002202441700006802463773009902531856008102630852000902711655001202720IND60557689220221120204928.0161103e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055768922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dcn.2016.08.0022doi7 aPMC69876492pmcid7 a275917122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan den Bulk, Bianca G.10aAmygdala habituation to emotional faces in adolescents with internalizing disorders, adolescents with childhood sexual abuse related PTSD and healthy adolescents  ap. 15-25.  aAdolescents with internalizing disorders and adolescents with childhood sexual abuse related post-traumatic stress disorder (CSA-related PTSD) show a large overlap in symptomatology. In addition, brain research indicated hyper-responsiveness and sustained activation instead of habituation of amygdala activation to emotional faces in both groups. Little is known, however, about whether the same patterns of amygdala habituation are present in these two groups. The current study examined habituation patterns of amygdala activity to emotional faces (fearful, happy and neutral) in adolescents with a DSM-IV depressive and/or anxiety disorder (N=25), adolescents with CSA-related PTSD (N=19) and healthy controls (N=26). Behaviourally, the adolescents from the internalizing and CSA-related PTSD group reported more anxiety to fearful and neutral faces than adolescents from the control group and adolescents from the CSA-related PTSD group reacted slower compared to the internalizing group. At the whole brain level, there was a significant interaction between time and group within the left amygdala. Follow-up ROI analysis showed elevated initial activity in the amygdala and rapid habituation in the CSA-related PTSD group compared to the internalizing group. These findings suggest that habituation patterns of amygdala activation provide additional information on problems with emotional face processing. Furthermore, the results suggest there are differences in the underlying neurobiological mechanisms related to emotional face processing for adolescents with internalizing disorders and adolescents with CSA-related PTSD. Possibly CSA-related PTSD is characterized by a stronger primary emotional response driven by the amygdala.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEmotional face processing 0aHabituation 0aAmygdala 0aInternalizing disorders 0aChildhood sexual abuse related posttraumatic stress disorder 0aAdolescents1 aSomerville, Leah H.1 avan Hoof, Marie-José1 avan Lang, Natasja D.J.1 avan der Wee, Nic J.A.1 aCrone, Eveline A.1 aVermeiren, Robert R.J.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8673-22070 tDevelopmental Cognitive Neuroscience.g2016 Oct., v. 21 p.15-25dElsevier Ltdx1878-92937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001700168245009000185300001600275520087800291592002801169650001301197650002001210650001001230650001401240650001401254650001401268650001201282650004001294650001801334650002501352650002501377650003701402650001401439650002701453653003901480653002601519653001101545653000801556653001801564653001901582700001901601700001801620700002001638773013001658856008401788852000901872655001201881IND60082841320221117185743.0190411e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008284132DNAL7 a239066002pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2013.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolan, Emily10aPhylogeny and systematics of deep-sea sea pens (Anthozoa: Octocorallia: Pennatulacea)  ap. 610-618.  aMolecular methods have been used for the first time to determine the phylogeny of families, genera and species within the Pennatulacea (sea pens). Variation in ND2 and mtMutS mitochondrial protein-coding genes proved adequate to resolve phylogenetic relationships among pennatulacean families. The gene mtMutS is more variable than ND2 and differentiates all genera, and many pennatulacean species. A molecular phylogeny based on a Bayesian analysis reveals that suborder Sessiliflorae is paraphyletic and Subselliflorae is polyphyletic. Many families of pennatulaceans do not represent monophyletic groups including Umbellulidae, Pteroeididae, and Kophobelemnidae. The high frequency of morphological homoplasy in pennatulaceans has led to many misinterpretations in the systematics of the group. The traditional classification scheme for pennatulaceans requires revision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthozoa 3aBayesian theory 3agenes 3amonophyly 3aparaphyly 3apolyphyly 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBayes Theorem 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Mitochondrial 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aMitochondrial protein-coding genes 0aMolecular systematics 0amtMutS 0aND2 0aPhylogenetics 0aPennatulaceans1 aTyler, Paul A.1 aYesson, Chris1 aRogers, Alex D.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2013 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.610-618dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2013.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100003200161245009000193300001600283500000900299520104900308592002801357650002101385650001501406650001901421650001501440650002201455650001101477650002201488650002701510650000901537650001401546650001501560650002601575650002001601650001501621650002701636650003501663650001401698650001501712650000901727700001801736773014701754856009601901852000901997655001202006IND60668135420221118065402.0191125e196005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066813542DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1960.03615995002400030025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBingham, F.

To separate the effect of the carrier from that due to phosphorus, Ca(H₂PO₄)₂, H₃PO₄, KH₂PO₄, and NH₄H₂PO₄ sources were also used in a separate experiment. Chemical analyses of water extracts from the latter experiment provided the solubility data as controlled by excesses of P. Regardless of sources, excess P resulted in acute Cu deficiency; and in the case of acid soils, reduced uptake of B and Zn usually followed excess P fertilization. Excessive P fertilization of acid soils resulted in increased Mn and Mo uptake, whereas in alkaline soils excessive P reduced the availability of Mo. Solubility of Mn, B, and Mo Paralleled uptake data. Cu and Zn Solubilities were increased by excessive P fertilization. Mechanisms pertinent to the various P interactions are discussed with the major emphasis placed on P-Cu antagonism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus aurantium 3aacid soils 3aalkaline soils 3aantagonism 3achemical analysis 3acopper 3acopper deficiency 3afertilizer application 3airon 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3amonocalcium phosphate 3aphosphoric acid 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3aseedlings 3asolubility 3azinc1 aGarber, M.

A to investigate the population genetic structure of this fungal symbiont across its fragmented distribution in southeastern Australia.Methods and Results: A partial genome sequence from an individual collection of Laccaria sp. A was obtained by 454 genome sequencing. Eight microsatellite markers were selected from 66 loci identified in the genome. The selected markers were highly polymorphic (4–19 alleles per locus, average 13 alleles) and amplified reproducibly from collections made across the distribution of this species. Five of these markers also amplified reproducibly in the sister species Laccaria sp. E (1). All eight of the selected microsatellite loci were from the mitochondrial genome.Conclusions: The highly polymorphic markers described here will enable population structure of Laccaria sp. A to be determined, contributing to research on mycorrhizal fungi from a novel distribution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLaccaria 3aalleles 3abiogeography 3agenetic markers 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apopulation structure 3asequence analysis 3asymbionts 0aHydnangiaceae 0aLaccaria 0amicrosatellites 0amitochondria 0amycorrhizae 0aNothofagus cunninghamii1 aWouw, Angela P.

For each plant part, fourth instars of M. vitrata were individually exposed to a set of three odours obtained from the cowpea varieties with pure air serving as the control. Movements of the larvae in the exposure chamber were followed at two levels of choice. Results from the first level of choice showed that the attractiveness of a particular plant part to M. vitrata larvae was not significantly influenced by variety. At the second level of choice a weakly significant preference was found for flowers (P = 0.1218) compared to pods (P = 0.7530) and flower buds (P = 0.6172). In all cases, no significant difference was found between the control (pure air) and the varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaruca testulalis 3aPyralidae 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3aflower buds 3aflowers 3ainstars 3aodors 3aolfactometers 3apods1 aHountondji, F.

Methyllysine reader proteins are increasingly a focus of epigenetics research and play important roles in regulating many cellular processes. These reader proteins are vital players in development, cell cycle regulation, stress responses, oncogenesis, and other disease pathways. The recent emergence of a small number of chemical inhibitors for methyllysine reader proteins supports the viability of these proteins as targets for drug development. This article introduces the biochemistry and biology of methyllysine reader proteins, provides an overview of functions for those families of readers that have been targeted to date (MBT, PHD, tudor, and chromodomains), and reviews the development of synthetic agents that directly block their methyllysine reading functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle 3achemical inhibitors 3adrugs 3aepigenetics 3amethylation 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins 3astress response 3aviability1 aHof, Fraser0 tBiochemistry.g2016 Mar. 22, v. 55, no. 11 p.1570-1583dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.5b010733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010700158520116300265592002801428650001501456650002201471650002401493650001001517650000901527650001901536650001101555650001601566650001601582700001701598700001801615700001901633700001701652700001701669773011901686856007301805852000901878655001201887IND60653543520221121211621.0190714e20190423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065354352DNAL7 a10.3390/w110408502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Myungjin 10aHydrological Modeling Approach Using Radar-Rainfall Ensemble and Multi-Runoff-Model Blending Technique  aThe purpose of this study is to reduce the uncertainty in the generation of rainfall data and runoff simulations. We propose a blending technique using a rainfall ensemble and runoff simulation. To create rainfall ensembles, the probabilistic perturbation method was added to the deterministic raw radar rainfall data. Then, we used three rainfall-runoff models that use rainfall ensembles as input data to perform a runoff analysis: The tank model, storage function model, and streamflow synthesis and reservoir regulation model. The generated rainfall ensembles have increased uncertainty when the radar is underestimated, due to rainfall intensity and topographical effects. To confirm the uncertainty, 100 ensembles were created. The mean error between radar rainfall and ground rainfall was approximately 1.808&ndash;3.354 dBR. We derived a runoff hydrograph with greatly reduced uncertainty by applying the blending technique to the runoff simulation results and found that uncertainty is improved by more than 10%. The applicability of the method was confirmed by solving the problem of uncertainty in the use of rainfall radar data and runoff models.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic models 3ameteorological data 3aradar 3arain 3arain intensity 3arunoff 3astream flow 3auncertainty1 aKang, Narae 1 aJoo, Hongjun 1 aKim, Hung  Soo1 aKim, Soojun 1 aLee, Jongso 0 tWater.g2019 Apr. 23, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110408503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002300161245008500184300001600269500000900285520073600294592002801030650001101058650001801069650001501087650001301102650000801115650001301123650002101136650002001157650001001177650001001187650002601197650002001223650002201243650001001265650001001275650001901285773014701304856009601451852000901547655001201556IND60668135720221118065148.0191125e197405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066813572DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1974.03615995003800030038x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahendrappa, M.

The method, which employed an RC-C18 column and diode array detection at 254 nm with sodium acetate solution and methanol as mobile phases, exhibited good linearity (R² = 1.0), and its limits of detection and quantification were determined to be 0.06 and 0.19 μg/mL, respectively. The precision was found to be 0–1.2% and the accuracy was between 86.5% and 94.8%. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was also performed to identify Brown FK in peaks. The pretreatment method was optimized for three different food sample groups, i.e., seafood, noodles and other, affording recoveries of 86.5–92.8%, 90.8–94.8% and 90.0–92.3%, respectively. In addition, inter-laboratory testing was also conducted to check the precision.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Food and Drug Safetydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003569 3adetection limit 3adiodes 3adyes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3anoodles 3aseafoods 3asodium acetate 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aKim, Young-Woo1 aJeong, Yeon-Seong1 aSuh, Hee-Jae1 aChun, Hyang-Sook1 aLee, Gun-Young1 aLim, Ho-Soo1 aLi, Zhan,0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2018 May 01, v. 56, no. 5 p.409-415dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmy0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01936naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010300173300001600276520074100292592002801033650002101061650001401082650001801096650002001114650001001134650001101144650001101155650001401166650001701180651001101197653001101208653002301219653001901242653002701261700003101288773012701319856008301446852000901529655001201538IND60542660820221119230439.0190405e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoto, Silvina Andrea10aBisphosphonates: Pharmacology and Clinical Approach to Their Use in Equine Osteoarticular Diseases  ap. 727-737.  aBisphosphonates (BPs) are drugs widely used in various bone diseases, mainly for their skeletal antiresorptive effect. Nowadays, they are also used to treat degenerative pathologies such as arthritis because of their particular anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Since the sixties, BPs with different characteristics and biological activity profiles have been studied, although most of the pharmacologic and clinical trials have been carried out in humans.

Since basic lexico-semantic abilities have been demonstrated from 6 months onwards, ‘top-down’ influences on phonotactic learning may complement the extraction of transitional probabilities in phonotactic learning. Such a bidirectional acquisition strategy predicts, that familiarization with (proto)words should affect processing of untrained word-forms of similar phonological structure. We investigated 6-month-old infants undergoing an associative training to establish a pseudoword-pseudoobject link. Comparison between pre- and post-training responses to trained and untrained items allowed investigating training effects. Additionally phonotactic status (50% legal, 50% illegal with regard to German) allowed investigating influences of previous language experience. EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provided measures of electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses. We find evidence for a robust effect of associative training on pseudoword processing when presented in isolation. This transferred to untrained items. Previous linguistic experience showed a much weaker effect. Taken together the results suggest that sensitivity to phonotactic contrasts is present at 6 months, but that acceptance as lexical candidates is rapidly modulated when word forms following non-native phonotactics become potentially meaningful due to repeated exposure in a semantic context.  aPublisher supplied data 0afNIRS 0aPhonotactics 0aAssociative training 0aLanguage development1 aMock, Julia1 aStephan, Franziska1 aRichter, Maria1 aVignotto, Micol1 aRossi, Sonja0 tDevelopmental Cognitive Neuroscience.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx1878-92937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2016.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245014900176520101200325592002801337650001701365650001101382650000901393650002101402650001701423650001101440650002201451650002101473650001201494650000901506650002001515650002001535650001101555650001101566651001101577653002001588653001701608653001901625653001401644653000701658653001701665700002301682700002501705700002501730773010601755856008801861852000901949655001201958IND60739123320221121234802.0210729e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073912332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1125082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Luciano N.10aMercury concentration in the sentinel fish species Orthopristis ruber: Effects of environmental and biological factors and human risk assessment  aThe present study aimed to assess corocoro grunt use as bioindicator of Hg contamination in coastal marine systems by testing environmental (seasons) and biological effects (sexual maturity, size and weight) on THg accumulation and assessing human health risk. Fish was captured in winter and summer seasons at Vermelha Beach, Rio de Janeiro, Southeast Brazil.

Fish THg concentrations did not differ between seasons and were below the accepted limit for human consumption. Human exposure risk by fish consumption was 0.31 μg MeHg kg⁻¹ week⁻¹ and the hazard quotient was 0.44 (0.11–1.84). Our results confirm the applied use of O. ruber as sentinel species for Hg contamination monitoring and highlight concern for its consumption, especially for local fishermen populations that highly consume this fish and may be more susceptible to Hg adverse effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthopristis 3aadults 3afish 3afish consumption 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3amarine pollution 3amercury 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asexual maturity 3asummer 3awinter 3aBrazil 0aBioaccumulation 0aBioindicator 0aCorocoro grunt 0aFisheries 0aHg 0aHuman safety1 aNeves, Raquel A.F.1 aKoureiche, Amanda C.1 aLailson-Brito, José0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Aug., v. 169 p.112508-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1125083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002100185245007400206300001300280506007600293520069000369592002801059506003701087650002101124650002701145650002401172650001801196650002401214650001001238650002301248650001501271650001701286653000901303653000901312653000901321653000901330653000901339653000901348653002701357653002101384700002301405700002101428700002001449700002101469773019101490856007801681852000901759655001201768IND60554807520221207130451.0161025e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055480752DNAL7 a10.5936/csbj.2013020082doi7 aPMC39621942pmcid7 a246887012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuggerone, Paolo10aMolecular dynamics computer simulations of multidrug rnd efflux pumps  ap. 1-11.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOver-expression of multidrug efflux pumps of the Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) protein super family counts among the main causes for microbial resistance against pharmaceuticals.

Methods and Results: A genomic DNA library was enriched and further screened using (GA)₁₅, (GTA)₈, and (TTC)₈ biotin-labeled probes coupled with chemi-luminescence detection. To increase simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci number, an ultra-high-throughput sequencing-based approach was used. Evaluation of all primer pairs was performed with labeled dUTP on an ABI 3130xl sequencer. Eleven polymorphic SSR loci were selected out of 79 SSR regions and extensively characterized on 150 individuals from eight populations. Total alleles ranged from six to 19 alleles per locus while expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.618 to 0.869. Conclusions: The SSRs developed here will be used to further characterize the genetic diversity of A. spinosa across its distribution range, mainly in the southern part of Morocco and southwestern Algeria. They may also be transferable to other Sapotaceae species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArgania spinosa 3aDNA 3aDNA libraries 3aalleles 3aendangered species 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation 3aAlgeria 3aMorocco 0aargan tree 0aArgania spinosa 0adUTP labeling 0amicrosatellite 0aSapotaceae 0asimple sequence repeats (SSRs)1 aDauchot, Nicolas1 aMachtoun, Ikrame1 aGaboun, Fatima1 aCutsem, Pierre Van0 tApplications in plant sciences.g2014 Apr., v. 2, no. 4dBotanical Society of Americax2168-04507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732%2Fapps.13000713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04092naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245022000168300001600388520201000404592002802414650001402442650002502456650001302481650000902494650002002503650000902523650002002532650002702552650002302579650001502602650001502617650002002632650002002652650003302672650001302705650002002718650002002738650001402758650002202772650001702794650002502811650001602836653002002852653002802872653002102900653002002921653001402941700002202955700001802977700002102995700002803016700003103044700006003075700002103135700003003156700002103186700001903207773011303226856008203339852000903421655001203430IND60775585120221120132032.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077558512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2022.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadifar, Ehsan10aEffect of a diet enriched with sodium propionate on growth performance, antioxidant property, innate-adaptive immune response, and growth-related genes expression in critically endangered beluga sturgeon (Huso huso)  ap. 101-108.  aOrganic acids are active substances required for improving the productivity and wellbeing of aquatic animals. Herein, the study investigated the effects of sodium propionate on growth performance, antioxidative and immune responses, and growth-related genes expression in beluga sturgeon (Huso huso). For eight weeks, fish fed sodium propionate at 0, 1.2, 2.5, and 5 g kg⁻¹. The final weight, weight gain, and SGR were substantially increased while FCR decreased by dietary sodium propionate at 2.5 and 5 g kg⁻¹ (P < 0.05). The expression of Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was markedly upregulated (P < 0.05) by dietary sodium propionate in the gills and livers of beluga. The highest mRNA level of GH and IGF-1 has been observed in fish fed a 2.5 g sodium propionate/kg diet. The red blood cells count, and hemoglobin level were meaningfully increased (P < 0.05) by 2.5 and 5 g sodium propionate/kg diet compared with 0 and 1.2 g kg⁻¹ levels. Further, the hematocrit level was increased (P < 0.05) by a dietary 5 g sodium propionate/kg diet. The total protein level and lysozyme activity were meaningfully increased (P < 0.05) by 2.5 and 5 g sodium propionate/kg diet compared with 0 and 1.2 g kg⁻¹ levels. The highest superoxide dismutase was observed in fish fed 2.5 g sodium propionate/kg diet. Catalase activity was significantly higher in fish fed 5 g kg⁻¹ than 1.2 g kg⁻¹. The glutathione peroxidase activity was markedly higher in fish fed 2.5, and 5 g kg⁻¹ than fish fed control diet. The lowest malondialdehyde levels were observed in fish fed 1.2, and 2.5 g sodium propionate/kg diets. Moreover, the highest mucosal total protein, total immunoglobulin and lysozyme were recorded in fish fed 2.5, and 5 g sodium propionate/kg diets. The obtained results indicate that dietary sodium propionate is recommended at 2.5–5 g kg⁻¹ to improve beluga sturgeon's growth performance, feed utilization, and wellbeing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuso huso 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3afish 3agene expression 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3alysozyme 3amalondialdehyde 3aprotein content 3ashellfish 3asodium propionate 3asomatotropin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight gain 0aBeluga sturgeon 0aShort chain fatty acids 0aGrowth promotors 0aGene expression 0aWellbeing1 aEslami, Mahboubeh1 aKalhor, Naser1 aZaretabar, Amine1 aMohammadzadeh, Sedigheh1 aShahriari Moghadam, Mohsen1 aYousefi, Morteza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5352-81061 aAhmadifar, Mehdi1 aHoseinifar, Seyed Hossein1 aPusadee, Tonapha1 avan Doan, Hien0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2022 June, v. 125 p.101-108dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009300171520093500264592002801199650001101227650002101238650001901259650002101278650001501299650001801314650001301332650002201345651001001367651001901377651001501396653002001411653001701431653002101448653001701469700001601486700002001502700001301522700001501535773010601550856008801656852000901744655001201753IND60739123520221122214604.0210729e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073912352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1125172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Jia-Wei10aControlling factors of annual cycle of dimethylsulfide in the Yellow and East China seas  aWe developed a dimethylsulfide (DMS) module coupled to an ecological dynamics model studying the annual DMS cycle of the Yellow and East China seas (YECS). The model results showed that surface DMS concentrations ([DMS]) peaked in August along the coast, and there exhibited several DMS peaks offshore annually. In addition, surface [DMS] were higher in the Yellow Sea than that in the East China Sea. The annual mean surface [DMS] of the YECS reached to 4.55 nmol/L, and oceanic DMS emissions from this sea area was 6.78 μmol/(m² day). Several sensitivity experiments demonstrated that phytoplankton community and sea water temperature exerted crucial effects on seasonal variations of surface [DMS]; and phytoplankton community or temperature changed the timing of surface DMS peak while photolysis affected the magnitude of [DMS]. Moreover, the effect size of phytoplankton community or water temperature varied spatially.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adimethyl sulfide 3adynamic models 3amarine pollution 3aphotolysis 3aphytoplankton 3aseawater 3awater temperature 3aChina 3aEast China Sea 3aYellow Sea 0aDimethylsulfide 0aAnnual cycle 0aEcological model 0aMarginal sea1 aZhao, Liang1 aZhang, Hong-Hai1 aWei, Hao1 aGuo, Xinyu0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Aug., v. 169 p.112517-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1125173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03796naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245017100156300001800327500002000345520144500365592002801810650001301838650001901851650001601870650002401886650002001910650002201930650001301952650001501965650001101980650001901991650001802010650002202028650002702050650001202077651002502089700002102114700002102135700002202156700002502178700002102203700002302224700001802247700001902265700001902284700002202303700002302325700002002348700002302368700002702391700002202418700002102440700003602461700002202497700002002519700002302539700002402562700002202586700001502608700002302623700002302646700002402669700001902693700001702712700002402729700001802753700002502771773011202796856007302908961001202981852000902993655001203002IND60548386920221119214908.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054838692DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.127322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSack, Lawren10aPlant hydraulics as a central hub integrating plant and ecosystem function: meeting report for ‘Emerging Frontiers in Plant Hydraulics’ (Washington, DC, May 2015)  ap. 2085-2094.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWater plays a central role in plant biology and the efficiency of water transport throughout the plant affects both photosynthetic rate and growth, an influence that scales up deterministically to the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, hydraulic traits mediate the ways in which plants interact with their abiotic and biotic environment. At landscape to global scale, plant hydraulic traits are important in describing the function of ecological communities and ecosystems. Plant hydraulics is increasingly recognized as a central hub within a network by which plant biology is connected to palaeobiology, agronomy, climatology, forestry, community and ecosystem ecology and earth‐system science. Such grand challenges as anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change, and improving the security and sustainability of our food supply rely on our fundamental knowledge of how water behaves in the cells, tissues, organs, bodies and diverse communities of plants. A workshop, ‘Emerging Frontiers in Plant Hydraulics’ supported by the National Science Foundation, was held in Washington DC, 2015 to promote open discussion of new ideas, controversies regarding measurements and analyses, and especially, the potential for expansion of up‐scaled and down‐scaled inter‐disciplinary research, and the strengthening of connections between plant hydraulic research, allied fields and global modelling efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aclimate change 3aclimatology 3aecological function 3afluid mechanics 3afood availability 3aforestry 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant biology 3aplant communities 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atissues 3aDistrict of Columbia1 aBall, Marilyn C.1 aBrodersen, Craig1 aDavis, Stephen D.1 aDes Marais, David L.1 aDonovan, Lisa A.1 aGivnish, Thomas J.1 aHacke, Uwe G.1 aHuxman, Travis1 aJansen, Steven1 aJacobsen, Anna L.1 aJohnson, Daniel M.1 aKoch, George W.1 aMaurel, Christophe1 aMcCulloh, Katherine A.1 aMcDowell, Nate G.1 aMcElrone, Andrew1 aMeinzer, F.

In this study, polyurethane (PU) adhesives were synthesized from crude glycerol-based polyols (CG-based polyols) for wood bonding applications. Effects of different variables, including hydroxyl values of CG-based polyols, chain extenders, and the molar ratio of NCO/OH on the properties of PU adhesives were investigated. The chemical structures of PU adhesives were characterized, and their thermal, mechanical, and chemical resistance properties were evaluated. The experimental results indicated that an increase of the NCO/OH molar ratio (1.3) substantially improved bonding strength by up to 38 MPa. Higher thermal stability and stronger chemical resistance to hot and cold water and to alkali and acid solutions were observed comparing to vegetable oil-based adhesives. However, the effect of the hydroxyl value of polyols on bonding strength was not significant. Additionally, bond strength of crude glycerol-based PU adhesives was comparable to that of some commercial PU wood adhesives. All these properties demonstrated the potential of CG for PU wood adhesive applications, particularly for fast-curing uses.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA-NIFA Critical Agricultural Materials Program0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3abiodiesel 3afeedstocks 3aglycerol 3apolyurethanes 3athermal stability 3avegetables 3awater 3awood1 aLuo , Xiaolan1 aLi, Yebo,0 tInternational Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives.g2017 Dec., v. 79 p.67-72dElsevier BVwJournal:11787x0143-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7318834  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01747naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002200161245004100183300001600224500000900240520087000249592002801119650001301147650001901160650001501179700002201194773014801216856009601364852000901460655001201469IND60668136020221118065147.0191125e195307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066813602DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1953.03615995001700030003x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Robert D.10aField Capacity in Laboratory Columns  ap. 191-195.  aepub  aIt is shown that the material decrease in downward movement observed as soils approach field capacity cannot be explained in terms of capillary conductivity alone. Instead, the combined effects of decreasing capillary conductivity in the drying zone, hysteresis and reduced hydraulic gradients at all levels are involved. The capillary conductivity of the drying zone is always greater (probably much greater) than that of the wetting zone. Hysteresis effects, if present, ought to result in larger reductions in hydraulic gradient for an increment of water transfer than would occur without hysteresis. The hydraulic gradients at all levels ought to decline during drainage. Experimental evidence is presented which is in general agreement with expectations. Hysteresis effects were large, and the hydranlic gradients greatly diminished after 48 hours of drainage.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3afield capacity 3ahysteresis1 aMcMurdie, John L.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1953 July, v. 17, no. 3 p.191-195dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1953.03615995001700030003x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009300167300001600260520260900276592002802885650001102913650002602924650002202950650001402972650002502986650002603011650001103037650001203048651001803060700001703078773012103095856008103216852000903297655001203306IND50066453020221117231030.0150208e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006645302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-013-0545-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKucukvar, Murat10aTowards a triple bottom-line sustainability assessment of the U.S. construction industry  ap. 958-972.  aPURPOSE: The construction industry has considerable impacts on the environment, economy, and society. Although quantifying and analyzing the sustainability implications of the built environment is of great importance, it has not been studied sufficiently. Therefore, the overarching goal of this study is to quantify the overall environmental, economic, and social impacts of the U.S. construction sectors using an economic input–output-based sustainability assessment framework. METHODS: In this research, the commodity-by-industry supply and use tables published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, as part of the International System of National Accounts, are merged with a range of environmental, economic, and social metrics to develop a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for the U.S. construction industry. After determining these sustainability assessment metrics, the direct and indirect sustainability impacts of U.S construction sectors have been analyzed from a triple bottom-line perspective. RESULTS: When analyzing the total sustainability impacts by each construction sector, “Residential Permanent Single and Multi-Family Structures" and "Other Non-residential Structures" are found to have the highest environmental, economic, and social impacts in comparison with other construction sectors. The analysis results also show that indirect suppliers of construction sectors have the largest sustainability impacts compared with on-site activities. For example, for all U.S. construction sectors, on-site construction processes are found to be responsible for less than 5 % of total water consumption, whereas about 95 % of total water use can be attributed to indirect suppliers. In addition, Scope 3 emissions are responsible for the highest carbon emissions compared with Scopes 1 and 2. Therefore, using narrowly defined system boundaries by ignoring supply chain-related impacts can result in underestimation of triple bottom-line sustainability impacts of the U.S. construction industry. CONCLUSIONS: Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies that consider all dimensions of sustainability impacts of civil infrastructures are still limited, and the current research is an important attempt to analyze the triple bottom-line sustainability impacts of the U.S. construction sectors in a holistic way. We believe that this comprehensive sustainability assessment model will complement previous LCA studies on resource consumption of U.S. construction sectors by evaluating them not only from environmental standpoint, but also from economic and social perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aconstruction industry 3aeconomic analysis 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3asociety 3aUnited States1 aTatari, Omer0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2013 June, v. 18, no. 5 p.958-972dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-013-0545-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245009600208300001500304520157700319592002801896650001101924650001101935650001701946650001401963650002001977651001101997653002002008653001702028653003202045653002302077700002702100700001902127700005402146700002102200700001902221700001902240700001802259700002002277700006602297773010702363856008502470852000902555655001202564IND60611807020221117232827.0181214e20181230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061180702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Randall1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3473-735310aNewly discovered Aurignacian engraved blocks from Abri Cellier: History, context and dating  ap. 99-125.  aThe rich record of Aurignacian graphic arts from sites in the Vézère Valley of SW France holds a key place in our understanding of systems of representation in the European Early Upper Paleolithic. One of the main sites yielding representational objects is Abri Cellier, which has long been on the short-list of major art-bearing sites attributed to the European Aurignacian. Collie's 1927 excavations yielded 15 engraved and/or pierced limestone blocks that have served as a key point of reference for the study of Aurignacian art in SW France. As part of a broader re-excavation of key Aurignacian sites in the Vézère Valley, we returned to Abri Cellier in 2014, with detailed archives in hand, in the hopes of finding intact deposits that would allow a better understanding of the archaeological sequence at the site and its relationship to other Aurignacian sites in the so-called "classic zone." While disappointingly little is left of the site, the 2014 season allowed the addition of 16 new engraved, painted or pierced blocks to the 15 already known from the 1927 excavations. We present here a brief history of excavations at the site, a stratigraphic analysis, an overview of archaeological materials recovered, a series of 14C ultrafiltration dates, a brief discussion of the peculiar characteristics of Aurignacian block art in SW France, a detailed analysis of the engraved surfaces of the blocks discovered in 1927 and in 2014 and finally a comparison of the newly-revised Cellier block assemblage with those from other Aurignacian sites in the Vézère.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollie 3acarbon 3agraphic arts 3alimestone 3aultrafiltration 3aFrance 0aVézère Valley 0aAbri Cellier 0aAurignacian engraved blocks 0aAurignacian vulvae1 aBourrillon, Raphaëlle1 aMensan, Romain1 aClark, Amy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3042-91181 aChiotti, Laurent1 aHigham, Thomas1 aRanlett, Sarah1 aTartar, Elise1 aMorala, André,1 aSoulier, Marie-Cécile1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2439-73080 tQuaternary international.g2018 Dec. 30, v. 498 p.99-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245016000174520097200334592002801306650002201334650001101356650001001367650002001377650000901397650001101406650002101417650001801438650001701456651001601473653001801489653001801507653002501525653002201550700002401572700002601596700002601622700002501648700002501673773010601698856008801804852000901892655001201901IND60739123620221122214700.0210729e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073912362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1125182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurjar, Udai Ram10aIncidence of microplastics in gastrointestinal tract of golden anchovy (Coilia dussumieri) from north east coast of Arabian Sea: The ecological perspective  aAnthropogenic marine litters or microplastics (MPs) accumulation in marine organisms is an emerging environmental threat. In this background, the gastrointestinal tract of Coilia dussumieri (n = 150) was studied in the samples collected from the fishing grounds of the north east coast of Arabian Sea through experimental fishing. Out of the total 150 specimens collected, all showed the incidence of microplastic particulates in the guts. The average abundance of MPs was found to be 6.98 ± 2.73 items/individual whereas gastrointestinal tract recorded with an average number of 28.84 ± 10.13 MPs/g in the gut material. The dominant MPs were found in the size range of 100–250 μm and of fibers type mostly blue in color. The prevalence of MPs in Coilia dussumieri is a matter of serious concern due to its ecological consequences due to trophic transfer in the connected food chains and probable threats to the health of human beings consuming the fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoilia dussumieri 3acoasts 3acolor 3adigestive tract 3afish 3ahumans 3amarine pollution 3amicroplastics 3aparticulates 3aArabian Sea 0aMarine litter 0aMicroplastics 0aEnvironmental threat 0aCoilia dussumieri1 aXavier, K.A.

We investigated the relative importance of available abiotic and biotic, landscape‐ and quadrat‐scale data for predicting the distributions of four small mammals using data at three resolutions: 150 m, 500 m and 1000 m. At 150 m, the inclusion of landscape‐scale data to a climate‐only model improved the predicted occurrence of the wet heath specialist and woodland generalist, but not the two dense understorey species. Limited improvement was obtained with the inclusion of available quadrat‐scale data (possibly because of missing or insufficiently detailed descriptive variables). As the models of best fit were re‐applied to lower‐resolution environmental data (500 m and 1000 m), the variance explained decreased for the wet heath specialist and two dense understorey species. These trends corresponded with reduced variance explained predominantly by biotic variables or abiotic landscape variables respectively. In contrast, the resolution of environmental data had no effect on the woodland generalist species distribution models, indicating the habitat for this more mobile species was sufficiently represented at the lowest resolution (1000 m). These results highlight the potential value of landscape‐ and finer‐scale variables in modelling the distributions of small mammals. Where such variables are unavailable, higher‐resolution climate data could better represent resource availability (indirectly) or suitable microclimates (directly), especially for more vulnerable, above‐ground nesting species. We encourage the collection of additional detailed and high‐resolution environmental information to facilitate the development of more accurate models of the extent and distribution of small mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicroclimate 3avariance 3amodels 3abiogeography 3aenvironmental factors 3aunderstory 3anesting 3asmall mammals 3ahabitats 3aprediction 0aclimate1 aDELEAN, STEVEN1 aBrook, Barry W.,0 tAustral ecology.g2012 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.216-226dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02267.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002400168245013200192300001600324520073500340592002801075650002001103650002701123650002901150650001101179650002901190650001401219650001701233650001601250650003301266650001801299650002501317650003001342650002501372650003201397650001401429653001601443653002801459653002001487653001301507653002401520773013001544856008401674852000901758655001201767IND60082841920221117185736.0190411e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008284192DNAL7 a238916632pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2013.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarmon, Livingstone10aElucidating the origin of the ExbBD components of the TonB system through Bayesian inference and maximum-likelihood phylogenies  ap. 674-686.  aUptake of ferric siderophores, vitamin B12, and other molecules in gram-negative bacteria is mediated by a multi-protein complex known as the TonB system. The ExbB and ExbD protein components of the TonB system play key energizing roles and are homologous with the flagellar motor proteins MotA and MotB. Here, the phylogenetic relationships of ExbBD and MotAB were investigated using Bayesian inference and the maximum-likelihood method. Phylogenetic trees of these proteins suggest that they are separated into distinct monophyletic groups and have originated from a common ancestral system. Several horizontal gene transfer events for ExbB–ExbD are also inferred, and a model for the evolution of the TonB system is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aGram-negative bacteria 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amodels 3amolecular motor proteins 3amonophyly 3asiderophores 3avitamin B12 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBayes Theorem 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aLikelihood Functions 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 0aTonB system 0aMolecular phylogenetics 0aFlagellar motor 0aHomology 0aMolecular evolution0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2013 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.674-686dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245010100173500001400274520111600288592002801404650002601432650001601458650001301474650002801487650002501515650001901540650001401559650002801573650001601601650001501617650001601632650001301648650002601661650001601687650002801703651001001731651001001741651000901751700002301760700003501783700003201818773012301850856008001973852000902053655001202062IND60718809720221120203745.0201126e20201122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071880972DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy101118392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-Real, José  Luis12aA Look at the Past, Present and Future Research Trends of Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture  aNAL-light  aTechnification in agriculture has resulted in the inclusion of more efficient companies that have evolved into a more complex sector focused on production and quality. Artificial intelligence, one of the relevant areas of technology, is transforming the agriculture sector by reducing the consumption and use of resources.

Analyses of seismic stratigraphy and gravity, magnetic and drilling wells data led to the discovery of three post-fault sequences (V, VI, VII). Extensive tectonic uplift, magma activity and erosion occurred in Dongsha Island and the adjacent area, where most of the faults in the northeastern SCS were still active during Pliocene and Quaternary. Two groups of faults trending NEE and NW were developed during Late Cenozoic. We conclude that three important tectonic movements, especially Dongsha movement (4.4–5.2 Ma) and Liuhua movement (1.4–1.89 Ma), controlled the structural framework in the Dongsha rise; whose deformation in the east is stronger than that in the west and whose stress field variation suggests that the tectonic uplift in the study area contributed to magmato-tectonic events correlated to the main collision phases between the East China and Taiwan 5-3 and 3-0 Ma ago.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3adrilling 3agravity 3aislands 3anet ecosystem exchange 3astratigraphy 3atectonics 3awells 3aSouth China Sea 3aTaiwan1 aZhan, Liu1 aWanyin, Wang1 aJunhua, Guo1 aLüdmann, T.1 aWong, H.

Yet, it is unclear when this behaviour emerges in development and if it is specific to ASD. We followed up infants at high and low familial risk for ASD to investigate how early VS abilities links to later ASD diagnosis, the potential underlying mechanisms of this association and the specificity of superior VS to ASD. Clinical diagnosis of ASD as well as dimensional measures of ASD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety symptoms were ascertained at 3 years. At 9 and 15 months, but not at age 2 years, high-risk children who later met clinical criteria for ASD (HR-ASD) had better VS performance than those without later diagnosis and low-risk controls. Although HR-ASD children were also more attentive to the task at 9 months, this did not explain search performance. Superior VS specifically predicted 3 year-old ASD but not ADHD or anxiety symptoms. Our results demonstrate that atypical perception and core ASD symptoms of social interaction and communication are closely and selectively associated during early development, and suggest causal links between perceptual and social features of ASD.  aPublisher supplied data 0aVisual search 0aVisual attention 0aASD 0aADHD 0aInfant 0aFamilial risk1 aBedford, R.1 aJohnson, M.H.1 aCharman, T.1 aGliga, T.0 tDevelopmental Cognitive Neuroscience.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx1878-92937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2016.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008500171520104900256592002801305650001801333650001901351650001601370650001801386650002301404650002101427650002201448650001401470650002201484650002101506653001101527653002901538653002401567653002001591653003801611700001801649700001601667700001501683700001401698700002701712700001501739700001501754773010601769856008801875852000901963655001201972IND60739123820221122214614.0210729e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073912382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1125232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Zhaozhao10aBacterial diversity in ballast water and sediments revealed by 2b-RAD sequencing  aDespite that the ballast water management (BWM) convention has come into force to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms, to date, very few bacteria can be identified through microbial culture method. In this study, we explored a reduced-representation sequencing of 2b-RAD approach to investigate the bacterial diversity in ballast water and sediments (BWS). Our results indicated a large amount of bacteria species (1496) detected in BWS up to now, including 13 pathogens that are seriously concerning in marine environment and aquaculture like the most harmful Vibrio harveyi and Aurantimonas coralicida. We showed that the ballast water had relative lower species, which was dominated by Proteobacteria. In contrast, the sediments had richer species, which was dominated by Bacteroidetes. Although BWS differed significantly in species composition, sediments shared most of the concerned pathogens with ballast water, highlighting the importance of sediment management. In conclusion, 2b-RAD sequencing shows promise in future BWM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aVibrio harveyi 3aaquaculture 3aballast water 3amarine environment 3amarine pollution 3amicrobial culture 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3awater management 0a2b-RAD 0aBallast water management 0aBacteria monitoring 0aMarine pathogen 0aReduced-representation sequencing1 aHan, Yangchun1 aLiu, Bingli1 aGu, Yujuan1 aTian, Wen1 aWhiting-Wagner, Nathan1 aZhao, Hong1 aZhang, Wei0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Aug., v. 169 p.112523-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1125233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245009100168520115300259592002801412650002401440650000901464650003101473650001501504650000901519650001801528650001801546650001501564651001301579700002501592700002901617700003301646700003201679773011901711856007301830852000901903655001201912IND60653544120221120205707.0190714e20190424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065354412DNAL7 a10.3390/w110408562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEljaiek-Urzola, Mónica 10aOil and Grease as a Water Quality Index Parameter for the Conservation of Marine Biota  aWater quality indexes are a tool used to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of a water body according to its use. The present study proposes the inclusion of oil and grease (OG) as a new water quality index (ICAM<inf>PFF-GA</inf>) parameter for the preservation of marine biota in tropical areas, since it is a typical pollutant found and measured in water bodies, causing damage to the aquatic environment. The normalized curve for OG was defined based on the percentage of surviving microorganism under a lethal concentration exposure of OG. The ICAM<inf>PFF-GA</inf> suitability was evaluated by its application to analyze marine water quality in the area of the sea outfall in the city of Cartagena, Colombia and comparing the trends of the outfall flow and the rainfall for 2017. Physical chemical data analyzed for the year 2017 shows that OG varies from 0.0 to 3.8 mg/L. The results show that the water quality index increases when rainfall and flow values increase for the rainy season. The ICAM<inf>PFF-GA</inf> can be a tool to evaluate the water quality of marine waters affected by the discharge of waters with oil and grease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3aoils 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollutants 3arain 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awet season 3aColombia1 aRomero-Sierra, Nora 1 aSegrera-Cabarcas, Laura 1 aValdelamar-Martínez, David 1 aQuiñones-Bolaños, Édgar 0 tWater.g2019 Apr. 24, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110408563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013700182300001600319520178300335536015802118592002802276596009902304650001702403650001402420650002602434650001902460650001802479650001602497650001402513650002002527650002602547650002002573650001302593650002502606650000902631650000902640650001402649650002302663650002002686650001702706650002502723653002002748653001902768653001802787653002502805700002402830700001802854700001602872700001902888773012302907856008503030852000903115655001203124IND60695706820221121111305.0200518e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069570682DNAL7 a10.1080/15427528.2020.17257012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFawibe, Oluwasegun Olamide10aGrain yield, water-use efficiency, and physiological characteristics of rice cultivars under drip irrigation with plastic-film-mulch  ap. 414-436.  aThe increased competition for water resources has intensified search for the most efficient water-saving techniques and water-use efficient cultivars. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to determine grain yield, grain quality, andwater-use efficiency (WUE) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under drip irrigation with plastic-film-mulch. Koshihikari (a lowland Japonica cultivar), Norin 24 (an upland Japonica cultivar), and Princessari (a lowland cultivar, a derivative from Indica and Japonica crosses) were used in 2017, whereas only Koshihikari and Norin 24 were used in 2018. The experiments were carried out with two rice cultivation systems in both years: continuous flooding (CF) and drip irrigation with plastic-film-mulch (DPD). There was no significant difference in the grain yield of Koshihikari and Norin 24 under both CF and DPD. This was attributable to their comparable photosynthesis-associated parameters at the grain-filling stage. The high yield obtained under DPD was attributed to the increase in the number of spikelets per panicle. However, the decreased SPAD value of leaves and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II in Princessari were associated with the deficiency of available soil Fe and mild water stress, which reduced grain yield by 54% under DPD compared with CF. The DPD increased WUE of Koshihikari and Norin 24 by 50% and 70%, respectively, and improved nutritional quality but increased the chalky grain percentage. The study demonstrated that, in cultivars adapted to Fe deficiency in the soil and mild water stress, DPD could significantly increase WUE while maintaining grain yield that is comparable to that under CF. Our results suggested that the DPD could be a promising rice-cultivation system in areas with limited water-resources.  aThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI  [JP 16K07570] and in part by SEEDS Fund (Chiba University Open Recruitment for International Exchange Program).  aPublisher supplied data  aJP 16K07570cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691 3aOryza sativa 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3afilling period 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3ahighlands 3amicroirrigation 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutritive value 3apanicles 3aplastic film mulches 3arice 3asoil 3aspikelets 3awater conservation 3awater resources 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 0aDrip irrigation 0aphotosynthesis 0aplastic mulch 0awater-use efficiency1 aHiramatsu, Motofumi1 aTaguchi, Yuki1 aWang, Junfa1 aIsoda, Akihiro0 tJournal of crop improvement.g2020 May 3, v. 34, no. 3 p.414-436dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl923723x1542-75367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15427528.2020.17257013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245015600179300001600335520146300351592002801814650002501842650001401867650002701881650001001908650002201918650001601940650002301956650001501979650001701994650003002011650001202041650001502053650001502068650001502083650002602098650002002124650001502144650002002159650002102179650001302200650001602213650000902229653001502238653001502253653001502268653001602283653002902299653001102328700002502339773012702364856008302491852000902574655001202583IND60542661420221119230438.0190405e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Kammar, Mahmoud Hussein10aAntagonism of Detomidine-Induced Sedation, Analgesia, Clinicophysiological, and Hematobiochemical Effects in Donkeys Using IV Tolazoline or Atipamezole  ap. 784-792.  aThe present study aimed to investigate and evaluate the reversal of sedation, analgesia, ataxia, clinicophysiological findings, and hematobiochemical effects of detomidine by subsequent IV administration of tolazoline or atipamezole to improve safety and utility of detomidine in donkeys.

Red blood cell and white blood cell counts, Packed cell volume (%), hemoglobin, total protein, cholesterol, glucose, urea, aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, and gamma glutamyl transferase values were determined. Detomidine induced deep sedation, complete analgesia, and significant ataxia. Pulse and respiratory rates were decreased from the base line values, although rectal temperature was within the baseline value. The alterations in hematological and hematobiochemical parameters were mild and transient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aanalgesia 3aaspartate transaminase 3aasses 3aataxia (disorder) 3acholesterol 3across-over studies 3adetomidine 3aerythrocytes 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3aglucose 3aheart rate 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3aintravenous injection 3aleukocyte count 3aleukocytes 3aprotein content 3arespiratory rate 3asedation 3atemperature 3aurea 0aAntagonism 0aDetomidine 0aTolazoline 0aAtipamezole 0aHematobiochemical effect 0aDonkey1 aGad, Shereen Basunei0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.784-792dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009300172300001400265520185300279592002802132650001402160650001502174650001802189650001802207650001202225650003302237650001102270650001302281650001202294650001102306650002902317650001502346650001202361650001002373650002302383653002302406653001902429653001802448653002802466653001702494653001802511700001702529700001602546700002302562773010202585856008602687852000902773655001202782IND60566338920221118031114.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056633892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilitz, Thane A.10aConsumer perspectives on theoretical certification schemes for the marine aquarium trade  ap. 33-42.  aCertification schemes are a component of sustainable industry development that can help empower consumers to support environmentally friendly and ethical commodities with their purchase decisions. At present, there is no unified certification scheme within the marine aquarium trade, limiting the capacity for consumers to differentiate sustainable products from others. To assess the extent to which consumers show preference for certified marine aquarium fishes (Teleostei) in the current market climate, an online survey of 510 marine aquarium consumers was conducted over a six month period to determine how certification schemes, presented under different themes, would influence their buying decisions when compared to other attributes of potential importance. Using a Likert five point scale, it was determined that consumers placed significantly higher importance on a certification theme of industry best practice (3.99±0.05) than themes of environmental sustainability (3.77±0.05) or supporting indigenous fishers (3.36±0.06; Fpseudo(14,7141)=212.08, P<0.01). The only surveyed attributes of greater importance than industry best practice certification were a fish’s health (4.81±0.06), aquarium suitability (4.56±0.03), and the fish species (4.21±0.04). A high percentage of surveyed consumers were willing to pay a price premium for fishes that were certified under the themes of environmental sustainability (90.5%), adherence to industry best practice (91.0%), and supporting indigenous fishers (82.6%). This indicates potential for the absorption of the costs of implementing certification schemes by exporters, wholesalers, and retailers. Further analysis revealed consumer predispositions towards certain certification themes that may be helpful in establishing consumer confidence in future industry certification schemes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTeleostei 3aabsorption 3aaquarium fish 3acertification 3aclimate 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aethics 3aindustry 3amarkets 3aprices 3aproducts and commodities 3apurchasing 3asurveys 3atrade 3awillingness to pay 0aAquarium fisheries 0aLive reef fish 0aEco-labelling 0aSustainable development 0aSupply-chain 0aOnline survey1 aFoale, Simon1 aKinch, Jeff1 aSouthgate, Paul C.0 tFisheries research.g2017 Sept., v. 193 p.33-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008700162520212800249592002802377650004102405650001202446650001902458650001902477650001202496650001502508650001602523650001102539650001402550650002202564650001402586650000902600650001102609650000902620650001602629650001902645650002002664650001602684650001502700650001502715650001302730651001302743700003002756700002402786700002402810700002902834773011902863856007302982852000903055655001203064IND60653544420221121211611.0190714e20190424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065354442DNAL7 a10.3390/w110408592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNäschen, Kristian10aImpact of Climate Change on Water Resources in the Kilombero Catchment in Tanzania  aThis article illustrates the impact of potential future climate scenarios on water quantity in time and space for an East African floodplain catchment surrounded by mountainous areas. In East Africa, agricultural intensification is shifting from upland cultivation into the wetlands due to year-round water availability and fertile soils. These advantageous agricultural conditions might be hampered through climate change impacts. Additionally, water-related risks, like droughts and flooding events, are likely to increase. Hence, this study investigates future climate patterns and their impact on water resources in one production cluster in Tanzania. To account for these changes, a regional climate model ensemble of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa project was analyzed to investigate changes in climatic patterns until 2060, according to the RCP4.5 (representative concentration pathways) and RCP8.5 scenarios. The semi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was utilized to analyze the impacts on water resources according to all scenarios. Modeling results indicate increasing temperatures, especially in the hot dry season, intensifying the distinctive features of the dry and rainy season. This consequently aggravates hydrological extremes, such as more-pronounced flooding and decreasing low flows. Overall, annual averages of water yield and surface runoff increase up to 61.6% and 67.8%, respectively, within the bias-corrected scenario simulations, compared to the historical simulations. However, changes in precipitation among the analyzed scenarios vary between −8.3% and +22.5% of the annual averages. Hydrological modeling results also show heterogeneous spatial patterns inside the catchment. These spatio-temporal patterns indicate the possibility of an aggravation for severe floods in wet seasons, as well as an increasing drought risk in dry seasons across the scenario simulations. Apart from that, the discharge peak, which is crucial for the flood recession agriculture in the floodplain, is likely to shift from April to May from the 2020s onwards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adrought 3adry season 3afloodplains 3afloods 3ahighlands 3aintensive farming 3amountains 3arisk 3arunoff 3asoil 3atemperature 3awater quantity 3awater resources 3awater yield 3awatersheds 3awet season 3awetlands 3aTanzania1 aDiekkrüger, B.q(Bernd),1 aLeemhuis, Constanze1 aSeregina, Larisa S.1 avan der Linden, Roderick0 tWater.g2019 Apr. 24, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110408593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014300170300001600313520139900329592002801728650001101756650002101767650001501788650001001803650001901813650001501832650001501847650001501862650001401877650001601891650002101907650002001928650001901948653001401967653000901981653002301990653001602013653001102029700002302040700002002063700002302083700002102106700002002127700002002147773012702167856008302294852000902377655001202386IND60542661520221119230448.0190405e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuriano, Riccardo10aIntraoperative Analgesic Effect of Intrafunicular Lidocaine Injection During Orchiectomy in Isoflurane-Anesthetized Martina Franca Donkeys  ap. 793-798.  aThis study aimed to evaluate the analgesic effect of intrafunicular lidocaine during orchiectomy in isoflurane-anesthetized donkeys. For this purpose, 10 adult healthy donkeys were chosen from Martina Franca donkey population. Each donkey underwent two surgical procedures of monolateral orchiectomy under general anesthesia. Starting isoflurane vaporizer setting was 1.5% to maintain a light plane of anesthesia. Regional anesthesia was performed by injecting 10 mL of 2% lidocaine plus adrenalin or an equivalent volume of saline solution into the spermatic cord. According to what was injected into the funiculus before the surgical procedure, each donkey was once assigned to the group L (lidocaine) and once to the group S (saline). End-tidal isoflurane and standard physiological parameters were measured. Compared with groups, monolateral orchiectomy increased mean heart rate in group S; during surgical procedure, the end-tidal isoflurane was significantly lower in group L. No differences were found regarding mean arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate, recovery quality, and metabolic parameters between groups during procedures. In isoflurane-anesthetized donkeys, intrafunicular injection of lidocaine before castration appears to decrease intraoperative nociception and significantly reduces the concentration of the volatile agent to obtain a sufficient surgical anesthesia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanalgesic effect 3aanesthesia 3aasses 3ablood pressure 3acastration 3aheart rate 3aisoflurane 3alidocaine 3anociception 3arespiratory rate 3asodium chloride 3aspermatic cord 0aLidocaine 0aPain 0aGeneral anesthesia 0aOrchiectomy 0aDonkey1 aVarasano, Vincenzo1 aRobbe, Domenico1 aCarluccio, Augusto1 aStraticò, Paola1 aContri, Alberto1 aPetrizzi, Lucio0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.793-798dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001700183245009600200506007600296520069200372592002801064506003701092650001601129650002101145650001201166650002001178650001901198650000901217650002701226650001501253650001901268650002201287650001101309651001001320653001901330653002201349653001701371653002101388653001901409700001701428700001901445700002201464700002501486700001601511773010601527856007801633852000901711655001201720IND60124946020221207064613.0151030e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012494602DNAL7 a10.3732/apps.13000942doi7 aPMC41031082pmcid7 a252026222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndo, Haruko10aDevelopment of Microsatellite Markers for the Coastal Shrub Scaevola taccada (Goodeniaceae)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPremise of the study: Microsatellite markers were developed for the coastal shrub species Scaevola taccada to estimate the population genetic structure, which may reflect different seed dispersal patterns.

We used three different heat treatments, simulating different dynamic temperature conditions in the field to gain insight into stress‐dependent changes in volatile blends and photosynthetic characteristics in the annual herb Brassica nigra (L.) Koch. Heat stress was applied by either heating leaves through temperature response curve measurements from 20 to 40 °C (mild stress), exposing plants for 4 h to temperatures 25–44 °C (long‐term stress) or shock‐heating leaves to 45–50 °C. Photosynthetic reduction through temperature response curves was associated with decreased stomatal conductance, while the reduction due to long‐term stress and collapse of photosynthetic activity after heat shock stress were associated with non‐stomatal processes. Mild stress decreased constitutive monoterpene emissions, while long‐term stress and shock stress resulted in emissions of the lipoxygenase pathway and glucosinolate volatiles. Glucosinolate volatile release was more strongly elicited by long‐term stress and lipoxygenase product released by heat shock. These results demonstrate that glucosinolate volatiles constitute a major part of emission blend in heat‐stressed B. nigra plants, especially upon chronic stress that leads to induction responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atemperature 3astomatal conductance 3amonoterpenoids 3aBrassica nigra 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aphotosynthesis 3amechanical damage 3aemissions 3aheat treatment 3aleaves 3aglucosinolates 0alipoxygenase1 aKännaste, Astrid1 aTalts, Eero1 aCopolovici, Lucian1 aNiinemets, Ulo,0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2016 Sept., v. 39, no. 9 p.2027-2042dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.127753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008100180300001600261520074400277536011301021592002801134596008101162650001001243650001301253650001601266650001701282650001301299651001301312653001201325653001501337653001701352653001201369653001401381773013701395856008501532852000901617655001201626IND60695707120221121081005.0200518e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069570712DNAL7 a10.1080/15428052.2018.15639332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFusté-Forné, Francesc,10aStar Chefs and the Table: From Restaurant to Home-Based Culinary Experiences  ap. 192-200.  aCelebrity chefs have played a huge social and cultural role during the last decades and they are often compared to rock stars.

The piece aims to show the potential of this topic since this approach to celebrity allows people – and tourists also – to consume – buy, cook, and eat – like chefs while at home kitchens, and consequently, perform their own starred culinary experience.  aThis work was supported by the Aristos Campus Mundus 2015 (ACM 2015) – Campus of International Excellence.  aPublisher supplied data  cAristos Campus Mundus 2015 (ACM 2015) – Campus of International Excellence 3achefs 3akitchens 3arestaurants 3asupermarkets 3atourists 3aNew York 0aCuisine 0afood media 0afood tourism 0aproduct 0astar chef0 tJournal of culinary science & technology.g2020 May 3, v. 18, no. 3 p.192-200dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000102x1542-80447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15428052.2018.15639333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012800208300001600336520213900352592002802491650001302519650001102532650001602543650002002559650001802579653001602597653002102613653001602634653002502650653002102675653001002696653002502706700005702731700001702788773010802805856008502913852000902998655001203007IND60611807820221117232803.0190410e20190205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061180782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuentes, Oscar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3980-079913aAn approach to Palaeolithic networks: The question of symbolic territories and their interpretation through Magdalenian art  ap. 233-247.  aThe Magdalenian (20,500–13,000 cal. BP) is an important period for the cultural evolution of societies in the European Upper Palaeolithic. It is characterized by a great increase in settlements and products, probably reflecting demographic growth. Along with other material evidence, symbolic products (art and ornaments) clearly expand. In association with the multiplication of representations, some of them become highly normalized (included geometric signs) whereas others develop a great diversity of forms (such as human depictions).The density of sites and more-or-less normalized products make possible an original spatial interpretation, that is probably unprecedented for Palaeolithic societies. Beyond highlighting the diffusion of some concepts over long distances, these rich data allow a deeper analysis of exchange, influence, and non-influence connections. Consequently, the question arises of the identification of what can be called “territories” (spaces built and delimited by human occupations) or “symbolic territories”. We define “symbolic territories” as spaces without visible material frontiers, symbolic through the weight of the ideas, the shared social norms and the installation of concepts by the societies in their close environment.We propose to examine this question through the prism of symbolic productions: body ornaments, portable art, rock art. Thousands of pieces of symbolic evidence assigned to the Magdalenian and a better stratigraphic definition for this period offer a favourable context for discussing the social implications of the results of several analyses: the distribution of themes in space, the presence of types of sign or figurative subjects contained in a narrow space, the identification of individual images and collective graphic norms. Comparing these approaches to series from the Middle and Upper Magdalenian, in which the evidence is the most abundant, will allow us to consider the nature of perceptible “territories”. Then we will question the relationships between human groups through identity and mechanisms of otherness in Magdalenian societies.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ahumans 3aoccupations 3asocial behavior 3asocial impact 0aTerritories 0aPalaeolithic art 0aMagdalenian 0aPalaeolithic network 0aHuman depictions 0aSigns 0aGeometric decoration1 aLucas, Claire1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4933-45221 aRobert, Eric0 tQuaternary international.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 503 p.233-247dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010600171500002200277520138100299592002801680653001901708653001101727653001401738653002101752653001401773653001601787700002601803700001901829773008501848856008201933852000902015655001202024IND60557690620221121182343.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055769062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpp.2016.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrickley, Megan B.10aPossible scurvy in the prisoners of Old Quebec: A re-evaluation of evidence in adult skeletal remains  aPre-press version  aScurvy is known to have been present in many past communities but recognising the condition in adult skeletal remains poses significant challenges. Fifty skeletons of Protestant prisoners who died between 1746 and 1747 were excavated in 1986–1987 from the walls of Old Quebec, Canada. Documentary sources indicate scurvy was present, and those considered the most likely candidates (n=9) were selected for re-evaluation using recently published macroscopic diagnostic criteria. Cranial porosity, hypertrophy and periosteal new bone formation (PNBF) were compared. The non-specific nature of skeletal changes in adult scurvy has a considerable effect on the potential to suggest a diagnosis. It is conceivable that all individuals had scurvy close to the time of death, but just two displayed probable evidence of scurvy and a further two had possible evidence of scurvy. Remaining cases had insufficient evidence for diagnosis. Although not straightforward, significantly more information was obtained by combining the results of the three types of pathological changes considered. Recent work has highlighted the difficulties of using PNBF in paleopathology, but careful evaluation of location and approximate stage of healing at the time of death contributes useful information that can be used to indicate level of disease burden and possible co-occurrence of conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPaleopathology 0aScurvy 0aVitamin C 0aSkeletal remains 0aPrisoners 0aQuebec City1 aSchattmann, Annabelle1 aIngram, Joelle0 tInternational Journal of Paleopathology.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x1879-98177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpp.2016.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011100170300001600281520120100297592002801498650003701526650002101563650001601584650002501600650002801625650003101653650001301684650001301697650001301710650001701723650001601740653002001756653003601776653002101812700002101833700001101854700001401865700001201879773011201891856008602003852000902089655001202098IND50059305220221119020545.0190408e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005930522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xiao-Juan10aNitrogen-enriched waste medium density fiberboard-based activated carbons as materials for supercapacitors  ap. 617-622.  aNitrogen-enriched activated carbons were prepared from waste medium density fiberboard base using K2CO3 as an activating agent for electrochemical capacitors. The effect of different temperatures of carbonization (300, 400, 500, and 600°C) and the influence of the sequence of activation process (a mass K2CO3/coke ratio of 3, temperature of 800°C and the activation time 1h) on the electrochemical performance have been investigated. All of the samples were characterized in terms of surface chemical composition by elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, porosity by N2 sorption at 77K, surface area by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurement. Electrochemical behavior as electric double-layer capacitors was determined using galvanostatic, voltammetric charge/discharge, specific capacitance values versus current densities, and impedance spectroscopy techniques in a 7molL−1 KOH aqueous solution. A maximum value of specific capacitance of 230Fg−1 was achieved for the sample carbonized at 400°C. The good electrochemical performance of the activated carbon was ascribed to high surface area, wide pore size distribution, and the presence of nitrogen functional groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3acapacitance 3achemical composition 3adielectric spectroscopy 3amedium density fiberboards 3anitrogen 3aporosity 3asorption 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aSupercapacitors 0aWaste medium density fiberboard 0aActivated carbon1 aZhang, Ming-Yang1 aWu, Yu1 aZhang, Ji1 aMu, Jun0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 May, v. 43 p.617-622dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245009400214300001400308520170900322592002802031650001702059650002502076650001202101650001702113650001202130650001902142650002202161650002002183650001402203650002602217650001202243650001002255650002102265650001102286650001502297651001802312651002102330653001702351653001802368653002502386653003402411653003302445773010702478856008802585852000902673655001202682IND60630397420221120023248.0190328e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063039742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChevalier, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8183-988110aEnabling possibilities to quantify past climate from fossil assemblages at a global scale  ap. 27-35.  aThe field of quantitative palaeoclimatology has made significant progress in the past decades. However, this progress has been spatially heterogeneous and strong discrepancies – both in terms of quality and density – exist between Europe and North America and the rest of the world. The need to balance this distribution of quantified records has never been stronger, and improving our understanding of past global climate is urgent in order to better evaluate and employ the predictions of climate models. In this paper, it is argued that this gap can be reduced by applying the climate reconstruction method CREST (Climate REconstruction SofTware) calibrated using the open-access GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) database, which contains hundreds of thousands modern distributions of numerous bio-indicator proxies (e.g. pollen, chironomids, foraminifers, etc.). Using the taxonomical diversity of the GBIF database, CREST can be used to reconstruct various climate and/or environmental parameters from assemblage variety of different records. Independent from the usual reconstruction techniques using surface samples for calibration, the CREST/GBIF framework can also be used as an independent tool that can be easily and efficiently applied (1) to complete the global coverage of climate reconstructions, as exemplified with a precipitation reconstruction from Lake Van, Turkey, (2) to revisit existing data sets to obtain new quantitative reconstructions, and (3) to evaluate and/or refine reconstructions based on other methods. The application of this tool promises to foster advances in our understanding of the past climate variability of the Earth system at a global scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aEarth system science 3aRetaria 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenvironmental factors 3afossils 3alakes 3apaleoclimatology 3apollen 3aprediction 3aNorth America 3aTurkey (country) 0aCREST method 0aGBIF database 0aModern distributions 0aProbability density functions 0aPalaeoclimate quantification0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2019 Apr., v. 175 p.27-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011600170300001600286500001400302520208800316592002802404650001702432650002102449650001102470650002102481650001202502650002202514650001502536650001102551650001302562650002002575650001702595651001202612653003302624653001502657653001902672653003102691653002702722653002902749700001902778773011302797856008502910852000902995655001203004IND60719489220221118202558.0201202e20180220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071948922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFichter, Klaus10aFactors influencing university support for sustainable entrepreneurship: Insights from explorative case studies  ap. 512-524.  aNAL-light  aRecent studies suggest that a growing number of universities are embracing the notion that sustainability should and can be integrated into the university support system for entrepreneurship, or that sustainability activities should be implemented and promoted with entrepreneurial spirit. This finding relates positively to the demands by policy makers that sustainable entrepreneurship should be addressed in (higher) education, to prepare the mind-set of future “green entrepreneurs”. But there are hardly any insights concerning how an appropriate university system should be designed and which factors influence the emergence and implementation of university support systems for sustainable entrepreneurship. We address this research gap by means of a qualitative multi-case study approach. Based on 41 good practice examples, we carried out in-depth case studies investigating four universities based in the USA and Germany. Our results indicate that the four areas of potential influence derived from theory and the literature (environmental context, institutional framework, key persons and external interaction) are actually relevant. The case studies support the assumption that the role of key persons as initiators, promoters or networkers is of outstanding importance. In addition to the four areas of influence derived from theory and literature, the four case studies indicated that there are further relevant factors. It was possible to identify three additional fields of influence: (1) Core activities for developing university support systems (research or implementation projects, dialogue processes), (2) the organizational history and competencies background of universities and (3) student interest and demand.While the question why sustainable entrepreneurship should be supported by higher education institutions is clearly answered, there are hardly any insights concerning how an appropriate university system should be designed and which factors influence the emergence and implementation of university support systems for sustainable entrepreneurship.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aentrepreneurship 3afields 3ahigher education 3ahistory 3aissues and policy 3aliterature 3apeople 3aresearch 3asupport systems 3auniversities 3aGermany 0aSustainable entrepreneurship 0aUniversity 0aSupport system 0aEntrepreneurial university 0aSustainable university 0aExplorative case studies1 aTiemann, Irina0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Feb. 20, v. 175 p.512-524dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245013500210300001400345520178500359592002802144596002202172650002402194650001602218650002302234650001902257650001002276650001502286650001202301650002802313650001502341650001702356650001502373650001302388650001702401700006002418700006702478700006202545773010202607856008302709852000902792655001202801IND60765828720221118223002.0220203e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076582872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-021-03101-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoker-Gurkan, Ajda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1475-241710amiR27a, a fine-tuning molecule, interacts with growth hormone (GH) signaling and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) via targeting STAT5  ap. 71-84.  aAutocrine growth hormone (GH) expression triggers cell proliferation, invasion-metastasis in vitro and in vivo models, but GH gene mutations inhibit postnatal growth. Natural polyamines (PA); putrescine, spermidine, spermine trigger cell growth and differentiation. The importance of miR27a has shown to exert a suppressive effect on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) expression in dwarf mice models. We aimed to modulate the role of A13S, F166Δ, T24 GH gene mutations’ impact on PA metabolism and epithelial–mesencyhmal transition (EMT) pathway through miR27a. Biologically active GH signaling triggered cell viability, growth, and colony formation, but T24A alteration significantly decreases aggressive profiles due to inactive GH signaling through a decline in STAT5 activity and expressions of STAT5, c-myc and ODC. Although statistically significant increase in intracellular PA levels in wt GH signaling HEK293 cells compared to HEK293 cells with a lack of GH signaling, a sharp decline in PA levels measured in each mutant GH expressing HEK293 cells. When we inhibited miR27a, proliferation and colony formation accelerated through a significant increase in putrescine levels and upregulation of ODC, STAT5 expression. In contrast, a substantial decline in GH-mediated colony enlargement observed via ODC, STAT5 downregulation, and PA depletion in both wt and mutant GH expressing HEK293 cell lines by miR27a mimic transfection. In conclusion, T24A mutant GH expression declines the GH signaling through STAT5 activity, and mutant GH signaling decreased cell proliferation, division, and colony formation via EMT inhibition.

Cocktail strains of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were used as indicator strains. In a nitrite reduced sausage model, L. monocytogenes growing trend did not significantly change (p > 0.05) when compared with that containing higher nitrite concentration (150 mg/kg NaNO2). The addition of L. plantarum PSC20 significantly lowered L. monocytogenes growth when compared with control batches without PCS20 (p < 0.05), obtaining 3.84 log cfu/g and 2.62 log cfu/g lower counts in the batches with 150 mg/kg NaNO2 and 75 mg/kg NaNO2 respectively. None of the protective cultures demonstrated in situ antagonistic activity against Salmonella spp. This work pointed out that the reduction of nitrites with the combined use of a protective culture could be a feasible approach to control L. monocytogenes growth in fermented meat foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3achorizo 3afermented meat 3afood pathogens 3amodels 3asodium nitrite 0aProtective cultures 0aNitrite reduction 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aSalmonella spp. 0aFermented pork meat1 aBaffoni, Loredana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5313-58711 aDi Gioia, Diana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0181-15721 aManso, Beatriz1 aGarcía-Sánchez, Lourdes1 aMelero, Beatriz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8982-81861 aRovira, Jordi0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Mar., v. 101 p.293-299dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009100165300001800256520105800274592002801332650001501360650000801375650002701383650001201410650001001422650001201432650001801444650001401462650002101476650002001497653002601517653002401543653000901567653002701576653001401603700001701617700001301634700001801647700001701665700001701682700001201699700001201711773013301723856008201856852000901938655001201947IND60565382320221118222822.0170325e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056538232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b057572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Dengfeng10aAdsorption and Distribution of Edible Gliadin Nanoparticles at the Air/Water Interface  ap. 2454-2460.  aEdible gliadin nanoparticles (GNPs) were fabricated using the anti-solvent method. They possessed unique high foamability and foam stability. An increasing concentration of GNPs accelerated their initial adsorption speed from the bulk phase to the interface and raised the viscoelastic modulus of interfacial films. High foamability (174.2 ± 6.4%) was achieved at the very low concentration of GNPs (1 mg/mL), which was much better than that of ovalbumin and sodium caseinate. Three stages of adsorption kinetics at the air/water interface were characterized. First, they quickly diffused and adsorbed at the interface, resulting in a fast increase of the surface pressure. Then, nanoparticles started to fuse into a film, and finally, the smooth film became a firm and rigid layer to protect bubbles against coalescence and disproportionation. These results explained that GNPs had good foamability and high foam stability simultaneously. That provides GNPs as a potential candidate for new foaming agents applied in edible and biodegradable products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3abiodegradable products 3abubbles 3afoams 3agliadin 3ananoparticles 3aovalbumin 3asodium caseinate 3aviscoelasticity 0agliadin nanoparticles 0aair/water interface 0afoam 0ainterfacial properties 0astability1 aJin, Weiping1 aLi, Jing1 aXiong, Wenfei1 aPei, Yaqiong1 aWang, Yuntao1 aLi, Yan1 aLi, Bin0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 65, no. 11 p.2454-2460dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.6b057573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245015300177300001600330500000900346500001500355520159400370592002801964650002201992650002002014650002602034650001402060650002102074650001102095650002702106650000902133650002102142651001002163651001902173653001702192700002302209700001802232773012202250852000902372856009702381655001202478IND8201241520221116173735.0191122e198111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND820124152DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1981.00021962007300060007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonbiela, F.12aA Method to Determine the Appropriate Mathematical Form for Incorporating Soil Test Levels in Fertilizer Response Models for Recommendation Purposes  ap. 937-941.  aepub  a2019-12-05  aA method is proposed for developing fertilizer recommendations based upon a statistical estimate of the amount of “plantavailable” nutrient in the soil (d), and determining the appropriate mathematical form of the relationship of this estimate to soil test values (T). A function of soil test is then substituted into the fertilizer response model ford. Some comparisons of the effects of three different models (Mitscherlich, quadratic and square root) upon d estimates and on the form of their relationships to soil test values were made. Regressions of d estimates obtained using the three models upon soil test P values were carried out to determine empirically the appropriate mathematical form [called f(T)] for a set of Irish potato data from Maine and North Carolina. The f(T) was found to be linear for that particular set of data for all three models, i.e.,d a = b₀ + b₁T. From these data, it was concluded that environmental conditions between states did not affect f(T) but did affect the level of maximum response (A, in the Mitscherlich model) and a factor related to curve shape (c, in the Mitscherlich model). Once f(T) is known for a model, it may be substituted into the model ford and this equation then used for fertilizer recommendations based upon site-specific soil test information. Equations for estimating optimal P fertilizer rates assuming different cost-price ratios (p) and marginal rates of return (R) were given for this data set. Similar equations may be derived for other specific crop-soil conditions using the techniques described in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3afertilizer rates 3amodels 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3asoil 3asoil test values 3aMaine 3aNorth Carolina 0asoil science1 aNicholaides, J.

We investigated the effects of sediment size on transport capacity of overland flow in a flume. Unit flow discharge ranged from 0.66 to 5.26 × 10⁻³ m² s⁻¹, and slope gradient varied from 8.7 to 42.3%. Five sediment size classes (median diameter, d₅₀, of 0.10, 0.22, 0.41, 0.69 and 1.16 mm) were used. Sediment size was inversely related to transport capacity. The ratios of average transport capacity of the finest class to those of the 0.22, 0.41, 0.69 and 1.16 mm classes were 1.09, 1.30, 1.55 and 1.92, respectively. Sediment transport capacity increased as a power function of flow discharge and slope gradient (R² = 0.98), shear stress (R² = 0.95), stream power (R² = 0.94), or unit stream power (R² = 0.76). Transport capacity generally decreased as a power function of sediment size (exponent = −0.35). Shear stress and stream power predicted transport capacity better than unit stream power on steep slopes when transport capacity was <7 kg m⁻¹ s⁻¹. Sediment transport capacity increased linearly with mean flow velocity. Critical or threshold velocity increased as a power function of sediment size (R² = 0.93). Further studies with fine soil particles are needed to quantify the effects of sediment size on transport capacity of overland flow on steep slopes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoverland flow 3asediment transport 3asediments 3ashear stress 3asoil 3asoil erosion models 0aerosion 0atransport capacity 0asediment size 0aoverland flow 0asteep slope1 aWang, Lili,1 aTang, Ke-Ming1 aLuo, Rong-Ting1 aZhang, X.

In this study, differences and interactions among SNF4 (encoding for the regulatory subunit of Snf1 kinase) overexpression and REG1 and REG2 (which encodes for the regulatory subunits of the type I protein phosphatase) deletions in maltose metabolism of baker’s yeast were investigated using various mutants. Results revealed that SNF4 overexpression and REG1 and REG2 deletions effectively alleviated glucose repression at different levels, thereby enhancing maltose metabolism and leavening ability to varying degrees. SNF4 overexpression combined with REG1/REG2 deletions further enhanced the increases in glucose derepression and maltose metabolism. The overexpressed SNF4 with deleted REG1 and REG2 mutant ΔREG1ΔREG2 + SNF4 displayed the highest maltose metabolism and strongest leavening ability under the test conditions. Such baker’s yeast strains had excellent potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a31171730cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aKYQD1660cthe Scientific Research Foundation of Hainan University 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3adough 3afermentation 3agene overexpression 3aglucose 3amaltose 3amutants1 aZhang, Cui-Ying1 aMeng, Lu1 aBai, Xiao-Wen1 aXiao, Dong-Guang0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2018 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.827-838dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl54684x1367-54357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-018-2058-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245015200174300001400326500001900340520162100359592002801980650002502008650004402033650002102077650002202098650002802120650001602148650001702164650001902181650001302200650001902213650000702232650001802239650001602257650001502273650002102288650002002309650001602329650003702345653004902382653003402431653002902465653001402494700002702508700002002535700001802555773013302573856008702706852000902793655001202802IND60732775020221119160730.0210708e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073277502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.1702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhobadi, Mohammad10aEffect of heat treatment on the structure and stability of Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) protein isolate/Alyssum homolocarpum seed gum nanoparticles  ap. 26-36.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present study, Grass pea protein isolate (GPPI)- Alyssum homolocarpum seed gum (AHSG) complex nanoparticles were formed through two fabrication methods and their physicochemical properties, structure and stability against sodium chloride and different pHs were investigated. Type 1 particles were formed by creating GPPI nanoparticles, and then coating them with AHSG; while Type 2 particles were fabricated through the heat treatment of GPPI-AHSG complexes at 85 °C for 15 min. The preparation methods did not influence the magnitude of electrical charges on biopolymer particles. The particle size analysis revealed that Type 2 particles had lower mean diameter (d = 360.20 nm) compared to Type 1 particles (d = 463.22 nm). Structural properties of Type 1 and Type 2 particles were determined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were the main driving forces contributed to the formation of both GPPI-AHSG complex particles. Assessments of morphological and structural properties also indicated that both Type 1 and 2 particles had spherical shapes and heat treatment increased the ordered intermolecular structures in biopolymer particles. Type 2 particles had higher denaturation temperature and better pH and salt stability when compared to Type 1 particles. These results indicate that thermal treatment was effective for the fabrication of stable GPPI-AHSG complex nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlyssum homalocarpum 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLathyrus sativus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiopolymers 3adenaturation 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3aparticle size 3apea protein 3aplant gums 3aprotein isolates 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aGrass pea (Lathyrus sativus) protein isolate 0aAlyssum homolocarpum seed gum 0aBiopolymer nanoparticles 0aStability1 aVaridi, Mohammad Javad1 aKoocheki, Arash1 aVaridi, Mehdi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 01, v. 182 p.26-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.1703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245017000173520153300343592002801876650001601904650003001920650001201950650001601962650001801978650001801996650001602014650000902030650001502039650002302054650001002077650001402087650001502101650001802116650001402134650001902148650001702167650001302184653002302197653003302220653001902253653001702272653001602289653001402305700002202319700001902341700002302360700001802383700002302401700002502424773011902449856008802568852000902656655001202665IND60758339520221120082247.0220214e20220410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075833952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1516422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrata, Joana C.10aEffects of virgin and weathered polystyrene and polypropylene microplastics on Raphidocelis subcapitata and embryos of Danio rerio under environmental concentrations  aMicroplastics are ubiquitous contaminants of freshwater ecosystems. However, few ecotoxicity assays have been conducted on freshwater organisms using environmentally relevant concentrations of virgin and weathered microplastics. This work assessed the adverse effects of virgin and artificially weathered fragments of polystyrene and polypropylene on the microalga Raphidocelis subcapitata (72 h growth inhibition assay) and on embryos of the fish Danio rerio (96 h fish embryo assay) under environmentally relevant concentrations (2000–200,000 MP L⁻¹) and high concentrations (12.5–100 mg L⁻¹). Sizes of microplastics were measured as tens (polystyrene) to hundreds (polypropylene) of micrometers, while aging was assessed by measuring the carbonyl index. In the microalga, the tested high concentrations promoted growth, while environmentally relevant concentration induced either growth inhibition or promotion. In zebrafish embryos, environmentally relevant concentrations decreased body length and heart rates. No relevant effects were observed in organisms exposed to high concentrations for mortality, malformations, hatching rates, and swimming bladder inflation. Virgin microplastics presented slightly higher toxicity but direct comparison was hindered by the lack of a linear dose-response curve. Despite the lack of a clear pattern, adverse effects were often observed in the lowest environmentally relevant concentrations, raising concerns over the impacts of microplastics on freshwater ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3abladder 3abody length 3adose response 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironment 3afish 3afreshwater 3agrowth retardation 3aheart 3ainflation 3amicroalgae 3amicroplastics 3amortality 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3atoxicity 0aAged microplastics 0aDegradation of microplastics 0aCarbonyl index 0aMethyl index 0aEcotoxicity 0aZebrafish1 aVenâncio, Cátia1 aGirão, Ana V.1 ada Costa, João P.1 aLopes, Isabel1 aDuarte, Armando C.1 aRocha-Santos, Teresa0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 10, v. 816 p.151642-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1516423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014100164300001800305520124900323592002801572596011701600596011601717596011601833650001501949650001501964650002501979650001702004650001302021650000902034650004102043650002602084650003002110650003202140650001502172650002902187700001802216700001502234700001402249700001402263700001502277700001402292773012502306856008202431852000902513655001202522IND60548926320221119181231.0180904e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054892632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-016-3132-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yonggang10aSimultaneous Determination of 42 Pesticides and Herbicides in Chicken Eggs by UHPLC–MS/MS and GC–MS Using a QuEChERS-Based Procedure  ap. 1165-1175.  aA quick, easy, cheap, rugged, effective, and safe (QuEChERS)-based method has been validated for the extraction of 42 pesticides and herbicides including organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs), carbamate pesticides (CBs), herbicides (HBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and synthetic pyrethroid pesticides (PYRs) from chicken eggs. The QuEChERS-based extraction procedure was followed by cleanup steps using C18 and primary secondary amine sorbents. The supernatant was analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The OPPs, CBs, and HBs were quantified by UHPLC–MS/MS, while the OCPs and PYRs were detected by GC–MS. The limits of quantification ranged from 0.01 to 8.5 μg kg⁻¹, and the analyte recoveries were in the range of 64.9–123.2 %. Furthermore, the repeatabilities (intra-day and inter-day) were good, and linear matrix-matched calibration curves were obtained. Acetochlor was identified in concentrations ranging from 0.27 to 0.44 μg kg⁻¹ in four samples from 80 chicken eggs. The method was successfully demonstrated for the fast and reliable analysis of pesticides and herbicides in chicken egg samples.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.201309046cPublic Sector Program of the National Environmental Protection of the People’s Republic of China  aY2013W01cSpecial Foundation for Young Scientists of Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention  aY2013W07cSpecial Foundation for Young Scientists of Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 3aacetochlor 3aadsorbents 3acarbamate pesticides 3achicken eggs 3achickens 3aeggs 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3aorganophosphorus pesticides 3apyrethrins 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aChen, Ziliang1 aZhang, Rui1 aLuo, Ping1 aZhou, Yan1 aWen, Sheng1 aMa, Meihu0 tChromatographia.g2016 Sept., v. 79, no. 17-18 p.1165-1175dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-016-3132-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245010500159300001800264520143000282592002801712650002501740650001701765650002001782650000901802650001601811650001501827650001201842650002601854650001001880650002701890650001601917650000901933650001401942650002301956650000901979650002401988650001202012650001002024650002902034653002802063653002102091653002302112700001602135700001502151700001502166700001502181700001702196700001502213700001902228773014802247856008202395852000902477655001202486IND60565382620221118222830.0170325e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056538262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b000622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hui10aApproach for Pesticide Residue Analysis for Metabolite Prothioconazole-desthio in Animal Origin Food  ap. 2481-2487.  aFood safety problems such as damage to immune, nervous, and endocrine systems leading to cancer and malformations have received increasing attention. To achieve the maximum residue limits, the most discussed method of high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) is widely used with a advantage of high precision and resolution. Prothioconazole is a broad-spectrum thiocarbamate fungicide. It can rapidly metabolize to prothioconazole-desthio in different matrixes. Rapid and effective methods for the determination of prothioconazole-desthio in five kinds of different animal food were developed. Samples were extracted with acetonitrile or acetonitrile/water and determined by HPLC–MS/MS. The limit of detection and limit of quantification values of prothioconazole-desthio were 0.015 and 0.05 mg/kg for porcine liver and kidney, 0.0015 and 0.005 mg/kg for pork, and 0.003 and 0.01 mg/kg for eggs, together with 0.0012 and 0.004 mg/kg for milk of the detected method, respectively. A good linear regression trend can be observed in a certain concentration range for all of the animal food. At fortified levels, recoveries were between 83.6 and 105%, with relative standard deviations of 1.5–10.3%. A sample survey of 150 samples with 30 samples for each kind of animal food across the country was conducted and found that there was no prothioconazole-desthio detected in all samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aacetonitrile 3adetection limit 3aeggs 3afood safety 3afungicides 3akidneys 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3amaximum residue limits 3ametabolites 3amilk 3aneoplasms 3apesticide residues 3apork 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3aswine 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aprothioconazole-desthio 0aresidue analysis 0aanimal origin food1 aYao, Guojun1 aLiu, Xueke1 aLiu, Chang1 aZhan, Jing1 aLiu, Donghui1 aWang, Peng1 aZhou, Zhiqiang0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 65, no. 11 p.2481-2487dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b000623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014700166300001400313520138500327592002801712650002901740650002101769650001901790650004201809650001701851650001201868650001901880650001001899650001401909650002301923650001701946650001801963650002001981650001302001653002702014653002902041653002602070653002602096653000802122653000902130653001002139653000902149653000702158653000802165653000702173653000802180653000802188700001302196700001102209700001702220700001702237700001902254700001302273700001902286773011602305856008302421852000902504655001202513IND60581444220221117204116.0190318e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058144422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2017.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ya-Nan10aDeep sequencing of antennal transcriptome from Callosobruchus chinensis to characterize odorant binding protein and chemosensory protein genes  ap. 13-21.  aThe sophisticated olfactory system of insects has a key role in their growth and reproduction, and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of this system in economically important insect species will be useful for development of new and effective insecticides. Callosobruchus chinensis (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera, Bruchidae) is a destructive pest of stored food, and is widely distributed around the world. However, our understanding at the molecular level of the olfactory mechanism in this beetle is limited. In the present study, antennal transcriptomic data was obtained using Illumina sequencing, and a total of 69,847 unigenes was assembled. Bioinformatics analyses identified a set of putative olfactory genes, including 21 odorant binding proteins (OBPs) and five chemosensory proteins (CSPs). We constructed phylogenetic trees of these OBPs and CSPs together with those from other insect species, and found high orthology with coleopteran species. The expression levels of OBPs and CSPs were estimated by the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) method. Our results provide the foundation to identify other chemoreception-related genes. It is to be hoped that some of these genes will be potential targets for developing novel behavioral blocker compounds and pesticides to interfere with the olfactory system of C. chinensis and help reduce population densities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallosobruchus chinensis 3abinding proteins 3abioinformatics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3aodor compounds 3apests 3aphylogeny 3apopulation density 3areproduction 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 0aAntennal transcriptome 0aOdorant binding proteins 0aChemosensory proteins 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aPCR 0acDNA 0aBLAST 0aRPKM 0aNr 0aCOG 0aGO 0aOBP 0aCSP1 aKang, Ke1 aXu, Lu1 aZhu, Xiu-Yun1 aQian, Jia-Li1 aZhang, Zi-Jian1 aHe, Peng1 aLi, Xiao Ming,0 tJournal of stored products research.g2017 Dec., v. 74 p.13-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2017.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245013100158300001600289520102400305592002801329596004601357596004601403650002101449650002401470650001301494650001201507650002601519650002401545650001401569650002601583700001601609700001701625700006201642773016201704856008201866852000901948655001201957IND60609083720221118025527.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060908372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-018-2062-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ye10aEngineering Escherichia coli to increase triacetic acid lactone (TAL) production using an optimized TAL sensor-reporter system  ap. 789-793.  aTriacetic acid lactone (TAL) (4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone) can be upgraded into a variety of higher-value products, and has potential to be developed into a renewable platform chemical through metabolic engineering. We previously developed an endogenous TAL sensor based on the regulatory protein AraC, and applied it to screen 2-pyrone synthase (2-PS) variant libraries in E. coli, resulting in the identification of variants conferring up to 20-fold improved TAL production in liquid culture. In this study, the sensor-reporter system was further optimized and used to further improve TAL production from recombinant E. coli, this time by screening a genomic overexpression library. We identified new and unpredictable gene targets (betT, ompN, and pykA), whose plasmid-based expression improved TAL yield (mg/L/OD₅₉₅) up to 49% over the control strain. This work further demonstrates the utility of customized transcription factors as molecular reporters in high-throughput engineering of biocatalytic strains.  aPublisher supplied data  aCBET-1159398cNational Science Foundation  aCBET-1511425cNational Science Foundation 3aEscherichia coli 3agene overexpression 3agenomics 3aliquids 3ametabolic engineering 3aregulatory proteins 3ascreening 3atranscription factors1 aQian, Shuai1 aDunn, Rachel1 aCirino, Patrick C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7245-62050 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2018 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.789-793dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl54684x1367-54357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-018-2062-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245012400166300002000290520067200310592002800982650001401010650001401024650002301038650002301061650002001084650002501104650004301129650001301172650002201185650001601207650002001223700002401243700001801267700002501285700002301310773012101333856008101454852000901535655001201544IND60583613820171214000000.0171020e20171020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058361382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b018202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantin, Mathilde10aStereochemical Characterization of Polyketide Stereotriads Synthesized via Hydrogen-Mediated Asymmetric syn-Crotylation  ap. 11225-11229.  aThe stereoselective access to stereotriads as important polyketide building blocks is reported on the basis of the Krische-type hydrogen-mediated syn-crotylation.

This extension of the burgeoning transfer hydrogen methodology gives divergent asymmetric access to anti,syn and syn,syn polyketide stereotriads from the same α-chiral starting material and avoids potentially epimerizable aldehyde intermediates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acrystallography 3adiastereoselectivity 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen 3aorganic chemistry 3apolyketides 3astereochemistry1 aHubert, Jonathan G.1 aSöhnel, Tilo1 aBrimble, Margaret A.1 aFurkert, Daniel P.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 Oct. 20, v. 82, no. 20 p.11225-11229dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b018203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015000171520152500321592002801846650002401874650001001898650001401908650002801922650001801950650001001968650001801978650001401996650001402010650002602024650001302050650001502063650001302078650003302091650001602124650001702140650001502157650001602172650002902188653001002217653002102227653001302248653001702261700002102278700002202299773010202321856008602423852000902509655001202518IND60678441120221119022203.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067844112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBollom, Mark A.10aDevelopment and characterization of a novel soy lecithin-stearic acid and whey protein concentrate bigel system for potential edible applications  aBigels are a new technology with great potential in the food industry. Their success with drug delivery suggests they may be able to deliver sensitive compounds in foods, such as probiotics and bioactives. The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a novel, edible bigel system. The bigel was prepared by homogenizing, at high shear, an oleogel emulsion composed of soy lecithin, stearic acid, soybean oil, and water, and a hydrogel composed of whey protein concentrate and water. Characterization was conducted through small angle x-ray scattering, rheology, and fluorescence microscopy. With addition of the hydrogel component, the oleogel emulsion retained its basic structural characteristics, but lost higher order structuring. The bigels were found to have temperature-dependent G′ values. Despite temperature sensitivity, the bigels showed G’>G″ at all temperatures from 8 to 98 °C. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that a bi-continuous bigel was formed at equal proportions of oleogel emulsion and hydrogel; nevertheless, when either of those phases increased one of them became the dominant continuous phase. Some interaction between the phases may have occurred at 10 wt% water and 15 wt% protein usage in the oleogel emulsion and hydrogel, respectively, and this synergy improved the bigel's mechanical properties. On the contrary, at protein and water contents outside those listed above, the relationship between phases became antagonistic towards the bigel's mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3adrugs 3aemulsions 3afluorescence microscopy 3afood industry 3afoods 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogels 3alecithins 3amechanical properties 3aoleogels 3aprobiotics 3arheology 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asoybean oil 3astearic acid 3atechnology 3atemperature 3awhey protein concentrate 0aBigel 0aOleogel emulsion 0aHydrogel 0aSoy lecithin1 aClark, Stephanie1 aAcevedo, Nuria C.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Apr., v. 101 p.105570-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04502naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245018800211300001100399506007600410520237800486592002802864596005702892596004702949506003702996650002403033650001003057650002103067650001503088650002103103650001703124650002503141650001303166650002503179650002403204650002403228650001303252650001203265650000903277650001403286650001403300650001203314650001103326650001203337650001103349650001403360650002103374650002503395650001803420650001403438650002203452650002603474700003403500700001903534700002803553700005703581773011103638856008203749852000903831655001203840IND60682700120221207055004.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068270012DNAL7 a319962542pmid7 aPMC69905732pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-020-3889-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aʻAsgarī, Majīd,10aMolecular characterization of RNase III protein of Asaia sp. for developing a robust RNAi-based paratransgensis tool to affect the sexual life-cycle of Plasmodium or Anopheles fitness  ap. 42.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: According to scientific recommendations, paratransgenesis is one of the solutions for improving the effectiveness of the Global Malaria Eradication Programme. In paratransgenesis, symbiont microorganisms are used for distorting or blocking the parasite life-cycle, affecting the fitness and longevity of vectors or reducing the vectorial competence. It has been revealed recently that bacteria could be used as potent tools for double stranded RNA production and delivery to insects. Moreover, findings showed that RNase III mutant bacteria are more competent for this aim. Asaia spp. have been introduced as potent paratransgenesis candidates for combating malaria and, based on their specific features for this goal, could be considered as effective dsRNA production and delivery tools to Anopheles spp. Therefore, we decided to characterize the rnc gene and its related protein to provide the basic required information for creating an RNase III mutant Asaia bacterium. METHODS: Asaia bacteria were isolated from field-collected Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. The rnc gene and its surrounding sequences were characterized by rapid amplification of genomic ends. RNase III recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 and biological activity of the purified recombinant protein was assayed. Furthermore, Asaia RNaseIII amino acid sequence was analyzed by in silico approaches such as homology modeling and docking to determine its structural properties. RESULTS: In this study, the structure of rnc gene and its related operon from Asaia sp. was determined. In addition, by performing superimposition and docking with specific substrate, the structural features of Asaia RNaseIII protein such as critical residues which are involved and essential for proper folding of active site, binding of magnesium ions and double stranded RNA molecule to protein and cleaving of dsRNA molecules, were determined. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the basic and essential data for creating an RNase III mutant Asaia sp. strain, which is the first step of developing an efficient RNAi-based paratransgenesis tool, were acquired. Asaia sp. have been found in different medically-important vectors and these data are potentially very helpful for researchers studying paratransgenesis and vector-borne diseases and are interested in applying the RNAi technology in the field.  aPublisher supplied data  aEducational office of PIIcPasteur Institute of Iran  a94810113cIran National Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aAsaia 3aEscherichia coli 3aPlasmodium 3aRNA interference 3aactive sites 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3abioactive properties 3acomputer simulation 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenomics 3ainsects 3aions 3alongevity 3amagnesium 3amalaria 3amodels 3amutants 3aoperon 3aparasites 3aparatransgenesis 3arecombinant proteins 3aribonucleases 3asymbionts 3avector competence 3avector-borne diseases1 aIlbeigikhamsehnejad, Mahdokht1 aRismani, Elham1 aDinparast Djadid, Navid1 aRaz, Abbasali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7937-83500 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.42-42dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-3889-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009300164300001600257520149000273592002801763650001701791650003401808650001301842650001801855650001101873650001901884650000901903650001401912650002301926650003101949650001601980650002401996650001002020650003002030650003302060650000902093650001802102650002002120700001502140700001502155700001402170700001302184700001602197700001402213700001702227700001902244773010702263856004802370852000902418655001202427IND50066418820221120132559.0130515e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006641882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-012-0537-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xuming10aCharacterization of a Novel NBS-LRR Gene Involved in Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice  ap. 649-656.  aNucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) genes play important roles in plant disease resistance. Due to its similarity to Rp1 in maize (Zea mays), a novel NB-LRR gene was isolated from rice and designated as OsRP1L1 (Oryza sativa Rp1-like 1). Analysis of expression of a super green fluorescent protein (sGFP) fusion gene revealed that the OsRP1L1 protein localizes to the nucleolus. Expression patterns suggested that OsRP1L1 was involved in responses to several plant growth regulators (PGRs) and environmental stresses. To explore its function in bacterial blight (BB) resistance, OsRP1L1 was cloned and overexpressed in a susceptible japonica rice cultivar. Overexpression of OsRP1L1 moderately elevated the resistance of plants to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains PXO86 and PXO341. Transcriptome analysis showed that plants overexpressing OsRP1L1 had small changes in their transcriptome, with 26 genes showing statistically significant changes of more than two-fold. The most up-regulated transcripts—a DIN1-like gene and a terpene synthase (TPS) gene—were up-regulated 7.9- and 7.6-fold, respectively. It was also noted that seven of the up-regulated genes have also reportedly been induced by overexpression of OsbZIP46, which has been identified recently as a player in ABA sensing. All these findings suggest that OsRP1L1 plays an important role in rice BB resistance, and may be useful as a genetic resource for engineering disease resistance in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3aZea mays 3aabscisic acid 3ablight 3acell nucleolus 3acorn 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agene expression regulation 3agene fusion 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aplant diseases and disorders 3arice 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aChen, Juan1 aYang, Yong1 aZhou, Jie1 aQiu, Yan1 aYu, Chulang1 aCheng, Ye1 aYan, Chengqi1 aChen, Jianping0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2013 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.649-656dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-012-0537-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012100175300001200296520160900308592002801917596008001945650001302025650001102038650001602049650001502065650002402080650001402104650001302118650001602131651001002147700002302157700002302180700006202203773013402265856008302399852000902482655001202491IND60777649920221117195634.0220524e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077764992DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-022-10418-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManivannan, Vengadesan10aDelineation and quantification of groundwater resources affected by seawater intrusion along the east coast of India  ap. 300.  aOverextraction of groundwater from coastal aquifers results in seawater intrusion causes immense threat to groundwater resources. The objectives of this study are to delineate the coastal regions affected by seawater intrusion along the east coast of India and to estimate the quantum of groundwater resources affected by seawater intrusion. The groundwater level, quality, and quantity data of groundwater along with its draft along the east coast for the year 2017 were collected from India WRIS. About 86% of groundwater pumped is used for irrigation and 14% of groundwater pumped is used for domestic and industrial purposes along the east coastal regions. The groundwater is being over exploited in Chennai, Nagapattinam, Puducherry, and Thanjavur districts of Tamil Nadu. The groundwater level is lower than mean sea level in most of the regions of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha where seawater intrusion is expected. The geochemical signatures such as Na/Cl and Cl/HCO₃ indicate that 35% of groundwater samples are affected by the seawater intrusion along the east coast. It is estimated that about 10,248 Mm³ of groundwater resources in the east coast of India are affected due to seawater intrusion, among which some parts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are highly affected. Around seven districts in the east coast of India are very much affected by incursion of seawater as inferred from groundwater level and geochemical signatures. Hence, it is necessary to regulate groundwater pumping and also to augment groundwater storage by suitable managed aquifer recharge methods.  aPublisher supplied data  aNCESS/MOES/402/GIA/2019cNational Centre for Earth Sciences Studies (NCESS) 3aaquifers 3acoasts 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3aseawater 3awater table 3aIndia1 aManoj, Subramanian1 aRamyaPriya, Ramesh1 aElango, Lakshmanan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0124-33680 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2022 May, v. 81, no. 10 p.300-300dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10418-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010100175300001800276520064000294592002800934650001100962650001000973650001800983650001201001650000901013653002001022653001601042653002201058653001301080653001201093653002601105700002001131700001701151700002301168773015501191856008601346852000901432655001201441IND60098435920221120075620.0190215e20130521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009843592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2013.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshioka, Toshinori10aVangl2, the planner cell polarity protein, is complexed with postsynaptic density protein PSD-95  ap. 1453-1459.  aVangl is a component of the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway, which is implicated in various cell polarity functions. However, little is known about its synaptic localization in neurons. Here, we show that Vangl1 and Vangl2 are expressed in adult rat neurons, where they are tightly associated with the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction. Vangl2 forms a complex with PSD-95 through direct binding. Furthermore, the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of Vangl2 is required for localization to dendritic spines. These results suggest that Vangl2 is a new component of the PSD that forms a complex with PSD-95 in the adult brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abrain 3acell polarity 3aneurons

genome interactions in primary head and neck cancers  ap. 15544-15549.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSignificance A significant proportion of head and neck cancer is driven by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and the expression of viral oncogenes is involved in the development of these tumors. However, the role of HPV integration in primary tumors beyond increasing the expression of viral oncoproteins is not understood. Here, we describe how HPV integration impacts the host genome by amplification of oncogenes and disruption of tumor suppressors as well as driving inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements. Tumors that do and do not have HPV integrants display distinct gene expression profiles and DNA methylation patterns, which further support the view that the mechanisms by which tumors with integrated and nonintegrated HPV arise are distinct.  aPrevious studies have established that a subset of head and neck tumors contains human papillomavirus (HPV) sequences and that HPV-driven head and neck cancers display distinct biological and clinical features. HPV is known to drive cancer by the actions of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, but the molecular architecture of HPV infection and its interaction with the host genome in head and neck cancers have not been comprehensively described. We profiled a cohort of 279 head and neck cancers with next generation RNA and DNA sequencing and show that 35 (12.5%) tumors displayed evidence of high-risk HPV types 16, 33, or 35. Twenty-five cases had integration of the viral genome into one or more locations in the human genome with statistical enrichment for genic regions. Integrations had a marked impact on the human genome and were associated with alterations in DNA copy number, mRNA transcript abundance and splicing, and both inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements. Many of these events involved genes with documented roles in cancer. Cancers with integrated vs. nonintegrated HPV displayed different patterns of DNA methylation and both human and viral gene expressions. Together, these data provide insight into the mechanisms by which HPV interacts with the human genome beyond expression of viral oncoproteins and suggest that specific integration events are an integral component of viral oncogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aDNA methylation 3aPapillomaviridae 3agene expression 3ahead 3ahead and neck neoplasms 3ahumans 3aoncogene proteins 3aoncogenes 0acancer 0ahead and neck 0apapilloma virus 0agenome rearrangement 0aintegration sites1 aPedamallu, Chandra Sekhar1 aGehlenborg, Nils1 aFreeman, Samuel S.1 aDanilova, Ludmila1 aBristow, Christopher A.1 aLee, Semin1 aHadjipanayis, Angela G.1 aIvanova, Elena V.1 aWilkerson, Matthew D.1 aProtopopov, Alexei1 aYang, Lixing1 aSeth, Sahil1 aSong, Xingzhi1 aTang, Jiabin1 aRen, Xiaojia1 aZhang, Jianhua1 aPantazi, Angeliki1 aSantoso, Netty1 aXu, Andrew W.1 aMahadeshwar, Harshad1 aWheeler, David A.1 aHaddad, Robert I.1 aJung, Joonil1 aOjesina, Akinyemi I.1 aIssaeva, Natalia1 aYarbrough, Wendell G.1 aHayes, D.

The presence of different air pollutants along with noise may aggravate the IAQ. The present study attempts to examine IAQ in terms of major criteria air pollutants (O3, NOx=NO+NO2, CO and PM2.5) along with total volatile organic compound (TVOC), individual VOC and noise pollution in indoor and outdoor environment of a Commercial Shopping Complex (CSC) in Delhi. Real time measurements have been carried out for O3, NOx, CO, PM2.5, TVOC and noise while thirteen individual VOCs have been estimated using NIOSH method was performed using Gas Chromatograph. The study also aimed to find out the relationship among VOCs, source estimation using Principal Component Analysis. The observed results for the targeted pollutants were also compared with international and national recommended permissible values. The mean values of O3, NOx, CO, PM2.5 and TVOC are found to be 17.6/(15.0) ppb, 15.8/(14.1) ppb, 8.4/(1.9) ppm, 125.4/(74.6) μg/m3 and 412.5/(226.5) μg/m3 for indoor/(outdoor), respectively. Among the individual VOC, toluene was the most abundant followed by xylene-isomers and benzene. The noise pollution level in Indoor/outdoor were found to be 51.5/46.4dB which is below the guideline value (65dB) provided by the WHO. Most of the pollutants were found to have indoor sources. The different kinds of pollutants and noise may have synergistic effect and aggravate the health of the people working and visiting the CSC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aanthropogenic activities 3abenzene 3acarbon monoxide 3aeducational institutions 3agas chromatography 3aguidelines 3ahuman health 3anitrogen oxides 3anoise pollution 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apeople 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk assessment 3astatistical models 3asynergism 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3aIndia 0aCriteria air pollutants 0aVOCs 0aNoise 0aExposure assessment 0aPrincipal Component Analysis 0aCommercial Shopping Complex1 aKumar, Amit1 aKumar, Krishan1 aSingh, Bupender1 aMina, Usha1 aSingh, Braj Bihari1 aJain, Vinod Kumar0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 572 p.586-594dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245005500209500002200264520087600286592002801162650001301190650002501203650001801228650002501246650001101271650002101282650000901303650001301312650001801325650001901343650001701362650002301379650001201402653000801414653000901422653000901431653000901440653000901449653000601458653001001464653001001474653000801484653000801492653000801500653000901508653000801517653000901525653000801534653000901542653000801551653000701559653000801566653000801574653000801582653000801590653001001598653000801608653000901616653001101625653000901636653000801645653000801653653000801661653000801669653000801677653000701685653000801692653000801700653001701708653002401725653003001749653003301779653001401812773007301826856008101899852000901980655001201989IND60560240620221120214550.0170720s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056024062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBetschinger, Joerg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2627-847910aCharting Developmental Dissolution of Pluripotency  aPre-press version  aThe formation of tissues and organs during metazoan development begs fundamental questions of cellular plasticity: How can the very same genome program have diverse cell types? How do cell identity programs unfold during development in space and time? How can defects in these mechanisms cause disease and also provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention? And ultimately, can developmental programs be exploited for bioengineering tissues and organs? Understanding principle designs of cellular identity and developmental progression is crucial for providing answers. Here, I will discuss how the capture of embryonic pluripotency in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro has allowed fundamental insights into the molecular underpinnings of a developmental cell state and how its ordered disassembly during differentiation prepares for lineage specification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3acell differentiation 3aembryogenesis 3aembryonic stem cells 3agenome 3ain vitro studies 3amice 3aontogeny 3aorganogenesis 3aspace and time 3atherapeutics 3atissue engineering 3atissues 0a5mC 0aαKG 0aBMP4 0aDnmt 0aDusp 0aE 0aEpiLC 0aEpiSC 0aESC 0aFCS 0aFGF 0aFGFR 0aGln 0aGSK3 0aGRN 0aHDAC 0aICM 0aId 0aJAK 0aLIF 0am6A 0aMEK 0amiRNA 0aNMD 0aNuRD 0aOxPhos 0aPRC2 0aPro 0aPiC 0aSAM 0aTCA 0aTet 0aTF 0aThr 0aTdh 0apluripotency 0aembryonic stem cell 0adevelopmental progression 0atranscription factor network 0asignaling0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245015400182300001800336520121700354592002801571650001501599650003101614650002501645650003001670650001501700650001101715650002201726650002201748650001801770650001401788650001601802650001301818651001001831653002501841653001401866653002601880653002501906653002201931653002301953653000801976653000801984653000801992653000802000653000802008700001702016700003102033773011502064856008602179852000902265655001202274IND60613699820221120130312.0201216e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061369982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.1492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez Iglesias, Edelmiro,10aMobility innovations for sustainability and cohesion of rural areas: A transport model and public investment analysis for Valdeorras (Galicia, Spain)  ap. 3520-3534.  aThis study provides a case example, referred to the county of Valdeorras (Galicia, Spain), to analyse different alternatives of public investment for sustainable mobility in rural areas. First, we develop a transport model based on gravity models to obtain commuting-to-work patterns, means of transport and routes, calibrating the results with the patterns observed according to different sources. Then, we make our own projections ten years ahead on population growth, geographical distribution, and employment rates, to obtain two scenarios on future trends. In a third step, we analyse different alternatives for public policy targets on sustainable mobility using a multi-criteria approach. The costs of implementing the mobility actions are compared against two potential benefits: 1. a higher integration among the villages that conform the dynamic axis of the area, and of these with their rural hinterland; 2. reducing the environmental impact –in terms of fuel consumption levels. The mobility alternatives are compared following a simple Analytic Hierarchy Process. The analysis helps to identify the potential benefits of exploiting a currently underutilised railroad facility in the area of study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemployment 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3ageographical distribution 3ahinterland 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3apublic investment 3apublic policy 3arailroads 3arural areas 3avillages 3aSpain 0aSustainable mobility 0aCommuting 0aCost-benefit analysis 0aEnvironmental impact 0aPublic investment 0aTransport planning 0aQ51 0aJ61 0aL91 0aO22 0aJ111 aPeon, David,1 aRodríguez-Álvarez, Jorge0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 172 p.3520-3534dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.1493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245016100161300001800322520093600340592002801276650001401304650002301318650002101341650002701362650002101389650001301410653003201423653002301455653002601478700001701504773014001521856007701661852000901738655001201747IND60521997420221120235338.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052199742DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1994-12232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHager, Rudolf10aPhosphazen-Katalyse.

Thereby three further types of phosphazenes have been synthesized: PCl₃=N(-PCl₂=N)ₓ-PCl₂=O,HO-PCl₂=N(-PCl₂=N)ₓ-PCl₂=O and siloxy derivatives of the latter ≡Si-O-PCl₂=N(-PCl₂=N)ₓ-PCl₂=O. Although several P-Cl bonds could be attacked by the nucleophiles, the reactions were found to be extremely selective and the products were obtained in very high yields. Finally relations between phosphazene structure and catalytic activity have been ascertained to find the optimal catalyst structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acondensation reactions 3amolecular weight 3asilicone 0aSilicones Linear Technology 0aChlorophosphazenes 0aCondensation Catalyst1 aWeis, Johann0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 49, no. 12 p.1774-1780dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1994-12233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003400132024001100166040001800177100001400195245014500209300001600354506017300370520177000543650002702313650003002340650001602370650001102386650001602397650001902413650001602432650001502448650001502463650002502478650001502503651001802518700002102536700002002557700002102577700001802598700002002616700003102636700002302667700002302690773008002713856011202793856004702905956009102952961000903043852000903052655001203061IND50066106720221214231448.0130426s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006610672DNAL7 a2638742aris7 a10113/563212hdl7 a10.1175/JHM-D-10-05000.12doi8 ans1457  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qing14aThe Contributions of Precipitation and Soil Moisture Observations to the Skill of Soil Moisture Estimates in a Land Data Assimilation System  ap. 750-765.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe contributions of precipitation and soil moisture observations to soil moisture skill in a land data assimilation system are assessed. Relative to baseline estimates from the Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), the study investigates soil moisture skill derived from (i) model forcing corrections based on large-scale, gauge- and satellite-based precipitation observations and (ii) assimilation of surface soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Soil moisture skill (defined as the anomaly time series correlation coefficient R) is assessed using in situ observations in the continental United States at 37 single-profile sites within the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) for which skillful AMSR-E retrievals are available and at 4 USDA Agricultural Research Service ("CalVal") watersheds with high-quality distributed sensor networks that measure soil moisture at the scale of land model and satellite estimates. The average skill of AMSR-E retrievals is R=0.42 versus SCAN and R=0.55 versus CalVal measurements. The skill of MERRA surface and root-zone soil moisture is R=0.43 and R=0.47, respectively, versus SCAN measurements. MERRA surface moisture skill is R=0.56 versus CalVal measurements. Adding information from precipitation observations increases (surface and root zone) soil moisture skills by ∆R~0.06. Assimilating AMSR-E retrievals increases soil moisture skills by ∆R~0.08. Adding information from both sources increases soil moisture skills by 'R~0.13, which demonstrates that precipitation corrections and assimilation of satellite soil moisture retrievals contribute important and largely independent amounts of information. 3aEarth Observing System 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acorrelation 3amodels 3aradiometers 3aremote sensing 3arhizosphere 3asatellites 3asoil water 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aUnited States1 aReichle, Rolf H.1 aBindlish, Rajat1 aCosh, Michael H.1 aCrow, Wade T.1 ade Jeu, Richard1 aDe Lannoy, Gabrielle J.

The molecule was able to efficiently facilitate a photomultiplication effect in blend with P3HT which was assisted by electron trapping followed by hole tunneling injection from the Al electrode giving rise to a high external quantum efficiency of 22 182% and a specific detectivity of 4.4 × 10¹² Jones at 355 nm and at −15 V bias.

HY5, a component of light-signaling pathways, and PAP1, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, share common regulatory targets on anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. The epistatic interactions between the two transcription factors are currently unknown. To address this problem, we analyzed crosses between hy5 and pap1 mutants (hy5pap1) or pap1D overexpressors (hy5pap1D), performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR, and determined the PAP1 promoter region through deletion analysis. The results show that HY5 regulates PAP1 expression via direct binding to G- and ACE-boxes in the promoter region, which suggests bifurcate regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis by HY5 via transcriptional activation of PAP1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3achromatin 3acrossing 3aepistasis 3agenes 3amutants 3apromoter regions 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 0aBc 0aEBG 0aFRc 0aHY5 0aLBG 0aMBW 0aPAP1 0aRc 0aAnthocyanin biosynthesis 0aArabidopsis 0aHY5 0aPAP11 aChoi, MyungGoo1 aKim, Keunhwa1 aBang, Geul1 aCho, Misuk1 aChoi, Sang-Bong1 aChoi, Giltsu1 aPark, Youn-Il0 tFEBS letters.g2013 May 21, v. 587, no. 10 p.1543-1547dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.03.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245017300206300001800379520148000397592002801877653001301905653002401918653001401942653002401956653000801980653002001988653001902008653000902027653001302036700002502049700001902074700001802093700002302111700001602134700002502150700002002175700002302195700002102218773010202239856007302341852000902414655001202423IND60560240920221120043548.0170105e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056024092DNAL7 a10.1002/jps.243792doi7 aPMC44487332pmcid7 a257537562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTelikepalli, Srivalli10aPhysical Characterization and In Vitro Biological Impact of Highly Aggregated Antibodies Separated into Size-Enriched Populations by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting  ap. 1575-1591.  aAn IgG2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) solution was subjected to stirring, generating high concentrations of nanometer and subvisible particles, which were then successfully size-enriched into different size bins by low-speed centrifugation or a combination of gravitational sedimentation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The size-fractionated mAb particles were assessed for their ability to elicit the release of cytokines from a population of donor-derived human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at two phases of the immune response. Fractions enriched in nanometer-sized particles showed a lower response than those enriched in micron-sized particles in this assay. Particles of 5–10μm in size displayed elevated cytokine release profiles compared with other size ranges. Stir-stressed mAb particles had amorphous morphology, contained protein with partially altered secondary structure, elevated surface hydrophobicity (compared with controls), and trace levels of elemental fluorine. FACS size-enriched the mAb particle samples, yet did not notably alter the overall morphology or composition of particles as measured by microflow imaging, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The utility and limitations of FACS for size separation of mAb particles and potential of in vitro PBMC studies to rank-order the immunogenic potential of various types of mAb particles are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aproteins 0aprotein aggregation 0aparticles 0amonoclonal antibody 0aIgG 0aimmune response 0aimmunogenicity 0aPBMC 0ain vitro1 aShinogle, Heather E.1 aThapa, Prem S.1 aKim, Jae Hyun1 aDeshpande, Meghana1 aJawa, Vibha1 aRussell Middaugh, C.1 aNarhi, Linda O.1 aJoubert, Marisa K.1 aVolkin, David B.0 tJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.g2015 May, v. 104 p.1575-1591dElsevier Inc.x0022-35497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jps.243793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007000170300001600240520119200256592002801448650002501476650002101501650001901522650001601541650001801557650002501575650002201600650002001622650001801642650002001660650001601680650001101696650000701707650001401714650001601728653000701744653000801751653001001759653000801769653001401777653000901791653001001800653000901810653000901819653001101828653000801839653000901847653000801856653000701864653001301871653002401884653002501908653002201933653001501955653002701970700002201997700001902019700002002038700006202058773009802120856008702218852000902305655001202314IND60593040520221120215029.0190318e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059304052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Jingfang10aCharacterization of l-aspartate oxidase from Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 133-142.  aThe flavoprotein l-aspartate oxidase (LASPO) is the first enzyme of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of NAD+ in plants. Although LASPO is considered pivotal to maintain NAD+ homeostasis, it has not been hitherto characterized in plants. Here, the cDNA encoding the LASPO from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (AtLASPO, At5g14760) has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli for subsequent enzyme characterization. The purified AtLASPO enzyme displayed a Km of 0.79 mM for l-aspartate and a kcat of 0.25 s−1. We could further detect an l-aspartate: fumarate oxidoreductase activity of the recombinant plant enzyme. In addition, results indicated that NADP+ but not NAD+, and even more strongly NADH, inhibited AtLASPO at physiological concentrations by competing with the flavin for binding to the apoprotein. LASPO optimal pH and temperature, as well as plastidial pyridine nucleotide concentrations may contribute to an increased NAD+ production in planta. Moreover, in Arabidopsis thaliana AtLASPO gene expression exhibited a clear correlation between LASPO activity and NAD+ levels, thus demonstrating that plant LASPO catalyzes a key metabolic step of NAD+ synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aEscherichia coli 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aapoproteins 3aaspartic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme activity 3aflavoproteins 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3amodels 3apH 3apyridines 3atemperature 0aDE 0aFAD 0aFADH2 0aGST 0aiminoasp. 0aIPTG 0aLASPO 0aNAD+ 0aNADS 0aNaMNAT 0aPeT 0aPMSF 0aQPT 0aQS 0aSDS-PAGE 0al-aspartate oxidase 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aNAD+ biosynthesis 0aRegulation 0aCompetitive inhibition1 aPétriacq, Pierre1 ade Bont, Linda1 aHodges, Michael1 aGakière, Bertrand1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0285-51600 tPlant science.g2018 June, v. 271 p.133-142dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245009900178300001200277520116200289592002801451650002201479650001401501650002401515650002901539650002101568650001501589650001601604650002401620650001201644650000901656650000701665650001901672650001501691650003301706650002101739650001101760653001401771653002101785653003301806653002101839653000901860700002001869700002401889700002601913700003301939700002401972700002701996700002302023773011902046856008802165852000902253655001202262IND60563220120221119095712.0181011e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056322012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.1772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbrosio, Elizangela10aOptimization of photocatalytic degradation of biodiesel using TiO2/H2O2 by experimental design  ap. 1-9.  aThis study reports on the investigation of the photodegradation of biodiesel (B100) in contact with water using TiO2/H2O2. The TiO2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), pH point of zero charge (pHpzc) and textural analysis. The results of the experiments were fitted to a quadratic polynomial model developed using response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the parameters. Using the three factors, three levels, and the Box-Behnken design of experiment technique, 15 sets of experiments were designed considering the effective ranges of the influential parameters. The responses of those parameters were optimized using computational techniques. After 24h of irradiation under an Hg vapor lamp, removal of 22.0% of the oils and greases (OG) and a 33.54% reduction in the total of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) concentration was observed in the aqueous phase, as determined using gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection (GC/FID).

Individual disparities in tumor patterns are compounded by acceleration of cancer onset with successive generations. It has been suggested that this apparent anticipation pattern may result from germ-line genomic instability in TP53 mutation carriers, causing increased DNA copy-number variations (CNVs) with successive generations. To address the genetic basis of phenotypic disparities of LFS/LFL, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 13 subjects from two generations of an LFS kindred. Neither de novo CNV nor significant difference in total CNV was detected in relation with successive generations or with age at cancer onset. These observations were consistent with an experimental mouse model system showing that trp53 deficiency in the germ line of father or mother did not increase CNV occurrence in the offspring. On the other hand, individual records on 1,771 TP53 mutation carriers from 294 pedigrees were compiled to assess genetic anticipation patterns (International Agency for Research on Cancer TP53 database). No strictly defined anticipation pattern was observed. Rather, in multigeneration families, cancer onset was delayed in older compared with recent generations. These observations support an alternative model for apparent anticipation in which rare variants from noncarrier parents may attenuate constitutive resistance to tumorigenesis in the offspring of TP53 mutation carriers with late cancer onset.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3agenome 3amice 3aneoplasms 3aphenotypic variation 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astochastic processes 0aLi–Fraumeni syndrome 0awhole genome sequencing 0agenetic anticipation 0ap53 mutation 0acopy number variation1 aHainaut, Pierre1 aPuzio-Kuter, Anna1 aChoong, Soo Sin1 aChan, Adelyne Sue Li1 aTolkunov, Denis1 aRajagopal, Gunaretnam1 aKang, Wenfeng1 aLim, Leon Li Wen1 aKrishnan, Shekhar1 aChen, Kok-Siong1 aAchatz, Maria Isabel1 aKarsa, Mawar1 aShamsani, Jannah1 aLevine, Arnold J.1 aChan, Chang S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Oct. 28, v. 111, no. 43 p.15497-15501dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14173221113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245020800158300001800366520041700384592002800801650002300829650002300852650002200875653004300897653002200940700001500962773015300977856007701130852000901207655001201216IND60521997820221120235518.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052199782DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1994-12272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreetz, W.14aDie Kristallstruktur des Tetraphenylphosphonium-Monoiodohexahydroc/ oso-Hexaborats [P(C6H5)4][B6H6I] / The Crystal Structure of Tetraphenylphosphonium Monoiodohexahydro-closo-hexaborate [P(C6H5)4][B6H6I]  ap. 1809-1812.  aThe crystal structure of [P(C₆H₅)₄][B₆H₆I] has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis; triclinic, space group P1 with a = 7.5137(9), b = 12.623(2), c = 13.6363(13) Å, α = 87.787(13)°, β = 83.836(13)°, γ = 88.156(10)°.

Here we demonstrate that globular adiponectin (gAcrp) modulates expression of miR-21 and PDCD4 in RAW 264.7 macrophages. These effects were abrogated by inhibitors of ERK1/2, JNK or NF-κB. Conditioned media collected from gAcrp-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages caused similar effects as direct gAcrp treatment, showing the paracrine effect of gAcrp. These data indicate that gAcrp modulates the miR-21/PDCD4 axis through the ERK and JNK/NF-κB pathways in RAW 264.7 macrophages and further suggest that the miR-21/PDCD4 axis may be a novel target mediating adiponectin-induced biological responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aapoptosis 3amacrophages 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphysiological response 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aAdiponectin 0aMicroRNA 0aMacrophage 0aPDCD4 0aParacrine1 aKim, Mi-Jin,1 aNepal, Saroj1 aLee, Eung-Seok1 aKim, Jung-Ae1 aSohn, Dong-Hwan1 aSong, Kyung1 aLee, Sung-Hee,1 aPark, Won Sang1 aJeong, Byeong-Seon1 aPark, Pil-Hoon0 tFEBS letters.g2013 May 21, v. 587, no. 10 p.1556-1561dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03947naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245018500164300001200349520220200361592002802563596005902591596007502650650002702725650002502752650003802777650001302815650001602828650002402844650003502868650001802903650001602921650001202937650000902949650002602958650001402984650002002998650002603018650001203044650001203056650001603068650002703084700001603111700002003127700001303147700001603160700001503176700001403191773010803205856008303313852000903396655001203405IND60777650720221117192523.0221003e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077765072DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-022-05286-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaohui14aThe mucin-like, secretory type-I transmembrane glycoprotein GP900 in the apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum is cleaved in the secretory pathway and likely plays a lubrication role  ap. 170.  aBACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic parasite and member of the phylum Apicomplexa with unique secretory organelles, including a rhoptry, micronemes and dense granules that discharge their contents during parasite invasion. The mucin-like glycoprotein GP900 with a single transmembrane domain is an immunodominant antigen and micronemal protein. It is relocated to the surface of excysted sporozoites and shed to form trails by sporozoites exhibiting gliding motility (gliding sporozoites). However, the biological process underlying its relocation and shedding remains unclear. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether GP900 is present as a transmembrane protein anchored to the plasma membrane on the surface of sporozoites and whether it is cleaved before being shed from the sporozoites. METHODS: Two anti-GP900 antibodies, a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the long N-terminal domain (GP900-N) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) to the short C-terminal domain (GP900-C), were produced for the detection of intact and cleaved GP900 proteins in sporozoites and other parasite developmental stages by microscopic immunofluorescence assay and in discharged molecules by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Both anti-GP900 antibodies recognized the apical region of unexcysted and excysted sporozoites. However, anti-GP900-N (but not anti-GP900-C) also stained both the pellicles/surface of excysted sporozoites and the trails of gliding sporozoites. Both antibodies stained the intracellular meronts, both developing and developed, but not the macro- and microgamonts. Additionally, the epitope was recognized by anti-GP900-N (but not anti-GP900-C) and detected in the secretions of excysted sporozoites and intracellular parasites. CONCLUSIONS: GP900 is present in sporozoites and intracellular meronts, but absent in sexual stages. It is stored in the micronemes of sporozoites, but enters the secretory pathway during excystation and invasion. The short cytoplasmic domain of GP900 is cleaved in the secretory pathway before it reaches the extracellular space. The molecular features and behavior of GP900 imply that it plays mainly a lubrication role.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772731cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0500401cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3aexcystation 3aextracellular space 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglycoproteins 3alubrication 3ameronts 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aparasites 3aplasma membrane 3apolyclonal antibodies 3arabbits 3arhoptry 3asporozoites 3atransmembrane proteins1 aYin, Jigang1 aWang, Dongqiang1 aGao, Xin1 aZhang, Ying1 aWu, Mingbo1 aZhu, Guan0 tParasites & vectors.g2022 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.170-170dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-022-05286-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245009400209300002000303506007600323520163100399592002802030506003702058650000802095650001402103650002502117650001102142650001102153650000902164650002302173650001602196650001902212650002202231650002002253651001702273653001702290653001502307653002802322653001402350653000902364700002102373700001802394700002202412700001802434700002302452773019402475856007902669852000902748655001202757IND60178767620221207101843.0150604e20141028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017876762DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14173701112doi7 aPMC42174562pmcid7 a253130632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEchegoyen, Yolanda10aRecent distribution of lead in the Indian Ocean reflects the impact of regional emissions  ap. 15328-15331.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHumans have injected lead (Pb) massively into the earth surface environment in a temporally and spatially evolving pattern. A significant fraction is transported by the atmosphere into the surface ocean where we can observe its transport by ocean currents and sinking particles. This study of the Indian Ocean documents high Pb concentrations in the northern and tropical surface waters and extremely low Pb levels in the deep water. North of 20°S, dissolved Pb concentrations decrease from 42 to 82 pmol/kg in surface waters to 1.5–3.3 pmol/kg in deep waters. South of 20°S, surface water Pb concentrations decrease from 21 pmol/kg at 31°S to 7 pmol/kg at 62°S. This surface Pb concentration gradient reflects a southward decrease in anthropogenic Pb emissions. The upper waters of the north and central Indian Ocean have high Pb concentrations resulting from recent regional rapid industrialization and a late phase-out of leaded gasoline, and these concentrations are now higher than currently seen in the central North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. The Antarctic sector of the Indian Ocean shows very low concentrations due to limited regional anthropogenic Pb emissions, high scavenging rates, and rapid vertical mixing, but Pb still occurs at higher levels than would have existed centuries ago. Penetration of Pb into the northern and central Indian Ocean thermocline waters is minimized by limited ventilation. Pb concentrations in the deep Indian Ocean are comparable to the other oceans at the same latitude, and deep waters of the central Indian Ocean match the lowest observed oceanic Pb concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aemissions 3aenvironmental health 3afreons 3ahumans 3alead 3amarine environment 3aozonosphere 3apolluted soils 3atracer techniques 3awater pollution 3aIndian Ocean 0aIndian Ocean 0aPb content 0aanthropogenic emissions 0aGEOTRACES 0alead1 aBoyle, Edward A.1 aYi, Chong-mi,1 aGamō, Toshitaka,1 aObata, Hajime1 aNorisuye, Kazuhiro0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Oct. 28, v. 111, no. 43 p.15328-15331dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14173701113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245014100128300001400269520159900283592002801882650002701910650001801937650001401955650001301969650001601982650001801998650002002016650002602036650001102062650001702073650001502090650001202105650001602117650001102133650003102144650002802175650001802203650001402221650001502235650000902250650001002259650001602269650001302285650001502298650001302313653001702326653001602343653001902359653001602378653001402394700001302408773013202421852000902553655001202562IND60706397720221121224544.0200807e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070639772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLal, Roshan10aBioefficacy and Persistence of Insecticides against Blister Beetle, Mylabris pustulata (Thunb.) in Pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.  ap. 57-62.  aBlister beetle, Mylabris pustulata (Thunb.) is a polyphagous pest attacking flowers of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), cotton (Gossypium sp), lady's finger (Abelmoschus esculentus), mungbean (Vigna radiata), urdbean (Vigna mungo), ricebean (Vigna umbellata) etc. throughout the country. Because of its polyphagous feeding nature and hard protective adaptation against insecticides, long term management of this pest with a single molecule is difficult. Therefore, field cum laboratory experiments were carried out for three consecutive cropping seasons during kharif 2008–09, 2009–10 and 2010–11 to find out the persistence and efficacy of different insecticides. It was found that decamethrin 2.8EC was 3334 times toxic with lowest LC₅₀ value (0.0000563) followed by monocrotophos 36SL as compared with endosulfan which was the least toxic with LC₅₀ value (0.1877). Insecticides evaluated for their persistent toxicity during 2009–10 revealed that decamethrin and thiodicarb caused cent per cent mortality of adult blister beetle immediately after spray. At 8ᵗʰ days after spraying, decamethrin caused 60 per cent mortality. Insecticides evaluated for their efficacy during the year 2010–11 revealed that the plants were found free from adult blister beetle population in treatments involving decamethrin and cypermethrin even at ten days after spray. Among all the treatments, spraying of thiodicarb 75WP @ 625 g ha⁻¹ provided the highest grain yield (18.87 q ha⁻¹). Maximum cost-benefit ratio was observed in monocrotophos 36SL, cypermethrin 25EC and decamethrin 2.8EC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aCajanus cajan 3aGossypium 3aMylabris 3aVigna mungo 3aVigna radiata 3aVigna umbellata 3acost benefit analysis 3acotton 3acypermethrin 3aendosulfan 3aflowers 3agrain yield 3aimagos 3alaboratory experimentation 3alethal concentration 50 3amonocrotophos 3amortality 3amung beans 3aokra 3apests 3apigeon peas 3aspraying 3athiodicarb 3atoxicity 0aInsecticides 0abioefficacy 0ablister beetle 0apersistence 0apigeonpea1 aJat, B L0 tPesticide research journal.g2015 June, v. 27, no. 1 p.57-62dSociety of Pesticide Science IndiawJournal:2077x2249-524X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245012100183300001600304520190000320592002802220650002302248650000802271650001902279650002102298650001402319650001302333650000902346650001402355650001102369653001102380653001402391653001302405653001202418653002302430653002302453653002202476700002802498700001602526700002102542700002402563773012302587856008802710852000902798655001202807IND60563220320221119095620.0181011e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056322032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabelin, Carlito Baltazar10aPyrite oxidation in the presence of hematite and alumina: II. Effects on the cathodic and anodic half-cell reactions  ap. 126-135.  aThe oxidative dissolution of pyrite is an important process in the redox recycling of iron (Fe) and is well-known for its role in the formation of acid mine drainage (AMD), which is considered as the most serious and widespread problem after the closure of mines and mineral processing operations. Because this process requires the movement of electrons, common metal oxides in nature that have either semiconducting (e.g., hematite) or insulating (e.g., alumina) properties may have strong effects on it. In this study, changes in the electrochemical behavior of pyrite in the presence of hematite and alumina were investigated. Results showed that the formation of surface-bound species directly influenced the anodic and cathodic half-cell reactions as well as the transfer of electrons between these sites. Pyrite pretreated in the air became anodically more reactive than that pretreated in oxygenated water, but the type of oxidizing media had little effect on the cathodic half-cell reaction. The presence of hematite and alumina during pretreatment also had strong effects on the electrochemical properties of pyrite. Chronoamperometry measurements suggest that hematite and alumina enhanced the anodic half-cell reaction but suppressed the cathodic half-cell reaction of pyrite oxidation. Increased anodic half-cell reaction in the presence of hematite could be attributed to electron “bridging” and catalytic effects of this mineral. In contrast, the effects of alumina on the anodic half-cell reaction were indirect and could be explained by the formation of Fe³⁺-oxyhydroxide surface species during pretreatment. Suppression of the cathodic half-cell reaction by both minerals was attributed to their “protective” effect on cathodic sites. Our results also point to the cathodic half-cell reaction as the rate determining-step of the overall oxidative dissolution process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aair 3aaluminum oxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3ahematite 3airon 3aoxidation 3apyrite 0aPyrite 0aOxidation 0aHematite 0aAlumina 0aAcid mine drainage 0aCyclic voltammetry 0aChronoamperometry1 aVeerawattananun, Suchol1 aIto, Mayumi1 aHiroyoshi, Naoki1 aIgarashi, Toshifumi0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 581-582 p.126-135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245013400182300001600316520142800332592002801760650002301788650001501811650001501826650001201841650001501853651001601868653002201884653002801906653003201934653002101966653002201987700001902009700001702028700002202045700003102067700002202098773011002120856009002230852000902320655001202329IND60593040820221120204100.0190326e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059304082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholte, Samantha S.K.10aMapping recreation as an ecosystem service: Considering scale, interregional differences and the influence of physical attributes  ap. 149-160.  aMethods to map nature-based recreation are increasingly used, especially in ecosystem services research and practice. Researchers that map nature-based recreation beyond local scales, however, have relied much on physical attributes, e.g. land cover and topography. In such instances the recreational potential of land is modeled based on expert judgement and not on public preferences. Participatory mapping data is based on public preferences and as such can be used to improve proxy-based methods to map the recreational potential of land. In this paper, we use data from an online mapping survey (the Hotspotmonitor/Greenmapper) to spatially analyze the recreational potential of land. We employed point pattern analyses to 1) investigate which physical attributes contribute to the recreational potential of land, at both a regional and a national scale, and 2) how preferences for such attributes differ between respondents from distinct geographical regions. We find that interregional differences, whereas prominent at the regional scale, are small at national scale, suggesting there is a shared understanding of what places are ‘hotspots’ for recreation within the Netherlands. These hotspots, however, are difficult to map using physical attributes alone. Discussing these discrepancies, our paper provides insights that contribute to a better understanding and mapping of the recreational potential of land.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aland cover 3arecreation 3asurveys 3atopography 3aNetherlands 0aParticipatory GIS 0aNature-based recreation 0aCultural ecosystem services 0aSpatial analysis 0aLand use planning1 aDaams, Michiel1 aFarjon, Hans1 aSijtsma, Frans J.1 avan Teeffelen, Astrid J.A.1 aVerburg, Peter H.0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2018 July, v. 175 p.149-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245016300155300002000318520155200338592002801890650001101918650005601929650002301985650002602008650002202034650001402056650001302070650001602083650001502099700002002114700002302134700002002157700001802177700002502195700002402220773011302244856007502357852000902432655001202441IND60529535920170412000000.0160717e20131105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052953592DNAL7 a10.1021/ac402002m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaun, Jakob10aOnline and Splitless NanoLC × CapillaryLC with Quadrupole/Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometric Detection for Comprehensive Screening Analysis of Complex Samples  ap. 10083-10090.  aA novel multidimensional separation system based on online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography and hybrid high-resolution mass spectrometry has been developed for the qualitative screening analysis and characterization of complex samples. The core of the system is a consistently miniaturized two-dimensional liquid chromatography that makes the rapid second dimension compatible with mass spectrometry without the need for any flow split. Elevated temperature, ultrahigh pressure, and a superficially porous sub-3-μm stationary phase provide a fast second dimension separation and a sufficient sampling frequency without a first dimension flow stop. A highly loadable porous graphitic carbon stationary phase is employed in the first dimension to implement large volume injections that help countervailing dilution caused by the sampling process between the two dimensions. Exemplarily, separations of a 99-component standard mixture and a complex wastewater sample were used to demonstrate the performance of the dual-gradient system. In the second dimension, 30 s gradients at a cycle time of 1 min were employed. One multidimensional separation took 80–90 min (∼120 min including extended hold and re-equilibration in the first dimension). This approach represents a cost-efficient alternative to online LC × LC strategies working with conventionally sized columns in the rapid second dimension, as solvent consumption is drastically decreased and analytes still are detectable at environmentally relevant concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acomprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography 3acost effectiveness 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ascreening 3asolvents 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aLeonhardt, Juri1 aPortner, Christoph1 aHetzel, Terence1 aTuerk, Jochen1 aTeutenberg, Thorsten1 aSchmidt, Torsten C.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Nov. 05, v. 85, no. 21 p.10083-10090dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac402002m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245007900209300001800288500001500306520179400321592002802115650001702143650002502160650001502185650001502200650001402215650001002229650001202239650003002251650002502281650002202306650002002328650002302348650002502371650001702396650002002413650001002433650001402443650001902457650001602476650001702492650001502509650001002524653001702534700001902551700002202570773012002592856008102712852000902793655001202802IND60619502520221122045952.0181102e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061950252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-017-0113-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortimer, Róisín1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3161-433410aSupporting and regulating ecosystem services in cacao agroforestry systems  ap. 1639-1657.  a2019-12-06  aCacao agroforestry systems (CAFS) can provide supporting services such as optimum light conditions for cacao growth, water and nutrient cycling and regulating services such as pest and disease control and climate regulation. This review considers recent literature on the manifestation of these services in CAFS around the world to provide an overview of scientific knowledge. Crown structures of associated trees can facilitate optimum light conditions for cacao growth, and provide water through vertical root segregation. Leaf litter fall and roots from associated species contribute to nutrient cycling. Both nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing species can provide nutrients to the cacao plant, though competition from certain species may limit phosphorus and potassium uptake. Pest and disease regulating services can arise through careful shade management to create a microclimate which reduces susceptibility of cacao to fungal diseases and sun-loving pests. All CAFS store carbon to varying degrees; those resembling original forest much more than simple two-species systems from which shade trees are removed after maturity of the cacao stand. CAFS also promotes biodiversity conservation depending on structure, management, and landscape arrangement, though not to the extent of natural forests. Research opportunities to increase provision of these services include optimal spatial arrangement for nutrient cycling and functional diversity as well as landscape connectivity for biodiversity conservation. Trade-offs between carbon storage, biodiversity, cacao yield and socio-economic resilience are presented, indicating that optimization of ecosystem services in CAFS requires consideration of interactions between all services, including socio-cultural and economic ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3acarbon sequestration 3acrop yield 3aphosphorus 3anutrients 3aroots 3aforests 3abiodiversity conservation 3afunctional diversity 3anitrogen fixation 3aTheobroma cacao 3aecosystem services 3ahabitat connectivity 3amicroclimate 3adisease control 3apests 3apotassium 3asocioeconomics 3ashade trees 3aplant litter 3alandscapes 3afungi 0abiodiversity1 aSaj, Stéphane1 aDavid, Christophe0 tAgroforestry systems.g2018 Dec., v. 92, no. 6 p.1639-1657dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34245x0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-017-0113-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245009500182520174400277592002802021650002502049650002502074650001702099650001602116650001102132650001102143650001302154650001902167650002502186650002102211650002002232650002202252650001302274650001602287650000902303650002702312650001502339650003202354650002302386650001702409650002502426650001302451653002502464653001502489653001602504653001302520653003202533653001502565653002502580700002302605700002602628700001902654773009802673856008802771852000902859655001202868IND60708094520221121052231.0220314e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070809452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1124862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizadeh-Moghaddam, Giti10aBio-genetic analysis of resistance in tomato to early blight disease, Alternaria alternata  aEarly blight disease (EB), Alternaria alternata, is destructive on Solanum lycopersicum Mill. The responses of 35 domestic and exotic commercial tomato genotypes to early blight were examined at transplanting and maturing stages using genetic diversity analysis, with 15 Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) primers, total phenolic content (TPC), and enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assays. The disease severity ranged from 18 to 87.5%. Eleven of 15 ISSR primers generated 68 loci of which 63 (90%) were polymorphic. Polymorphism information content value varied from 0.3 to 0.5 with an average of 0.4. Nei's measure of the average gene diversity ranged from 0.06 to 0.5. The Tomato genotypes were divided into five clusters in Un-weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) analysis, showing a considerable similarity between resistance level and molecular classification pattern. Antioxidant analysis indicated a significant increase in TPC and CAT, POD, PAL and SOD activities in most inoculated tomato genotypes at both growth stages. The highest increase in activity was seen in PAL (5-fold) and TPC (4-fold) at transplanting stage, whereas the highest TPC (2 to 3-fold) and POD activity (3-fold) were found at maturing stage in all the inoculated resistant genotypes in comparison with controls. Esfahan Local and H. a.s 2274 showed the highest level of activity in POD (2.5- and 3- fold, respectively) and TPC (2.5- and 4-fold, respectively). Our results suggest that using both genetic diversity and enzymatic diversity as markers, it is possible to discriminate resistant from susceptible tomato genotypes to early blight disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aantioxidants 3aarithmetics 3aassays 3ablight 3acatalase 3aclassification 3adevelopmental stages 3adisease severity 3aenzyme activity 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ainformation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aplant biochemistry 3apolymorphism 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atomatoes 0aSolanum lycopersicum 0aSolanaceae 0aISSR marker 0aCatalase 0aPhenylalanine ammonia lyase 0aPeroxidase 0aSuperoxide dismutase1 aRezayatmand, Zahra1 aEsfahani, Mehdi Nasr-1 aKhozaei, Mahdi0 tPhytochemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 179 p.112486-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1124863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010600168300001800274520123100292592002801523650001801551650001101569650001801580650001401598650002001612650001401632650002501646650001001671650001601681650001601697650001801713650001501731650002601746650001401772650000801786651001001794653002601804653001701830653002301847653002201870653001601892653001501908700002801923700002201951700001701973700002601990773011502016856008602131852000902217655001202226IND60613700420221118224947.0201216e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061370042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoya, Isabel10aEnvironmental impacts of the cultivation-phase associated with agricultural crops for feed production  ap. 3721-3733.  aLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was used to estimate the environmental impacts and identify the most critical stages (hotspots) of cultivation of three cereal crops typically used for animal feed purposes – barley, rye and sorghum – in the Lombardy region, the most productive crop and livestock area in Northern Italy. The crop variety (out of 3 and 4 varieties of barley and rye, respectively) and cultivation regime (single vs. double cropping of sorghum) with the lowest impacts per kg of crude protein (mass-based functional unit) were identified. Environmental impact categories reported by ReCiPe method were used. According to the results, both Reni and Dank Nowe were the varieties with the lowest environmental impacts for barley and rye varieties, respectively; single cropping of sorghum had lower impacts than double cropping. Impact hotspots included field emissions, agricultural activities and agrochemical (fertilisers and herbicides) production regardless the cropping system considered. Moreover, among the cereals studies, rye was identified as the best environmental alternative. Use of land-based and economic functional units did not change the ranking of systems according to their impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3abarley 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3adouble cropping 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3afeeds 3afertilizers 3agrain crops 3agrain sorghum 3aherbicides 3alife cycle assessment 3alivestock 3arye 3aItaly 0aLife cycle assessment 0aSorghum spp. 0aHordeum vulgare L. 0aSecale cereale L. 0aAnimal feed 0aPig slurry1 aGonzález-García, Sara1 aBacenetti, Jacopo1 aFiala, Marco1 aMoreira, Maria Teresa0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 172 p.3721-3733dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245051100157300001600668520113400684592002801818650001101846650001401857650002701871650001301898650004401911650001501955650002001970650001801990653007502008653005302083653001602136653001702152700002102169700002502190773015002215856007702365852000902442655001202451IND60521998220221121021820.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052199822DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1994-02022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeda, Ion10aZur Chemie der 1,3,5-Triaza-2-phosphorinan-4,6-dione.

As an alternative, a procedure using double carbon substrate was examined (11.7gcₐᵣbₒn(l⁻¹), 60%/40% carbon from glucose/methanol). The effects on methanol metabolism, extracellular formation of porcine trypsinogen, biomass growth and cell viability were analyzed. In contrast to batch cultures, where the glucose and methanol were utilized sequentially, in carbon/energy-limited continuous cultures (operated between dilution rates 0.03 and 0.20h⁻¹) the repressive effect of glucose on methanol utilization was eliminated up to 0.15h⁻¹ (ca. 130% of μ(mₐₓ) with methanol). With the mixture, the yield of biomass (1.54±0.12) g(CDW)g(⁻¹)cₐᵣbₒn was found to be 1.4 times larger than the yield with methanol alone. Despite the current widespread view that glucose has a repressive effect on the AOX1 promoter, the product was synthesized over the entire range of dilution rates, with maximum productivities of (0.70±0.12)mg (g-1)(CDW)(h⁻¹) at 0.07(h⁻¹). Thus, glucose was shown to be a feasible partial substitute for methanol in recombinant protein production by P. pastoris Mut⁺ strain while enhancing process productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametabolism 3aenergy 3acell growth 3aKomagataella pastoris 3acell viability 3aglucose 3amethanol 3arecombinant proteins 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3abiomass 3atrypsinogen 3aswine 0aPichia pastoris1 aHyka, Petr1 aBranská, Barbora1 aMelzoch, Karel1 aKovar, Karin0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2012 Jan., v. 157, no. 1 p.180-188dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245014200180300001800322520152500340592002801865650001601893650002201909650001501931650002301946650002201969650002501991650001302016650002502029653001002054653001202064653002402076653001302100653002302113700002902136700002902165700002902194700002302223700002202246773011502268856008602383852000902469655001202478IND60613700520221118225124.0201216e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061370052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlemán-Nava, Gibrán S.10aBiotechnological revalorization of Tequila waste and by-product streams for cleaner production – A review from bio-refinery perspective  ap. 3713-3720.  aIn this paper, industrial processing and biotechnological revalorization of Tequila waste and by-product streams have been reviewed. Tequila production process generates different kind of waste and by-products with a huge potential to produce value-added products. Therefore, many research projects, scientific investigations and innovative utilizations of such waste and by-product streams have been the object of recent studies. Moreover, the bio-based transformation from a petrochemical-based economy to a bio-based economy necessitates the novel exploitation of cost-effective natural materials for both future biorefinery development and a range of value-added products of interests. The present review article focuses on an area not comprehensively reviewed previously, the potential of utilizing waste and by-product streams from current Tequila industry activities. The first part of this review focused on various processing aspects and prospects on the fermentative production of Tequila. In the second and third parts, statistical and sustainable aspects and the generation of waste and by-product streams of Tequila industry are critically reviewed, respectively. In the fourth part, various industrial and biotechnological applications of Tequila’s wastes are comprehensively discussed from a bio-refinery perspective. In conclusion, it is evident that biotransformation of waste and by-product streams has great potential and significant prospects for wider industrial and biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3abyproducts 3acost effectiveness 3adistilled spirits 3adistillery effluents 3aindustry 3avalue-added products 0aAgave 0aBagasse 0aGreen biotechnology 0aVinasses 0aWaste valorization1 aGatti, Ilaria Alessandra1 aParra Saldivar, Roberto,1 aDallemand, Jean-Francois1 aRittmann, Bruce E.1 aIqbal, Hafiz M.N.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 172 p.3713-3720dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010600159300002000265520109700285592002801382650001501410650002001425650002601445650001901471650001801490650002201508650001201530700001901542700002001561700001901581700001901600700002801619700002201647773011301669856007501782852000901857655001201866IND60529536020221120231102.0160717e20131105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052953602DNAL7 a10.1021/ac402018e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerber, Florian10aMultiorder Correction Algorithms to Remove Image Distortions from Mass Spectrometry Imaging Data Sets  ap. 10249-10254.  aTime-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging is a rapidly evolving technology. Its main application is the study of the distribution of small molecules on biological tissues. The sequential image acquisition process remains susceptible to measurement distortions that can render imaging data less analytically useful. Most of these artifacts show a repetitive nature from tile to tile. Here we statistically describe these distortions and derive two different algorithms to correct them. Both a generalized linear model approach and the linear discriminant analysis approach are able to increase image quality for negative and positive ion mode data sets. Additionally, performing simulation studies with repetitive and nonrepetitive tiling error we show that both algorithms are only removing repetitive distortions. It is further shown that the spectral component of the data set is not altered by the use of these correction methods. Both algorithms presented in this work greatly increase the image quality and improve the analytical usefulness of distorted images dramatically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3aimage analysis 3alinear models 3amass spectrometry 3atissues1 aMarty, Florian1 aEijkel, Gert B.1 aBasler, Konrad1 aBrunner, Erich1 aFurrer, R.q(Reinhard),1 aHeeren, Ron M.

Cryosol warming and permafrost degradation may enhance the CO2 release to the atmosphere through the microbial decomposition. Despite the large carbon pool, the permafrost carbon feedback on the climate remains uncertain. In this study, we aimed at better understanding the diurnal evolution of the temperature sensitivity of CO2 efflux in Cryosols. A Histic Cryosol and a Turbic Cryosol were instrumented in tussock tundra ecosystems near Salluit (Nunavik, Canada). Open top chambers were installed during summer 2011 and the ground temperature, the soil moisture and meteorological variables were recorded hourly while the ecosystem respiration was measured three times per day every second day with opaque and closed dynamic chambers in control and warm stations. Despite warmer conditions, the average CO2 efflux at the control stations at the Histic site (1.29±0.45μmolCO2m⁻²s⁻¹) was lower than at the Turbic site (2.30±0.74μmolCO2m⁻²s⁻¹). The increase in CO2 efflux with warming was greater in the Histic Cryosol (~39%) than in the Turbic Cryosol (~16%). Our study showed that the temperature sensitivity of the ecosystem respiration evolved during the day and decreased with the experimental warming. Both sites exhibited diurnal hysteresis loops between CO2 efflux and the soil surface temperature. The width of hysteresis loops increased with the solar radiation and decreased along the growing season. We developed simple linear models that took into account the diurnal evolution of the temperature sensitivity of CO2 efflux and we estimated the seasonal cumulative carbon release to the atmosphere. The calculation using solely diurnal measurements significantly differed from the seasonal carbon release modelled hourly. Our study highlighted that the time of the day when measurements are performed should be taken into account to accurately estimate the seasonal carbon release from tundra ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryosols 3acarbon dioxide 3alinear models 3apermafrost 3asoil organic carbon 3asolar radiation 3atundra 3acarbon sinks 3agrowing season 3ahysteresis 3abiodegradation 3asoil water 3aecosystems 3aecosystem respiration 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3aCanada 0acarbon 0aArctic tundra 0aTurbic Cryosol 0aHistic Cryosol 0aPermafrost carbon feedback 0aQ10 0aDiurnal hysteresis loops1 aKeller, Catherine1 aAllard, Michel1 aAmbrosi, Jean-Paul,0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 581-582 p.161-173dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245024800157300001600405520093300421592002801354650001101382650002601393650001301419650001301432650004401445650001501489653006701504653002401571653002401595653004201619700002101661700002501682773015001707856007701857852000901934655001201943IND60521998320221120044127.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052199832DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1994-02032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeda, Ion10aUmsetzungen von 2-chlor- und 2-organoaminosubstituierten 5.6-Benzo-1,3-dimethyl-1,3,2-diazaphosphorinan-4-onen mit Aziden / Reactions of 2-Chloro- and 2-Organoamino-Substituted 5.6-Benzo-1,3-dimethyl-1,3,2-diazaphosphorinane-4-ones with Azides  ap. 171-175.  aThe reaction of 5,6-benzo-2-chloro-1,3-dimethyl-1,3,2-diazaphosphorinane-4-one (1) with trimethylsilyl azide led to the substituted cyclotriphosphazene (3).

The main challenge in producing practical devices is to obtain polymers with mechanical stability, eco-friendliness, and self-healing properties. Herein, we introduce urea bonds and 2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone (UPy) to synthesize tailored waterborne polyurethanes (WPU-UPy-x) with a hierarchical hydrogen bond (H-bond). Accordingly, sound tensile performance (strength: 53.33 MPa, toughness: 128.97 MJ m–³), satisfying deformation recovery, and good self-healing capability of the WPU-UPy-x film are demonstrated. With atomic force microscope characterization, we find that UPy groups contribute to the highly improved microphase separation of WPU-UPy-x, responsible for good mechanical properties. As a proof of concept, a strain sensor is successfully configured, thanks to the good interfacial interactions between the polyurethane matrix and the Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene conductive filler, which features sensitive and stable performance for monitoring diverse human and mechanical motions. Intriguingly, this sensor is capable of self-healing after cutting and displays well-retained sensitivity to detect the stretched signal. The as-proposed design concept for healable and sensitive strain sensors can shed light on future wearable electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiomimetics 3adeformation 3aelectronics 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3apolyurethanes 3aurea 0abiomimetic 0awaterborne polyurethane 0asupramolecular 0astrain sensor 0aTi3C2Tx MXene1 aGuo, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1378-00481 aWang, Wenyan1 aGuo, Zijian1 aYao, Laifeng1 aXue, Ying1 aLiu, Qing1 aZhang, Qiuyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4823-50310 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Jan. 21, v. 14, no. 4 p.6016-6027dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c219873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245010700207300002000314506007600334520173800410592002802148506003702176650001502213650001602228650001902244650001702263650001702280650001702297650001302314650002002327650002102347650001402368650002902382653004502411653001802456653001702474653003502491653001002526700002302536700003102559700002202590700001802612700001902630700002202649700001902671700002302690773019402713856007902907852000902986655001202995IND60178768020221207101832.0150604e20141028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017876802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14183421112doi7 aPMC42174632pmcid7 a253130672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibata, Shigeru10aAngiotensin II signaling via protein kinase C phosphorylates Kelch-like 3, preventing WNK4 degradation  ap. 15556-15561.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHypertension contributes to the global burden of cardiovascular disease. Increased dietary K ⁺ reduces blood pressure; however, the mechanism has been obscure. Human genetic studies have suggested that the mechanism is an obligatory inverse relationship between renal salt reabsorption and K ⁺ secretion. Mutations in the kinases with-no-lysine 4 (WNK4) or WNK1, or in either Cullin 3 (CUL3) or Kelch-like 3 (KLHL3)—components of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets WNKs for degradation—cause constitutively increased renal salt reabsorption and impaired K ⁺ secretion, resulting in hypertension and hyperkalemia. The normal mechanisms that regulate the activity of this ubiquitin ligase and levels of WNKs have been unknown. We posited that missense mutations in KLHL3 that impair binding of WNK4 might represent a phenocopy of the normal physiologic response to volume depletion in which salt reabsorption is maximized. We show that KLHL3 is phosphorylated at serine 433 in the Kelch domain (a site frequently mutated in hypertension with hyperkalemia) by protein kinase C in cultured cells and that this phosphorylation prevents WNK4 binding and degradation. This phosphorylation can be induced by angiotensin II (AII) signaling. Consistent with these in vitro observations, AII administration to mice, even in the absence of volume depletion, induces renal KLHL3 S⁴³³ phosphorylation and increased levels of both WNK4 and the NaCl cotransporter. Thus, AII, which is selectively induced in volume depletion, provides the signal that prevents CUL3/KLHL3-mediated degradation of WNK4, directing the kidney to maximize renal salt reabsorption while inhibiting K ⁺ secretion in the setting of volume depletion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aaldosterone 3aangiotensin II 3aelectrolytes 3ahyperkalemia 3ahypertension 3amutation 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinase C 3asecretion 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 0arenin–angiotensin–aldosterone system 0adistal tubule 0ahypertension 0aposttranslational modification 0aPHAII1 aArroyo, Juan Pablo1 aCastaíñeda-Bueno, María1 aPuthumana, Jeremy1 aZhang, Junhui1 aUchida, Shunya1 aStone, Kathryn L.1 aLam, TuKiet T.1 aLifton, Richard P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Oct. 28, v. 111, no. 43 p.15556-15561dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14183421113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245012400199300001800323520149000341592002801831650001601859650001201875650001701887650001901904650001201923650001301935650001801948650001401966653002701980653002002007653002702027653003602054700001202090700001902102700005602121700005902177700005902236773013902295856007902434852000902513655001202522IND60765746720220314000000.0220202e20220121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076574672DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c219962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5150-821310aLeverage of Pyridine Isomer on Phenothiazine Core: Organic Semiconductors as Selective Layers in Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 5729-5739.  aTo drive the development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), hole-transporting materials are imperative. In this context, pyridine derivatives are being probed as small molecules-based hole-transporting materials due to their Lewis base and electron-deficient unit. Herein, we focused our investigation on pyridine isomer molecules 4,4′-(10-(pyridin-x-yl)-10H-phenothiazine-3,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (x = 2, 3, or 4), in which the pyridine nitrogen heteroatom is located at the 2, 3, and 4 positions, named as 2PyPTPDAn, 3PyPTPDAn, and 4PyPTPDAn, respectively. We decipher the structure–properties–device performance relationship impacted by the different N-atom positions in pyridine. In the case of 3PyPTPDAn, the partial orbital overlap between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) favors the generation of neutral excitons and hole transport, as well as improves the film-formation ability, and this induces efficient hole extraction as compared to their 2,4 analogues. The solar cells fabricated with 3PyPTPDAn gave on-par photovoltaic performance as that of typical Spiro-OMeTAD, and higher performance than those of 2PyPTPDAn and 4PyPTPDAn. The hydrophobicity and homogeneous film properties of 3PyPTPDAn add merits to the stability. This work emphasizes the guidelines to develop small molecules for organic solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aaniline 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3aisomers 3anitrogen 3aphenothiazine 3apyridines 0aorganic semiconductors 0apyridine isomer 0aperovskite solar cells 0aelectron paramagnetic resonance1 aManju, 1 aKazim, Samrana1 aLezama, Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6183-20521 aMisra, Rajneesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3225-21251 aAhmad, Shahzada1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1218-25560 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Jan. 21, v. 14, no. 4 p.5729-5739dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c219963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245018200171300001800353520135800371592002801729596006701757596009801824596009801922650002002020650002502040650002402065650001802089650001702107650001502124650001102139650001702150650002302167650001902190650002302209650002202232650002202254650001802276650001002294650001302304650002302317650003302340650001502373650004402388700001802432700001502450700001702465700005302482773013202535856008302667852000902750655001202759IND60777651320221117185804.0220518e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077765132DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-021-05250-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtwill, Yurong Y.,10aQuality improvement of sweet rice wine fermented with Rhizopus delemar on key aroma compounds content, phenolic composition, and antioxidant capacity compared to Rhizopus oryzae  ap. 2339-2350.  aThe pure culture fermentation has led to less flavorful rice wine and relatively lower bioactive substance level compared to traditional mixed culture fermentation; however, a pure strain is easily controlled by industrialized producers. The purpose of the present research was to screen a species of Rhizopus for improving the flavor deficiency and antioxidant function of sweet rice wine. Seven rice wine samples fermented with isolated strains were analyzed for their total phenolics, total flavonoids, peptide and antioxidant activity using spectrophotometry, as well as ethanol, ethyl acetate, β-phenethyl alcohol, and volatile alcohol contents measured by headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC), the further principal component analysis determined Rhizopus delemar rice wine better on aroma and antioxidant capacity. A comparison of phenolics profile between R. delemar and R. oryzae rice wines was made based on the measurement data of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QE-MS) data. Thirty-two phenolics were identified in sweet rice wine. Overall, the results presented in this study showed that a strain of R. delemar is available for the improvement of flavor and antioxidant activity in sweet rice wine, which has the great potential to be applied to industrialized products.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020SK2140chunan provincial science and technology department  a2019430102003061cthe technology development project of jiangxi lidu liquor industry co. ltd.  a2020430102002535cthe technology development project of jiangxi lidu liquor industry co. ltd. 3aRhizopus oryzae 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3aethyl acetate 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3aflavor 3afood science 3agas chromatography 3aglutinous rice 3aheadspace analysis 3aindustrialization 3amass spectrometry 3amixed culture 3aodors 3apeptides 3aphenolic compounds 3aprincipal component analysis 3arice wines 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aZhong, Haiyan1 aYang, Ning1 aXu, Shuaizhe1 aYang, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8103-11530 tJournal of food science and technology.g2022 June, v. 59, no. 6 p.2339-2350dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-021-05250-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245012500128300001600253520165400269592002801923650001801951650002401969650001701993650002602010650001402036650001702050650001502067650001502082650001402097650001602111650001602127650001102143650001202154650002802166650001802194650001102212650001602223650000902239650001502248650000802263650001302271650001502284651001002299653001702309653001602326653001402342700001302356773013402369852000902503655001202512IND60706398320221121232536.0200807e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070639832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLal, Roshan10aBioefficacy of Insecticides against Tur Pod Bug, Clavigralla gibbosa (Spinola) on Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.)

Nymphs and adults of tur pod bug, Clavigralla gibbosa (Spinola) suck the cell sap from the pods and cause loss of the grain. Because of its high fecundity and wide host adaptability, it is necessary to check its damage potential. For this purpose, an experiment on bioefficacy of insecticides against this insect was conducted in the laboratory-cum-field conditions on cultivar “Paras” during kharif season 2010–11, 2011–12 and 2012–13. Eight insecticides viz., endosulfan 35EC, monocrotophos 36SL, chlorpyriphos 20EC, quinalphos 25EC, triazophos 40EC, decamethrin 2.8EC, fenvalerate 20EC and cypermethrin 25EC were selected based on their LC₅₀ values against this insect. Among the tested insecticides, cypermethrin proved most toxic (63.94 times) against adults of C.gibbosa followed by decamethrin. Quick knock down effect of decamethrin and fenvalerate was recorded in the field conditions. Therefore, the combinations of decamethrin and quinalphos with DDVP (76 EC) were also tested under field conditions. Cypermethrin, decamethrin plus DDVP, decamethrin and monocrotophos were found effective in managing the C.gibbosa population upto 10 days after application. None of the insecticides could manage the bug population below ETL after 14 days of their application. Application of cypermethrin @ 188 mL ha⁻¹ recorded the highest grain yield, highest net monetary returns and highest incremental cost benefit ratio, followed by decamethrin, fenvalerate and monocrotophos. Either of dimethoate or oxydemeton methyl could also manage the bug population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3aClavigralla gibbosa 3achlorpyrifos 3acost benefit analysis 3acultivars 3acypermethrin 3adimethoate 3aendosulfan 3afecundity 3afenvalerate 3agrain yield 3aimagos 3ainsects 3alethal concentration 50 3amonocrotophos 3anymphs 3apigeon peas 3apods 3aquinalphos 3asap 3atoxicity 3atriazophos 3aIndia 0aInsecticides 0abioefficacy 0apigeonpea1 aJat, B L0 tPesticide research journal.g2015 June, v. 27, no. 1 p.104-110dSociety of Pesticide Science IndiawJournal:2077x2249-524X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006800171506010400239506007600343520090800419592002801327506003701355650001901392650002201411650002501433650000901458650001301467650001701480650001801497650001801515651001201533651001101545651002301556653002201579653002901601653001401630700002001644700003401664700002401698700002101722773011301743856008501856852000901941655001201950IND60777239720221207104255.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077723972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fawpar.2022.e001622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, Eskild10aCongenital toxoplasmosis: Should we still care about screening?  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrenatal systematic screening for congenital toxoplasmosis has been performed in Austria and France since 1975 and neonatal screening for congenital toxoplasmosis has been part of the New England Newborn screening program since 1986. In this narrative review we review the data leading up to the systematic screening programs in Austria and France, highlighting the main finding of the European Union funded research in the 1990s and early 2000s. Different descriptive studies of the effect of pre- or postnatal treatment are discussed. Toxoplasma gondii has different genetic lineages with different pathogenicity in humans. This means that results in areas with a low pathogenic lineage cannot be extrapolated to an area with highly pathogenic lineages. The importance of meat as a source of infection is discussed in the light of an increased prevalence of T.gondii in organic livestock production .  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuropean Union 3aToxoplasma gondii 3alivestock production 3ameat 3aneonates 3aparasitology 3apathogenicity 3atoxoplasmosis 3aAustria 3aFrance 3aNew England region 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aCongenital toxoplasmosis 0aScreening1 aMeroni, Valeria1 aVasconcelos-Santos, Daniel V.1 aMandelbrot, Laurent1 aPeyron, Francois0 tFood and Waterborne Parasitology.g2022 June, v. 27 p.e00162-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23307x2405-67667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fawpar.2022.e001623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001000139245015600149300001600305520102000321592002801341650001901369650001901388650000901407650002701416650002001443650002501463650003401488650001801522650004301540650001701583700001201600700001501612700001101627700001401638700001201652773012201664856007301786852000901859655001201868IND60081528320221118051636.0140912e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008152832DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.123752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, H10aImpact of Food Restriction on Ovarian Development, RFamide‐Related Peptide‐3 and the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Ovarian Axis in Pre‐Pubertal Ewes  ap. 831-838.  aRFamide‐related peptide‐3 (RFRP‐3), the mammalian ortholog of gonadotropin‐inhibiting hormone, has been implicated as a mediator between reproduction and energy balance. This study aimed to investigate the physiological effects of RFRP‐3 on the process of ovarian development in food‐restricted pre‐pubertal ewes. The results showed that food restriction significantly inhibited the ovarian development and follicular growth. The data of qPCR in the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian (HPO) axis showed that food restriction not only upregulated RFRP‐3 mRNA expression but also downregulated the mRNA expression of gonadotropin‐releasing‐hormone receptor, follicle‐stimulating hormone receptor and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR). Immunohistochemistry of RFRP‐3 in the ovaries suggested that RFRP‐3 may regulate the follicular development. These results suggested that the changes of RFRP‐3 in response to food restriction might influence the HPO axis and inhibit ovarian development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3aenergy balance 3aewes 3afollicular development 3agene expression 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aluteinizing hormone receptors 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areproduction1 aSong, H1 aHuang, M.,1 aNie, H1 aWang, Z.,1 aWang, F0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Oct., v. 49, no. 5 p.831-838dP.

The GI of products ranged from 47 to 53 than control white bread (GI = 95). Total phenolic (20.1 ± 1 mg gallic acid/g dry wt.) and flavonoids (15.2 ± 1 mg quercetin/g dry wt.) were higher in wheat + barley than barley (17.2 ± 1; 13.6 ± 2) and wheat (16.9 ± 1; 14.9 ± 2) products. The in vitro α-amylase (4–10%), α-glucosidase (5–17%) and DPP-IV (3–26%) inhibition (IC₅₀) of methanol extracts were higher than the aqueous extracts. The fasting blood glucose (50.85, 33.22 and 24.52%) and oral glucose tolerance (AUC = 32.1, 36.04, and 27.73%) was lower in barley, wheat, and wheat + barley fed diabetic groups than diabetic control group (1571.5 ± 13.5 mg/dL/120 min).

Here, a transposon mutant library of a Burkholderia lata isolate from a pig with swine respiratory disease in Korea was screened for strains showing attenuated virulence in Caenorhabditis elegans. One such mutant was obtained, and the Tn5 insertion junction was mapped to rpfR, a gene encoding a cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase that functions as a receptor. Mutation of rpfR caused a reduction in growth on CPG agar and swimming motility as well as a rough colony morphology on Congo red agar. TLC analysis showed reduced AHL secretion, which was in agreement with the results from plate-based and bioluminescence assays. The mutant strain produced significantly more biofilm detected by crystal violet staining than the parent strain. SEM of the mutant strain clearly showed that the overproduced biofilm contained a filamentous structure. These results suggest that the cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase RpfR plays an important role in quorum sensing modulation of the bacterial virulence and biofilm formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aagar 3abacterial motility 3abiofilm 3abioluminescence 3agenes 3agentian violet 3ahumans 3amutants 3amutation 3aphosphoric diester hydrolases 3aplants (botany) 3aquorum sensing 3arespiratory tract diseases 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asecretion 3astaining 3aswine 3atransposons 3avirulence 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKim, Yun Jung,1 aLee, Y.

Oak chips favoured polymerization reactions (SPP, LPP, I HCₗ, polymeric phenols, and polymeric pigments, respectively +28, +67, +44, +60, and +73 % in comparison with the untreated wines, 12 months after racking). The polymerization reactions increased colour stability (colour intensity, and % of red and blue colour of the oak-treated wines were +11, +2, and +10 % compared to the control). At the end of ageing, the oak-treated wines had the highest concentrations of alcohols, carbonyl compounds, and lactones, while the highest contents of acids and esters were detected in the micro-oxygenated wines. The sensory profile of the oak-treated wines was characterized by the attenuation of floral, fruity, and vinous attributes. Concerning the phenolic profile, micro-oxygenated wines showed the highest concentrations of anthocyanins (+23 % respect to the untreated samples and +306 % respect to the oak-treated ones) and of flavan-3-ols (+24 % respect to the untreated samples and +95 % respect to the oak-treated ones).

Therefore, here we investigated whether the homologous protein of Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan responsible for human amoebiasis, might be considered as a biochemical target for parasite control. Trophozoites were cultured with bacterial double-stranded RNA molecules targeting the EhCFIm25 gene, and inhibition of mRNA and protein expression was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot assays, respectively. EhCFIm25 silencing was associated with a significant acceleration of cell proliferation and cell death. Moreover, trophozoites appeared as larger and multinucleated cells. These morphological changes were accompanied by a reduced mobility, and erythrophagocytosis was significantly diminished. Lastly, the knockdown of EhCFIm25 affected the poly(A) site selection in two reporter genes and revealed that EhCFIm25 stimulates the utilization of downstream poly(A) sites in E. histolytica mRNA. Overall, our data confirm that targeting the polyadenylation process represents an interesting strategy for controlling parasites, including E. histolytica. To our best knowledge, the present study is the first to have revealed the relevance of the cleavage factor CFIm25 as a biochemical target in parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aWestern blotting 3aamebiasis 3acell death 3acell proliferation 3adouble-stranded RNA 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3aparasites 3aprotein synthesis 3areporter genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atrophozoites1 aGuillén, Nancy1 aLópez-Camarillo, César,1 aSoto-Sanchez, Jacqueline1 aRamirez-Moreno, Esther1 aGarcia-Vazquez, Raul1 aCastañon-Sanchez, Carlos A.1 aBetanzos, Abigail1 aMarchat, Laurence A.0 tjournal of microbiology.g2017 Oct., v. 55, no. 10 p.783-791dThe Microbiological Society of Koreax1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-017-7259-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011400169300001600283500001900299520148200318592002801800650001601828650002601844650001601870650002001886650003101906650001201937650001001949650001201959650001701971650001801988650003002006650001302036650001502049650000902064650002002073650001902093650001102112650001302123653004102136653001902177653002802196700001702224700001802241700001702259700001602276700001502292700001402307773013502321856008702456852000902543655001202552IND60732772120221122173449.0210603e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073277212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Ciliang10aCrataegus pinnatifida polysaccharide alleviates colitis via modulation of gut microbiota and SCFAs metabolism  ap. 357-368.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) afflicted individual and most medications have side-effects. Crataegus pinnatifida (Hawthorn), which is a safe medicine and food homolog plant, has been reported to prevent colitis in murine. Yet the bioactivity component and the underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. Here, we established a direct link between colitis induced by dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) in mice and polysaccharide HAW1–2 isolated from hawthorn. Our results showed HAW1–2 restored the pathological lesions in colon and inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Meanwhile, IKKα/β, IκBα, NF-κB and the phosphorylation levels were inhibited significantly. These findings suggested HAW1–2 could alleviate the inflammation of colon. Further, we found the composition of gut microbiota was modified and Bacteroides including Alistipes and Odoribacter were significantly enriched. Besides, we showed Alistipes and Odoribacter were positively co-related with acetic acid and propionic acid while were negatively co-related with inflammatory cytokines. Finally, we demonstrated the anti-inflammation activity of HAW1–2 might be induced by acetic acid. Together, the present data revealed HAW1–2 could directly modify the gut microbiota, especially for Bacteroides, and generate SCFAs to inhibit colitis. It also implies microbiota-directed intervention in IBD patients should be particularly given more attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aCrataegus pinnatifida 3aacetic acid 3aadverse effects 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acolitis 3acolon 3adextran 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amedicine 3ametabolism 3amice 3aphosphorylation 3apropionic acid 3asodium 3asulfates 0aCrataegus pinnatifida polysaccharide 0aGut microbiota 0aShort chain fatty acids1 aWang, Yeqing1 aZhang, Shihai1 aZhang, Xiuqi1 aDu, Zhenyun1 aLi, Meixia1 aDing, Kan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 June 30, v. 181 p.357-368dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245016300214500001900377520175500396592002802151650002102179650001102200650001702211650001302228650001202241650002602253650001502279650001902294650002302313650002202336650001402358650001602372650001902388650002402407650000902431650001102440650001102451650001002462653001702472653002702489653002202516653001802538653001102556653002502567653001602592700001402608700002002622700001602642700006302658773013802721856008802859852000902947655001202956IND60737489920221121044548.0210708e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073748992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1084372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXenakis, Georgios1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2950-410110aComparison of the carbon, water, and energy balances of mature stand and clear-fell stages in a British Sitka spruce forest and the impact of the 2018 drought  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSitka spruce is the major conifer species in British upland forests and is predominantly managed as even-aged, single-species plantations with rotation lengths of less than 50 years using a “patch clear-felling” system. Evidence on the impact of clear-felling on the carbon, water and energy balances of plantation forestry is sparse and extreme weather events, such as the 2018 drought that occurred across Europe, are expected to have considerable impact. We used energy balance and gas flux data from a typical mature stand and a clear-felled site on peaty-gley soil at Harwood Forest in Northumberland, UK, over 4 years to quantify the impact of clear-felling and investigate how the drought of 2018 affected these fluxes. Felling resulted in an annual CO2 source (7.05 tCha−1yr−1) of similar magnitude in absolute terms to the mature stand sink (−7.09 tCha−1yr−1). The source was reduced with the growth of ground vegetation, and after tree replanting two years post-felling, the site was a weak source. Felling increased reflected radiation by 92%, reduced evapotranspiration by 28% and therefore increased site wetness by 8%, while replanting and the spread of ground vegetation increased evapotranspiration by 16% on average. The warm, dry spring and summer in 2018 increased evapotranspiration and reduced net carbon uptake of the mature stand by 30% compared to the mean of the previous three years, because of a small decrease in photosynthetic uptake and a small increase in ecosystem respiration. The drought conditions also increased ecosystem losses of CO2 at the clear-felled site by 28%. The clear-fell site would have turned into a small CO2 sink in the second year after replanting, if there had not been a drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea sitchensis 3acarbon 3aclearcutting 3aconifers 3adrought 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3aenergy balance 3aevapotranspiration 3aground vegetation 3ahighlands 3ameteorology 3aphotosynthesis 3aplantation forestry 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3atrees 0aSitka spruce 0aNet ecosystem exchange 0aForest management 0aClear-felling 0aAlbedo 0aWater use efficiency 0aBowen ratio1 aAsh, Adam1 aSiebicke, Lukas1 aPerks, Mike1 aMorison, James I.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0803-637X0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 306 p.108437-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1084373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01971naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245014900209300001400358520098200372592002801354650002601382650001801408650002201426700002301448700001801471773011301489856008201602852000901684655001201693IND60609080820221118025639.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060908082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-018-4150-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega, Jean C.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of species richness–EH (S–EH) relationships reported for experimental or quasi-experimental studies. We controlled for the lack of independence among effect sizes and additionally performed a cumulative meta-analysis. We found that EH has a consistent positive effect on species richness. This pattern was consistent across spatial scales, methodological issues and among taxonomic groups and realms. Furthermore, our cumulative meta-analysis highlighted that a positive S–EH relationship has been evident for nearly two decades. However, experiments often did not deeply explore the mechanisms underlying the positive relationship between EH and species richness. Taken together, our results present a robust pattern for the S–EH relationship, but our understanding of the main mechanisms is still in its infancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3ameta-analysis 3aspecies diversity1 aThomaz, Sidinei M.1 aBini, Luis M.0 tOecologia.g2018 Sept., v. 188, no. 1 p.11-22dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4150-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05737naa a2200961 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015500174300001200329520183000341592002802171596007202199596007702271596007702348596007202425596007202497596007202569596007002641596007302711596010202784596007602886596011602962596006003078596007603138596004303214596006803257596004003325596003403365596008003399596008603479596008603565650001203651650001103663650001003674650001603684650001803700650002203718650002103740650003103761650001303792650001903805650001103824650001703835650000903852650002103861650002803882650001303910650001403923650001403937650001303951650001803964650002403982650001604006700003004022700001804052700002104070700003304091700002404124700002904148700002204177700002704199700002604226700001804252700002704270700001604297700002504313700003104338700002704369700001704396700001904413700002104432700002404453700002304477700006804500773010304568856008304671852000904754655001204763IND60715449820221118052010.0220805e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071544982DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-020-02172-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavas-Pérez, Enrique10aCharacterization of an eutherian gene cluster generated after transposon domestication identifies Bex3 as relevant for advanced neurological functions  ap. 267.  aBACKGROUND: One of the most unusual sources of phylogenetically restricted genes is the molecular domestication of transposable elements into a host genome as functional genes. Although these kinds of events are sometimes at the core of key macroevolutionary changes, their origin and organismal function are generally poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we identify several previously unreported transposable element domestication events in the human and mouse genomes. Among them, we find a remarkable molecular domestication that gave rise to a multigenic family in placental mammals, the Bex/Tceal gene cluster. These genes, which act as hub proteins within diverse signaling pathways, have been associated with neurological features of human patients carrying genomic microdeletions in chromosome X. The Bex/Tceal genes display neural-enriched patterns and are differentially expressed in human neurological disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia. Two different murine alleles of the cluster member Bex3 display morphological and physiopathological brain modifications, such as reduced interneuron number and hippocampal electrophysiological imbalance, alterations that translate into distinct behavioral phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We provide an in-depth understanding of the emergence of a gene cluster that originated by transposon domestication and gene duplication at the origin of placental mammals, an evolutionary process that transformed a non-functional transposon sequence into novel components of the eutherian genome. These genes were integrated into existing signaling pathways involved in the development, maintenance, and function of the CNS in eutherians. At least one of its members, Bex3, is relevant for higher brain functions in placental mammals and may be involved in human neurological disorders.  aPublisher supplied data  aBFU2015-68655-PcMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aRTI2018-100968-B-I00cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aPGC2018-098229-B-I00cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aBES-2016-077374cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aSAF2016-80937-RcMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aBFU2017-89780-RcMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aMDM-2016-0687cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aBFU-2017-83150-PcMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aMaria de Maeztu Excellence Unit MDM-2016-0687cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aand SAF2016-76340-RcMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aMaria de Maeztu Excelent Unit, Insitute of Neurosciences UBcMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aFPIcMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aBFU2017-861152cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades (ES)  a2017-SGR-738cGeneralitat de Catalunya  aP12-CTS-2257cAgencia de Innovación y Desarrollo de Andalucía  a67302, 643051, 728018cHorizon 2020  aCVI-7290cJunta de Andalucía  aN/AcCentro de Investigación Biomédica en Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas  aN/Ac'Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Raras' (CIBERER)  aN/Ac'Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Raras' (CIBERER) 3aalleles 3aautism 3abrain 3achromosomes 3adomestication 3aelectrophysiology 3agene duplication 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainterneurons 3amice 3amultigene family 3anervous system diseases 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3aschizophrenia 3asignal transduction 3atransposons1 aVicente-García, Cristina1 aMirra, Serena1 aBurguera, Demian1 aFernàndez-Castillo, Noèlia1 aFerrán, José Luis1 aLópez-Mayorga, Macarena1 aAlaiz-Noya, Marta1 aSuárez-Pereira, Irene1 aAntón-Galindo, Ester1 aUlloa, Fausto1 aHerrera-Úbeda, Carlos1 aCuscó, Pol1 aFalcón-Moya, Rafael1 aRodríguez-Moreno, Antonio1 aD’Aniello, Salvatore1 aCormand, Bru1 aMarfany, Gemma1 aSoriano, Eduardo1 aCarrión, Ángel M.1 aCarvajal, Jaime J.1 aGarcia-Fernàndez, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5677-59700 tGenome biology.g2020 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.267-267dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02172-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01659naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011800165300001600283520072400299592002801023650001201051650001101063650001901074650002901093700001801122700001801140773012101158856008101279852000901360655001201369IND60580765220221118024028.0170929e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058076522DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-016-0639-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Huifu10aFiltering Approach Based on Voter Model and Spatial-Contextual Information to the Binary Change Map in SAR Images  ap. 733-741.  aIf a binary change map (BCM) is generated without considering spatial-contextual information, it can produce a number of false and missed alarms because of the significant speckle noise in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Therefore, this paper first proposes the local continuity assumption of the changed and unchanged areas. Then, a new filtering approach to BCM of SAR images is proposed based on the voter model and spatial-contextual information.

Experimental and theoretical studies strongly suggest that the shape factor should not be determined only by the outline of the particles, although previous research assigned a value of 1 to the shape factor for particles regardless of the presence of pores and their distribution. We found the possibility that our porous particles both had specific internal structures induced by spontaneous emulsification and exhibited unusual aerodynamic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamic properties 3acolloids 3adrugs 3aemulsifying 3alungs 0aSpontaneous emulsification 0aOne-step emulsification 0aPulmonary drug delivery 0aPLGA 0aCascade impactor1 aTakami, Taku1 aMurakami, Yoshihiko0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 159 p.318-326dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005700165300001800222520137700240592002801617650001601645650001101661650001601672650001801688650001801706650001301724650001701737650001401754650000901768650001201777650001501789650001201804650000701816650001301823650001201836650001801848650003701866700002001903773012501923856008102048852000902129655001202138IND60548924120221119181248.0160905e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054892412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-016-2676-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietsch, Paul10aPossibilities for the specific reduction of fructose  ap. 1763-1776.  aThe aim of this work was to investigate the application of boronic acids for the specific reduction of fructose in food matrices as fruit juice. The ability of boronic acids to form esters with diol structures forms the basis of the investigation. The retention of fruit juice components in a solution and fruit juice was analysed on a boronic acid gel. The known affinity decrease in boronic acid in the order of sorbitol, fructose, galactose and glucose was confirmed. The disaccharides sucrose and maltose as well as the fruit acids malic acid, citric acid and tartaric acid have not shown any interactions. The ligand 3-aminophenylboronic acid was appropriate for the reversible binding of fructose at higher pH values. The sugar reduction and the change of the sugar composition were possible by fractionation. For the application in the natural pH range of a fruit juice, specific substituted boronic acids (3-fluoro-5-methoxycarbonylphenylboronic acid, 3-carboxy-5-nitrophenylboronic acid and 3-methoxy-5-nitrophenylboronic acid) were analysed concerning an interaction with fructose. The spectroscopy in the UV range was appropriate as a method of detection. The 3-carboxy-5-nitrophenylboronic acid is a possible ligand for applications in acid media. In brief, this paper shows the potential of boronic acids for a specific reduction of fructose in food matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitric acid 3aesters 3afood matrix 3afood research 3afractionation 3afructose 3afruit juices 3agalactose 3agels 3aglucose 3amalic acid 3amaltose 3apH 3asorbitol 3asucrose 3atartaric acid 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aRichter, Renate0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2016 Oct., v. 242, no. 10 p.1763-1776dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-016-2676-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245016000214520142500374592002801799650000801827650002701835650000901862650001501871650000901886650001801895650003301913650000901946650002001955650000901975650003301984650002502017651001602042653003602058653001502094653002802109653002102137653001302158653002202171700002502193700001702218700005902235773009102294856009002385852000902475655001202484IND60758337520221120173412.0220205e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075833752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Dat Thanh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6454-278710aProfiling and assessing soil-air exchange of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in playground dust and soil using ex situ equilibrium passive sampling  aCancer risk can be associated with exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in playground dust and soil. This study investigated the profiles and sources of PAHs from poured rubber-surfaced playground dust and uncovered playground surface soil, by applying an ex-situ equilibrium passive sampling technique. Surface dust and soil samples were collected from 15 different playgrounds in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The total 16 EPA PAHs concentrations in surface dust and soil varied from 198 to 919 μg kg⁻¹ dw and 68–169 μg kg⁻¹ dw, respectively. 4- to 6-ring PAHs were dominant, accounting for approximately 53.8%–94.5% of the total PAHs in surface dust and soil. The diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis suggested that a mixed coal combustion and vehicular emission was likely the main source of PAHs in the surface dust and soil. The higher total organic carbon content can explain the higher PAH accumulation and lower fugacities of PAHs. The fugacity comparison of phenanthrene and pyrene in dust, soil, air, and playground surface material indicated that atmospheric deposition is the main source of PAHs in the dust and soil on rubber-surfaced and uncovered surfaced playgrounds. This study contributes to the understanding of PAHs sources in dust and soil samples in children's playground and helps policymaker determine the right contamination sources for risk management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric deposition 3acoal 3acombustion 3adust 3aphenanthrenes 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk management 3asoil 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3atotal organic carbon 3aSouth Korea 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 0aPlayground 0aPoured rubber surfacing 0aPassive sampling 0aFugacity 0aSoil-air exchange1 aTarafdar, Abhrajyoti1 aKim, Pil-Gon1 aKwon, Jung-Hwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6341-75620 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.133083-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245010700216300001600323520188700339592002802226650001502254650001002269650002602279650001502305650001102320650001502331650002302346650001702369650002202386650002102408650001502429650001002444650001102454651001402465700002102479700002202500700002102522773011502543856008202658852000902740655001202749IND60609081520221118025802.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060908152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-018-4207-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVergara-Tabares, David L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7493-791010aAliens will provide: avian responses to a new temporal resource offered by ornithocorous exotic shrubs  ap. 173-182.  aFrugivorous birds are able to track spatiotemporal changes in fruit availability. Food resource fluctuations, characteristic of seasonal environments, can be affected by the naturalization of exotic ornithocorous plants. In the mountain forest of central Argentina, invasive shrubs of the genus Pyracantha provide a new temporal resource that modifies fluctuations of natural resource availability because the invasives fructify in autumn–winter (largely uncoupled with the fruiting of native species). The contrasting patterns of resource fluctuation between non-invaded and invaded areas throughout the year provide a good study system to test predictions of the fruit-tracking hypothesis, and to understand the relationship between food resources offered by fleshy fruited invasives and abundances of avian trophic guilds. By means of point counts conducted during five time periods at invaded and non-invaded sites we found that the presence of Pyracantha, and time periods, significantly affected frugivorous bird abundance, which in autumn–winter was greater in invaded sites and in spring–summer similar between invaded and non-invaded sites. On the other hand, granivores and insectivores did not show a significant relationship with the presence of Pyracantha. Abundances of the most common seed disperser were significantly affected by the interaction between time period and presence of Pyracantha. These results indicate that the abundances of birds that legitimately disperse Pyracantha seeds are temporally and spatially associated with fruit abundance provided by this exotic plant. This underscores fruit availability as an important ecological factor affecting frugivorous bird abundance, and suggests that Pyracantha seed dispersers are capable of detecting changes in the availability of its fruit, likely contributing to the effectiveness of its dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyracantha 3abirds 3aenvironmental factors 3afrugivores 3afruits 3agranivores 3aindigenous species 3ainsectivores 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aprediction 3aseeds 3ashrubs 3aArgentina1 aToledo, Martín,1 aGarcía, Emiliano1 aPeluc, Susana I.0 tOecologia.g2018 Sept., v. 188, no. 1 p.173-182dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4207-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245018100161300001800342520156800360592002801928650001301956650001101969650002401980650003502004650001602039650002502055650003502080650000902115650002002124650001102144650000902155650001302164650001602177650002502193650000702218650001002225650001502235650001102250650001902261650001302280650001402293700002102307700002602328773012902354856007402483852000902557655001202566IND60656683020221118033638.0190814e20130912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065668302DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40885j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortada, Wael I.10aMixed micelle-mediated extraction of alizarin red S complexes of Zr(iv) and Hf(iv) ions prior to their determination by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry  ap. 5234-5240.  aA modified cloud-point extraction method using a mixed surfactant has been developed for the preconcentration of Zr(iv) and Hf(iv) prior to their determination by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The method is based on the complexation of Zr(iv) or Hf(iv) with Alizarine Red S (ARS) at pH 2.5 in the presence of cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and non-ionic surfactant Triton X-114. Phase separation was accomplished at room temperature in the presence of 0.1 mol L⁻¹ sodium sulphate. The surfactant-rich phase containing Zr(iv) or Hf(iv) was separated then diluted with methanol/concentrated nitric acid mixed solvent (5 : 1) before its introduction into ICP-OES for the determination. The optimal extraction and reaction conditions were evaluated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the calibration graphs were linear in the range of 0.5–1000 and 0.5–850 ng mL⁻¹ with detection limits of 0.18 and 0.25 ng mL⁻¹ for Zr(iv) and Hf(iv), respectively. The RSD values for five replicates of Zr(iv) and Hf(iv) at 50 ng mL⁻¹ concentrations were 2.1 and 2.3%, respectively, and the enrichment factors for 100 mL samples were obtained as 120 and 105 for Zr(iv) and Hf(iv), respectively. The accuracy of the results was verified by analyzing the spiked water from different sources and synthetic mixtures. The proposed method has been applied for the determination of Zr(iv) and Hf(iv) in some real samples such as clay, rocks and silver alloy samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3aalloys 3aambient temperature 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acalibration 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3aclay 3adetection limit 3agraphs 3aions 3amethanol 3anitric acid 3anonionic surfactants 3apH 3arocks 3aseparation 3asilver 3asodium sulfate 3asolvents 3azirconium1 aAli, Al-Ahmad Z.1 aHassanien, Mohamed M.0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Sept. 12, v. 5, no. 19 p.5234-5240dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40885j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008900168520154600257592002801803650001101831650001301842650001301855650001201868650002601880650001401906650002601920650001801946650001801964650002701982650001502009650001402024650001102038650001202049650001102061650001202072651001402084651001202098653003002110653001102140653002902151653001402180700002402194700001802218700002002236700002402256700002002280773011802300856008602418852000902504655001202513IND60678438820221119015659.0200228e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067843882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2019.1061252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCwanek, Anna14aThe radioactive contamination study in south-western Greenland tundra in 2012–2013  aThe paper presents results of the radioecological investigation carried out in south-western Greenland shoreline. There were examined over 50 samples of lichens and mosses collected from 7 locations during two scientific expeditions conducted in the summer of 2012–2013. The levels, trends and the most likely origin were determined for following natural and artificial radionuclides: ⁹⁰Sr, ¹³⁷Cs, ²³⁰, ²³²Th, ²³⁴, ²³⁸U, ²³⁸, ²³⁹⁺²⁴⁰Pu and ²⁴¹Am. The radioactive pollution was found as relatively low, reaching the maximum values at: 25.3 ± 2.04 Bq/kg for ⁹⁰Sr, 293 ± 27 Bq/kg for ¹³⁷Cs, 4.01 ± 0.13 Bq/kg for ²³⁹⁺²⁴⁰Pu, 0.1381 ± 0.0070 Bq/kg for ²³⁸Pu and 1.90 ± 0.21 Bq/kg of ²⁴¹Am, 9.15 ± 0.48 Bq/kg for ²³⁰Th, 25.1 ± 1.2 Bq/kg for ²³²Th, 7.5 ± 1.5 Bq/kg for ²³⁴U and 7.26 ± 0.80 Bq/kg for ²³⁸U. Both activity and mass isotopic ratio assays revealed dominant contribution of the global fallout + SNAP 9A on the presence of plutonium isotopes and ²⁴¹Am in Greenland tundra. However, noticeable deviations of ²⁴¹Am/²³⁹⁺²⁴⁰Pu and to a lesser extend of ²⁴⁰Pu/²³⁹Pu ratios from the GF level have been observed. The origin of ¹³⁷Cs was evidently connected with the coexistence of global and Chernobyl fallout, while the presence of ⁹⁰Sr was caused by nuclear weapon tests and affected by leaching process. The seaborne signature of uranium isotopes was manifested in research material as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3acesium 3aisotopes 3aleaching 3alichens 3amosses and liverworts 3aplutonium 3aradioactive pollution 3aradioactivity 3aradionuclides 3ascientific expeditions 3ashorelines 3astrontium 3asummer 3athorium 3atundra 3auranium 3aGreenland 3aUkraine 0aRadioactive contamination 0aMosses 0aGlobal fallout + SNAP 9A 0aChernobyl1 aMietelski, Jerzy W.1 aŁokas, Edyta1 aOlech, Maria A.1 aAnczkiewicz, Robert1 aMisiak, Ryszard0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2020 Feb., v. 212 p.106125-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2019.1061253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01554naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002800160245009400188300001600282500000900298520057300307592002800880650002500908650001300933650001100946650001300957650001300970650001000983700001900993773012201012852000901134856009701143655001201240IND8009715320221116173755.0191122e198007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND800971532DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200040034x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimonelli, Mary L.

This makes accurate measurements of the water status of organs difficult, if not impossible. This note briefly describes a technique for making customized seals by molding them out of silicone rubber directly onto representative stems or petioles. Such seals have been demonstrated to provide superior sealing action with little or no tissue change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acacti and succulents 3apetioles 3arubber 3asealants 3asilicone 3astems1 aSpomer, L.

Then T. brassicae adults were treated with LC₁₀ and LC₅₀ values obtained from probit analysis of the mite bioassay results using toxicity bioassay with fresh residue method. For evaluating residual effects of abamectin, bean plants were sprayed with twentieth of recommended field dose of abamectin (equal to 25 ppm of trade product). Leaf pieces were prepared from treated plants in different time intervals and the adult mites were transferred on them. Mortality was recorded after 24 h. Probit analysis of lethal experiment against T. urticae revealed 0.05, 0.417 and 3.26 ppm from trade product as LC₁₀, LC₅₀ and LC₉₀ values, respectively. Results of residual effects experiment showed that mite mortality was 100% in 1 day after plant spraying which decreased to 55.62% in 21 days after spraying.

The obtained porous keratin-PAA hydrogel was then characterized using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The interaction mechanism of Pb(II) and the keratin-PAA hydrogel was further investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that keratin-PAA hydrogel was successfully synthesized, with a specific surface area of 49.35 m²/g and a uniform pore distribution of 6.20 nm. The synthesized keratin-PAA hydrogel only took 6 min to adsorb nearly 70% of Pb(II) from the solution because of the interconnected porous network. The keratin-PAA hydrogel also showed a maximal adsorption amount of 234.6 mg/g, and satisfactory selectivity toward Pb(II). The adsorption kinetics of the keratin-PAA hydrogel binding to Pb(II) could be better described by the pseudo-second-order model, whereas the adsorption isotherms could be fitted using the Langmuir equation; this suggested that chemisorption was the main rate-limiting step. The XPS and FT-IR analysis results indicated that the sulfur-, nitrogen- and oxygen-containing groups in the keratin-PAA hydrogel were the main binding sites for Pb(II). In real aqueous samples, the keratin-PAA hydrogel could remove 93–104% of Pb(II). It is clear that the keratin-PAA hydrogel is an outstanding adsorbent material for the removal of Pb(II) from aqueous samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3ahydrogels 3akeratin 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apolyacrylic acid 3areaction kinetics 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3athermogravimetry 0aKeratin 0aPorous double-network hydrogel 0aLead ions removal 0aRecognition mechanism1 aMa, Xiuna1 aWei, Ziqi1 aTan, Yang1 aChen, Siwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9613-37771 aYe, Tai1 aYuan, Min1 aYu, Jinsong1 aWu, Xiuxiu1 aYin, Fengqin1 aXu, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7745-28550 tChemosphere.g2022 Feb., v. 289 p.133086-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245020000157500001900357520168100376592002802057650001202085650001502097650001702112650000902129650002002138650001302158650001902171650002302190650001302213650001102226650001802237650000902255650001802264650001602282651001002298700001702308700001802325700001802343700001502361700001502376700001902391773012802410856007402538852000902612655001202621IND60735273320221120202611.0210423e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073527332DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130815242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xuliang 10aAssessing the Effects of Spatial Scales on Regional Evapotranspiration Estimation by the SEBAL Model and Multiple Satellite Datasets: A Case Study in the Agro-Pastoral Ecotone, Northwestern China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEvapotranspiration (ET) estimation is important for understanding energy exchanges and water cycles. Remote sensing (RS) is the main method used to obtain ET data over large scales. However, owing to surface heterogeneities and different model algorithms, ET estimated from RS products with different spatial resolutions can cause significant uncertainties, whose causes need to be thoroughly analyzed. In this study, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model was selected to explore spatial resolution influences on ET simulations. Three satellite datasets (Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) were selected to independently estimate ET in SEBAL model to identify the influence of the spatial scale on ET estimation, and analyze the effects and causes of scale aggregation. Results indicated that: (1) the spatial distributions of ET estimated from the three satellite datasets were similar, with the MODIS-based ET having the largest uncertainty; and (2) aggregating input parameters had limited changes in the net radiation and soil heat fluxes. However, errors in the sensible heat and latent heat fluxes were relatively larger, which were caused by changes in the selection of hot and cold pixels and the NDVI and surface albedo parameters during scale aggregation. The scale errors caused by the model mechanisms were larger than those caused by the land use/cover pattern in the SEBAL model. Overall, this study highlights the impact of spatial scale on ET and provides a better understanding of the scale aggregation effect on ET estimation by RS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3acold 3adata collection 3aecotones 3aenergy balance 3aevapotranspiration 3aland use 3amodels 3anet radiation 3asoil 3athematic maps 3auncertainty 3aChina1 aXu, Xuefeng 1 aWang, Xuejin 1 aXu, Shaoyuan 1 aTian, Wei 1 aTian, Jie 1 aHe, Chansheng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130815243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005500155245011700210520187500327592002802202650001402230650001502244650001302259650001102272650001202283650001202295650001702307650001502324651001702339653001402356653001202370653001402382653002502396653002402421653001902445653001402464700006002478700001602538773011002554856009002664852000902754655001202763IND60737490920221121131312.0210812e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073749092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1041472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManyani, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7174-228510aAttitudes and preferences towards elements of formal and informal public green spaces in two South African towns  aDifferent types of public urban green spaces (PUGS) contain various natural (such as trees, pools, flowerbeds) and artificial elements (such as benches, play equipment, fountains) which contribute to the enjoyment and experience of users. However, which elements users most require, appreciate or notice has rarely been examined as the basis of their choice for specific PUGS, especially in poorer neighbourhoods and countries, where formal PUGS may be limited. The study was carried out in two towns in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, both characterized by high poverty and unemployment levels, low literacy rates and many people living without basic infrastructure and services. To understand the meanings people, have for specific PUGS elements, formal and informal PUGS and peri-urban municipal commonages were assessed with respect to the natural and artificial elements present. A survey of 360 households was conducted across two towns by targeting PUGS users and households within 100 m from the designated PUGS. Approximately 63% of the respondents visited PUGS, with informal PUGS being the most frequented. However, they were strong negative feelings towards some natural elements because of their unkempt nature. Issues of safety, cultural restrictions and lack of recreational facilities were mentioned as some of the specific deterrents against visiting the closest PUGS among different user and age groups. Most respondents emphasized the need for PUGS that are well laid out with maintained lawns, recreational facilities and open vegetation. Thus, the current design and available features within the studied PUGS do not meet local preferences and needs and thus do not contribute to enjoyment as much as they could. Attention needs to be given to understand and incorporate the elements that invoke positive attitudes among urban residents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3alandscapes 3aliteracy 3apeople 3apoverty 3asurveys 3aunemployment 3avegetation 3aSouth Africa 0aAttitudes 0aCulture 0aLivestock 0aMunicipal commonages 0aPoor neighbourhoods 0aUrban dwellers 0aWellbeing1 aShackleton, C.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8489-61361 aCocks, M.L.0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2021 Oct., v. 214 p.104147-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1041473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013600166300001600302520159700318592002801915650002801943650002601971650001601997650001102013650001302024650002102037650002602058650001502084650001402099650001602113650001902129650002102148650001002169650000902179651001002188700002402198700001802222700002102240773012102261856008102382852000902463655001202472IND60580766020221118024030.0170929e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058076602DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-016-0633-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Ashaq10aRelationship of Hyperspectral Reflectance Indices with Leaf N and P Concentration, Dry Matter Accumulation and Grain Yield of Wheat  ap. 773-784.  aA field experiment was conducted on wheat during rabi season of year 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 at IARI, New Delhi to study the reflectance response of wheat to the nutrient omissions and identify the appropriate indices for assessing the nutrient deficiencies. Treatments comprised omission of N, P, K, S and Zn, 50% omission of N, P, and K, absolute control and optimum dose of nutrition (150–26.4–50–15–3 kg/ha N–P–K–S–Zn). The R² were significant and higher for the hyperspectral indices than the broad band vegetation indices. GMI-I, RI-2 dB and RI-3d, GNDVI, VOGa, VOGb, VOGc, ND₇₀₅, PRI, PSNDc and REIP had higher R² (>0.61) for the leaf N concentration. The hyperspectral indices having highly significant correlation with leaf P concentration were PSSRc, GMI-1, ZM, RI-half, VOGa, VOGb, VOGc, mSR and REIP. Among the indices analysed PSSRc, GMI-I, VOGa, RI-2 dB, RI-3 dB, GNDVI, VOGb, VOGc and ND₇₀₅ had almost a similar degree of relationship with DM accumulation with R² values ranging from 0.70 to 0.73. However, REIP displayed a higher degree of relationship with leaf N concentration, drymatter accumulation and grain yield as indicated by R² of 0.85, 0.81 and 0.95 (P = ≤0.01), respectively. It can be concluded from the study that among the hyperspectral indices REIP had a highly significant relationship with leaf N concentration, DM accumulation and grain yield. However, for leaf P concentration several hyperspectral indices viz PSSRc, GMI-1, ZM, RI-half, VOGa, VOGb, VOGc, mSR had though significant but almost similar R² values.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry matter accumulation 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient deficiencies 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3avegetation index 3awheat 3azinc 3aIndia1 aSahoo, Rabi Narayan1 aKumar, Dinesh1 aPradhan, Sanatan0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2017 Oct., v. 45, no. 5 p.773-784dSpringer Indiax0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-016-0633-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245010000171520148500271592002801756650000801784650001501792650002101807650001401828650001801842650001901860650001701879650001701896650002001913650001901933650001801952650001501970650001601985650002602001650002802027653001502055653001902070653001702089653001402106653001902120700001402139700001602153700001802169700001702187700001602204700001402220700001602234700005502250773009102305856009002396852000902486655001202495IND60758337920221120153227.0220606e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075833792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ping10aImmunotoxicity induced by Ivermectin is associated with NF-κB signaling pathway on macrophages  aIvermectin (IVM) has been widely used as a highly effective and broad-spectrum biopesticide in animal husbandry and agriculture. Considering the frequent environmental and occupational exposure, the various toxic effects caused by IVM should be paid more attention. The immune system is a common target of toxins due to its complexity and sensitivity. The toxicity effect of the immune system may lead to increased susceptibility to infections, with potentially fatal consequences. The immunotoxicity of IVM has received little attention, which poses a challenge to the systematic assessment of safety risks. The purpose of this study was to assess the immunotoxicity of the IVM using in vitro cellular assays. We proved that IVM could inhibit the cell viability, induce DNA damage and enhance apoptosis. In addition to the induction of cytotoxicity, IVM has also been shown to reduce the phagocytic capacity and significantly increase the mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 β and TNF-α. Intracellular biochemical assay indicated that activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), release of cytochrome C, DNA double strand damage. These results indicate that IVM can induce immunotoxicity through induction of immune dysfunction and cytotoxicity. In conclusion, this study supports that IVM can be immunotoxic to macrophages in different ways, and draw attention to the potential immunotoxicity of IVM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aanimal husbandry 3aapoptosis 3abiopesticides 3acell viability 3acytochrome c 3acytotoxicity 3agene expression 3aimmunotoxicity 3ainterleukin-6 3aivermectin 3amacrophages 3aoccupational exposure 3areactive oxygen species 0aIvermectin 0aImmunotoxicity 0aPhagocytosis 0aCytokines 0aNF-κB pathway1 aLi, Yandi1 aXu, Wenping1 aCheng, Jiagao1 aZhang, Cheng1 aGao, Jufang1 aLi, Zhong1 aTao, Liming1 aZhang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6804-18400 tChemosphere.g2022 Feb., v. 289 p.133087-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024002300170024004000193024002500233040001800258100005900276245007200335300001600407520090100423592002801324650002901352650002701381650001401408650002901422650002701451650002301478650002201501650001401523650001401537650003201551650001401583650001701597650002001614653001401634653001901648653002601667653002501693700001901718700002601737700002101763700002301784700002001807700002601827700006201853700002301915700002201938700002401960700002301984773012902007856008302136856011402219961001302333852000902346655001202355IND60737491020221214225622.0210723e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073749102DNAL7 a3791892aris7 a10113/73749102hdl7 a10.1016/j.tree.2021.04.0102doi7 a3791892seq_no_1157 a3032-22000-019-00D2aris_project_no7 a4392612aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabal, Megan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4291-847X10aPredation landscapes influence migratory prey ecology and evolution  ap. 737-749.  aMigratory prey experience spatially variable predation across their life cycle. They face unique challenges in navigating this predation landscape, which affects their perception of risk, antipredator responses, and resulting mortality. Variable and unfamiliar predator cues during migration can limit accurate perception of risk and migrants often rely on social information and learning to compensate. The energetic demands of migration constrain antipredator responses, often through context-dependent patterns. While migration can increase mortality, migrants employ diverse strategies to balance risks and rewards, including life history and antipredator responses. Humans interact frequently with migratory prey across space and alter both mortality risk and antipredator responses, which can scale up to affect migratory populations and should be considered in conservation and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantipredatory behavior 3aevolution 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3alife cycle (organisms) 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory species 3amortality 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3aprey species 3arisk perception 0amigration 0apredation risk 0aantipredator behavior 0aanthropogenic change1 aBoyce, Mark S.1 aCharpentier, Corie L.1 aFurey, Nathan B.1 aLuhring, Thomas M.1 aMartin, Hans W.1 aMelnychuk, Michael C.1 aSrygley, Robert B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-38731 aWagner, C.

We solved two crystal structures of tetranucleosomes with approximately 11 base pair DNA linker length at 5.8 and 6.7Å resolution. Minimal intramolecular nucleosome-nucleosome interactions result in a fiber model resembling a flat ribbon that is compatible with a two-start helical architecture, and that exposes histone and DNA surfaces to the environment. The differences in the two structures combined with electron microscopy reveal heterogeneous structural states, and we used site-specific chemical crosslinking to assess the diversity of nucleosome-nucleosome interactions through identification of structure-sensitive crosslink sites that provide a means to characterize fibers in solution. The chromatin fiber architectures observed here provide a basis for understanding heterogeneous chromatin higher order structures as they occur in a genomic context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3achromosome segregation 3acrosslinking 3acrystal structure 3aelectron microscopy 3agenomics 3ahistones 3amodels 3anucleosomes 3atranscription (genetics) 0aTetranucleosomes 0aChromatin structure 0aNucleosomes1 aRichmond, Timothy J.1 aSchalch, Thomas0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245009200208300001600300520082600316592002801142650002701170650000901197650001101206650002101217650001101238650001501249650003001264651001001294773011901304856008201423852000901505655001201514IND60715450720221122035431.0201026e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071545072DNAL7 a10.1007/s13355-020-00701-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshiga, Toyoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7050-261810aIn vitro culture method of Ditylenchus destructor (Tylenchida: Anguinidae) using garlic  ap. 435-437.  aDitylenchus destructor Thorne (Tylenchida: Anguinidae) is a plant-parasitic nematode that causes garlic rot in Japan. A method that can be used to culture the nematode on garlic has not yet been established, but is required to be able to conduct studies for a better understanding of the nematode’s physiology and ecology. The purpose of this study was to develop such a culture method. Surface-sterilized nematodes (200 individuals) were inoculated onto a surface-sterilized garlic storage leaf on 1% agar in a 100 ml medium bottle, and incubated at 25 °C. Seven weeks after inoculation, a mean number of approximately 360,000 axenic nematodes per bottle was obtained. The culture method established in this study is simple, less laborious, and can be useful for the studies of D. destructor associated with garlic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDitylenchus destructor 3aagar 3agarlic 3ain vitro culture 3aleaves 3aphysiology 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aJapan0 tApplied entomology and zoology.g2020 Nov., v. 55, no. 4 p.435-437dSpringer JapanwJournal:22886x0003-68627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13355-020-00701-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245015500176520162800331592002801959650001401987650001702001650001502018650001202033650001402045650002302059650002002082650001302102650003302115650001302148650002402161650002002185650001702205650001902222650002402241653001902265653001802284653002902302700002302331700002302354700002402377700002702401700003402428773009102462856009002553852000902643655001202652IND60758338020221121221242.0220205e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075833802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhumho, Rujeeluk10aEtherification of glycerol into short-chain polyglycerols over MgAl LDH/CaCO3 nanocomposites as heterogeneous catalysts to promote circular bioeconomy  aGlycerol is a byproduct from biodiesel production via conventional transesterification processes, representing approximately 10 wt% of the mass of biodiesel produced. Because of increasing biodiesel consumption, the volume of glycerol being produced has grown significantly, leading to a large surplus and, consequently, a dramatic drop in its market value. Thus, the valorization of glycerol into chemicals is a promising pathway toward sustainability in biodiesel industries. This study focused on upgrading biodiesel plant-derived glycerol into short-chain polyglycerols (PG), which are used as intermediates for producing emulsifiers in several consumer products, via catalytic etherification. To enhance environmental sustainability, solvent-free etherification of glycerol was performed over mixed oxides derived from magnesium–aluminum layered double hydroxides (MgAl LDH). For the first time, natural dolomite, a mixed calcium and magnesium carbonate (CaMg [CO₃]₂), was used as an Mg source in the preparation of MgAl LDH/CaCO₃ nanocomposites via hydrothermal synthesis. The calcined MgAl LDH/CaCO₃ nanocomposites were characterized by highly dispersed small crystallites of magnesium oxide. Their textural and acid–base properties were tuned by varying the Mg:Al molar ratio. The MgAl LDH/CaCO₃ (an Mg:Al molar ratio of 1:1) calcined at 500 °C exhibited a superior catalytic performance to the MgAl LDH available commercially and the one synthesized by conventional co-precipitation. The nanocomposite catalyst displayed selectivity of >99% toward short-chain PG at 52.1 mol% glycerol conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3abioeconomics 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoprecipitation 3adolomite 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aglycerol 3amagnesium carbonate 3amagnesium oxide 3amarket value 3ananocomposites 3atransesterification 0aEtherification 0aPolyglycerols 0aLayered double hydroxide1 aTocuweang, Kitvara1 aSangkhum, Prissana1 aKuchonthara, Prapan1 aAshokkumar, Veeramuthu1 aNgamcharussrivichai, Chawalit0 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.133091-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007500166300001600241520125200257592002801509650001101537650002501548650001901573650001501592650002001607650002301627650001201650650002501662650001501687650001901702650001301721650001301734650001301747650000901760650001701769650002201786650001401808650001001822653002501832653002001857653001601877653001701893700001301910700001801923700002501941700001801966700001901984700001502003700001902018700001502037773010502052856008502157852000902242655001202251IND60581216120221118135814.0190408e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058121612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlberti, G.10aTree functional diversity influences belowground ecosystem functioning  ap. 160-168.  aMany ecosystem processes in forest ecosystems are influenced by tree species richness and tree functional diversity (FD). Several studies, mainly in grasslands, have already underlined a positive effect of plant species richness on soil carbon (C) storage, but evidence for such a relationship for forests is scarce and not much is known about the role of FD. In this study, we investigated the impact of trees with contrasting functional litter traits on soil C and nitrogen (N) storage in a forest plantation on a former grassland. In addition, we also investigated the impact of increasing FD on six different soil enzymes, considered as proximate agents of potential microbial mineralization processes. We found synergistic effects of tree mixtures on soil enzymatic activities at the highest FD levels and an overall increase in soil mineralization potential with FD within tree mixtures. Moreover, we registered an overall decrease in soil C and N stocks 12 years after tree planting. Our results suggest that the selection of tree species and mixtures based on functional traits influencing soil C storage is fundamental for the success of climate change mitigation strategies employing tree plantations on abandoned pastures or grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3agrasslands 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3apastures 3aplanting 3asoil 3asoil enzymes 3aspecies diversity 3asynergism 3atrees 0aFunctional diversity 0aEnzyme activity 0aSoil carbon 0aBiodiversity1 aNock, C.1 aFornasier, F.1 aScherer-Lorenzen, M.1 aDe Nobili, M.1 aPeressotti, A.1 aHoenig, L.1 aBruelheide, H.1 aBauhus, J.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2017 Nov., v. 120 p.160-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013100170300001100301500001900312520189100331592002802222650001402250650001602264650002602280650001102306650002102317650002002338650000902358650002202367650002502389650002002414650000902434650002602443700002802469700006302497700002202560700002402582773009902606856008302705852000902788655001202797IND60715450820221122035522.0210209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071545082DNAL7 a10.1186/s40795-020-00376-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacquier, Emma F.10aComplementary feeding patterns of Filipino infants and toddlers lack diversity, especially among children from poor households  ap. 51.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: Consumption of nutritionally adequate complementary foods is essential for optimal growth and development of infants and toddlers, including those in developing countries. The aim of this study was to describe the food and beverage consumption patterns among 6–23.9 month old Filipino infants and toddlers, by household wealth. METHODS: Data from 1087 infants and toddlers from the 2013 National Nutrition Survey were included. Dietary intake data was assessed using a 24Hr recall and population food intakes were stratified into pre-defined wealth categories. RESULTS: Breast milk, infant formula, powdered milk and rice were the most commonly consumed foods and beverages across the age groups. Several differences in complementary feeding by wealth status were observed. Infants from poor households (69%) reported significantly greater consumption of human milk, than those from rich households (42%) who reported a significantly greater consumption of infant/toddler formula (Poor: 22%, Rich: 56%) (P < 0.05). A higher percentage of toddlers from rich households consumed protein-containing foods, cookies and cakes. There was a significant difference in vegetable consumption in 12–17.9 month old children (Poor: 17%, Rich: 31%; P = 0.021). Human milk and formula were the top contributors to energy in 6–17.9 month old children, while rice was the top energy contributor in 18–23.9 month old children. CONCLUSION: Milk and rice were the main dietary components in all Filipino children, contributing up to 60% of energy in the infants from poorer households. Consumption of protein-containing foods and vegetables were typically lower in poorer households. Interventions are required to enable caregivers of young Filipino children to provide complementary foods of high nutritional quality, particularly among children from the poor households.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3abreast milk 3acomplementary feeding 3aenergy 3ahousehold income 3ainfant formulas 3amilk 3anutrition surveys 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritive value 3arice 3avegetable consumption1 aAngeles-Agdeppa, Imelda1 aLenighan, Yvonne M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9179-60721 aToledo, Marvin B.1 aCapanzana, Mario V.0 tBMC nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.51-51dBioMed CentralwJournal:27315x2055-09287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40795-020-00376-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245012600177300001800303520219400321592002802515650002302543650001402566650001502580650001702595650002002612650001402632650001002646650001202656650002802668650001602696650001402712650001202726650001802738650001702756700003302773700002802806700002202834700002902856773016302885856008303048852000903131655001203140IND60757362520221122215726.0211124e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075736252DNAL7 a10.1007/s42690-020-00407-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolmohammadi, Gholamreza10aLethal and sublethal effects of three insecticides on first instar larvae of green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea, Stephens  ap. 2351-2359.  aThe green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea, Stephens (Neu.: Chrysopidae) is one of the most important predators for insect pests such as whiteflies, thrips, psyllids and aphids that ignificantly decrease their populations. In the current study, lethal (LC50) and sublethal effects (LC30) of three insecticides; clothianidin, tebufenozide and flupyradifurone on first instar larvae of C. carnea (<one-day old) and their biological characteristics were evaluated using fertility life table method. Bioassays were conducted by contact method with glass petri-dishes (10 cm diameter). All experiments were conducted at controllable conditions of 25 ± 1 C°, 60 ± 5% and a photoperiod 16:8 h (L:D). The results revealed that LC50 for clothianidin, tebufenozide and flupyradifurone were 8.55, 336.12 and 642.02, respectively. Moreover, the life table response experiment shows that the values of rm and R0 due to LC30 for clothianidin, tebufenozide and flupyradifurone were 0.13, 0.13 and 0.15 per day and 95.72, 97.00 and 136.27 offspring, respectively. At the same time, rm and R0 in the control group were 0.15 per day and 143.26 offspring. Furthermore, the highest survival rate of C. carnea was observed in tebufenozide (54 days) but after control treatment, the lowest survival rate was related to clothianidin (46 days). Results reveal that longevity and life span of both sexes in three treatments were different from the control. According to the IOBC-system, comparing the total effects indicated that clothianidin (77.83%) was classified as slightly harmful while tebufenozide (20.43%) and flupyradifurone (12.89%) were categorized as harmless classes. Hence, based on obtained results, it can be concluded that flupyradifurone than clothianidin are harmless while tebufenozide is less hazardous on C. carnea population. We also measured the esterase enzyme activities of the C. carnea as biomarkers of sublethal exposure to insecticides. The results showed that alpha and beta-esterase activity in treated insects with clothianidin and flupyradifurone was increased (compared to the control), while the enzymatic activity was reduced in insects with tebufenozide treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysoperla carnea 3aPsyllidae 3abiomarkers 3aclothianidin 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3aglass 3ainstars 3alethal concentration 50 3alife tables 3alongevity 3aprogeny 3asurvival rate 3atebufenozide1 aTorshizi, Hosein-Reza Rezaei1 aVafaei-Shooshtari, Reza1 aFaravardeh, Leila1 aRafaei-Karehroudi, Zahra0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2021 Dec., v. 41, no. 4 p.2351-2359dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-020-00407-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013700159500001900296520121100315592002801526650001201554650001701566650001101583650001601594650001001610650001501620650002401635650002401659650001701683700001301700700001401713700002001727700001601747700001601763773012801779856007401907852000901981655001201990IND60735273620221120205331.0210423e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073527362DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130815262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yaoyao 10aQuantifying the Cooling Effect and Scale of Large Inner-City Lakes Based on Landscape Patterns: A Case Study of Hangzhou and Nanjing  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe rapid urbanization worldwide has brought various environmental problems. The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is one of the most concerning issues because of its strong relation with daily lives. Water bodies are generally considered a vital resource to relieve the UHI. In this context, it is critical to develop a method for measuring the cooling effect and scale of water bodies in urban areas. In this study, West Lake and Xuanwu Lake, two famous natural inner-city lakes, are selected as the measuring targets. The scatter plot and multiple linear regression model were employed to detect the relationship between the distance to the lake and land surface temperature based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) and Sentinel-2 data. The results show that West Lake and Xuanwu Lake massively reduced the land surface temperature within a few hundred meters (471 m for West Lake and 336 m for Xuanwu Lake) and have potential cooling effects within thousands of meters (2900 m for West Lake and 3700 m for Xuanwu Lake). The results provide insights for urban planners to manage tradeoffs between the large lake design in urban areas and the cooling effect demands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acase studies 3acities 3aheat island 3alakes 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3asurface temperature 3aurbanization1 aLi, Yao 1 aHou, Hao 1 aMurayama, Yuji 1 aWang, Ruci 1 aHu, Tangao 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130815263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520140300293592002801696650002401724650001101748650002001759650001501779650002501794650001201819650001101831650001301842650001601855650001901871650001501890650001801905650001101923650001101934650002101945700001501966700001401981700001201995700001202007700001602019700001602035773012102051856008102172852000902253655001202262IND60580766320221118024017.0170929e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058076632DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-016-0632-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Haiqing10aEstimation of Sugar Beet Aboveground Biomass by Band Depth Optimization of Hyperspectral Canopy Reflectance  ap. 795-803.  aAboveground biomass of sugar beet influences tuber growth and sugar accumulation. Thus, accurate, rapid, and non-destructive technique of biomass estimation is important to optimize the crop management practices to attain the required aboveground biomass to support high tuber yields and optimal sugar content. The current research aimed to evaluate the performance of hyperspectral indices and band depth analysis, to remotely assess the aboveground biomass in sugar beet. The biomass and hyperspectral reflectance were collected at different growth stages in experimental and farmers’ fields. The model development was based on sugar beet plants sampled at various times during the growing period subject to seven nitrogen rates. The results showed that accuracy of biomass estimation was greater when using vegetation indices involving red edge bands (680–740 nm) as compared to that using the red light-based indices. Four types of optimized band depth information (band depth, band depth ratio, normalized band depth index, and band depth normalized to band area) involving the red edge further increased the accuracy of biomass estimation. This study demonstrated as the sugar beet biomass increased towards later growing period, biomass estimation using red light-based vegetation indices were less accurate as compared to that using band depth analysis in the vicinity of the red edge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acanopy 3acrop management 3acrop yield 3adevelopmental stages 3afarmers 3amodels 3anitrogen 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asugar beet 3asugar content 3asugars 3atubers 3avegetation index1 aShi, Shude1 aWang, Hui1 aLi, Fei1 aLi, Zhe1 aAlva, Ashok1 aZhang, Ziyi0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2017 Oct., v. 45, no. 5 p.795-803dSpringer Indiax0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-016-0632-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245013800175520100200313592002801315650002101343650001201364650001501376650002301391650002101414650001801435650002501453650001301478650001801491653002401509653001401533653001701547653002001564700001601584700003101600773009101631856009001722852000901812655001201821IND60758338120221121220643.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075833812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Tukendra12aA critical review on early-warning electrochemical system on microbial fuel cell-based biosensor for on-site water quality monitoring  aThe microbial fuel cell (MFC) sensor is a very promising self-powered self-sustainable system for early warning water quality detection.

The results indicate that both C. laurentii and the CMC treatment suppressed P. digitatum conidia germination. In addition, C. laurentii growth in vitro was not affected by low CMC concentrations, nevertheless, the biofilm of C. laurentii was enhanced. Compared with the control fruit, the grapefruit had a lower green mould in all treatments. Significantly synergistic effects were caused by combining C. laurentii and CMC on minimum decay incidence and lesion diameter. Combined treatment induced defence enzyme activities, including chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, together with disease tolerance-associated total phenol. Also, this combination inhibited the pathogen growth by adhered to the hyphae and reduced its infection in fruit wounds. Moreover, the commercial quality parameters in the combined treatment of C. laurentii and CMC, including weight loss, total soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and titratable acidity, were superior to single treatment. The combination of C. laurentii and CMC can not only control postharvest decay but also maintain fruit qualities. Thus, it can be used in grapefruit for commercial purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptococcus laurentii 3aPenicillium digitatum 3aascorbic acid 3abiofilm 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acatechol oxidase 3achitinase 3aconidia 3afruits 3agermination 3agrapefruits 3ahyphae 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apostharvest diseases 3asynergism 3atitratable acidity 3aweight loss 0aGreen mould 0aGrapefruit fruit1 aLi, Wenqing1 aMa, Diantong1 aLiu, Yun1 aYang, Haiyan1 aLin, Jing1 aSong, Gang1 aNaik, Nithesh1 aGuo, Zhanhu1 aWang, Fang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 June 30, v. 181 p.253-262dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.1553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010300166300001600269520096700285592002801252650002601280650002001306650002001326653000701346653000801353653001201361653001401373653002001387653001901407653001001426700002501436700002001461700002001481700002301501700002101524700002201545700002001567773011901587856008201706852000901788655001201797IND60581442920221117203317.0190131e20180216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058144292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2017.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWruck, Florian10aProtein Folding Mediated by Trigger Factor and Hsp70: New Insights from Single-Molecule Approaches  ap. 438-449.  aChaperones assist in protein folding, but what this common phrase means in concrete terms has remained surprisingly poorly understood. We can readily measure chaperone binding to unfolded proteins, but how they bind and affect proteins along folding trajectories has remained obscure. Here we review recent efforts by our labs and others that are beginning to pry into this issue, with a focus on the chaperones trigger factor and Hsp70. Single-molecule methods are central, as they allow the stepwise process of folding to be followed directly. First results have already revealed contrasts with long-standing paradigms: rather than acting only “early” by stabilizing unfolded chain segments, these chaperones can bind and stabilize partially folded structures as they grow to their native state. The findings suggest a fundamental redefinition of the protein folding problem and a more extensive functional repertoire of chaperones than previously assumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat-shock protein 70 3aprotein binding 3aprotein folding 0aTF 0aMBP 0afolding 0achaperone 0asingle-molecule 0atrigger factor 0aHsp701 aAvellaneda, Mario J.1 aKoers, Eline J.1 aMinde, David P.1 aMayer, Matthias P.1 aKramer, Günter,1 aMashaghi, Alireza1 aTans, Sander J.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2018 Feb. 16, v. 430, no. 4 p.438-449dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2017.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013700162300001800299520111500317592002801432650002601460650002701486650002301513650001501536650001301551650001301564650002001577650001401597650002001611650003801631650002401669650001801693650001901711650001601730650001201746650001401758650001901772700002601791700002901817700002201846773012801868856007401996852000902070655001202079IND60656683520221118033717.0190814e20130822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065668352DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40893k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavaiuolo, Marina10aDevelopment and optimization of an ELISA based method to detect Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157 in fresh vegetables  ap. 4622-4627.  aFood-borne pathogen contamination of fresh produce represents a crucial problem in terms of food safety and economic losses. To avoid outbreaks and release of contaminated products in the market, food producers must assure that safety and control measures are followed throughout the production chain. Since traditional methods are complex and time consuming, the use of rapid and reliable methods is needed for a reproducible detection of low pathogen levels prior to packaging. To respond to this need, an indirect ELISA assay was developed to detect the presence of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157. Bacteria isolation procedure, antibody working concentration and limit of detection were studied and optimized to verify the presence of the two bacteria on cucumber. Incubation times for antigen (overnight, 4 °C), antibodies (60 minutes, 25 °C) and for substrate reaction (30 min, 25 °C) were selected. Results show that the ELISA method was highly sensitive with a detection limit lower than 10³ CFU g⁻¹ and relatively fast because bacteria isolation was achieved from 1 to 7 hours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aanalytical methods 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abacteria 3acontrol methods 3acucumbers 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afinancial economics 3afood industry 3afood pathogens 3afood safety 3amarkets 3apackaging 3araw vegetables1 aParamithiotis, Spiros1 aDrosinos, Eleftherios H.1 aFerrante, Antonio0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Aug. 22, v. 5, no. 18 p.4622-4627dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40893k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03930naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010900171300001400280520224400294592002802538650001902566650002802585650003302613650001802646650001602664650001702680650003602697650003002733650001302763650001502776650002602791650001402817650002502831650001702856653002102873653003002894653003102924653001902955653002002974700002302994700002103017700001903038700002803057700002203085700002103107700002003128700001903148700002203167773009703189856008103286852000903367655001203376IND60560238920221123004318.0170215e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056023892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2016.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBargalló, Manel E.10aUtility of Systematic Isolation of immune cell subsets from HIV-infected individuals for miRNA profiling  ap. 12-19.  aPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are frequently used for genomic analyses, but several factors can affect the yield and integrity of nucleic acids, including the methods of cell collection and isolation. The goal of this work was to analyze the utility of systematic isolation of different immune cell subsets by immunomagnetic separation and the RNA integrity after isolated cells from samples of HIV-infected patients.PBMC from Healthy Controls (HC, n=15), Elite Controllers (EC, n=15), Viremic Controllers (VC, n=15), Viremic Progressors (VP, n=15) and HIV-infected patients on therapy (ART, n=15) were isolated by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Subsets were separated with monoclonal antibodies (CD56, CD14, CD4, and CD8) conjugated to microbeads. We evaluated the yield and purity of each subset isolated from PBMCs under resting and activated conditions; LPS, anti-CD3/CD28 and anti-CD16 were used to activate monocytes, PBMC, T cells and NK cells, respectively. The quality of extracted RNA was tested by 2100 Bioanalyzer.In resting conditions, the average yield of CD14+ (monocytes) was decreased (p=0.021) in HIV+ patients compared with healthy controls. CD56+ (Natural Killer-NKs; p=0.03) and CD8+ (Cytotoxic T lymphocytes-CTL p=0.001) cells were increased in HIV+ patients after 72h of activation. The purity assay detected significant differences in CD14+ (p≤0.001) and CD8+ (p=0.034) subpopulations when comparing PBMC isolated either from healthy controls or HIV+ patients. The number of activated cells in HIV+ presented differences in CD8 subset (p=0.003). Finally, similar quantities of high quality RNA were extracted from immune cells subsets obtained by our method. Specifically, we show that Bioanalyzer electrophenograms reveal optimal RIN values in HIV positive and negative patients in resting condition (EC:8;HC:6.5;VC:8.80;VP:8;HAART:7.5) and activated condition (EC:9;HC:6.7;VC:8.2;VP:7.2;HAART:8.6).This method allowed us to obtain a sufficient quantity of different isolated immune cell subsets from HIV–infected individuals at different disease stages. Moreover, the assessed qualities of nucleic acids allow us to perform subsequent molecular studies, such as microRNA profiling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHIV long-term survivors 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3acontrollers 3acytotoxicity 3adensity gradient centrifugation 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3amicroRNA 3amicrobeads 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amonocytes 3anatural killer cells 3atherapeutics 0aHIV+ populations 0aImmunomagnetic separation 0aRIN (RNA integrity number) 0aFlow cytometry 0aImmune response1 aGuardo, Alberto C.1 aMaleno, Maria J.1 aMiralles, Laia1 aEgaña-Gorroño, Lander1 aEscribà, Tuixent1 aGarcía, Felipe,1 aGatell, Jose M.1 aArnedo, Mireia1 aPlana, Montserrat0 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2017 Mar., v. 442 p.12-19dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2016.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245028500160300001800445520083700463592002801300650002101328650002201349650000901371653003201380653005401412653002201466700001501488773015301503856007701656852000901733655001201742IND60521995420221120183613.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052199542DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1994-12032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuster, M.10a(Se,O)-Koordinierte Komplexe niedervalenter Hauptgruppenmetalle: Die Kristallstruktur von Bis(N,N-Diethyl-N′-benzoylselenoureato)blei(II) / (S e,O)-Coordinated Complexes of Subvalent Main Group Metals: The Crystal Structure of Bis(N ,N -diethyl-N′-benzoylselenoureato)lead(II)  ap. 1615-1619.  aBis(N,N-diethyl-N′-benzoylselenoureato)lead(II) has been prepared and characterized by single-crystal structure analysis.

Given its species diversity, the broad biogeographical and ecological range, and the variation in morphology, chromosome numbers and ecological interactions, the genus presents a rich source for intriguing and yet unanswered questions. Epidendrum is also a prime candidate to study speciation and this makes establishing precise species boundaries and diversity estimates in the genus extremely important. Through the recognition and discovery of hundreds of undescribed taxa, the number of formally described Epidendrum species has grown from 1000 to 1800 in the last two decades, while projections suggest the genus may have up to ca. 2400 species. This notorious underestimation of species diversity has serious consequences in many macroecological studies, including speciation, biogeographical patterns, diversification processes, and conservation priorities. Such a large number of unrecognized species in the genus has multiple unforeseen negative consequences and closing the gap between the described and projected diversity needs to become a priority. The isthmus of Costa Rica and Panama, one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, is also a center of diversity of Epidendrum. One out of every six species in the genus is present in the region and half of them are endemic. In the current paper, 20 new species are described from the isthmus and new records and exclusions are presented for both countries. Many of the newly recognized species had previously been included within broader circumscriptions of other taxa or had simply been misidentified. They represent a good example of how taxonomy can cause a sudden shift from a scenario where a few broadly distributed and unthreatened species become multiple potentially threatened species for which the population size, distribution and conservation status need to be urgently established. Epidendrum is the most specious orchid genus in Costa Rica and Panama, as well as most other Latin American countries, but species are poorly represented in herbaria and literature, and indetermination or incorrect determination of specimens is widespread. This results in a severe underestimation of Epidendrum species both in terms of species richness and their conservation priority levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpidendrum 3aNeotropics 3acenter of diversity 3achromosomes 3aconservation status 3ageographical distribution 3anew species 3apopulation size 3aspecies richness 3athreatened species 3aCosta Rica 3aPanama 0aconservation 0ataxonomy 0aspeciation0 tHarvard papers in botany.g2021 Dec. 31, v. 26, no. 2 p.299-369dHarvard University Botany LibrarieswJournal:jnl44547x1043-45347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3100/hpib.v26iss2.2021.n13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011800163300001200281520103900293592002801332596005901360596007501419596007101494650001501565650001501580650000801595650001101603650002001614650003101634650001901665650001201684650000901696650000701705650001501712650001901727650001001746700001901756700002001775700001601795700005701811773014101868856008302009852000902092655001202101IND60777648220221117195133.0220628e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077764822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-022-05628-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Wenshu10aCu/Fe Bimetallic Modified Fly Ash: An Economical Adsorbent for Enhanced Phosphorus Removal from Aqueous Solutions  ap. 182.  aExcessive phosphorus in water causes eutrophication and leads to the ecological unbalance. The main treatment for eutrophication is to remove the phosphorus in aqua system effectively and efficiently. A composite of fly ash (FA) and metal compound was proposed as the effective sorbent for phosphorus removal, attributed to the active metal compositions and stable structure, as well as the wide source availability of economy. Copper and iron were co-precipitated as a bimetallic compound (BM), well adhered onto fly ash, to acquire the composite sorbent of Cu/Fe-BM@FA. Through the characterizations of XPS, FTIR etc., phosphorus adsorption was achieved mainly upon heterogeneous chemisorption and electrostatic attraction. Consequently, from pH 3 to pH 6, phosphorus of 98% on average was removed in solutions of 0 ~ 40 mg P/L, and the maximum adsorption capacity was up to 32.88 mg/g. Promisingly, the composite sorbent of FA and copper/iron bimetallic compound was a potential and economic selection for phosphorus removal.  aPublisher supplied data  a21506028cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019YFE0119200cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aDUT20LK43cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aair 3acopper 3acoprecipitation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aeutrophication 3afly ash 3airon 3apH 3aphosphorus 3asoil pollution 3awater1 aLi, Shuangqing1 aJiang, Minqiang1 aHe, Gaohong1 aZhang, Wenjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3982-35010 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2022 June, v. 233, no. 6 p.182-182dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05628-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245007500210300001800285520169800303592002802001596005502029650002402084650002402108650001802132650001902150650003002169650002602199650001102225650001302236650002102249650002602270650002102296650001902317650002702336650001902363650001502382650001402397700006402411773010102475856008202576852000902658655001202667IND60619500320221120232808.0190214e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061950032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-017-0212-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Justin E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2941-745110aDoes Nutrient Availability Regulate Seagrass Response to Elevated CO2?  ap. 1269-1282.  aFuture increases in oceanic carbon dioxide concentrations (CO₂₍ₐq₎) may provide a benefit to submerged plants by alleviating photosynthetic carbon limitation. However, other environmental factors (for example, nutrient availability) may alter how seagrasses respond to CO₂₍ₐq₎ by regulating the supply of additional resources required to support growth. Thus, questions remain in regard to how other factors influence CO₂₍ₐq₎ effects on submerged vegetation. This study factorially manipulated CO₂₍ₐq₎ and nutrient availability, in situ, within a subtropical seagrass bed for 350 days, and examined treatment effects on leaf productivity, shoot density, above- and belowground biomass, nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, and sediment organic carbon (Cₒᵣg). Clear, open-top chambers were used to replicate CO₂₍ₐq₎ forecasts for the year 2100, whereas nutrient availability was manipulated via sediment amendments of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer. We provide modest evidence of a CO₂ effect, which increased seagrass aboveground biomass. CO₂₍ₐq₎ enrichment had no effect on nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, or sediment Cₒᵣg content. Nutrient addition increased leaf productivity and leaf N content, however did not alter above- or belowground biomass, shoot density, carbohydrate storage, or Cₒᵣg content. Treatment interactions were not significant, and thus NP availability did not influence seagrass responses to elevated CO₂₍ₐq₎. This study demonstrates that long-term carbon enrichment may alter the structure of shallow seagrass meadows, even in relatively nutrient-poor, oligotrophic systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aDBI-0620409cDivision of Biological Infrastructure 3aaboveground biomass 3abelowground biomass 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aenvironmental factors 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3aorganic carbon 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aphotosynthesis 3aseagrasses 3asediments1 aFourqurean, James W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0811-85000 tEcosystems.g2018 Nov., v. 21, no. 7 p.1269-1282dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-017-0212-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01201naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245005500183300001600238520026300254592002800517650001600545650001100561651001100572700004100583700002800624700002500652773014000677856008500817852000900902655001200911IND60762851020221120081307.0220115e20211231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076285102DNAL7 a10.3100/hpib.v26iss2.2021.n22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-González, Gustavo A.10aNew Reports of Galeandra (Orchidaceae) from Mexico  ap. 371-401.  aHere we report two species as new for Mexico, G. arundinis and G. sobralioides, and discuss the report of G. batemanii for the state of Tabasco.

To estimate the potential for carbon (C) accumulation in degraded grassland soils, we first need to understand how SOM content influences the transformation of plant C and its stabilization within the soil matrix. We conducted a greenhouse experiment using C₃ soils with six levels of SOM content; we planted the C₄ grass Cleistogenes squarrosa or added its litter to the soils to investigate how SOM content regulates the storage of new soil C derived from litter and roots, the decomposition of extant soil C, and the formation of soil aggregates. We found that with the increase in SOM content, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and the mineralization of litter C increased. Both the litter addition and planted treatments increased the amount of new C inputs to soil. However, the mineralization of extant soil C was significantly accelerated by the presence of living roots but was not affected by litter addition. Accordingly, the soil C content was significantly higher in the litter addition treatments but was not affected by the planted treatments by the end of the experiment. The soil macroaggregate fraction increased with SOM content and was positively related to MBC. Our experiment suggests that as SOM content increases, plant growth and soil microbial activity increase, which allows microbes to process more plant-derived C and promote new soil C formation. Although long-term field experiments are needed to test the robustness of our findings, our greenhouse experiment suggests that the interactions between SOM content and plant C inputs should be considered when evaluating soil C turnover in degraded grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data  aFP/2007-2013cthe European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme  a31522011cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2014CB954003cChinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research  a2017YFC0503900cChinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research 3aC4 plants 3aKengia squarrosa 3afield experimentation 3agrasses 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse experimentation 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial carbon 3amicroorganisms 3amineralization 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asoil aggregates 3asoil carbon 3asoil degradation 3asoil organic matter1 aLi, Ping1 aSayer, Emma J.1 aZhang, Beibei1 aWang, Jing1 aQiao, Chunlian1 aPeng, Ziyang1 aDiao, Liwei1 aChi, Yonggang1 aLiu, Weixing1 aLiu, Lingli0 tEcosystems.g2018 Nov., v. 21, no. 7 p.1377-1389dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-018-0227-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245007900182300001600261520127500277592002801552650001801580650001001598650001001608650001601618650001301634650001101647650001001658651001301668653000901681653005001690653001501740773014001755856008501895852000901980655001201989IND60762851120221120081205.0220115e20211231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076285112DNAL7 a10.3100/hpib.v26iss2.2021.n32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAymard-Corredor, Gerardo A.12aA New Species of Neea (Nyctaginaceae: Pisonieae) for the Flora of Colombia  ap. 403-413.  aNeea gustaviaefolia, a new species from the wet forests from “Sierra de La Macarena” and upper “Guaviare” river regions of Colombia (Guaviare and Meta departments) is described, illustrated, and its morphological relationships are discussed. This new species is a small tree of 6 m tall, on the basis of its alternate, oblanceolate larger leaves and a shorter terminal cymes inflorescence, verticillate (with three opposite primary branches), it does not appear to be closely allied to any other Neea species. This new species shares several other features with five species (N. alumnorum, N. brevipedunculata, N. floribunda, N. itanhaensis and N. verticillata). Morphologically, however, it is comparable to N. alumnorum and N. itanhaensis but it differs in its leaves, inflorescences, staminal perianth, and stamens number. In addition, ecological, floristic, and geological notes about the “La Sierra de La Macarena are included. A key for identifying species of Neea to Colombia is also provided.

To overcome these issues, the use of eco-friendly materials for designing such devices is attaining much attention. This current work presents a recycled material-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) made of plastic waste and carbon-coated paper wipes (C@PWs), in which the PWs are also collected from a waste bin. The resultant C@PW-based TENG is then used for powering low-power electronic devices and, later, to generate a Morse code from a wearable for autonomous communication. In this application, the end users decode the Morse code from a customized LabVIEW program and read the transmitted signal. With further redesigning, a 9-segment keyboard is developed using nine-TENGs, connected to an Arduino controller to display the 9-segment actuation on a computer screen. Based on the above analysis, our C@PW-TENG device is expected to have an impact on future self-powered sensors and internet of things systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aEP/S02106X/1cEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000266  aNAcRoyal Academy of Engineeringdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000287 3aInternet 3acomputers 3aelectric generators 3aelectronic wastes 3apaper 3apollution 3asemiconductors 3atoxicity 0atriboelectric nanogenerator 0awaste materials 0aflexible electronics 0awearables 0aautonomous internet of things1 aDharmasena, R.

To reveal the inhibition of (NH₄)₂HPO₄ on the wheat dust explosion, a vertical pipeline was built to study the explosion of wheat dust with different particle size distribution under the addition of (NH₄)₂HPO₄. The characteristics of wheat dust explosion were recorded by high-speed photography, ion probe and micro-thermocouple. The pyrolysis behaviors of wheat dust and (NH₄)₂HPO₄ were investigated by simultaneous thermal analyzer, and the explosion residues were characterized by FTIR and XPS. The results indicate that the flame propagation distance, velocity and temperature were significantly decreased under 25% (NH₄)₂HPO₄, and the wheat dust explosion was significantly inhibited. In the explosion reaction zone, the ion current increases and then decreases with the content of (NH₄)₂HPO₄ increases. Furthermore, the inhibition mechanism of (NH₄)₂HPO₄ on wheat dust explosion was presented by analyzing the samples and residues of wheat dust explosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adiammonium phosphate 3adust 3aparticle size distribution 3aphotography 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3awheat 0aWheat dust explosion 0aExplosion flame 0a(NH4)2HPO4 0aExplosion inhibition1 aChen, Xianfeng1 aDai, Huaming1 aHuang, Chuyuan1 aLiu, Jing1 aHe, Song1 aYuan, Bihe1 aYang, Pan1 aZhu, Huiwei1 aLiang, Guangqian1 aZhang, Bingqian0 tPowder technology.g2020 May 01, v. 367 p.751-761dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005900168300002000227520173300247592002801980650002102008650001202029650002302041650002302064700001802087700005302105773011602158856008502274852000902359655001202368IND60754852920221122103449.0211026e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c017932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Chuxuan10aElectropumping Phenomenon in Modified Carbon Nanotubes  ap. 12318-12326.  aControlling the water transport in a given direction is essential to the design of novel nanofluidic devices, which is still a challenge because of thermal fluctuations on the nanoscale. In this work, we find an interesting electropumping phenomenon for charge-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through a series of molecular dynamics simulations. In electric fields, the flowing counterions on the CNT inner surface provide a direct driving force for water conduction. Specifically, the dynamics of cations and anions exhibit distinct behaviors that lead to thoroughly different water dynamics in positively and negatively charged CNTs. Because of the competition between the increased ion number and ion–CNT interaction, the cation flux displays an interesting maximum behavior with the increase in surface charge density; however, the anion flux rises further at higher charge density because it is less attractive to the surface. Thus, the anion flux is always several times larger than cation flux that induces a higher water flux in positive CNTs with nearly 100% pumping efficiency, which highly exceeds the efficiency of pristine CNTs. With the change in charge density, the translocation time, occupancy number, and radial density profiles for water and ions also demonstrate a nontrivial difference for positive and negative CNTs. Furthermore, the ion flux exhibits an excellent linear relationship with the field strength, leading to the same water flux behavior. For the change in salt concentration, the pumping efficiency for positive CNTs is also nearly 100%. Our results provide significant new insight into the ionic transport through modified CNTs and should be helpful for the design of nanometer water pumps.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acations 3amolecular dynamics 3asalt concentration1 aZhao, Yunzhen1 aSu, Jiaye1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9894-578X0 tLangmuir.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 37, no. 42 p.12318-12326dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c017933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007900167300001800246520125700264592002801521650002401549650001001573650001801583650002201601650002501623650001301648650003401661700001601695700001601711773012201727856008101849852000901930655001201939IND60624213120221120154429.0181202e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062421312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0339-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇamurlu, H.

Experiments were performed for durations in the range of 15 min to 3 h. Reaction products were subjected to powder X-ray diffraction analysis, chemical analysis and were examined by scanning electron microscope. Formation of hexagonal boron nitride was found to be complete in 3 h with most forming in the initial 2 h. Boron carbide was found to exist in the reaction products of the experiments in which hexagonal boron nitride formation was not complete. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of boron carbide in the carbothermic production of hexagonal boron nitride. For this purpose, conversion reaction of boron carbide into hexagonal boron nitride was studied. Boron carbide used in these experiments was produced in the same conditions that hexagonal boron nitride was formed, but under argon atmosphere. It was found that formation of hexagonal boron nitride from boron carbide—boric oxide mixtures was slower than activated carbon—boric oxide mixtures. It was concluded that boron carbide is not a necessary intermediate product in the carbothermic production of hexagonal boron nitride.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3aboron 3aboron nitride 3achemical analysis 3aintermediate product 3anitrogen 3ascanning electron microscopes1 aSevinç, N.1 aTopkaya, Y.0 tJournal of materials science.g2006 Aug., v. 41, no. 15 p.4921-4927dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-0339-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011800167300001600285520098300301592002801284650001601312650001301328650001201341650001201353650003101365650002201396650001001418653002001428653002601448653002201474653002201496653002701518700001801545700001401563700001601577700002001593700001401613773010101627856008501728852000901813655001201822IND60688976420221121064349.0210212e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068897642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Mingwei10aAtomization simulation and preparation of 24CrNiMoY alloy steel powder using VIGA technology at high gas pressure  ap. 724-739.  aTo more accurately analyze the atomization process of vacuum induction melting gas atomization (VIGA) technology at high gas pressure, a new method was proposed based on the combination of VOF and DPM theories. Numerical simulations and powder preparation tests were used to verify the applicability of this method. The results indicated that the large eddy simulation model could accurately visualize the large droplet separation process from the liquid column in the primary atomization.

We sampled sediments and polychaete worms from mudflats in the Bay of Fundy to investigate the bioaccumulation of mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in the coastal invertebrate food web. Hg concentrations in the sediments were low (<20 μg kg−1). Labile Hg (methanol/KOH sediment extraction) in surface sediments (0–1 cm) was positively correlated with Hg bioaccumulation by surface sediment-ingesting polychaetes but, surprisingly, there was a negative correlation between δ15N (i.e. trophic level) and THg bioaccumulation factors in polychaete worms. Worms feeding on deeper sediments contained the greatest MeHg concentrations (69.6 μg kg−1). Polychaetes are an important vector for Hg biomagnification to the coastal avian food web. This research demonstrates that feeding depth and method of feeding are more important than trophic position or sediment Hg concentrations for predicting Hg bioaccumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3abioaccumulation 3abioavailability 3abirds 3acorrelation 3afeeding methods 3afood webs 3ainvertebrates 3amercury 3amethanol 3amethylmercury compounds 3apotassium hydroxide 3aprediction 3asediments 2aAnimals 2aEcology 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFood Chain 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aMercuryxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPolychaetaxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism. 0aMercury 0aPolychaete worm 0aBurrowing 0aTrophic position 0aSediment1 aCanário, João1 aGerwing, Travis G.1 aMallory, Mark L.1 aO'Driscoll, Nelson J.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 May, v. 176 p.18-25dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024003500159040001800194100001900212245010200231300001600333506007600349520117100425592002801596506003701624650002001661650001401681650001101695650001201706650001901718650003801737650002001775650001101795650001801806650002301824700001701847773008001864856008101944852000902025655001202034IND60081698320221207061220.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008169832DNAL7 a244026492pmid7 aPMC4165836 [Available on 10/01/15]2pmcid7 a10.1007/s13280-013-0483-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSummers, J.

Human well-being is described by four primary elements—basic human needs, economic needs, environmental needs, and subjective well-being. These elements can interact in a myriad of ways to influence overall well-being. What makes changes in human well-being sustainable for a population or a nation? Two major interactional concepts can push changes in human well-being toward a sustainable state in space and time—social equity and intergenerational equity. The concept of social equity distributes well-being over space, ensuring the fair treatment of all members of society promoting spatial sustainability of a well-being decision. The concept of intergenerational equity distributes well-being through time, ensuring the well-being of present and future generations of a population or nation, promoting temporal sustainability of a well-being decision. The roles of social and intergenerational equity in terms of their influence on human well-being are examined with a focus on more sustainable decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adecision making 3aeconomics 3ahumans 3asociety 3aspace and time 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDecision Making 2aHumans 2aSocial Change 2aSocial Environment1 aSmith, L.

Cells of the strain were rod-shaped and colonies on LB agar were faint yellow. Strain TJ48ᵀ was positive for catalase and oxidase and the optimal condition for growth was 28 °C, with 1% (w/v) NaCl and at pH 7.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain TJ48ᵀ was closely related to the genus Rhodobacter and the closest relatives were Rhodobacter ovatus JA234ᵀ (97.4%, 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Rhodobacter azotoformans KA25ᵀ (96.5%). The DNA G + C content of strain TJ48ᵀ was 64.7 mol%. Genome-to-genome distance calculations (GGDC) and ANIb values from genomic comparison between the genomes of strain TJ48ᵀ and the related reference species were less than 70% and 95%, respectively. The major cellular fatty acids were summed feature 8 (C₁₈:₁ω7c and/or C₁₈:₁ω6c) and C₁₇:₀. The only isoprenoid quinone detected was Ubiquinone-10 (Q-10). The polar lipid profile contains diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminophospholipid, one unidentified phospholipids, and three unidentified lipids. Strain TJ48ᵀ significantly increased the dry weight of roots (26.2–66.3%) and shoots (16.7–37.8%) of pakchoi and reduced the Cd (50.2–60.1%) and Pb (55.6–60.9%) contents in pakchoi shoots and roots. On the basis of the physiological, genotypic and genomic characteristics, the strain TJ48ᵀ represent a novel species of the genus Rhodobacter, and the name Rhodobacter xinxiangensis sp. nov. is proposed (type strain TJ48ᵀ = CCTCC AB2019120ᵀ = KCTC 72510ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data  a41907143cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20A180023cEducation Department of Henan Province 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3aRhodobacter azotoformans 3aRhodobacter ovatus 3aagar 3acatalase 3acoenzyme Q10 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheavy metals 3aisoprenoids 3alipid composition 3amicrobiology 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3asequence homology 3aChina1 aWang, Tiejun1 aChen, Zhaojin1 aLi, Yadong1 aYao, Lunguang0 tArchives of microbiology.g2020 Sept., v. 202, no. 7 p.1741-1748dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-01885-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024003500159040001800194100002200212245007900234300001600313506007600329520116000405592002801565506003701593650001101630650001301641650002301654650001401677650001801691650002201709650002701731650002901758650001101787650002001798650003401818650004801852650005701900651001101957651003301968773008002001856008102081852000902162655001202171IND60081698520221207061103.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008169852DNAL7 a245633932pmid7 aPMC4165831 [Available on 10/01/15]2pmcid7 a10.1007/s13280-014-0491-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrăvălie, Remus10aNuclear Weapons Tests and Environmental Consequences: A Global Perspective  ap. 729-744.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe beginning of the atomic age marked the outset of nuclear weapons testing, which is responsible for the radioactive contamination of a large number of sites worldwide. The paper aims to analyze nuclear weapons tests conducted in the second half of the twentieth century, highlighting the impact of radioactive pollution on the atmospheric, aquatic, and underground environments. Special attention was given to the concentration of main radioactive isotopes which were released, such as ¹⁴C, ¹³⁷Cs, and ⁹⁰Sr, generally stored in the atmosphere and marine environment. In addition, an attempt was made to trace the spatial delimitation of the most heavily contaminated sites worldwide, and to note the human exposure which has caused a significantly increased incidence of thyroidal cancer locally and regionally. The United States is one of the important examples of assessing the correlation between the increase in the thyroid cancer incidence rate and the continental-scale radioactive contamination with ¹³¹I, a radioactive isotope which was released in large amounts during the nuclear tests carried out in the main test site, Nevada.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahumans 3aisotopes 3amarine environment 3apollution 3aradionuclides 3athyroid neoplasms 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHumans 2aNuclear Weapons 2aRadioactive Falloutxanalysis 2aRadioactive Pollutantsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aThyroid Neoplasmsxchemically inducedxepidemiology. 3aNevada 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.0 tAmbio.g2014 Oct., v. 43, no. 6 p.729-744dSpringer-Verlagx0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-014-0491-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245007600180500001900256520124800275592002801523650002801551650001401579650001601593650003801609650001601647650002901663650001401692650002301706650001801729650001401747653000901761653000901770653000901779653000801788653000801796653001201804653001701816653001001833653000901843653001001852653001301862653000801875653000901883653000901892653000901901653001001910653001101920653001701931653001701948653002801965653001301993653002202006700002002028700002002048700002202068700001902090700001902109773011902128856008502247852000902332655001202341IND60736466620221116152846.0210610e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073646662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2021.1589552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatanapirunhakit, Patamat10aSphingolipids in HDL – Potential markers for adaptation to pregnancy?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) exhibits many functions that render it an effective endothelial protective agent and may underlie its potential role in protecting the maternal vascular endothelium during pregnancy. In non-pregnant individuals, the HDL lipidome is altered in metabolic disease compared to healthy individuals and is linked to reduced cholesterol efflux, an effect that can be reversed by lifestyle management. Specific sphingolipids such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) have been shown to mediate the vaso-dilatory effects of plasma HDL via interaction with the endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway. This review describes the relationship between plasma HDL and vascular function during healthy pregnancy and details how this is lost in pre-eclampsia, a disorder of pregnancy associated with widespread endothelial dysfunction. Evidence of a role for HDL sphingolipids, in particular S1P and ceramide, in cardiovascular disease and in healthy pregnancy and pre-eclampsia is discussed. Available data suggest that HDL-S1P and HDL-ceramide can mediate vascular protection in healthy pregnancy but not in preeclampsia. HDL sphingolipids thus are of potential importance in the healthy maternal adaptation to pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular diseases 3aceramides 3acholesterol 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aendothelium 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alifestyle 3ametabolic diseases 3apre-eclampsia 3apregnancy 0aCERS 0aCERT 0aCETP 0adNK 0aEVT 0aHDL-S1P 0aHDL-ceramide 0aPON-1 0aPLTP 0aSR-B1 0aS1P1–5 0aSPT 0aSPHK 0aSGPP 0aSGPL 0aTNFα 0aVCAM-1 0aPreeclampsia 0aSphingolipid 0aSphingosine-1-phosphate 0aCeramide 0aVascular function1 aKarlsson, Helen1 aMulder, Monique1 aLjunggren, Stefan1 aGraham, Delyth1 aFreeman, Dilys0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 Aug., v. 1866, no. 8 p.158955-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2021.1589553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008400177300002000261520095900281592002801240650002301268650001701291650001801308650002501326650001301351650000901364650001301373650001701386700007001403773011601473856008501589852000901674655001201683IND60754853420221122131736.0211026e20211012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c019532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuglakov, Aleksandr I.10aFibril Assembly and Gelation of Macromolecules with Amphiphilic Repeating Units  ap. 12377-12387.  aThis paper reports the self-assembly of the fibrillar network in a concentrated solution of macromolecules with an amphiphilic structure of repeating units. The investigation of amphiphilic homopolymers and alternating copolymers with the linear and cyclic topologies, the solution with different polymer concentrations and solvent qualities, allows us to conclude that the ability to form a fibrillar gel with branched fibrils and regular subchain thickness is inherent for macromolecules with the solvophobic backbone and solvophilic pendants. The elements of the gel structure, such as the mesh size and fibrillar thickness, the number of cross-links, and their functionality, can be tuned and customized according to the requirements of their application. The results could be helpful for the directed design of the synthetic analogue of the relevant extracellular matrix, in tissue engineering, for fibrotic disease treatment and cell encapsulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3aencapsulation 3aextracellular matrix 3agelation 3agels 3asolvents 3atherapeutics1 aVasilevskaya, Valentina V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0623-04670 tLangmuir.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 37, no. 42 p.12377-12387dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c019533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009700166520103900263592002801302650002301330650005201353650002501405650002401430650002801454650002201482653001401504653002001518653002301538653001301561653001801574653003301592700001501625700001601640700001601656700001701672700001601689700001901705700001801724700001301742700001601755773011201771856008301883852000901966655001201975IND60743714320221118223901.0220606e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074371432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2021.1163772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xiaobin10aRapid PCR powered by microfluidics: A quick review under the background of COVID-19 pandemic  aPCR has been widely used in different fields including molecular biology, pathogen detection, medical diagnosis, food detection and etc. However, the difficulty of promoting PCR in on-site point-of-care testing reflects on challenges relative to its speed, convenience, complexity, and even cost. With the emerging state-of-art of microfluidics, rapid PCR can be achieved with more flexible ways in micro-reactors. PCR plays a critical role in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Under this special background of COVID-19 pandemic, this review focuses on the latest rapid microfluidic PCR. Rapid PCR is concluded in two main features, including the reactor (type, size, material) and the implementation of thermal cycling. Especially, the compromise between speed and sensitivity with microfluidic PCR is explored based on the system ratio of (thermal cycling time)/(reactor size). Representative applications about the detection of pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 viruses based on rapid PCR or other isothermal amplification are discussed as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aanalytical chemistry 3amicrobial detection 3amicrofluidic technology 3amolecular biology 0aRapid PCR 0aThermal cycling 0aPathogen detection 0aCOVID-19 0aMicrofluidics 0aPoint-of-care testing (POCT)1 aLiu, Luyao1 aTu, Yunping1 aZhang, Jing1 aMiao, Guijun1 aZhang, Lulu1 aGe, Shengxiang1 aXia, Ningshao1 aYu, Duli1 aQiu, Xianbo0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 143 p.116377-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2021.1163773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245010000211300001800311520194300329592002802272650002102300650001902321650001602340650001902356650001402375650002102389650001902410650001102429650001102440650001302451650001402464650000902478650001502487650001602502700003202518700002002550773013302570856008202703852000902785655001202794IND60675129220221119032726.0191104e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067512922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-019-01560-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMistriotis, Antonis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4518-709710aBiodegradation of Cellulose in Laboratory-Scale Bioreactors: Experimental and Numerical Studies  ap. 2793-2803.  aStandard tests such as ISO 17556 (Plastics - determination of the ultimate aerobic biodegradability in soil by measuring the oxygen demand in a respirometer or the amount of carbon dioxide evolved. International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland, 2019) or ASTM D5988 (Standard test method for determining aerobic biodegradation of plastic materials in soil. ASTM International, West Conshohocken, 2018) have been developed for measuring the biodegradation of polymers and assessing their biodegradability in soil. In several experiments performed according to these standard tests, the measured biodegradation of cellulose was reported unexpectedly between 80 and 85%. These results are difficult to justify since cellulose is a well-known biodegradable material. In the present study, this phenomenon is explained as the consequence of starvation occurring in a confined bioreactor. It is proposed that the favourable conditions applied to the small-size bioreactors accelerate the proliferation of the microorganisms which are responsible for the biodegradation. Such a dense microbial population may face starvation when cellulose is consumed. It is assumed that starvation causes the secretion of an inhibitory chemical signal, which can diffuse to neighbouring sites still containing food, and suppresses biodegradation. This hypothesis was supported by two experiments. First, it was shown that the final measured biodegradation increased when the microbial growth rate decreased by reducing temperature. In the second experiment, it was shown that the biodegradation proceeded slower when a new cellulose quantity was inserted into a previously used soil substrate. To confirm the hypothesis regarding the presence of an inhibitory starvation factor, which can suppress biodegradation, a Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model was also developed. The KMC simulations reproduced qualitatively the experimental findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3abioreactors 3acarbon dioxide 3acellulose 3amicrobial growth 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aplastics 3asecretion 3asoil 3astarvation 3atemperature1 aPapardaki, Nikoleta-Georgia1 aProvata, Astero0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2019 Dec., v. 27, no. 12 p.2793-2803dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870065x1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-019-01560-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04045naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245008200180300001600262520161500278592002801893650001801921650001301939650001401952650001901966650002001985650001302005650002302018650001902041650001902060650001102079650001802090650001102108650002502119650002002144650002202164650001602186650002402202650002602226650001302252650001202265650004002277650001402317650002802331650003102359650002502390650002802415650002102443650002802464650002302492650005902515650004302574650001102617650000902628650000902637650002402646650001502670650002902685650003702714650002002751650002602771650002102797650002702818650002402845650008102869650002702950700001302977700001502990700001603005700001803021700001903039773010003058856004803158852000903206655001203215IND50067394220221121121615.0130625e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006739422DNAL7 a236606272pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-013-1640-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Yun10aB7-H4 enhances oncogenicity and inhibits apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells  ap. 139-151.  aB7-H4 is expressed in a variety of tumor cells and functions as a negative regulator of T cells. However, clarification is needed as to whether B7-H4 mediates tumorigenesis through mechanisms, such as apoptosis, in addition to mediating tumor immune escape. We investigate the mechanisms involved in enhanced oncogenicity and the inhibition of apoptosis by B7-H4 in pancreatic cancer cells. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for B7-H4 were evaluated for their ability to knockdown B7-H4 mRNA and protein expression in pancreatic cancer cells and the most effective siRNA was selected for investigating the effect of B7-H4 gene silencing in a number of functional assays. The inhibition of B7-H4 increased cell-cell adhesion and decreased the formation of pseudopodia. It also increased the expression of E-cadherin and decreased the expression of vimentin and CD44. B7-H4 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, increased apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells following B7-H4 silencing was demonstrated in vitro by using flow cytometry and in a xenograft tumor model and was associated with increased caspase activity and decreased Erk1/2 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. Loss of B7-H4 function thus prevents tumor growth through many processes, including the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway indicating that B7-H4 is a cancer promoter and a potentially important therapeutic target. B7-H4 inhibition might offer an exciting opportunity to inhibit the progression of human pancreatic cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadhesion 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinogenicity 3acaspases 3acell proliferation 3aflow cytometry 3agene silencing 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3apseudopodia 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3avimentin 2aAnimals 2aHyaluronan Receptorsxbiosynthesis. 2aApoptosis 2aCadherinsxbiosynthesis 2aCarcinogenesisxmetabolism 2aCaspasesxmetabolism 2aCell Adhesionxgenetics 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Movementxgenetics 2aCell Proliferation 2aExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinasesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Nude 2aNeoplasm Transplantation 2aPancreatic Neoplasmsxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aPseudopodiaxgenetics 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Small Interfering 2aSignal Transduction 2aV-Set Domain-Containing T-Cell Activation Inhibitor 1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVimentinxbiosynthesis1 aHong, Bo1 aShen, Ling1 aWu, Zhigang1 aYao, Hangping1 aZhang, Lihuang0 tCell and tissue research.g2013 July, v. 353, no. 1 p.139-151dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-013-1640-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245016000167520100300327592002801330650002201358650002401380650002001404650001401424650002301438650001901461650002001480653001901500653001301519653002801532700001901560700001801579700001701597700001901614700002101633700002501654773010601679856008701785852000901872655001201881IND60768916020221121052228.0220412e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076891602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1269092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Yafan14aThe absolute concentration and bioavailability of trace elements: Two vital parameters affecting anaerobic digestion performance of chicken manure leachate  aIt is currently unclear whether trace elements (TEs) deficiency is due to low bioavailability or low absolute TEs concentrations, especially in high-pH anaerobic digestion (AD) systems. A mixed solution of TEs and EDTA-Na₂ were used separately in mono-AD of chicken manure (CM) leachate to investigate this research gap. The results showed relatively low bioavailability of Fe, Mn, and Zn. The bioavailability of all TEs remained stable along with a gradual increase in total ammonia nitrogen concentration. Both TE and EDTA-Na₂ supplementation improved the bioavailability of TEs, but TEs supplementation also gave a high proportion of soluble TEs. Adding TEs improved methane production efficiency (+38.3%) and decreased the H₂S content. The exchangeable fraction of specific TE (Mo) in H₂/CO₂ pathway was higher in the TEs treatment. TEs bioavailability and absolute concentrations of available TEs are critical aspects that need to be scrutinized to assess the risk of TEs deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioavailability 3aleachates 3amethane production 3apoultry manure 3arisk assessment 0aTrace elements 0aEDTA-Na2 0aChicken manure leachate1 aJanke, Leandro1 aMeng, Xingyao1 aZheng, Zehui1 aZhao, Xiaoling1 aPröter, Jürgen1 aSchäfer, Franziska,0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Apr., v. 350 p.126909-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1269093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009400162300001800256520193300274592002802207650002102235650002202256650002302278650001502301650001602316650002502332650001102357650001102368650001302379650000902392650001702401650001002418650001502428650001502443650001702458650001602475700002102491700001802512773009402530856007302624852000902697655001202706IND60408514920221119084942.0150905e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851492DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.105032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimaldi, Stefania10aModelling the effects of soil type and root distribution on shallow groundwater resources  ap. 4457-4469.  aVegetated, shallow groundwater environments typically have high environmental and economic value. A sound understanding of the complex interactions and feedbacks between surface vegetation and groundwater resources is crucial to managing and maintaining healthy ecosystems while responding to human needs. A vegetated shallow groundwater environment was modelled using the software HYDRUS 2D to investigate the effects of several combinations of soil type and root distributions on shallow groundwater resources. Three rainfall regimes coupled to both natural and anthropogenically affected groundwater conditions were used to investigate the effect that combinations of four soil types and five root distributions can have on (a) groundwater level drops, (b) groundwater depletion, (c) groundwater recharge and (d) water stress conditions. Vegetation with roots distributed across the whole unsaturated zone and vegetation with dimorphic root systems (i.e. roots having larger concentrations both near the surface and the capillary fringe) behaved differently from vegetation growing roots mainly near the saturated zone. Specifically, vegetation with roots in the unsaturated zone caused water‐table drops and groundwater depletions that were half the amount due to deep‐rooted vegetation. Vegetation with a large portion of roots near the soil surface benefited from rainfall and was less vulnerable to water‐table lowering; as such, the fraction of the total area of roots affected by water stress conditions could be 40% smaller than in the case with deep‐rooted vegetation. However, roots uniformly distributed in the unsaturated zone could halve groundwater recharge rates observed in bare soils. Our analysis provided insights that can enable the formulation of site‐ and purpose‐specific management plans to respond to both human and ecosystem water requirements.

KR-1, was previously isolated from pond water collected in Japan. This strain grew at 10 °C to 40 °C (optimum 30 °C), at pH 4.5 to 11.5 (optimum pH 8.0), and in the presence of 2.0% NaCl. Its major cellular fatty acids were C₁₅: ₁ω6 and C₁₆ : ₁ω7c. The quinone system was menaquinone 8. Multilocus sequence analysis based on partial sequences of four housekeeping genes (atpD, dnaA, gyrB and rpoB) showed that branching of Deinococcus sp. KR-1 was distant to those of Deinococcus type strains. The genome average nucleotide identity value between strain KR-1 and its closest related Deinococcus type strain was less than 95.69%. Based on its phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain KR-1 (= HUT-8138ᵀ = KCTC 33977ᵀ) can be considered a novel species within the genus Deinococcus with the proposed name Deinococcus kurensis sp. nov.  aPublisher supplied data  a19K15743cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18H01574cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aDeinococcus 3aJapan 3achemotaxonomy 3amenaquinones 3amicrobiology 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apH 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aquinones1 aItoiri, Yuya1 aIhara, Sota1 aTakeda, Noriyo1 aMatsushika, Akinori1 aKimura, Zen-ichiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1395-86430 tArchives of microbiology.g2020 Sept., v. 202, no. 7 p.1757-1762dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-01845-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013100172300001400303520179700317592002802114650001602142650001302158650001102171650001902182650002102201650001602222650001202238650001102250650001102261650001602272650001302288650001002301650001702311653002002328653003602348653002402384653002202408653003202430653001802462653000802480653000802488653000702496653000802503653000802511653000802519653000702527653000702534653000802541653001602549700004002565700001702605700002002622700002502642700002402667700001702691700002102708700002202729773011402751856008502865852000902950655001202959IND60542598320221121235740.0190403e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054259832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrimicia, Irantzu10aAge, competition, disturbance and elevation effects on tree and stand growth response of primary Picea abies forest to climate  ap. 77-86.  aStands and trees may exhibit different climate–growth responses compared to neighbouring forests and individuals. The study of these differences is crucial to understanding the effects of climate change on the growth and vulnerability of forests and trees. In this research we analyse the growth responsiveness of primary Norway spruce forests to climate as a function of different stand (elevation, aspect, slope, crowding, historic disturbance regime) and tree (age, tree-to-tree competition) features in the Romanian Carpathians. Climate–growth relationships were analysed using Pearson correlation coefficients between ring-width indices (RWIs) and climate variables. The influence of stand and tree characteristics on the RWI responses to climate were investigated using linear mixed-effects models. Elevation greatly modulated the climate–growth associations and it frequently interacted with competition intensity or tree age to differentially influence growth responsiveness to climate. Old trees were more sensitive to climate than young trees, but while old tree’s response to climate highly depended on elevation (e.g. positive influence of summer temperature on old trees’ RWIs at high elevations, but negative effect at low elevations), differences of the young trees’ response across the elevation gradient were less evident. The severity of the past disturbance also modified the climate–growth associations because of contrasting canopy structures. Our results suggest that although an increase in temperature might enhance growth at high elevations, it may also induce growth declines due to drought stress at lower elevations, particularly for old trees or trees growing under high levels of competition, which may increase their vulnerability to disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aaltitude 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acorrelation 3aforests 3amodels 3asummer 3atemperature 3atree age 3atrees 3awater stress 0aClimate warming 0aClimate–growth responsiveness 0aClimate sensitivity 0aDendroclimatology 0aLinear mixed-effects models 0aNorway spruce 0aRWI 0aDBH 0aAC 0amsx 0arbt 0aCRI 0aCI 0aDI 0aPCA 0aPC1 and PC21 aCamarero, J.

Herein, we prepared a polymer porous foam (HPSS) by a facile hydrothermal method. The HPSS presents a superhydrophilic wettability, an interpenetrating macroporous structure, and low thermal conductivity, which can well satisfy the criteria as an ideal candidate for photothermal materials. The HPSS/Fe₃O₄/PPy (polypyrrole) evaporator, of which a Fe₃O₄/PPy binary optical system served as a light absorption layer and HPSS was used as a porous substrate, was constructed through in situ growth of Fe₃O₄ particles followed by interfacial polymerization of PPy on the surface of HPSS. HPSS/Fe₃O₄/PPy shows an excellent light absorption capacity (92%) and photothermal conversion performance, with the solar energy conversion efficiency reaching up to 94.7% under 1 sun irradiation, which is much higher than that of HPSS/PPy (84.8%) composed of a unitary PPy light absorption layer. Interestingly, the presence of Fe₃O₄ particles could make directional migration in a magnetic field possible, thus facilitating its recovery as a self-floating solar generator in an open water area. Moreover, the HPSS/Fe₃O₄/PPy evaporator displays outstanding salt resistance properties and stability in various saline solutions, thus having great potential in practical desalination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adesalination 3aenergy conversion 3afoams 3afreshwater 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrophilicity 3airradiation 3amagnetic fields 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aporous media 3apyrroles 3asolar energy 3asteam 3athermal conductivity 3awettability1 aLiu, Fang1 aXiao, Chaohu1 aSun, Hanxue1 aLi, Jiyan1 aZhu, Zhaoqi1 aLiang, Weidong1 aLi, An1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1982-18800 tLangmuir.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 37, no. 42 p.12397-12408dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c020133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010600170300001600276520091200292592002801204650002001232650001301252650002401265650001501289650001801304650001501322650001601337650001401353653001301367653002001380653001401400653001701414653002701431653001401458700001801472700002001490700001801510700001801528773010101546856008501647852000901732655001201741IND60688977120221122045031.0210212e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068897712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yuanzhou10aExperimental evaluating the rheological behavior of ethylene glycol under graphene nanosheets loading  ap. 788-795.  aIn this study, the rheological behavior of ethylene glycol (EG)-graphene nanosheet nanofluid is examined experimentally. The impacts of mass concentration of nanoparticles (0–5%), temperature (5–65 °C) and shear rate (0–90 1s) on the dynamic viscosity of EG-graphene nanofluid are examined. The obtained results showed that incorporating graphene nanoparticles into EG causes fluid behavior to change from Newtonian to power-law non-Newtonian. In addition, it was found that the dynamic viscosity of EG-graphene nanofluid augments by boosting nanoparticle concentration and decreasing temperature. Moreover, the regression technique is utilized to develop predictive correlations of consistency-index and power-law index of the power-law model. The results demonstrated that the R-squared value for the obtained correlations for consistency index and power-law index are 0.925and 0.982, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene glycol 3agraphene 3amathematical models 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aGraphene 0aEthylene glycol 0aViscosity 0aShear stress 0aNon-Newtonian behavior 0aNanofluid1 aZhang, Xinzhu1 aShahsavar, Amin1 aNguyen, Quyen1 aRostami, Sara0 tPowder technology.g2020 May 01, v. 367 p.788-795dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245005400174520122000228592002801448650001401476650002801490650001701518650001601535650001801551650001101569650001201580650001501592650002101607650001901628650002001647650001501667653001601682653001201698653002401710653001001734653001101744653001601755700003301771700003301804700002701837700001901864700002101883700001901904700002801923700001701951700001701968700001501985700003002000700002002030700001902050700001902069700002602088773010502114856008702219852000902306655001202315IND60768916120221121081122.0220412e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076891612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1269102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Anil Kumar10aAlgae as an emerging source of bioactive pigments  aAlgae have been identified as natural producer of bioactive commercial pigments. To perform photosynthesis, algae use pigments to harvest sunlight energy. The pigments found in algae are categorized in chlorophylls, phycobilins, and carotenoids. Popular carotenoids include astaxanthin, lutein,fucoxanthin, canthaxanthin, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin and finds application as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunoprophylactic, antitumor activities among others. Due to double-bonds in their structure, they exhibit broad health applications while protecting other molecules from oxidative stress induced by active radicals using various mechanisms. These carotenoids are synthesized by certain species as major products however they also present as byproducts in several species based on the pathway and genetic capability. Haematococcus pluvialis and Chlorella zofingiensis are ideal strains for commercial astaxanthin production. This review provides recent updates on microalgal pigment production, extraction, and purification processes to standardize and analyze for commercial production. Also, discussed the factors affecting its production, application, market potential, bottlenecks, and future prospects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aantioxidants 3aastaxanthin 3acanthaxanthin 3aenergy 3amarkets 3amicroalgae 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3asolar radiation 3azeaxanthin 0aCarotenoids 0aPigment 0aBioactive compounds 0aAlgae 0aHealth 0aAntioxidant1 aAlbarico, Frank Paolo Jay B.1 aPerumal, Pitchurajan Krishna1 aVadrale, Akash Pralhad1 aNian, Cherry T1 aChau, Ho Thi Bao1 aAnwar, Choirul1 aWani, Henna Mohi ud din1 aPal, Anugunj1 aSaini, Reetu1 aHa, Le Hai1 aSenthilkumar, Balamurugan1 aTsang, Yi-Sheng1 aChen, Chiu-Wen1 aDong, Cheng-Di1 aSinghania, Reeta Rani0 tBioresource technology.g2022 May, v. 351 p.126910-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1269103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012200152300001800274520168100292592002801973650002302001650000802024650001602032650002502048650001502073650001502088650001702103650002002120650001802140650001502158650001202173650002202185650001202207650001602219650001502235650001702250650003102267773012802298856007402426852000902500655001202509IND60656706120221123021650.0190814e20131121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065670612DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41406j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yue10aApplications of a confined DART (direct analysis in real time) ion source for online in vivo analysis of human breath  ap. 6933-6940.  aHuman breath is composed of many volatile metabolites that can potentially provide information about a person's health status. A sensitive assay to identify these volatile organic compounds as biomarkers is ideal and important for early detection of many diseases. However, the diagnosis through online breath analysis based on mass spectrometry is difficult due to the low concentration of pertinent compounds in breath. The DART (direct analysis in real time) ion source is a novel atmospheric pressure ionization technique, which can efficiently ionize gaseous, liquid and solid samples with high throughput. A major problem in analysis of gaseous samples is its poor detection sensitivity due to open-air sampling. Recently, a confined DART ion source (cDART) was developed, where the plasma generated by the atmospheric pressure glow discharge ionizes gas-phase molecules in a Tee-shaped flow tube instead of open air. It leads to a significant increase of the ionization efficiency of gaseous samples. In this study, the cDART source was modified and applied in online analysis of exhaled breath. The limit of detection of the improved cDART source was determined to be at the level of low ppb. The cDART source was used in the real-time monitoring of an oral anesthetic drug. The concentration variations of two active ingredients in exhaled breath, menthol and benzocaine, and their metabolites with time were obtained. The results show that the cDART ion source is a powerful analytical tool to provide high sensitivity and high throughput analysis for volatile organic compounds in human breath, and can find potential applications in clinical diagnosis and therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aair 3aanesthetics 3aatmospheric pressure 3abenzocaine 3abiomarkers 3abreath tests 3adetection limit 3ahealth status 3aionization 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3amenthol 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3atherapeutics 3avolatile organic compounds0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Nov. 21, v. 5, no. 24 p.6933-6940dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41406j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245018000187300001600367520099500383592002801378650001301406650001301419650002501432650002601457650001101483650001801494650001701512650001301529650001601542650004001558650004701598650001401645650002901659650001101688650002101699650001801720650004401738650003601782650001201818653002501830653001901855653001401874653001501888653001701903700001801920700001701938700001601955700001801971700001601989700001702005700002002022700001702042773008802059856008402147852000902231655001202240IND60086731420221117230849.0160903e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673142DNAL7 a234347722pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerrone, M.G.10aParticle size, chemical composition, seasons of the year and urban, rural or remote site origins as determinants of biological effects of particulate matter on pulmonary cells  ap. 215-227.  aParticulate matter (PM), a complex mix of chemical compounds, results to be associated with various health effects.

A Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis has been performed to relate PM chemical composition to the toxic effects observed. Results show that PM-induced biological effects changed with the seasons and sites, and such variations may be explained by chemical constituents of PM, derived both from primary and secondary sources. The first-time here reported biological responses induced by PM from a remote site at high altitude were associated with the high concentrations of metals and secondary species typical of the free tropospheric aerosol, influenced by long range transports and aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaltitude 3achemical composition 3adiscriminant analysis 3ametals 3aparticle size 3aparticulates 3atoxicity 3atroposphere 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aAir Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aCell Line 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHumans 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aParticle Size 2aParticulate Matterxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aPulmonary Alveolixdrug effects 2aSeasons 0aChemical composition 0aHealth effects 0aIn vitro 0aPM sources 0aChemometrics1 aGualtieri, M.1 aConsonni, V.1 aFerrero, L.1 aSangiorgi, G.1 aLonghin, E.1 aBallabio, D.1 aBolzacchini, E.1 aCamatini, M.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 May, v. 176 p.215-227dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011800169300001300287500001900300520151600319592002801835650001301863650002001876650001801896650001501914650001301929650001701942650000901959650001301968650003001981650002502011650001302036653001702049653002302066653005402089653003502143653002402178653002402202700006102226773016902287856008502456852000902541655001202550IND60736467220221116152732.0210619e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073646722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2021.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanok, Kesinee10aCombination effects of rice extract and five aromatic compounds against α-glucosidase, α-amylase and tyrosinase  ap. 9-17.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRice is a source of bioactive compounds related to human health and has been used for both consumption and traditional medicine. The authors investigated the synergistic and additive effect of rice extract (RE) combined with five aromatic compounds against three enzymes: α-glucosidase, α-amylase and tyrosinase. RE was purified by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and preparative TLC (PTLC) with different solvent systems. RE had higher α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activity than the five aromatic compounds, while the five aromatic compounds had higher tyrosinase inhibitory activity than RE. The combination of RE/acarbose produced synergic inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase, whereas RE showed additive inhibition of both enzymes when combined with aromatic compounds. The five aromatic compounds showed additive inhibition of tyrosinase when combined with RE. The combination of 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol/vanillin/guaiacol produced synergistic inhibition of α-amylase while showing antagonism of α-glucosidase and tyrosinase. Interestingly, the RE produced additive inhibition of α-glucosidase, α-amylase and tyrosinase when combined with the 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol/vanillin/guaiacol combination. RE had rich bioactive compounds related to α-glucosidase, α-amylase and tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Volatile compounds, including 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, vanillin and guaiacol, enhanced the inhibitory activity of RE against α-glucosidase, α-amylase and tyrosinase activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacarbose 3aadditive effect 3aalpha-amylase 3aantagonism 3aguaiacol 3ahuman health 3arice 3asolvents 3athin layer chromatography 3atraditional medicine 3avanillin 0aRice extract 0aAromatic compounds 0aα-Glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activity 0aTyrosinase inhibitory activity 0aSynergic inhibition 0aAdditive inhibition1 aSansenya, Sompong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8044-84320 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2021 July, v. 132, no. 1 p.9-17dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2021.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009300175300001400268520181300282592002802095650001402123650001202137650002002149650001402169650001202183650001302195650001102208650001302219650001102232650001502243650001502258650003202273650001002305653001702315653001402332653001402346653002002360773011402380856008502494852000902579655001202588IND60542598620221121151445.0190403e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054259862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacFarlane, David W.12aA generalized tree component biomass model derived from principles of variable allometry  ap. 43-55.  aAccurate estimates of forest biomass stocks are critical for scientists, policymakers and forest managers trying to address an increasing array of demands on forests, to sustain human well-being and a broader diversity of life forms on Earth. Thus, it is important that forest biomass estimates are translatable into both biologically and economically meaningful components. Here, a new variable-form, variable-density tree mass component model is presented. The model decomposes a tree into a system of tree component-specific equations that: (a) reflect variation in scaling relationships between major portions of the tree body that define variation in whole-tree growth form and (b) relate to commercially relevant portions of the tree. When tested using data collected from felled and dissected hardwood trees of different size and species, growing over a range of stand conditions, the variable-form, variable-density models gave superior predictions for all components of tree mass, when compared to standard fixed-form, fixed-density models that predict tree mass components only from stem diameter at breast height (DBH). The results demonstrated why the standard approach of estimating mass components from DBH with a power function is fairly limited, because base-, trunk-, crown- and main stem-DBH relationships are all variable within and between tree species. Species-specific models were generally superior, but a mixed-species model gave equivalent and sometimes better results than equations fitted to each species individually. The results provide a theoretical basis for biologically-meaningful, robust estimation of tree biomass components over a range of species and forest conditions and may offer new flexibility in producing ecologically and economically relevant biomass inventories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3abiomass 3adata collection 3aequations 3aforests 3ahardwood 3ahumans 3amanagers 3amodels 3aprediction 3ascientists 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 0aTree biomass 0aAllometry 0aHardwoods 0aMass components0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 354 p.43-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007200168300001600240520168500256592002801941650001901969650001201988650001802000650001502018650001202033650001202045650001402057650002002071650001202091650002602103650001602129651001102145700001802156700001402174700001502188773009702203856008102300852000902381655001202390IND60081699120221121064053.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008169912DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-014-0227-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZotarelli, H G S12aA Comparison of Social Bee–Plant Networks between Two Urban Areas  ap. 399-408.  aIn the last decade, several studies demonstrated the effectiveness of ecological network analysis to a better understanding of the structure bee–plant interaction networks; however, such approaches involving urban areas are still scarce. Here, we analyzed two assemblages of corbiculate bees (Apoidea, Apidae) in two geographically distinct urban areas in Brazil. In both study areas, apid bees visiting flowers were captured with an insect net. Surveys were performed biweekly and alternately in each area, over a 1-year period. Both urban areas were very similar for most indices. The two social bee–plant networks were significantly nested, a pattern usually described for bee–plant networks and somehow expected in our study, considering the recognized behavior of social apid bees in exploring a wide range of plant species. The modularity measures were low and very similar for the networks of both urban areas, a finding that could be due at least in part to the low phylogenetic distance between corbiculate bees and the broad dietary habits of the social apid bees. Network-level indices showed that both bee assemblages had a relatively low niche overlap, indicating that the set of social apid species studied exploited differently the arrays of plants available. Species level index (resource range) showed that in both urban areas, Trigona spinipes (Fabr.) and Apis mellifera L. showed the higher number of interactions, a result that demonstrates the importance of these species in social bee–plant interaction networks in urban areas. Similarly to other ecosystems, these two apid species behaved as super-generalists in the two urban areas surveyed herein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aTrigona 3aeating habits 3aecosystems 3aflowers 3ainsects 3aphylogeny 3asocial behavior 3asurveys 3atrophic relationships 3aurban areas 3aBrazil1 aEvans, D.

The presence of PFASs in twenty-eight municipal WWTPs from eleven cites in economically developed areas of China were screened. Overall, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were dominant in wastewater and sludge, and were not effectively removed during wastewater treatment. Elevated influent concentration ratios of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) to PFOA and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) to PFOS in some WWTPs suggested that short chains substitution were adopted in these cities. Cluster analysis showed treatment processes had important impacts on PFASs profiles in effluent and sludge. Average concentration of total PFCAs in influent from each city and its gross domestic product (GDP) had significant positive correlation. This study provides a snapshot of both domestic and industrial discharges of PFAS to WWTPs as well as PFAS discharge from WWTPs to the aquatic environment in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3agross domestic product 3amunicipal wastewater 3acluster analysis 3awastewater treatment 3aaquatic environment 3asulfonic acids 3aperfluorocarbons 3acities 3asludge 2aCities 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFluorocarbonsxanalysis 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWastewaterxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aChina 0aChina 0aEconomically developed areas of China 0asulfonic acid 0aMunicipal wastewater treatment plants 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0aFate1 aZhang, Yating1 aTaniyasu, Sachi1 aYeung, Leo W.Y.1 aLam, Paul K.S.1 aWang, Jianshe1 aLi, Xinhai1 aYamashita, Nobuyoshi1 aDai, Jiayin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 May, v. 176 p.10-17dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245009100206506010400297506007600401520112600477592002801603506003701631650002501668650001401693650002201707650001901729650001301748650002101761650002201782650001701804650002401821650001701845650001801862653001301880653001801893653002101911653003001932653002401962653001501986653002202001653002002023653002002043653001502063700002202078700002902100700006202129700003302191700003602224700006202260700002802322700006802350700001802418700006802436773011202504856008302616852000902699655001202708IND60743714820221207113210.0220606e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074371482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2021.1163822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudzik, Danuta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9833-761810aPerspectives and challenges in extracellular vesicles untargeted metabolomics analysis  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe discovery of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, has opened a new frontier in the study of signal transduction and understanding cell-to-cell communication. EVs play a key role regulating various biological processes such as tissue regeneration, blood coagulation, immunomodulation or carcinogenesis. Therefore, they gain much attention as potentially therapeutic and non-invasive diagnostic targets. In this aspect, a comprehensive characterization of the EVs molecular content and understanding EVs functions are especially relevant. However, routine isolation of a usually small amount of high purity EVs is challenging, and analysis requires highly sensitive advanced analytical solutions. The utility of EVs in clinical settings is still limited due to the lack of standardization in existing protocols. This review focuses on the implication of the state-of-the-art mass-spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics approach for the molecular profiling of EVs, with the emphasis on the analytical methodologies, highlighting potential challenges and limitations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalytical chemistry 3aapoptosis 3ablood coagulation 3acarcinogenesis 3aexosomes 3aimmunomodulation 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atissue repair 0aExosomes 0aMicrovesicles 0aApoptotic bodies 0aNon-targeted metabolomics 0aMolecular profiling 0aBiomarkers 0aMass spectrometry 0aStandardization 0aQuality control 0aValidation1 aMacioszek, Szymon1 aStruck-Lewicka, Wiktoria1 aKordalewska, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3352-09531 aBuszewska-Forajta, Magdalena1 aWaszczuk-Jankowska, Małgorzata1 aWawrzyniak, Renata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0763-45891 aArtymowicz, Małgorzata1 aRaczak-Gutknecht, Joanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1856-00011 aSiluk, Danuta1 aMarkuszewski, Michał J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1166-48170 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 143 p.116382-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2021.1163823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009700167300001600264520130600280592002801586650001101614650001301625650001301638650001901651650001401670650001901684650001201703650001201715650003701727700001701764700002001781700001801801773015201819856008101971852000902052655001202061IND60624214320190204000000.0181202e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062421432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-005-2470-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarioara, C.

The result microstructure for all alloys and conditions consisted of metastable, needle-shaped precipitates growing along 〈100〉 directions in aluminium. Each of the phases β″-Mg₅Si₆, β′-Mg₁.₈Si, U1-MgAl₂Si₂ and U2-MgAlSi could be identified as main precipitate in the alloy with its solute Si/Mg ratio closest to the same ratio in the composition of that particular phase: The highest Si content alloy produced coarse needles of the trigonal U1-phase coexisting with finer precipitates of hexagonal B′-phase. The most common phase in the Mg-rich alloy is coarse needles of hexagonal β′-type. The Si/Mg ratio of 1.25 in one alloy is similar to the Si/Mg ratio in β″. Here the microstructure changes from that of fine β″ needles to fine needles of the orthorhombic U2-phase. This material remains strongest during heat-treatment. Nucleation on dislocations, mainly by the B′-phase, was observed to be significant in the case of Si-rich alloys heat-treated from T4-condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3ahardness 3aheat treatment 3amagnesium 3amicrostructure 3asilicon 3asolutes 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aNordmark, H.1 aAndersen, S.

Secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that N and Al are incorporated into ZnO. The resistivity, carrier concentration, and Hall mobility are typically of 50–100 Ωcm, 1×10¹⁷–8×10¹⁷ cm⁻³, and 0.1–0.6 cm²/Vs, respectively, for the N–Al codoped p-type ZnO films. Hall measurement, X-ray diffraction, and optical transmission were carried out to investigate the changes of the properties with the storage period. Results show that the p-type characteristics of the N–Al codoped ZnO films are of acceptable reproducibility and stability. In addition, the N–Al codoped p-type ZnO films have good crystallinity and optical quality.

The capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is an endangered umbrella species of montane forests in central Europe. Despite its status, it has largely been overlooked in forest management planning in the Carpathian Mountains, a biodiversity hotspot within the European Union. Previous investigations of timber management effects on capercaillie have shown contradictory results within Europe; habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive forest management have been implicated in population declines, while other studies have suggested neutral or positive effects. In Romania, recent changes in forest management have shifted from extensive, selective logging to intensive clearcutting; this change provides the opportunity to assess the effects of harvesting on capercaillie numbers across a full range of forest management intensities, thereby addressing discrepancies in the literature. Across the Southern and Eastern Carpathian mountains from 2009–2011, we used spring counts of capercaillie males at leks to evaluate the impact of forest management, other human activities, and habitat at two spatial scales – stand (∼2ha) and landscape (∼300ha). At the landscape level, the proportion of forest clearcuts and intensity of tourism had significant negative effects on the number of capercaillie males in the lek. In contrast, low intensity selective logging had a positive effect at the local stand (lek) level. Large scale (landscape level) forest clear-cutting had a negative effect on the capercaillie population – areas comprised of clearcuts of 30% reduced male lek counts by 76%. The protection of intact mature and old-growth forests, and forest management practices that emulate natural disturbance processes are recommended to support habitat of this critical umbrella species and associated biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aTetrao urogallus 3aadverse effects 3abiodiversity 3aclearcutting 3adeforestation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3ahumans 3aintensive forestry 3alandscapes 3alogging 3amales 3amontane forests 3aold-growth forests 3aplanning 3apopulation dynamics 3aspring 3atimber management 3atourism 3aCarpathian region 3aCentral European region 3aRomania 0aCapercaillie 0aHabitat requirements 0aAnthropogenic threat 0aUmbrella species 0aEcological forestry 0aForest management1 aSvitok, Marek1 aTejkal, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8784-76741 aLeitão, Pedro J.1 aMorrissey, Robert C.1 aSvoboda, Miroslav1 aSeedre, Meelis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3635-63541 aFontaine, Joseph B.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 354 p.26-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245015500158300001600313500001500329520108000344592002801424650001601452650001401468650002901482650001201511650002001523650002501543650001001568650001401578650002001592650001101612653002401623700001301647700001301660700001501673773009701688856008101785852000901866655001201875IND60081699320221121063954.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008169932DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-014-0229-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, H10aFunctional and Numerical Responses of Three Species of Predatory Phytoseiid Mites (Acari: Phytoseiidae) to Thrips flavidulus (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)  ap. 437-445.  a2019-12-06  aPhytoseiid mites are considered the most effective natural enemies of pest mites. They also have been shown to attack pest thrips. It is unknown, however, whether phytoseiid mites can reduce high densities of Thrips flavidulus (Bagnall). We addressed this question by the study of functional and numerical responses. The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential predation success of the adults of three predatory mites, Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans), Neoseiulus barkeri (Hughes), and Euseius nicholsi (Ehara & Lee), against the first-instar of T. flavidulus in a climatic chamber at five different temperatures. The results showed that the functional responses of those predators reflected the Holling type II functional response and were density dependent and positively related to temperature. For the three predatory mites, predation and successful attack rates increased with increasing temperature up to 26°C, reducing afterward. Handling time had the opposite trend. Reproductive ability also increased with an increase in temperature and prey consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3aThripidae 3areproductive performance 3aEuseius 3apredatory mites 3aNeoseiulus cucumeris 3apests 3apredation 3anatural enemies 3aadults 0afunctional response1 aZheng, W1 aTariq, K1 aZhang, H.,0 tNeotropical entomology.g2014 Oct., v. 43, no. 5 p.437-445dSpringer-Verlagx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-014-0229-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009800169300001400267520099400281592002801275650001701303650001901320650002101339650001101360650001501371650001901386650001901405650002101424650000901445650001601454700002101470700001701491773009901508856008701607852000901694655001201703IND60084089320221119175339.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008408932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jinfeng10aTrends in research on global climate change: A Science Citation Index Expanded-based analysis  ap. 13-20.  aThis study was conceived to evaluate the global scientific output of climate change research over the past 18years and to assess the characteristics of the research patterns, tendencies, and methods in the papers. Data were based on the online version of Science Citation Index Expanded from 1992 to 2009. Articles referring to climate change were assessed by distribution of source countries, source institutes, paper titles, author keywords, KeyWords Plus, abstracts, and the most cited articles in these years. By synthetic analysis of the four kinds of keywords, it was concluded that the items “temperature”, “environment”, “precipitation”, “greenhouse gas”, “risk”, and “biodiversity” will be the foci of climate change research in the 21st century, while “model”, “monitoring”, and “remote sensing” will continue to be the leading research methods. A novel method, “phylogeography”, may have a strong application potential in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aphylogeography 3aremote sensing 3aresearch methods 3arisk 3atemperature1 aWang, Ming-Huang1 aHo, Yuh-Shan0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 May, v. 77, no. 1-2 p.13-20dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04700naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245012800188300001600316500001500332520207600347592002802423650002002451650001502471650001602486650003702502650001302539650001102552650000802563650001002571650002202581650001402603650001502617650001502632650002402647650001702671650001202688650001602700650002302716650001502739650001402754650002202768650001502790650001002805650001602815650001802831650000902849650002502858650001102883650002202894650001002916650002002926650002102946650002802967650001102995650002303006650001503029650002003044650000903064650001003073650002303083650002603106650001603132650001603148650001203164650002603176650001503202650001603217653002303233653001903256653001903275653002303294653002203317700002103339700002103360700001603381700001903397700002403416700002303440700002803463773017903491856008303670852000903753655001203762IND50067386520221121121612.0190416e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006738652DNAL7 a236478342pmid7 a10.1016/j.jand.2013.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Tracey J.10aEating Patterns and Leisure-Time Exercise among Active Duty Military Personnel: Comparison to the Healthy People Objectives  ap. 907-919.  a2019-12-04  aTo assess whether active duty military personnel meet Healthy People 2010 objectives for physical activity and fruit, vegetable, and whole-grain intake; the relationship of select demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors (eg, smoking), and eating patterns (eg, frequency and location of meals) on achieving diet and exercise-related Healthy People 2010 objectives; and the relationship of eating patterns to self-reported weight gain.Secondary data from 15,747 participants in the 2005 Department of Defense Health Related Behaviors Survey was analyzed.More than 57% of respondents met the Healthy People 2010 guidelines for moderate or vigorous leisure exercise but only 3% reported eating fruit (once), vegetables (3 times), and whole grains (3 times) daily. Individuals who reported gaining weight during the previous year were more likely to skip breakfast and eat at, or from, a restaurant ≥2 times per week compared with those who did not gain weight (P<0.001). Regression analysis indicated that women were more likely to eat fruits (odds ratio [OR] 1.25) and vegetables (OR 1.20) and less likely than men to eat whole grains (OR 0.76) or engage in moderate or vigorous exercise (OR 0.71). Military personnel who skipped breakfast ≥2 times per week (OR 0.45) or ate at a restaurant/takeout food (OR 0.54) ≥2 times per week were significantly less likely to meet Healthy People 2010 guidelines for food intake (defined as achieving a daily intake of one or more fruits, three or more vegetables, and three or more servings of whole grains) and exercise (OR 0.88 and 0.82, respectively).Although the majority of military personnel met guidelines for physical activity, their intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains was suboptimal. Skipping breakfast and eating at, or from, restaurants were risk factors for poor nutrient intake and associated with weight gain. These data suggest that skipping breakfast and eating out deter achieving Healthy People 2010 objectives and provide targets for military programs to promote achieving these objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient intake 3avegetables 3aweight gain 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aexercise 3afruits 3amen 3awomen 3agrain consumption 3alifestyle 3aguidelines 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asurveys 3arestaurants 3amilitary personnel 3aeating out 3abreakfast 3awhole grain foods 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBody Weight 2aEdible Grain. 2aDiet 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFruit 2aHealth Behavior 2aHealth Promotion 2aHealthy People Programs 2aHumans 2aLeisure Activities 2aLife Style 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMeals 2aMilitary Personnel 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aRestaurants 2aSelf Report 2aSmoking 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aVegetables 2aYoung Adult 0aDietary Guidelines 0againing weight 0aHealthy People 0aMilitary personnel 0aPhysical activity1 aDotson, Laura E.1 aYoung, Andrew J.1 aWhite, Alan1 aHadden, Louise1 aBathalon, Gaston P.1 aFunderburk, LesLee1 aMarriott, Bernadette P.0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2013 July, v. 113, no. 7 p.907-919dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2013.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009000172300002000262520211000282592002802392650002502420650001802445650002002463650001302483650002202496650002002518650001802538650001302556650001802569650001602587700005302603700006002656700005902716773011602775856008502891852000902976655001202985IND60754854220221122073226.0211026e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c021362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoner, Hannah M.10aWater Wettability Coupled with Film Growth on Realistic Cyclopentane Hydrate Surfaces  ap. 12447-12456.  aAlthough the wettability of hydrate surfaces and hydrate film growth are key to understanding hydrate agglomeration and pipeline plugging, a quantitative understanding of the coupled behavior between both phenomena is lacking. In situ measurements of wettability coupled with film growth were performed for cyclopentane hydrate surfaces in cyclopentane at atmospheric pressure and temperatures between 1.5–6.8 °C. Results were obtained as a function of annealing (conversion) time and subcooling. Hydrate surface wettability decreased as annealing time increased, while hydrate film growth rate was unaffected by annealing time at any subcooling. The results are interpreted as a manifestation of the hydrate surface porosity, which depends on annealing time and controls water spreading on the hydrate surface. The wettability generally decreased as the subcooling increased because higher subcooling yields rougher hydrate surfaces, making it harder for water to spread. However, this effect is balanced by hydrate growth rates, which increase with subcooling. Also affecting the results, surface heating from heat release (from exothermic crystallization) allows excess surface water to promote spreading. The hydrate film growth rate on water droplets increased with subcooling, as expected from a higher driving force. At any subcooling, the instantaneous hydrate growth rate decreased over time, likely from heat transfer limitations. A new phenomenon was observed, where the angle at the three-phase point increases from the initial contact angle upon hydrate film growth, named the crystallization angle. This is attributed to the water droplet trying to spread while the thin film is weak enough to be redirected. Once the hydrate film grows and forms a “wall” around the droplet, it cannot be moved, and further growth yields a crater on the droplet surface, attributed to water penetrating the hydrate surface pore structures. This fundamental behavior has many flow assurance implications since it affects the interactions between the agglomerating hydrate particles and water droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acontact angle 3acrystallization 3adroplets 3afilms (materials) 3aheat production 3aheat transfer 3aporosity 3asurface water 3awettability1 aPhan, Anh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2428-69901 aStriolo, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6542-80651 aKoh, Carolyn A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3452-40320 tLangmuir.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 37, no. 42 p.12447-12456dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c021363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01100naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245004800160300001600208520028600224592002800510650001500538650001600553651001000569700001400579700001800593700001200611773009700623856008100720852000900801655001200810IND60081699520221121063951.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008169952DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-014-0231-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZha, L S10aFour New Species of Tetrigidae (Orthoptera)  ap. 429-436.  aFour new species of Tetrigidae (Orthoptera) from Anhui province, China, are described, namely Paragavialidium anhuiensis n. sp. of Scelimeninae, Bolivaritettix jinzhaiensis n. sp. of Metrodorinae, Bannatettix anhuiensis n. sp., and Formosatettix albomaculatus n. sp. of Tetriginae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetrigidae 3anew species 3aChina1 aDeng, W A1 aZheng, Z.

For the study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a BSL-2 laboratory, a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle (SARS2pp) production and infection system was constructed by using a lentiviral vector bearing dual-reporter genes eGFP and firefly luciferase (Luc2) for easy observation and analysis. Comparison of SARS2pp different production conditions revealed that the pseudovirus titer could be greatly improved by: 1) removing the last 19 amino acids of the spike protein and replacing the signal peptide with the mouse Igk signal sequence; 2) expressing the spike protein using CMV promoter other than CAG (a hybrid promoter consisting of a CMV enhancer, beta-actin promoter, splice donor, and a beta-globin splice acceptor); 3) screening better optimized spike protein sequences for SARS2pp production; and 4) adding 1 % BSA in the SARS2pp production medium. For infection, this SARS2pp system showed a good linear relationship between MOI 2-0.0002 and then was successfully used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibitors including recombinant human ACE2 proteins and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. The kidney, liver and small intestine-derived cell lines were also found to show different susceptibility to SARSpp and SARS2pp. Given its robustness and good performance, it is believed that this pseudovirus particle production and infection system will greatly promote future research for SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms and inhibitors and can be easily applied to study new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aactin 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aliver 3aluciferase 3amice 3apromoter regions 3asignal peptide 0aSARS2pp 0aSARSpp 0aVSVpp 0aS 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aPseudovirus 0aViral entry inhibitors 0aSusceptible cell lines1 aYang, Yang1 aWu, Yuming1 aHuang, Cong1 aDing, Yanlei1 aWang, Xuejun1 aWang, Shengqi0 tJournal of virological methods.g2021 Sept., v. 295 p.114221-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1142213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013900168520103300307592002801340650002101368650001701389650001401406650003301420650002001453650001701473650001001490650001901500650002201519650001301541650002101554650002201575650001601597653003201613653001701645653002401662653002401686653001401710700001501724700001701739700001701756700001601773700001601789700001301805773010601818856008701924852000902011655001202020IND60768916820221121081149.0220412e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076891682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1269172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Sihan10aMechanisms of nitrogen transformation driven by functional microbes during thermophilic fermentation in an ex situ fermentation system  aIn this study, we explored the pathways and mechanisms of nitrogen (N) transformation driven by functional microbes carrying key genes in an ex situ fermentation system (EFS). Temperature and N content were found to be the most important factors driving variation in bacterial and fungal communities, respectively; Bacillus became the most abundant bacteria and Batrachochytrium became the most abundant fungi. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that some bacteria including Halomonas, Truepera, and Gemmatimonas species carry genes that promote mineralization, nitrification, dissimilatory/assimilatory nitrate reduction, denitrification, anammox reactions, and N fixation. The maximum rate of total mineralization reached 136.60 μg N g⁻¹ d⁻¹. Functional microbes promoted various N conversion processes at different rates in the EFS, with levels increasing by at least 0.23 μg N g⁻¹ d⁻¹. These results provide a theoretical basis for feasible optimization measures to address N loss during fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBatrachochytrium 3aGemmatimonas 3aHalomonas 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3adenitrification 3afermentation 3afungi 3amineralization 3anitrate reduction 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation 3atemperature 0aEx situ fermentation system 0aMetagenomics 0aNitrogen metabolism 0aFunctional microbes 0aKey genes1 aSong, Zhen1 aLi, Zhanbiao1 aQiao, Rongye1 aLi, Mengjie1 aChen, Yifan1 aGuo, Hui0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Apr., v. 350 p.126917-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1269173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04114naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010800171300001400279520259100293592002802884650002502912650001202937650002702949650001602976650002302992650001203015650001203027650001103039650001503050650001003065650000903075650001103084650002203095650001603117650001503133650002103148650001003169653001103179653001603190653001503206653001303221653001903234700002403253700001803277700001903295700001803314700003203332773011403364856008503478852000903563655001203572IND60542599020221121221331.0190403e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054259902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaws, Matthew I.10aPhosphorus fertilisation and large legume species affect jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining  ap. 10-17.  aRe-establishing nutrient-cycling is often a key goal of mine-site restoration. This goal can be achieved by applying fertilisers (particularly P) in combination with seeding N-fixing legumes. However, the effect of this strategy on other key restoration goals such as the establishment and growth of non-leguminous species has received little attention. We investigated the effects of P-application rates either singly, or in combination with seeding seven large understorey legume species, on jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining. Five years after P application and seeding, legume species richness, density and cover were higher in the legume-seeded treatment. However, the increased establishment of legumes did not lead to increased soil N. Increasing P-application rates from 0 to 80kgPha−1 did not affect legume species richness, but significantly reduced legume density and increased legume cover: cover was maximal (∼50%) where 80kgPha−1 had been applied with large legume seeds. Increasing P-application had no effect on species richness of non-legume species, but increased the density of weeds and native ephemerals. Cover of non-legume species decreased with increasing P-application rates and was lower in plots where large legumes had been seeded compared with non-seeded plots. There was a significant legume×P interaction on weed and ephemeral density: at 80kgPha−1 the decline in density of these groups was greatest where legumes were seeded. In addition, the decline in cover for non-legume species with increasing P was greatest when legumes were seeded. Applying 20kgPha−1 significantly increased tree growth compared with tree growth in unfertilised plots, but growth was not increased further at 80kgha−1 and tree growth was not affected by seeding large legumes. Taken together, these data indicate that 80kgha−1 P-fertiliser in combination with (seeding) large legumes maximised vegetation cover at five years but could be suboptimal for re-establishing a jarrah forest community that, like unmined forest, contains a diverse community of slow-growing re-sprouter species. The species richness and cover of non-legume understorey species, especially the resprouters, was highest in plots that received either 0 or 20kgha−1 P and where large legumes had not been seeded. Therefore, our findings suggest that moderation of P-fertiliser and legumes could be the best strategy to fulfil the multiple restoration goals of establishing vegetation cover, while at the same time maximising tree growth and species richness of restored forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus marginata 3abauxite 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3alegumes 3amining 3aphosphorus 3aseeds 3asoil 3asowing 3aspecies diversity 3atree growth 3aunderstory 3avegetation cover 3aweeds 0aAcacia 0aCompetition 0aFertilizer 0aNitrogen 0aRehabilitation1 aStandish, Rachel J.1 aKoch, John M.1 aMorald, Tim K.1 aTibbett, Mark1 aHobbs, R.

Its structure and conformation strongly depend on the fermentation conditions and such factors as temperature and ions concentration. The properties of the xanthan gum were appreciated in the controlled drug delivery but in the crosslinked form. Due to its ability to enhance the survival rate of immobilized bacteria, the potential of a crosslinked form is promising. Unfortunately, xanthan gum crosslinking procedures often require toxic substances or harsh environmental conditions, which cannot be used in the entrapment of living cells. In this study, we summarised a crosslinking method that could potentially be modified to reduce its toxicity to living cells. Moreover, this review also includes using xanthan gum in bioremediation studies and possible utilization methods to avoid carrier accumulation in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioremediation 3acrosslinking 3adrug delivery systems 3aexopolysaccharides 3afermentation 3aimmobilized cells 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3axanthan gum 0aImmobilization 0aBioaugmentation 0aMicroorganisms 0aEntrapment1 aWojcieszyńska, Danuta1 aGuzik, Urszula0 tBioresource technology.g2022 May, v. 351 p.126918-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1269183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245015700161300001600318500002000334520159500354592002801949596006201977650001802039650002502057650001302082650001202095650001102107650001602118650001702134651001402151700001902165773013302184856007602317852000902393655001202402IND60786387020221118204837.0220803e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078638702DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.16003212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscapa, Ignacio12aA new Cheirolepidiaceae (Coniferales) from the Early Jurassic of Patagonia (Argentina): Reconciling the records of impression and permineralized fossils  ap. 322-334.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plants preserved in different fossil modes provide complementary data concerning the paleobiology and evolutionary relationships among plant groups. New material from the Early Jurassic of Patagonia shows the importance of combining these sources of information, as we describe the first compression/impression fossils of Pararaucaria, a genus of the extinct conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae previously known from permineralized fossils. These fossils extend the temporal range of this genus and may allow its wider recognition in the fossil record. METHODS: We studied fossil plants from the Early Jurassic (Pleinsbachian‐Toarcian) locality of Taquetrén in Patagonia, Argentina using standard paleobotanical preparation and description techniques. KEY RESULTS: Pararaucaria taquetrensis consists of isolated ovuliferous scales and small seed cones with helically arranged bract‐scale complexes attached to scale‐leaf foliage. Bract‐scale complexes consist of separated bracts and ovuliferous scales with two seeds and three broad distal lobes. CONCLUSIONS: Pararaucaria taquetrensis represents the oldest known Cheirolepidiaceae seed cones from the Southern Hemisphere, and this material highlights the importance of compression and impression fossils in understanding the distribution of fossil taxa. This material also suggests that Cheirolepidiaceae cone scales can be easily confused with those of another common conifer family, the Araucariaceae, which has important implications for accurately understanding Mesozoic conifer diversity and paleoecology.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica 3aAraucariaceae 3aEarly Jurassic epoch 3aconifers 3afossils 3aleaves 3apaleobotany 3apaleoecology 3aArgentina1 aLeslie, Andrew0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Feb., v. 104, no. 2 p.322-334dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.16003213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007300175300001600248520149000264592002801754650001501782650002001797650001601817650001801833650001101851650001701862650001501879650002801894650001601922650001901938650002201957650002101979650001302000653001202013653001502025653001302040653002302053653001302076653000902089700001802098700002202116700001802138773010302156856008602259852000902345655001202354IND60535894720221120024606.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053589472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoquillé, Nathalie10aUse of diatom motility features as endpoints of metolachlor toxicity  ap. 202-210.  aMany recent ecotoxicological studies suggest a relationship between freshwater contamination and increasing abundances of motile diatoms (potentially able to move). The capacity to escape would present advantages to species in polluted environments. However, actual motility as a response to toxicants had not been described and required experimental validation.We designed a specific experiment to assess how a field-isolated diatom (Gomphonema gracile) distributes energy to in situ resistance (increased population growth or photosynthesis) and escape (behavioral changes), when exposed to increasing concentrations of the herbicide metolachlor.We report here the dose–time dependent responses of G. gracile populations. They coped with low contamination by resisting in situ, with early hormetic responses highlighted by stimulation of chlorophyll-a fluorescence. At a higher dose, harmful impacts were observed on growth after a few days, but an earlier behavioral response suggested that higher motility (percentage of motile individuals and mean distance crossed) could be involved in escape.Our findings bring new arguments to support the implementation of real measurements instead of motility traits in toxicity assessment. Specifically, motion descriptors have been used as early-warning indicators of contamination in our study. Further works should address the reliability of these endpoints in more complex conditions (interspecific variability, behavior in the field).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGomphonema 3abehavior change 3achlorophyll 3aecotoxicology 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3afreshwater 3ainterspecific variation 3ametolachlor 3aphotosynthesis 3apopulation growth 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aDiatoms 0aPhysiology 0aBehavior 0aPesticide exposure 0aMotility 0aCASA1 aJan, Gwilherm1 aMoreira, Aurélie1 aMorin, Soizic0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Jan., v. 158 p.202-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015500164300001700319520157400336592002801910650001801938650002401956650001501980650002301995650002902018650001302047650002102060650001602081650002402097650001502121650001102136650002102147650002402168650000902192650002502201650000902226650001702235650002902252650001502281650002702296653001002323653002402333653002002357653002102377653002302398653000802421653000702429653000802436653000802444653000802452700001902460700001802479700002302497700005902520773014702579856008202726852000902808655001202817IND60628041120221116195513.0190129e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062804112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jae-Il10aRD-05, a novel anti-CD154 antibody, efficiently inhibits generation of anti-drug antibody without the risk of thrombus formation in non-human primates  ap. 996-1001.  aAntibody formation against therapeutic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and Factor VIII, that leads to treatment failure has become a major challenge in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and hemophilia. It is well known that anti-CD154 antibodies have the highest potential to inhibit these types of adverse immune responses. Nevertheless, the formation of thromboemboli is the major hurdle in the clinical application of these anti-CD154 blocking antibodies. For this, we attempted to derive an idea as to how this major complication can be eliminated. Consequently, we developed a novel anti-CD154 chimeric antibody, which was made by genetic modification of a portion of human IgG4 Fc. This antibody has an almost comparable antigen binding affinity to a previously developed 5C8 clone and near completely inhibited CD40-CD154 interaction and T cell-dependent B cell activation in vitro. Even under the condition, where we injected immune complexes comprised of RD-05 and CD154 antigen, the formation of thromboembolism was not seen in human FcγRIIA-transgenic mice, whereas the converse was exactly true in the case of 5C8 antibody. Notably, just two injections of RD-05 antibody was sufficient to inhibit the antibody formation against adalimumab during 3–4 months in cynomolgus macaques, in which adalimumab was repeatedly injected for 12 weeks. Based on these findings, we suggest that this RD-05 antibody can be applied to antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and immune thrombocytopenic purpura.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aantigen-antibody complex 3aantigens 3abinding capacity 3afactor VIII 3agenetic engineering 3ahemophilia 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alupus erythematosus 3amice 3arheumatoid arthritis 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3athrombocytopenic purpura 3athrombosis 3atumor necrosis factors 0aRD-05 0aAnti-CD154 antibody 0aThromboembolism 0aHumoral immunity 0aAnti-drug antibody 0aADA 0aCI 0aITP 0aSLE 0aTNF1 aChoi, Yun-Jung1 aPark, Hi-Jung1 aJung, Kyeong Cheon1 aPark, Seong Hoe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3456-20980 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 498, no. 4 p.996-1001dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04222naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011700165300001400282520232800296592002802624650001902652650000802671650001802679650002202697650002902719650002702748650001202775650001302787650002102800650001402821650001902835650001602854650001602870650001302886650001302899650003202912650002402944650002102968650001702989650001303006650001803019650002203037650002003059650001803079650001003097650001503107651001003122653002103132653004403153653001603197653001503213653003703228700001703265700001903282700001703301700001103318700001603329773012303345856008303468852000903551655001203560IND60532393720221122015946.0190318e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Maofang10aModeling nitrogen loading from a watershed consisting of cropland and livestock farms in China using Manure-DNDC  ap. 88-98.  aNitrogen (N) losses from agro-ecosystems have become a serious issue over the past decades, causing a series of environmental problems, such as water eutrophication and air pollution. Estimating N discharges at a watershed scale to quantify the N fluxes released across various land-use components has long been a problem, especially for croplands and livestock farms, the two major sources of excess N, because of fertilizer use and livestock manure management. This study used Manure-DNDC, a biogeochemical, process-based model, to calculate N discharge fluxes from both crop fields and livestock farms within the Xiaoqinghe watershed in Shandong Province, China. The newly developed Manure-DNDC was tested against the crop growth, soil climate, and N leaching loss data measured in the watershed and showed encouraging results. A database containing daily weather data, soil properties, livestock farms, and cropping systems for the 182 towns included in the watershed was created to provide input information to support the model simulations at a watershed scale. The Manure-DNDC model was used to evaluate the 652,881ha of cropland and 728 livestock farms in the watershed in 2008. The modeled N influxes to and effluxes from the agro-ecosystem in all towns were summarized to obtain the watershed-scale N fluxes. The modeled results indicated that about 184 million kg of N was applied annually as synthetic fertilizer in croplands, 297 million kg of N as feed introduced into the livestock farms, and 9 million kg N came from atmospheric deposition in the Xiaoqinghe watershed in 2008. The cropland soils received about 260 million kg of N, of which only 25.6% (67 million kg of N) came from manure amendment. The entire watershed released 127 million kg of ammonia-N into the air, including 42% from croplands and 58% from livestock farms. Other N gases, such as nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, and dinitrogen, were released into the atmosphere at a rate of 35 million kg of N per year. The N loads to surface water from livestock farms and crop fields were 47 and 7 million kg of N, respectively. About 24 million kg of nitrate-N was leached from the cropping systems, which could be loaded to both surface water and groundwater. The modeled results were compared with observations, which yielded encouraging results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3aair 3aair pollution 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanimal manure management 3aatmospheric deposition 3aclimate 3acropland 3acropping systems 3adatabases 3aeutrophication 3afertilizers 3agroundwater 3aland use 3aleaching 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameteorological data 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3asimulation models 3asoil properties 3asurface water 3atowns 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aNitrogen balance 0aAgricultural non-point source pollution 0aManure-DNDC 0aXiaoqinghe 0aLivestock and poultry production1 aQiu, Jianjun1 aLi, Changsheng1 aWang, Ligang1 aLi, Hu1 aGao, Chunyu0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 185 p.88-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008500166300001600251520159400267592002801861650001401889650001401903650001501917650001501932650002301947650002001970650003101990650001002021650002102031650002802052650001802080650001902098650001302117650003402130650002202164650004302186650005202229650002602281650001702307650002202324650001202346650001802358650002202376653000902398653000802407700001502415700006102430700001602491700002002507700001702527700001902544773014702563856008302710852000902793655001202802IND60610307420221117081745.0191231e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061030742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiaofen10aLRP4 promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion in papillary thyroid cancer  ap. 257-263.  aDysregulation of cell proliferation and death is considered the foundation of the malignant biological characteristics of cancer. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a massively parallel whole transcriptome resequencing of paired papillary thyroid cancer and normal thyroid tissues from 19 patients. In addition, we found that LRP4, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein family, is significantly overexpressed in thyroid carcinoma. We demonstrated through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) that LRP4 is upregulated in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) tissues. This observation was also consistent with data analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. Thus, the biological role of LRP4 in the thyroid cancer in the present study was investigated using the PTC cell lines TPC1, BCPAP and KTC-1. In these cell lines, the mRNA level of LRP4 was higher than normal thyroid cancer cell named HTORI3. In vitro experiments demonstrated that LRP4 downregulation significantly inhibited the colony formation, proliferation, migration, and invasion of the three PTC cell lines. Knockdown of LRP4 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in those cell lines decreased the protein expression of N-cadherin, Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and Zinc finger E-box-binding home-box 1 (ZEB1). Furthermore, LRP4 knockdown significantly reduced the levels of phosphorylated PI3K in the PTC cell lines. In conclusion, the present study indicated that LRP4 is a gene associated with PTC and might become a potential therapeutic target.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadherins 3acarcinoma 3acell death 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3alow density lipoprotein 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics 3athyroid neoplasms 3atissues 3atranscriptome 3azinc finger motif 0aLRP4 0aPTC1 aXia, Erjie1 aBhandari, Adheesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0406-26851 aZheng, Chen1 aXiang, Jingjing1 aGuan, Yaoyao1 aZhang, Xiaohua0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Sept. 03, v. 503, no. 1 p.257-263dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245008500198500001100283520110100294592002801395596006401423650002301487650001701510650003001527650002001557650001501577650001301592650002201605650000901627700005801636773012101694856007501815852000901890655001201899IND60781151420221119130112.0220623e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078115142DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.128812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiva, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1724-429314aThe disproportionately high value of small patches for biodiversity conservation  aLETTER  aSmall habitat patches have been historically neglected in conservation, primarily because extinction risk is higher in small patches. Nevertheless, sets of small patches usually harbor more species than one or a few larger patches of equal total area. Resolving this inconsistency is key to policy and practice in biodiversity conservation. Our analysis of 32 datasets (603 patches and 2290 taxa) provides two novel lines of evidence confirming that small patches have disproportionately high value for biodiversity. First, sets of small patches harbor more species than large patches even when considering only species of conservation concern. Second, sets of small patches harbor more species than large patches even when the small patches are very small compared to the large patches. Therefore, higher extinction risk in small than large patches does not decrease the cumulative value of small patches for biodiversity. We contend that acknowledging the conservation value of small patches, even very small patches, will be a necessary step for stemming biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aAnthropocene epoch 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3adata collection 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3arisk1 aFahrig, Lenore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3841-03420 tConservation letters.g2022 May, v. 15, no. 3 p.e12881-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.128813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010600173300001400279500001900293520147500312592002801787650002501815650001101840650001301851650001801864650001701882650001801899650001701917650001201934650001201946651002501958653001601983653001701999653002802016700001702044700001602061700001502077700001802092700001902110700001502129773011602144856008502260852000902345655001202354IND60694030020221120185107.0200509e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069403002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJean-Baptiste, P.10aTritium and radiocarbon levels in the Rhône river delta and along the French Mediterranean coastline  ap. 53-64.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Rhône is characterised by a heavy concentration of nuclear-based industries including nuclear power stations and nuclear sites housing civilian and military facilities. Here, we report the results of a four-year survey (2010–2013) of tritium and radiocarbon levels in a variety of matrices within the Rhône delta and along the French Mediterranean coastline. The aim of the study is to create a spatial reference framework of environmental levels of these two radionuclides, which are the most prevalent in radioactive effluents from nuclear power stations. Although both tritium and radiocarbon levels in the samples analysed are very low and can only be detected using ultra-sensitive analytical techniques, they clearly show the influence of the tritium and radiocarbon discharges carried by the Rhône plume along the Mediterranean coast. The tritium content of suspended matter and sediments of the Rhône is a special case, which shows elevated tritium values not seen in other French rivers with similar nuclear facilities. The north-south spatial distribution of this tritium anomaly shows that these trace values are at their highest in the upper Rhône, close to the Swiss border and upstream of Creys Malville, the northernmost nuclear power station on the Rhône. This points to a legacy of past tritium releases by the watchmaking industry. A dedicated study would be needed to clearly identify the source and the exact nature of this contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon radioisotopes 3acoasts 3aindustry 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aradioactivity 3ariver deltas 3asurveys 3atritium 3aMediterranean region 0aRadiocarbon 0aRiver Rhône 0aMediterranean coastline1 aFontugne, M.1 aFourré, E.1 aMarang, L.1 aAntonelli, C.1 aCharmasson, S.1 aSiclet, F.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2018 July, v. 187 p.53-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02053naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016300160300001600323520079100339592002801130650001801158650004601176650002201222650002601244650002601270650001301296650001501309650001401324650000901338651001301347700001301360700001301373700001401386700001701400700001801417773013001435856008101565852000901646655001201655IND60701230620221120201125.0200708e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070123062DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348200700352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPu Bai, 10aSimultaneous Determination of (2R,3R)-Dihydromyricetin and Myricetin of Mongolia Medicine Sendeng-4 in RAT Plasma by Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry  ap. 913-921.  aA liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry method was developed for the simultaneous quantitation of (2R,3R)-Dihydromyricetin and Myricetin in rat plasma samples to facilitate analysis of samples collected after administration of SenDeng-4 medicine.

(RPW). This pest of economic importance in regions of Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean was not observed in the Americas until 2009. Due to its economic and environmental damage, there is an urgent need to manage or eradicate RPW in Curacao to reduce its impact on the island as well as avoid the possibility of transference to surrounding regions. Studies were conducted to explore methods available for monitoring adults with traps and acoustically assessing larval infestations in trees in the warm, dry but humid Curacao environment - considering also some special challenges of urban conditions, such as increased traffic noise or unwanted human curiosity that could negatively affect monitoring success. Bucket traps baited with 4-methyl-5-nonanol/4-methyl-5-nonanone pheromone lure, ethyl acetate and a molasses - ethylene glycol mixture captured RPW adults at consistent rates for ca. 7/d, but the rates of capture were reduced for the 9th to 14th d of a two-week sampling period. The weevils were observed to escape rapidly from dry traps but not from liquid-containing traps. A portable, user-friendly acoustic sensor system enabled identification of larvae in individual infested trees through the use of signal processing analyses that screened out bird and wind noise. This information gained about liquid baits and acoustic differences between background noise and RPW-produced sounds can assist future efforts to monitor, control, or eradicate RPW in Curacao as well as other urban landscapes. 3aRhynchophorus ferrugineus 3aacoustics 3abait traps 3abaits 3abirds 3aeconomics 3aethyl acetate 3aethylene glycol 3ahumans 3ainsect larvae 3alandscapes 3amolasses 3amonitoring 3apests 3asurveys 3atraffic 3atrees 3awind 3aAsia 3aMiddle East 3aNetherlands Antilles1 aMankin, R.W.1 aRoda, A.L.1 aKairo, M.T.K.1 aJohanns, C.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2011 Dec., v. 94, no. 4 p.766-773dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.094.04063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle05623naa a2200973 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245004400173300001600217520280400233592002803037650001503065650001303080650001303093650001903106650002503125650001503150650000903165650001703174650003903191650001103230650005003241650001303291650002203304650001603326650001903342650001503361650001003376650001103386650001103397650001603408651002103424651001503445651001803460651001703478653003203495653003003527653004203557653004603599653003703645653004103682700003003723700001703753700002203770700002303792700002303815700002103838700002103859700001903880700002203899700001903921700001903940700002603959700001703985700002004002700002004022700002104042700002104063700002304084700002604107700002104133700002104154700002304175700002304198700001404221700001504235700002104250700002104271700002004292700002504312700001604337700001904353700002104372700002304393700002204416773010304438856008704541852000904628655001204637IND60593295220221116153343.0180426e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059329522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomasi, Claudio10aAerosol remote sensing in polar regions  ap. 108-157.  aMulti-year sets of ground-based sun-photometer measurements conducted at 12 Arctic sites and 9 Antarctic sites were examined to determine daily mean values of aerosol optical thickness τ(λ) at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, from which best-fit values of Ångström's exponent α were calculated. Analysing these data, the monthly mean values of τ(0.50μm) and α and the relative frequency histograms of the daily mean values of both parameters were determined for winter–spring and summer–autumn in the Arctic and for austral summer in Antarctica. The Arctic and Antarctic covariance plots of the seasonal median values of α versus τ(0.50μm) showed: (i) a considerable increase in τ(0.50μm) for the Arctic aerosol from summer to winter–spring, without marked changes in α; and (ii) a marked increase in τ(0.50μm) passing from the Antarctic Plateau to coastal sites, whereas α decreased considerably due to the larger fraction of sea-salt aerosol. Good agreement was found when comparing ground-based sun-photometer measurements of τ(λ) and α at Arctic and Antarctic coastal sites with Microtops measurements conducted during numerous AERONET/MAN cruises from 2006 to 2013 in three Arctic Ocean sectors and in coastal and off-shore regions of the Southern Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and the Antarctic Peninsula.Lidar measurements were also examined to characterise vertical profiles of the aerosol backscattering coefficient measured throughout the year at Ny-Ålesund. Satellite-based MODIS, MISR, and AATSR retrievals of τ(λ) over large parts of the oceanic polar regions during spring and summer were in close agreement with ship-borne and coastal ground-based sun-photometer measurements. An overview of the chemical composition of mode particles is also presented, based on in-situ measurements at Arctic and Antarctic sites. Fourteen log-normal aerosol number size-distributions were defined to represent the average features of nuclei, accumulation and coarse mode particles for Arctic haze, summer background aerosol, Asian dust and boreal forest fire smoke, and for various background austral summer aerosol types at coastal and high-altitude Antarctic sites. The main columnar aerosol optical characteristics were determined for all 14 particle modes, based on in-situ measurements of the scattering and absorption coefficients. Diurnally averaged direct aerosol-induced radiative forcing and efficiency were calculated for a set of multimodal aerosol extinction models, using various Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function models over vegetation-covered, oceanic and snow-covered surfaces. These gave a reliable measure of the pronounced effects of aerosols on the radiation balance of the surface–atmosphere system over polar regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaerosols 3aaltitude 3aboreal forests 3achemical composition 3acovariance 3adust 3aforest fires 3agovernmental programs and projects 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aplateaus 3aradiative forcing 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asmoke 3aspring 3asummer 3awavelengths 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 3aArctic region 3aIndian Ocean 0aSun-photometer measurements 0aAerosol optical thickness 0aPolar aerosol optical characteristics 0aLidar backscattering coefficient profiles 0aSatellite aerosol remote sensing 0aMultimodal aerosol extinction models1 aKokhanovsky, Alexander A.1 aLupi, Angelo1 aRitter, Christoph1 aSmirnov, Alexander1 aO'Neill, Norman T.1 aStone, Robert S.1 aHolben, Brent N.1 aNyeki, Stephan1 aWehrli, Christoph1 aStohl, Andreas1 aMazzola, Mauro1 aLanconelli, Christian1 aVitale, Vito1 aStebel, Kerstin1 aAaltonen, Veijo1 ade Leeuw, Gerrit1 aRodriguez, Edith1 aHerber, Andreas B.1 aRadionov, Vladimir F.1 aZielinski, Tymon1 aPetelski, Tomasz1 aSakerin, Sergey M.1 aKabanov, Dmitry M.1 aXue, Yong1 aMei, Linlu1 aIstomina, Larysa1 aWagener, Richard1 aMcArthur, Bruce1 aSobolewski, Piotr S.1 aKivi, Rigel1 aCourcoux, Yann1 aLarouche, Pierre1 aBroccardo, Stephen1 aPiketh, Stuart J.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2015 Jan., v. 140 p.108-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013600167300001400303520152000317592002801837650001301865650001801878650001501896650002601911650002201937650001301959650001501972650002101987650001002008650001602018650001502034650002302049650001702072650001902089650001102108650001602119650001602135650001102151651001002162653001302172653002102185653002102206653002802227653002502255653001602280700001802296700001502314700001802329700002102347700002002368700001902388773010102407856008702508852000902595655001202604IND60608116920221120210848.0180904e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060811692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Junli10aMAX-DOAS measurements and satellite validation of tropospheric NO2 and SO2 vertical column densities at a rural site of North China  ap. 12-25.  aNorth China (NC), namely Huabei in Chinese, is one of the most severely polluted regions in China, and the air pollution issues in this region have received a worldwide attention. We performed ground-based Multi Axis Differential Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements at Gucheng, (39°08′N, 115°40′E), a rural site of North China about 110 km southwest of Beijing, from September 2008 to September 2010. The tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) of NO2 and SO2 were retrieved using the so-called geometric approximation. The results show that the tropospheric NO2 and SO2 VCDs over NC have nearly the same seasonal variation pattern, with the maximum in winter and minimum in summer, while their diurnal variations are different. We also compared the tropospheric NO2 and SO2 VCDs from our MAX-DOAS measurements with several products of corresponding OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite observations. While in summer good agreement is found, the satellite observations systematically underestimate the tropospheric NO2 in winter over the polluted rural area of NC, probably mostly due to the so called aerosol shielding effect. In contrast, for SO2 no such clear conclusion can be drawn, probably owing to the larger uncertainties from MAX-DOAS and in particular satellite retrievals. This indicates that improvements of the retrieval algorithm for MAX-DOAS and off-line corrections of satellite measurements for the tropospheric SO2 VCDs should be given more emphasis in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3aalgorithms 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adiurnal variation 3ageometry 3amonitoring 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3arural areas 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3aspectroscopy 3asulfur dioxide 3asummer 3atroposphere 3auncertainty 3awinter 3aChina 0aMAX-DOAS 0aTropospheric NO2 0aTropospheric SO2 0aVertical column density 0aSatellite validation 0aNorth China1 aMa, Jianzhong1 aLin, Weili1 aZhao, Huarong1 aShaiganfar, Reza1 aBeirle, Steffen1 aWagner, Thomas0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 May, v. 133 p.12-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010900172300001600281520238900297592002802686650001002714650001502724650002702739650001802766650001402784650002402798650001702822650001402839650002102853650001502874650001202889650001902901650001302920650003202933650002602965650001402991650001103005650002703016650002903043650004403072700002103116700001603137700002703153773014503180856008203325852000903407655001203416IND60627243520221122061920.0190816e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1468-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlotterbeck, Jörg10aQuantitative analysis of chemoresistance-inducing fatty acid in food supplements using UHPLC–ESI-MS/MS  ap. 479-491.  aPolyunsaturated fatty acids are important signaling molecules. A recent study reported hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid, 12-oxo-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid, and (12S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid as chemotherapy resistance-inducing factors when tumor cells were treated with cisplatin. Marine-based food supplements like fish oil or algae extracts are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and can contain large amounts of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid. Thus, it was concluded that oral uptake of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid might induce chemoresistance as shown in a mouse model. Cancer patients tend to consume food supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids on a regular basis. The uptake of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid and (12S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid should be controlled, because even low concentrations of 0.5 ng mL⁻¹ showed chemoresistance-inducing effects in animal experiments. For accurate analysis of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid and (12S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid a validated method was developed by using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry via electrospray ionization and sample preparation by solid-phase extraction (SPE) with 3-aminopropyl silica. A combined targeted/untargeted approach was utilized using MS/MS by data-independent acquisition with SWATH and applied to commercial food supplements (refined fish oil, fish oil capsules, algae oil capsules, and flaxseed capsules). Accurate quantification of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid and (12S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid on the MS/MS level with simultaneous untargeted fatty acid screening revealed additional information. The LODs for hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid and (12S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid were 0.036 ng mL⁻¹ and 0.054 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. Since hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid was present in the samples in large amounts and (12S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic was not expected to be present in high concentrations, two calibration ranges, namely, 0.5–20 ng mL⁻¹ and 5–200 ng mL⁻¹, were validated. An untargeted screening identified 18–39 free fatty acids being present in the lipid extracts of the food supplement samples.

Regeneration of missing endocrine cells would be a significant improvement over hormone replacement therapies, which incur side effects and do not mimic physiological secretion patterns. Recent in vitro studies have identified a population of adult pituitary progenitors that express the HMG box transcription factors SOX2 and SOX9. Here, we apply cell-lineage tracing analysis to demonstrate that SOX2- and SOX9-expressing progenitors can self-renew and give rise to endocrine cells in vivo, suggesting that they are tissue stem cells. Moreover, we show that they can become mobilized and differentiate into the appropriate endocrine cell types in response to physiological stress. Our results highlight the pituitary as a model for exploring how physiological changes influence stem cell behavior and suggest that manipulation of endogenous pituitary stem cells is a potential therapeutic strategy for pituitary deficiencies.

In recent years, the lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been reported to probably play a central role in inflammatory diseases. However, its role in IH-induced endothelial injury remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated the IH-induced ECs inflammation and apoptosis, as well as the role of S1P in both. First, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with IH to explore the mechanism of S1P and S1P microbubbles (S1P-MBs) in HUVECs with altered function. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) significantly increased after IH treatment, which further resulted in the increased efficiency of cell apoptosis. Following the S1P and S1P-MBs treatments, the lower Bax protein and Cyt c protein levels in HUVECs indicated the protective effects of S1P for CIH-induced ECs injury. The reason may be that the enhanced expression levels of Gα(i) and S1P receptor 1 in S1P and S1P-MBs treatment groups could actively increase intracellular p-Akt and p-eNOS protein levels, which counteract the increased ROS secondary to inflammation from IH. Therefore, the Akt/eNOS signaling pathway induced by S1P may be important in protecting IH-induced ECs injury. Furthermore, the S1P-MBs may be designed as a novel S1P dosage formulation to protect the body from the ECs injuries in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahypoxia 3ainflammation 3alipids 3amicrobubbles 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3asleep apnea 0aSphingosine-1-phosphate 0aMicrobubbles 0aIntermittent hypoxia 0aEndothelial cell injury 0aObstructive sleep apnea1 aYuan, Chu-xiao1 aTong, Jia-yi1 aZhang, Guang-hao1 aZhou, Fang-ping1 aYang, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6922-63480 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 498, no. 4 p.1016-1021dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010700166300001400273500001900287520089100306592002801197650001901225650002201244650001201266650002201278650001801300650001401318650000901332651001401341653001401355653001301369653003001382653002601412700001501438700001901453700001701472700001201489700001701501700001801518700005901536773011601595856008501711852000901796655001201805IND60694030420221120150407.0200509e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069403042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Maoyi10aSequential analyses of actinides in large-size soil and sediment samples with total sample dissolution  ap. 73-80.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is a growing demand for the determination of actinides in soil and sediment samples for environmental monitoring and tracing, radiological protection, and nuclear forensic reasons. A total sample dissolution method based on lithium metaborate fusion, followed by sequential column chromatography separation, was developed for simultaneous determination of Pu, Am and Cm isotopes in large-size environmental samples by alpha spectrometry and mass spectrometric techniques. The overall recoveries of both Pu and Am for the entire procedure were higher than 70% for large-size soil samples. The method was validated using 20 g of soil samples spiked with known amounts of ²³⁹Pu and ²⁴¹Am as well as the certified reference materials IAEA-384 (Fangataufa Lagoon sediment) and IAEA-385 (Irish Sea sediment). All the measured results agreed very well with the expected values.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3aforensic sciences 3alithium 3amass spectrometry 3aradioactivity 3asediments 3asoil 3aIrish Sea 0aActinides 0aSediment 0aLithium metaborate fusion 0aSequential separation1 aXing, Shan1 aYang, Yonggang1 aSong, Lijuan1 aMa, Yan1 aWang, Yadong1 aDai, Xiongxin1 aHappel, Steffen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3567-94150 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2018 July, v. 187 p.73-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245012900175300001600304520111100320592002801431650002201459650001701481650002001498650002001518650001201538650001501550650001101565650001701576650001601593653001501609653002201624653002601646653002501672653001401697773010301711856008701814852000901901655001201910IND60593295420221116153419.0180426e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059329542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina, Eustoquio10aEvidence and causes of the main extinction events in the Paleogene based on extinction and survival patterns of foraminifera  ap. 166-181.  aWe review the four main extinction events in the Paleogene, from the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary to the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, integrating the results obtained from a study of foraminiferal assemblages with other paleontological and geological data. Different survival strategies followed by the species are described and the duration of the phases of extinction, survival, and recovery is estimated. The models and patterns of extinction of the foraminifera are highlighted. We present a range of evidence and paleo-environmental factors and analyze the possible causes of extinction. A new terminology for mass extinction events is proposed: sudden mass extinction would have happened virtually instantaneously and the process would have taken a few years or decades (Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary). Rapid mass extinction is defined as that which occurred in relatively short events, around 100kyr (Paleocene/Eocene and Eocene/Oligocene boundaries). Slow mass extinctions are suggested to have lasted around 1Myr (Bartonian/Priabonian transition) and may even have lasted for several million years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aEocene epoch 3aOligocene epoch 3aPaleocene epoch 3aRetaria 3aextinction 3amodels 3apaleoecology 3aterminology 0aExtinction 0aSurvival strategy 0aPlanktic foraminifera 0aBenthic foraminifera 0aPaleogene0 tEarth-science reviews.g2015 Jan., v. 140 p.166-181dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008400169300001600253520112000269592002801389650001101417650002101428650002001449650001001469650001501479650001801494650001901512650001401531650002401545650003301569650001601602700002001618700002301638700002601661773013001687856008101817852000901898655001201907IND60701231020221120213013.0200708e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070123102DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348200700842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFatemeh Farjami, 10aDetermination of Amitriptyline on a Carbon Nanocomposite Ionic Liquid Electrode  ap. 941-950.  aThis manuscript reports oxidation of amitriptyline at the carbon nanocomposite ionic liquid electrode fabricated using multi-walled carbon nanotubes and the ionic liquid 1-octylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate. The surface morphology of the electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Differential pulse voltammetry was applied as an analytical procedure for the determination of the sub-micromolar concentration of amitriptyline. Different experimental parameters were optimized. Considering optimized conditions, the proposed electrode represented remarkable sensitivity toward determination of amitriptyline compared to other conventional electrodes and linearity in the range from 5 × 10–⁸ to 9 × 10–⁵ was obtained for amitriptyline with the detection limit of 1.9 × 10–⁸ M. Cyclic voltammetry was applied to obtain information about the reaction mechanism and calculating some kinetic parameters. The oxidation process was irreversible and showed adsorption-controlled behavior. The method was successfully applied for the quantification of amitriptyline in pharmaceuticals forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3aelectrodes 3aionic liquids 3ananocomposites 3aoxidation 3areaction mechanisms 3ascanning electron microscopy 3avoltammetry1 aFasihi, Farshid1 aValibeigi, Marzieh1 aMoradi, Seyed Esmaeil0 tJournal of analytical chemistry.g2020 July, v. 75, no. 7 p.941-950dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000000418x1061-93487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10619348200700843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012900167300001600296520081300312592002801125650002301153650001401176650002001190650001301210700002301223700001601246773009001262856008601352852000901438655001201447IND50067565620221118011747.0141111e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006756562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.07.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xuan10aInhibitory effect of polysaccharides from pumpkin on advanced glycation end-products formation and aldose reductase activity  ap. 821-825.  aInhibitors of advanced glycation end-products formation and aldose reductase have been considered to be potential treatment of diabetic complications.

The results showed that the inhibitory effects of PPs on the formation of advanced glycation end-products were higher than 50%, at 200μg/ml, stronger than the positive control aminoguanidine, and the inhibitory effects of PPs on aldose reductase were higher than 58%, at 500μg/ml, but not as potent as the positive control epalrestat.

To guide future conservation, it is important to determine the extinction risk of newly described species. Here, we test how time since formal description of a species is linked to its threat status to obtain a better insight into the possible threat status of newly described species and as yet undescribed species. We compiled IUCN Red List data for 53,808 species from five vertebrate groups described since 1758. Extinction risk for more recently described species has increased significantly over time; the proportion of threatened species among newly described species has increased from 11.9% for species described between 1758 and 1767 to 30.0% for those described between 2011 and 2020. Based on projections from our analysis, this could further increase to 47.1% by 2050. The pattern is consistent across vertebrate taxonomic groups and biomes. Current species extinction rates estimated from data of all known species are therefore highly likely to be underestimated. Intensive fieldwork to boost discovery of new species and immediate conservation action for newly described species, especially in tropical areas, is urgently required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextinction 3anew species 3arisk 3athreatened species 3avertebrates1 aSlik, Ferry1 aZheng, Shilu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0332-27531 aLindenmayer, David B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4766-40880 tConservation letters.g2022 May, v. 15, no. 3 p.e12876-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.128763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245013600167300002000303520138100323592002801704650002201732650000901754650001501763650003801778650001001816650000901826650001401835650001901849650001801868650001301886650001901899650000901918650002401927650001401951650003301965650001201998650001702010653002502027653002002052653001802072653001802090653001302108700006102121700002602182700002302208773014102231856007802372852000902450655001202459IND60598288020180803000000.0180629e20180511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059828802DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b045592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJesus, Celso R.

The aim was to control the nanostructural features of the nanocomposite, improve the release profile of the sodium diclofenac (SDCF) drug, and optimize the swelling behavior of the hydrophilic matrix. The nanoscopic characteristics of the siloxane-cross-linked poly(ethylene oxide) network, the semicrystallinity of the hybrid, and the intercalated or exfoliated structure of the clay were investigated by X-ray diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry. The correlation between the nanoscopic features of nanocomposites containing different amounts of MMT and the swelling behavior revealed the key role of exfoliated silicate in controlling the water uptake by means of a flow barrier effect. The release of the drug from the nanocomposite displayed a stepped pattern kinetically controlled by the diffusion of SDCF molecules through the mass transport barrier created by the exfoliated silicate. The sustained SDCF release provided by the hybrid hydrogel nanocomposite could be useful for the prolonged treatment of painful conditions, such as arthritis, sprains and strains, gout, migraine, and pain after surgical procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aclay 3adiclofenac 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3agout 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3amass transfer 3amigraine 3ananocomposites 3apain 3apolyethylene glycol 3asilicates 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asurgery 3awater uptake 0asiloxane−polyether 0amontmorillonite 0ananocomposite 0adrug delivery 0aswelling1 aMolina, Eduardo F.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3574-29231 aPulcinelli, Sandra H.1 aSantilli, Celso V.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 May 11, v. 10, no. 22 p.19059-19068dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b045593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245008700209300001400296506007600310520226600386592002802652506003702680650001102717650002302728650001502751650002302766650002302789650002602812650002002838650001602858650001802874650001302892650002302905650001202928650001202940650001602952651001902968653001102987653001602998653002303014653001603037653002403053653001803077653001903095700001703114700001503131700001403146700002103160700001603181773012303197856008303320852000903403655001203412IND60532394520221207114924.0190318e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0322doi7 aPMC39904522pmcid7 a247486982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarratt, M.P.D.10aAvoiding a bad apple: Insect pollination enhances fruit quality and economic value  ap. 34-40.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInsect pollination is important for food production globally and apples are one of the major fruit crops which are reliant on this ecosystem service. It is fundamentally important that the full range of benefits of insect pollination to crop production are understood, if the costs of interventions aiming to enhance pollination are to be compared against the costs of the interventions themselves. Most previous studies have simply assessed the benefits of pollination to crop yield and ignored quality benefits and how these translate through to economic values. In the present study we examine the influence of insect pollination services on farmgate output of two important UK apple varieties; Gala and Cox. Using field experiments, we quantify the influence of insect pollination on yield and importantly quality and whether either may be limited by sub-optimal insect pollination. Using an expanded bioeconomic model we value insect pollination to UK apple production and establish the potential for improvement through pollination service management. We show that insects are essential in the production of both varieties of apple in the UK and contribute a total of £36.7 million per annum, over £6 million more than the value calculated using more conventional dependence ratio methods. Insect pollination not only affects the quantity of production but can also have marked impacts on the quality of apples, influencing size, shape and effecting their classification for market. These effects are variety specific however. Due to the influence of pollination on both yield and quality in Gala, there is potential for insect pollination services to improve UK output by up to £5.7 million per annum. Our research shows that continued pollinator decline could have serious financial implications for the apple industry but there is considerable scope through management of wild pollinators or using managed pollinator augmentation, to improve the quality of production. Furthermore, we show that it is critically important to consider all production parameters including quality, varietal differences and management costs when valuing the pollination service of any crop so investment in pollinator management can be proportional to its contribution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapples 3abioeconomic models 3acrop yield 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3afield experimentation 3afood production 3afruit crops 3afruit quality 3aindustry 3ainsect pollination 3ainsects 3amarkets 3apollinators 3aUnited Kingdom 0aApples 0aPollination 0aEconomic valuation 0aPollinators 0aPollination deficit 0aApple quality 0aUnited Kingdom1 aBreeze, T.D.1 aJenner, N.1 aPolce, C.1 aBiesmeijer, J.C.1 aPotts, S.G.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 184 p.34-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001500189245008600204300001600290520109800306592002801404650002501432650002001457650001001477650000901487650002101496650004301517650001501560700001601575700001901591700001601610700001501626700002201641700001701663700001801680700001301698700002401711700001701735700001601752700002001768700002201788773008901810856008201899990002301981852000902004655001202013IND60092898020221120192611.0141103e20131003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009289802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2013.07.0172doi7 aPMC38450892pmcid7 a240353532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Guoji10aMapping Cellular Hierarchy by Single-Cell Analysis of the Cell Surface Repertoire  ap. 492-505.  aStem cell differentiation pathways are most often studied at the population level, whereas critical decisions are executed at the level of single cells. We have established a highly multiplexed, quantitative PCR assay to profile in an unbiased manner a panel of all commonly used cell surface markers (280 genes) from individual cells. With this method, we analyzed over 1,500 single cells throughout the mouse hematopoietic system and illustrate its utility for revealing important biological insights. The comprehensive single cell data set permits mapping of the mouse hematopoietic stem cell differentiation hierarchy by computational lineage progression analysis. Further profiling of 180 intracellular regulators enabled construction of a genetic network to assign the earliest differentiation event during hematopoietic lineage specification. Analysis of acute myeloid leukemia elicited by MLL-AF9 uncovered a distinct cellular hierarchy containing two independent self-renewing lineages with different clonal activities. The strategy has broad applicability in other cellular systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell differentiation 3adata collection 3agenes 3amice 3amyeloid leukemia 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells1 aLuc, Sidinh1 aMarco, Eugenio1 aLin, Ta-Wei1 aPeng, Cong1 aKerenyi, Marc A.1 aBeyaz, Semir1 aKim, Woo-Jin,1 aXu, Jian1 aDas, Partha Pratim1 aNeff, Tobias1 aZou, Keyong1 aYuan, Guo-Cheng1 aOrkin, Stuart H.,0 tCell stem cell.g2013 Oct. 3, v. 13, no. 4 p.492-505dElsevier Inc.x1934-59097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2013.07.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011500173300001600288520103900304592002801343650001301371650001601384650001001400650001401410650002101424650001101445653002501456653002101481653001401502653003101516653002001547700002301567773010701590856008601697852000901783655001201792IND60553019220221119144932.0161021e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055301922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRochowski, Pawel10aPhysical signatures of drug transport through an artificial skin barrier—A proposed model and its validation  ap. 107-113.  aThe objective of the present study is to better characterize the system acting as a model for the penetration of a pharmaceutical drug into the skin. With a new mathematical formalism, the transport of the drug (dithranol) from a semisolid vaseline suspension into an artificial membrane was described. In our novel approach, we have taken into account not only diffusion but also other effects dependent on chemical reactivity of drug, medium structure, and drug–matrix interactions. The transport equation was solved with two methods: the Laplace transform and the reflection-and-superposition. Despite the applied method, the three-dimensional calculations were found to be, in major parts, in good agreement with the experimental data resulting from the photoacoustic depth profiling. For the first time, from the depth profiling we were capable of estimating not only the diffusion coefficient but also other parameters of the permeation phenomenon as the pore velocity, the first and the zero order reaction rate coefficients.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3adiffusivity 3adrugs 3aequations 3amodel validation 3amodels 0aDrug transport model 0aDrug penetration 0aDithranol 0aPhotoacoustic spectroscopy 0aDepth profiling1 aSzurkowski, Janusz0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 May 01, v. 117 p.107-113dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03836naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245015700173300001400330520245400344592002802798650001702826650001702843650001102860650001402871650002002885650001202905650001102917650001402928650001602942650001902958650001902977650001602996651001003012653001103022653001203033653001503045653001503060653001503075653001803090700001203108700001903120700001803139773010103157856008703258852000903345655001203354IND60593296020221116153357.0180426e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059329602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2016.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zong-Feng10aOn the chemical markers of pyroxenite contributions in continental basalts in Eastern China: Implications for source lithology and the origin of basalts  ap. 18-31.  aAlthough it is widely recognized that mantle peridotite is compositionally heterogeneous, primitive mantle-like peridotite is commonly considered the potential peridotite source when identifying the source lithology of oceanic and continental basalts. Here, a simple equation that compatible with thermodynamic result (Ol (wt%)=144.27ln((Fe+Mg+Ca+2Na)/Si), mol ratio) is introduced to distinguish peridotitic and pyroxenitic rocks. Meanwhile, the basic assumptions, alternative interpretations and uncertainties of many of the literature markers for pyroxenite contributions in basalts are briefly summarized, and some detailed comments on these markers are presented using literature data on olivines and basalts from Eastern China. Both high-CaO (>0.1wt%) and low-CaO (<0.1wt%) olivines in these continental basalts are likely generated by a xenocryst diffusive re-equilibration process, suggesting that the olivine chemistry method may not be suitable for the source lithology identification of the basalts. For the Cenozoic and Mesozoic continental basalts in Eastern China, nearly all of the markers for pyroxenite sources based on whole-rock major and/or trace elements might be compromised by refertilized/metasomatized peridotite sources. These uncertainties also exist for many other oceanic and continental basalts. However, the FC3MS (FeOᵀ/CaO-3∗MgO/SiO2, all in wt%) value, combined with those of Na2O+K2O, Mg#, MgO and La/Yb, suggests that Cenozoic OIB-type basalts in Eastern China are mostly primary pyroxenite-derived products, and caution should be paid when interpreting the petrological and geological implications of these basalts, particularly that of the low-MgO pyroxenite-derived basalts. At the normal mantle potential temperature (~1350–1400°C), the pyroxenite source can produce melts that explain all of the compositional characteristics of the Cenozoic basalts, suggesting that the origin temperature and pressure of the Cenozoic basalts determined by the traditional peridotite model are overestimated. For the Mesozoic basalts, compositionally diverse peridotite sources can account for their petrogenesis, but the pyroxenite source cannot be excluded. We acknowledge that the pyroxenite source may represent crustal materials (continental or oceanic crust) recycling and/or mantle metasomatism, which have important geodynamic implications, but further work is needed to determine the origin of the pyroxenite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenozoic era 3aMesozoic era 3abasalt 3aequations 3amagnesium oxide 3amelting 3amodels 3arecycling 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3atrace elements 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aBasalt 0aOlivine 0aPeridotite 0aPyroxenite 0aXenocrysts 0aPrimary magma1 aLi, Jie1 aLiang, Wen-Fei1 aLuo, Zhao-Hua0 tEarth-science reviews.g2016 June, v. 157 p.18-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2016.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245016500179300001600344520143800360592002801798650001301826650002601839650001601865650001401881650002301895650001301918650002001931650001901951650002101970650001301991650001902004650002402023650001902047650002602066653003502092653001102127653002002138653001402158700002802172700002802200700002402228700002702252700002602279700002102305700002502326700002802351773010702379856008602486852000902572655001202581IND60553019320221119145030.0161021e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055301932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirgorodskaya, Alla B.10aDesign of supramolecular biomimetic catalysts of high substrate specificity by noncovalent self-assembly of calix[4]arenes with amphiphilic and polymeric amines  ap. 497-504.  aSupramolecular biomimetic catalysts of high substrate specificity are developed based on amphiphilic oxyethylated calix[4]arene bearing iso-nonyl fragments at the upper rim and hexadeca(ethylene glycol) fragments at lower rim (9CO16), and amines of amphiphilic or polymeric nature. Two critical concentrations determined by tensiometry and dye solubilization methods are probably reflect the onset of association process and transition from bimodal to monomodal size distribution revealed by the dynamic light scattering method. Amine components used may form aggregates as well, which is mediated by hydrophobic effect due to occurrence of long-chain alkyl tails. The micellar rate effect of the designed systems toward the cleavage of carboxylic acid ester is shown to be contributed by the formation of mixed aggregates with the reactive functional groups, as well as by the pKa shift of the amine and the character of the distribution of reagents in functional micelles. In the case of long-chain primary amines, an inversion of micellar rate effect (catalysis to inhibition) occurs upon transferring from the less hydrophobic substrate, p-nitrophenyl acetate, to the more hydrophobic analogs, p-nitrophenyl laurate and p-nitrophenyl caprinate. The opposite effect (inhibition of the reaction of p-nitrophenyl acetate and the acceleration of the process of hydrophobic analogs) was observed in systems based on polyethyleneimine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiomimetics 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acolloids 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3aprimary amines 3areaction inhibition 3asolubilization 3asubstrate specificity 0aPolyoxyethylated calix[4]arene 0aAmines 0aEsters cleavage 0aCatalysis1 aYackevich, Ekaterina I.1 aKudryashova, Yuliana R.1 aKashapov, Ruslan R.1 aSolovieva, Svetlana E.1 aGubaidullin, Aidar T.1 aAntipin, Igor S.1 aZakharova, Lucia Ya.1 aKonovalov, Alexander I.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 May 01, v. 117 p.497-504dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245009300195500002000288520114900308592002801457650001501485650000801500650001701508650001901525650002001544650001401564650001301578650001701591650001401608700005801622700006101680773012601741856007501867852000901942655001201951IND60781152520221119130111.0220623e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078115252DNAL7 a10.1002/aps3.114752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Liming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8982-243510aPhyloHerb: A high‐throughput phylogenomic pipeline for processing genome skimming data  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE: The application of high‐throughput sequencing, especially to herbarium specimens, is rapidly accelerating biodiversity research. Low‐coverage sequencing of total genomic DNA (genome skimming) is particularly promising and can simultaneously recover the plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear ribosomal regions across hundreds of species. Here, we introduce PhyloHerb, a bioinformatic pipeline to efficiently assemble phylogenomic data sets derived from genome skimming. METHODS AND RESULTS: PhyloHerb uses either a built‐in database or user‐specified references to extract orthologous sequences from all three genomes using a BLAST search. It outputs FASTA files and offers a suite of utility functions to assist with alignment, partitioning, concatenation, and phylogeny inference. The program is freely available at https://github.com/lmcai/PhyloHerb/. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that PhyloHerb can accurately identify genes using a published data set from Clusiaceae. We also show via simulations that our approach is effective for highly fragmented assemblies from herbarium specimens and is scalable to thousands of species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClusiaceae 3aDNA 3abiodiversity 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aherbaria 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny1 aZhang, Hongrui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4845-260X1 aDavis, Charles C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8747-11010 tApplications in plant sciences.g2022 May, v. 10, no. 3 p.e11475-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19710x2168-04507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aps3.114753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245014800162300001600310500002000326520180700346592002802153596005102181596005102232596005102283650001302334650001202347650001902359650001202378650002002390650001002410650001102420650001502431650002402446650001902470700002102489700001902510700002502529773013302554856007602687852000902763655001202772IND60786388120221118204847.0220803e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078638812DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.16003972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamut, Jannathan10aFlexibility of resource allocation in a hermaphroditic‐gynomonoecious herb through deployment of female and male resources in perfect flowers  ap. 461-467.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: It has been hypothesized that two flower types permit flexible allocation of resources to female and male functions, yet empirical evidence for the sex‐allocation hypothesis remains scarce in gynomonoecious species. To characterize resource allocation to pistillate and perfect flowers and allocation of perfect flowers between gynomonoecious and hermaphroditic individuals, we examined the flexibility and whether female‐biased allocation increases with plant size in the hermaphroditic‐gynomonoecious herb Eremurus anisopterus. METHODS: Frequency of gynomonoecious individuals, flower production, and plant size were investigated in different populations. Floral allocation was compared among the three flower types of E. anisopterus. KEY RESULTS: Frequency of gynomonoecious plants varied from 2–17% in nine populations. Only larger plants produced female flowers at the bottom of racemes. Both female and perfect flower production tended to increase proportionately with plant size in gynomonoecious individuals. Female flowers did not produce less biomass than perfect flowers from hermaphroditic or gynomonoecious plants. However, both female and perfect flowers from gynomonoecious individuals had lighter stamen mass, but larger pistil mass, than perfect flowers from hermaphrodites. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prediction of an increase in female flower number with plant size was not observed in E. anisopterus, the flexibility of sex allocation in gynomonoecious species was confirmed in that gynomonoecious individuals had a female‐biased floral allocation compared to hermaphroditic individuals. Such comparisons of gynomonoecious to hermaphroditic individuals permit us to unveil a sexual adjustment strategy: flexibility of sexual investments within plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a31460128cNational Science Foundation of China  aU1603231cNational Science Foundation of China  a31470320cNational Science Foundation of China 3aEremurus 3abiomass 3afemale flowers 3afemales 3ahermaphroditism 3amales 3apistil 3aprediction 3aresource allocation 3asex allocation1 aXiong, Ying‐Ze1 aTan, Dun‐Yan1 aHuang, Shuang‐Quan0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Mar., v. 104, no. 3 p.461-467dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.16003973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245019200170300001600362520143300378592002801811650003101839650003101870650001501901650001001916650001301926650002001939650001801959650002601977650001302003650001302016650002602029650001302055650001602068650001702084650003002101650001702131650001302148700001902161700002002180700002202200700002102222700002402243700002202267700002002289700001902309700002502328700002002353700002402373700002402397773014502421856008202566852000902648655001202657IND60627244420221122053233.0190816e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1466-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinaldi, Francesca10aEpitope and affinity determination of recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ag85B antigen towards anti-Ag85 antibodies using proteolytic affinity-mass spectrometry and biosensor analysis  ap. 439-448.  aTuberculosis (TB) is the first cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide. Only a single anti-TB vaccine is currently available for clinical use, but its efficacy is not achieved with certainty. The aim of this work is to provide a basis for the rational design of a neo-glycoconjugate vaccine against TB. Structural characterization of recombinant antigenic proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) Ag85B (rAg85B, variants, and semi-synthetic glycoconjugates) was initially carried out. Identification of antibody epitope analyses by proteolytic affinity-mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor analyses were performed in order to qualitatively identify and quantitatively characterize interaction structures of the antigens with antibodies from different sources. A commercial monoclonal antibody and polyclonal antibodies from different sources (patients with active TB, vaccinated individuals, and a healthy control) were employed to analyze antigen-antibody interactions. These combined approaches provided the identification of different assembled epitope regions on the recombinant MTB antigens, their affinity binding constants in the interactions with specific antibodies, and revealed the importance of protection from excessive glycosylation. The identified epitope peptides should constitute a suitable basis for the design of new specific target vaccines.

We investigated how light and soil variation affected early growth, biomass partitioning, morphology, and physiology of 22 tree species common in tropical dry forest, including eight legumes. Our hypothesis was that legume seedlings are better at taking advantage of increased resource availability, which contributes to their successful regeneration in tropical dry forests. METHODS: We grew seedlings in a full‐factorial design under two light levels in two soil types that differed in nutrient concentrations and soil moisture. We measured height biweekly and, at final harvest, biomass partitioning, internode segments, leaf carbon, nitrogen, δ¹³C, and δ¹⁵N. KEY RESULTS: Legumes initially grew taller and maintained that height advantage over time under all experimental conditions. Legumes also had the highest final total biomass and water‐use efficiency in the high‐light and high‐resource soil. For nitrogen‐fixing legumes, the amount of nitrogen derived from fixation was highest in the richer soil. Although seed mass tended to be larger in legumes, seed size alone did not account for all the differences between legumes and nonlegumes. Both belowground and aboveground resources were limiting to early seedling growth and function. CONCLUSIONS: Legumes may have a different regeneration niche, in that they germinate rapidly and grow taller than other species immediately after germination, maximizing their performance when light and belowground resources are readily available, and potentially permitting them to take advantage of high light, nutrient, and water availability at the beginning of the wet season.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB‐1053237cU.S. National Science Foundation CAREER 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3aforest trees 3agermination 3aleaves 3alegumes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aseed size 3aseed weight 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asoil types 3asoil water 3atropical dry forests 3awater use efficiency 3awet season1 aGei, Maria G.1 aBergstrom, Ellie1 aBecklund, Kristen K.1 aBecknell, Justin M.1 aWaring, Bonnie G.1 aWerden, Leland K.1 aPowers, Jennifer S.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Mar., v. 104, no. 3 p.399-410dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.16002763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01461naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002200140245006900162300001600231500002400247500002400271520055300295650001200848650001700860650002100877650001900898651002100917700002300938773010900961852000901070856008001079655001201159IND4462674020221116150046.0120131s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446267402DNAL7 a10.1653/024.094.04202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÜstüner, Turgay10aNew Data about Xylomya Species from Turkey (Diptera: Xylomyidae)  ap. 859-862.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aThe Xylomya species found in Turkey are summarized and illustrated in this work.

On a semitechnical scale, different doses of PAC-type aluminum coagulant (polyaluminum chloride) were tested. The required doses of coagulant (on average, 11 mg Al/L) were determined based on the amount of phosphorus that is bioavailable in the lake ecosystem. The research covered the lake water, near-bottom and interstitial water, and bottom sediments of five lakes with low alkalinity (0.4–2.5 meq/L) and low calcium contents (5–35 mg Ca/L). The experiments were conducted in situ for 2 years using mesocosms with a volume of approximately 20 m³. The effectiveness of the flocculation and sedimentation processes of coagulant flocs was closely related to changes in water pH caused by acidic coagulant application, and the corresponding transformation level ranged from 39.8 to 99.8%. In the waters of these lakes, where the alkalinity did not reach 1 meq/L, the coagulant used in doses adequate for intensive full-scale projects caused high water pollution with dissolved aluminum fractions (from 0.05 ± 0.01 to 4.67 ± 1.32 mg Al/L). In all lakes, the penetration of dissolved aluminum into the interstitial water of the bottom sediment was limited to the first 5-cm layer. After the application of coagulant, the aluminum content in the bottom sediments significantly increased in proportion to the amount of the PAC used (by 12–96% in terms of a 5-cm surface layer of sediment). Within 2 years of the research, solid fractions (flocks) of the coagulant moved to a depth of 5–10 cm below the bottom level. Due to high release rates of aluminum from the applied aluminum treatments, modifications to the treatment protocols are needed in soft-water lakes.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEC-2012/05/B/ST10/02178cNarodowe Centrum Nauki  a010/RID/2018/19cMinisterstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wyższego 3aair 3aalkalinity 3aaluminum 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acoagulants 3aecosystems 3aflocculation 3alakes 3apH 3aphosphorus 3asediments 3asoil pollution 3awater 3awater pollution1 aAugustyniak, Renata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0098-04271 aGrochowska, Jolanta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7319-41741 aParszuto, Katarzyna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1373-22651 aTandyrak, Renata1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6767-65721 aWiśniewski, Grzegorz,0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 July, v. 231, no. 7 p.358-358dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04708-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014100164300001600305520143200321592002801753650002701781650003301808650002301841650002301864650002201887650001201909650002201921650001201943650001301955650001701968650003001985653002802015653002402043653001602067653001602083653002702099700001702126700001902143773014702162856008302309852000902392655001202401IND60610308520221117080641.0191231e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061030852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Do Wan10aCrystal structure of hypothetical protein PA4202 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in complex with nitroethane as a nitroalkane substrate  ap. 330-337.  aNitroalkane oxidase (NAO) and nitronate monooxygenase (NMO) are two different types of nitroalkane oxidizing flavoenzymes identified in nature. A previous study suggested that the hypothetical protein PA4202 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is NMO and utilizes only anionic nitronates. However, the structural similarity between the PA4202 protein and Streptomyces ansochromogenes NAO has motivated investigation for what features of the two enzymes differentiate between the NAO and NMO activities. Herein, we report the crystal structure of PA4202 in a ternary complex with a neutral nitroethane (NE) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor to elucidate the substrate recognition mechanism using a site-directed mutagenesis. The ternary complex structure indicates that the NE is bound with an orientation, which is poised for the proton transfer to H183 (which is the essential first catalytic step with nitroalkanes), and subsequent reactions with FMN. Moreover, a kinetic study reveals that the catalytic reactions of the wild type and H183 mutants PA4202s with nitroalkane substrates may yield the products of hydrogen peroxide and nitrite that are specified to NAO, although they show a low catalytic efficiency. Our results provide the first structure-based molecular insight into the substrate binding property of the hypothetical protein PA4202, including the interactions with neutral nitroalkanes as the substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStreptomyces ansochromogenes 3abinding properties 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3aenzymes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amutants 3anitrites 3anitroalkanes 3asite-directed mutagenesis 0aNitronate monooxygenase 0aNitroalkane oxidase 0aFlavoenzyme 0aNitroalkane 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa1 aLee, Ki Seog1 aChi, Young Min0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Sept. 03, v. 503, no. 1 p.330-337dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007300170300001800243520080900261592002801070650001501098650002201113650001701135650001401152650001801166650002401184650002401208650002201232650001101254650001901265650001601284653002301300653001801323653002801341653002101369653002201390700002001412700002001432700006601452773014801518856008201666852000901748655001201757IND60628042220221116195008.0190129e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062804222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlić, Budimir S.10aAscorbic acid as DNase I inhibitor in prevention of male infertility  ap. 1073-1077.  aApoptotic and/or ROS-induced DNA fragmentation in sperm cells may contribute to the development of male infertility. As the known dietary antioxidant, ascorbic acid prevents ROS production and protects sperm cells from DNA damage. Here, we found that ascorbic acid has the ability to inhibit DNase I, one of the main endonucleases involved in DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. Site Finder and Molecular docking defined the ascorbic acid interactions with the most important residues of DNase I, including H-donor interactions with Asp 168 and Asn 170, and H-acceptor interaction with Asn 170. As a furan derivative, ascorbic acid could be considered a pioneer of substrate-based DNase I inhibitors.

High-frequency gene targeting was obtained using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated double-strand break (DSB) formation at a pre-defined target genomic location using a unique intron directly downstream of a promoter driving a selectable marker gene to facilitate homology between target and donor sequences. In this system, only insertion into the target locus leads to a functional selectable marker, and regeneration from random insertions of the promoterless donor construct are reduced on selection media. A new stack of transgenes can potentially be loaded with each successive cycle of gene targeting by exchanging the selectable marker gene using the intron homology. This system was tested in maize using the pat selectable marker gene, whereby up to 30% of the plants regenerated on Bialaphos-containing medium were observed to have the donor construct integrated into the target locus. Unlike previous gene targeting methods that utilize defective or partial genes for selecting targeted events, the present method exchanges fully functional genes with every cycle of targeting, thereby allowing the recycling of selectable marker genes, hypothetically for multiple generations of gene targeting.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3agene targeting 3agenetic markers 3aintrons 3aloci 3arecycling 3atransgenes 3azinc finger motif 0aAad1 0aBC 0aeZFN 0aOsubi3 0aPat 0aPhiyfp 0aSCBV 0aTaper 0aTLP 0aZFN 0aZmlip 0aZmper5 0aZmubi1 0aCorn 0aGene targeting 0aPlants 0aTransgene stacking 0aZinc finger nuclease1 aAlAbed, Diaa1 aWorden, Andrew1 aNovak, Stephen1 aWu, Huixia1 aAusmus, Carla1 aBeck, Margaret1 aRobinson, Heather1 aMinnicks, Tatyana1 aHemingway, Daren1 aLee, Ryan1 aSkaggs, Nicole1 aWang, Lizhen1 aMarri, Pradeep1 aGupta, Manju0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 Aug. 10, v. 207 p.12-20dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245012000173300001200293500001900305520160300324592002801927596004601955650001102001650001902012650000802031650001302039650001302052650001602065650001902081650002202100650001302122650000702135650001502142650001502157650002102172650001502193650001402208650001102222650001902233650002502252650002002277700001802297700002202315700001502337700006302352773014102415856008302556852000902639655001202648IND60701232320221122040121.0200724e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070123232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-04739-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKannaujiya, Vinod K.10aPhysiological and Biochemical Response of a Hot-Spring Cyanobacterium Nostoc Sp. Strain HKAR-2 to Aluminum Toxicity  ap. 359.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAluminum is an undesirable water pollutant released by water treatment plants and metal processing industries that exhibit enormous toxic effects on water bodies. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of aluminum toxicity on the physiological and biochemical behavior of a hot-spring cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2. The growth of cyanobacterium was declined up to 33% by increasing aluminum concentration from 0.2 to 0.6 mM at pH 7.5 as compared to control (non-treated). However, the growth had further declined up to 87 and 92% by decreasing the pH to 6.0 and 5.0, respectively, as compared to control (pH 7.5) after 12 days of treatment. The amount of protein, chlorophyll, mycosporine-like amino acids, phycobiliproteins, extracellular and intracellular macronutrients such as phosphate and nitrate contents, and nitrate reductase activity was also declined at pH 7.5 as compared to non-treated control. In addition, aluminum also altered the sodium and potassium ions in both extracellular and intracellular environments. There was an increase in the activity of antioxidative enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbic peroxidase (APX) ranging from 58, 79, and 40%, respectively, at 0.6 mM aluminum. The increase in intracellular concentration of aluminum was directly proportional to the inhibition of cyanobacterial growth at pH 7.5. In conclusion, aluminum showed acute toxicity on the hot-spring cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2, which indicates that aluminum may adversely affect the microbiota of hot-spring habitats.  aPublisher supplied data  a30-431/2018cUniversity Grants Commission 3aNostoc 3aacute toxicity 3aair 3aaluminum 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3amicroorganisms 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aphosphates 3aphycobiliprotein 3apollutants 3apotassium 3asodium 3asoil pollution 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater treatment1 aKumar, Deepak1 aPathak, Jainendra1 aRajneesh, 1 aSinha, Rajeshwar P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0112-61610 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 July, v. 231, no. 7 p.359-359dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04739-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245023300164300001600397520158000413592002801993596007902021596008302100596005902183650001702242650002202259650001202281650001902293650001902312650002102331650002002352650001302372650000802385650001602393650002002409650001502429650003102444650001802475650000902493650002102502650001902523650001902542650002302561650002902584650004402613700001602657700001702673700001602690700001802706700001502724773014502739856008202884852000902966655001202975IND60627244620221122070235.0190816e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1482-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Jiaying10aSimultaneous determination of neonicotinoid insecticides and metabolites in rice by dispersive solid–liquid microextraction based on an in situ acid–base effervescent reaction and solidification of a floating organic droplet  ap. 315-327.  aA sensitive and rapid method named dispersive solid–liquid microextraction combining in situ acid–base reaction-based effervescence and solidification of a floating organic droplet was developed for the simultaneous determination of eight neonicotinoid insecticides and two metabolites in rice by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The samples were extracted with sodium citrate monobasic-modified acetonitrile by vortexing and purified by primary secondary amine, and then a mixture of 1-undecanol and sodium carbonate aqueous solution was rapidly injected. An acid–base reaction and carbon dioxide bubbles were generated in situ, which promoted the dispersion of 1-undecanol droplets and subsequent transfer of the analytes from the acidified acetonitrile extract to 1-undecanol. The 1-undecanol phase was easily retrieved by centrifugation and solidification in an ice bath. This novel dispersive solid–liquid microextraction fully utilized the advantages of the effervescent reaction and floating droplet solidification, which was carried out in a tube and did not require stepwise analysis for a solid matrix. Under the optimized conditions, the average recoveries of the analytes ranged from 77.8 to 97.1% with relative standard deviations less than 7.3. The limits of detection varied between 0.01 and 0.1 μg kg⁻¹, and enrichment factors were 42–55. The proposed method provides a quantitative, sensitive, and convenient analytical tool applicable for routine monitoring of neonicotinoids in rice.

Pterostilbene, a 3,5‐dimethylether derivative of resveratrol, possesses properties similar to its parent compound and, additionally, exhibits significantly higher fungicidal activity in vitro and superior pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Recombinant enzyme studies carried out using a previously characterized O‐methyltransferase sequence from Sorghum bicolor (SbOMT3) demonstrated its ability to catalyse the A ring‐specific 3,5‐bis‐O‐methylation of resveratrol, yielding pterostilbene. A binary vector was constructed for the constitutive co‐expression of SbOMT3 with a stilbene synthase sequence from peanut (AhSTS3) and used for the generation of stably transformed tobacco and Arabidopsis plants, resulting in the accumulation of pterostilbene in both species. A reduced floral pigmentation phenotype observed in multiple tobacco transformants was further investigated by reversed‐phase HPLC analysis, revealing substantial decreases in both dihydroquercetin‐derived flavonoids and phenylpropanoid‐conjugated polyamines in pterostilbene‐producing SbOMT3/AhSTS3 events. These results demonstrate the potential utility of this strategy for the generation of pterostilbene‐producing crops and also underscore the need for the development of additional approaches for minimizing concomitant reductions in key phenylpropanoid‐derived metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aArachis hypogaea 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aSorghum bicolor 3aflavonoids 3agene expression 3agenetic transformation 3ametabolites 3amethyltransferases 3apeanuts 3aphenotype 3aphenylpropanoids 3apigmentation 3apolyamines 3aresveratrol 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 2aAcyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArachisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEnzyme Assays 2aFlavonoidsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFlowersxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenetic Vectorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMetabolic Engineeringxmethods 2aMethylation 2aModels, Molecular 2aPhenotype 2aPigmentation 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aProtein O-Methyltransferasexmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSorghumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aStilbenesxmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransformation, Genetic1 aPan, Zhiqiang1 aPolashock, James J.1 aDayan, Franck E.1 aMizuno, Cassia S.1 aSnook, Maurice E.1 aLiu, Chang‐Jun1 aBaerson, Scott R.0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2012 Apr., v. 10, no. 3 p.269-283dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-76447nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/552113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2011.00657.x  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/113490_IN_PLANTA_RIMANDO_M396.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010200173300001600275520252200291592002802813650002502841650001602866650001602882650001502898650001102913650002402924650001502948653002502963653002302988653002503011653001503036653001503051653001403066700002203080773010303102856008403205852000903289655001203298IND60593296720221116153432.0180426e20180518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059329672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2018.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarinos, Vassilis.10aMaintaining geological reality in application of GSI for design of engineering structures in rock  ap. 282-297.  aIn rock engineering design, significant advances have occurred in recent years in numerical modelling capability with increasing trends to ever greater use of synthetic rock mass models and discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling, but all too often with little comparative improvement in geologic base data. As a consequence, there is even more need that reliable estimates be available of strength and deformation characteristics of the rock masses on which or within which engineering structures are to be created, be it a tunnel, a foundation or a slope. Geological Strength Index (GSI) characterization, linked with Hoek-Brown strength determination as a basis for modelling has been widely adopted by engineers and geologists involved in design and construction of engineering structures. The need for geological definition of rock mass properties required as inputs into numerical analysis, constitutes one of the greatest reasons for application of the GSI chart, allowing characterization of even difficult-to-describe rock masses, including tackling even the most problematic of weak and complex rock masses. Back-analyses of tunnels, slopes and foundation behaviour using GSI and its reliable application in rock engineering designs attest to its reliability. With continuing use worldwide, the GSI system has continued to evolve, but greater understanding is needed in the definition of input constants, for establishing both GSI and intact rock properties. This need for improved evaluation, particularly from a geological perspective, is addressed in this paper. Geological processes of tectonism, weathering and alteration all affect GSI. Evaluation of these factors, which are each critical to proper GSI definition, are analyzed based on real rock mass cases. Suggested ranges in variability of intact rock parameters uniaxial compressive strength σci and material constant mi for common rock masses are presented in the context of a composite new GSI chart. This chart allows selection of appropriate GSI ranges for any specific rock suite. Specific key engineering geological characteristics that differentiate igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary one from each other are highlighted through discussion of various example rock units (including gneisses, granites, ophiolites, limestones, schists, siltstones/mudstones/shales, and molassic and flysch formations). Illustrations are given of how geological differentiation dictates variability in geotechnical properties of most common rock masses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression strength 3adeformation 3aengineering 3ageologists 3agneiss 3amathematical models 3aweathering 0aGSI characterization 0aRock mass strength 0aHoek-Brown criterion 0aWeathering 0aAlteration 0aTectonism1 aCarter, Trevor.G.0 tEngineering geology.g2018 May 18, v. 239 p.282-297dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2018.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245007800209300001600287500001400303500001100317520082100328592002801149650002701177650001601204650002501220650001201245650001801257650001801275650002201293650001001315650000801325650001401333650001001347700002201357773011301379856008201492852000901574655001201583IND60707142320221120192047.0200814e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070714232DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-020-01089-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRagasa, Catherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8033-078410aCOVID-19 and the food system: setback or opportunity for gender equality?  ap. 877-880.  aNAL-light  aLetter  aAgriculture and the food sector are critical to food and nutrition security because they not only produce food but also contribute to economic empowerment by employing a large share of female and male workers, especially in developing countries. Food systems at all levels―globally, domestically, locally, and in the home― are expected to be highly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Women and men work as food producers, processors, and traders and will likely be impacted differently. Shocks or crises can exacerbate or reduce gender gaps, and so can policy responses to mitigate the impact of these crises or shocks. We offer some perspectives and available country examples on how the COVID-19 crisis and responses to the crisis could be a setback or offer opportunities for gender equality in the food system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronavirus infections 3aagriculture 3adeveloping countries 3afemales 3afood industry 3afood security 3aissues and policy 3amales 3amen 3anutrition 3awomen1 aLambrecht, Isabel0 tFood security.g2020 Aug., v. 12, no. 4 p.877-880dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-020-01089-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245016800178300001400346520224400360592002802604650001702632650002302649650001502672650002102687650002202708650002302730650002202753650002002775650002402795650001202819653001302831653003002844653003802874653001902912653002002931700002102951700001902972773011502991856008503106961001203191852000903203655001203212IND60542596220221117190122.0190403e20150907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054259622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales Hidalgo, David,10aStatus and trends in global primary forest, protected areas, and areas designated for conservation of biodiversity from the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015  ap. 68-77.  aThe global community has recognized the importance of forests for biodiversity, and has prioritized the preservation of forest biodiversity and ecosystem functions through multiple multilateral agreements and processes such as the Convention on Biodiversity’s Aichi Targets and the Millennium Development Goals. The Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) provides one mechanism for tracking progress toward such goals in three particular areas: primary forest area, protected forest areas, and areas designated for the conservation of biodiversity. In this paper, we quantify current area and trends in forest areas designated for the conservation of biodiversity, protected forest areas, and primary forests by country and biome; and examine the association between total forest area and measures of protection, per-capita income, and population. The overall findings suggest that countries are increasingly protecting forests of ecological significance at the global scale (7.7% of forests were protected in 1990 rising to 16.3% in 2015), with a strong upward trend in protected areas in the tropical domain (from 12% in 1990 to 26.3% in 2015). However, primary forest area has declined by 2.5% globally and by 10% in the tropics over the period 1990–2015 (using data for countries that reported in all years). Given that many species in the tropics are endemic to primary forests, losses in that climatic domain continue to be of concern, although the rate of decline appears to be slowing.Using multiple regression analysis, we find that a 1% increase in protected area or area designated for biodiversity conservation within a country is associated with an increase in total forest area in that country of about 0.03% (p<0.05). A 1% within-country increase in population density and per capita GDP are associated with a decrease in forest area of about 0.2% (p<0.01) and an increase in forest area of about 0.08% (p<0.05) respectively. Our findings also indicate that, since FRA is used as one mechanism for tracking progress toward goals like the AICHI Biodiversity Targets, country correspondents may require additional assistance toward reporting on primary forest, protected forest, and biodiversity conservation statistics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3aforest resources 3aper-capita income 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aprimary forests 3aregression analysis 3atropics 0aFRA 2015 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aGlobal Forest Resource Assessment 0aPrimary forest 0aProtected areas1 aOswalt, Sonja N.1 aSomanathan, E.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Sept. 07, v. 352 p.68-77dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245006900172300001400241520131600255592002801571650002801599650002101627650002101648650001501669650002401684650000901708651000901717700001701726773010001743856008701843852000901930655001201939IND60084086320221119174913.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008408632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModarres, Reza10aStatistically-based regionalization of rainfall climates of Iran  ap. 67-75.  aIran is a large country with diverse geophysical and climatic conditions which are influenced by both large atmospheric circulation patterns and local effects. The density of rainfall station network of Iran is not enough for rainfall estimation at ungauged regions. Therefore, rainfall regionalization should be used to extend rainfall data to regions where rainfall data are not available. The aim of this study is to use cluster analysis and L-moment methods together to quantify regional rainfall patterns of Iran using annual rainfall of 137 stations for the period of 1952–2003. The cluster analysis follows “Ward's method” and shows eight regions of rainfall in Iran. The homogeneity test of L-moments shows that most of these regions are homogeneous. Using the goodness-of-fit test, Zᴰⁱˢᵗ, the regional frequency distribution functions for each group are then selected. The 3-parameter Log Normal (LN3), Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and generalize logistic (GLOG) distributions are selected for the first, second and the remaining 6 regions of rainfall over Iran, respectively. However, because of different rainfall generating mechanisms in Iran such as elevation, sea neighborhood and large atmospheric circulation systems, no parent distribution could be found for the entire country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimatic factors 3acluster analysis 3ageophysics 3ameteorological data 3arain 3aIran1 aSarhadi, Ali0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 Jan., v. 75, no. 1-2 p.67-75dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01407naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011700159300001800276520034600294592002800640650002300668650001300691650001100704650001700715650002100732650000900753650001200762650001300774650001100787700002200798700002000820773013400840856007400974852000901048655001201057IND60658920720221119042211.0190819e20110322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065892072DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10425j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Snigdha10aTwisting (conformational changes)-based selective 2D chalcogeno podand fluorescent probes for Cr(iii) and Fe(ii)  ap. 4174-4176.  aThe fluorenoazomethine containing chalcogeno podand fluorescent probes having N, O/S/Se coordinating donor unit show donor specific ‘turn-on’ recognition property towards metals (Cr(iii), Fe(ii) and Cu(ii)), where the fluorescence signals are controlled by the conformational change of the ligand framework on binding with the metal ion.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achromium 3acopper 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3airon 3aligands 3aselenium 3asulfur1 aPati, Palas Baran1 aZade, Sanjio S.0 tChemical communications.g2011 Mar. 22, v. 47, no. 14 p.4174-4176dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc10425j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01945naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010200165300001800267520064500285592002800930650002200958650001500980650001300995650001001008650000901018650001701027650001801044650002201062650001201084650003301096650001701129650001201146650000901158650001501167700001601182700002601198700002301224700001801247700002201265773012201287856008101409852000901490655001201499IND60624211220221120220350.0181202e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062421122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0035-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarros, B.

The weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC), feed efficiency (FE), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and protein retention (PR) were significantly higher in D3 than in the other treatment groups (P < 0.05). Although the feed intake (FI) of D15 was greatly higher than that of the D0, the ADC of crude lipid, hepatic lipid level, and hepatosomatic index (HSI) of D15 (P > 0.05) were significantly reduced. Compared to the D0, hepatic glycogen and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity in the liver as well as serum total cholesterol (TC) of the fish on D3 and D6 were significantly higher (P < 0.05). Significantly higher activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the abdominal adipose tissues of fish fed on D3 was also observed (P < 0.05). The activities of lipase in anterior intestines appear decreased when the G. lemaneiformis supplementation level was over 12%. These results indicate that incorporate 3% G. lemaneiformis in diet could improve the growth performance and feed utilization of juvenile red sea bream. Incorporation of G. lemaneiformis at 15% level in the diet was also feasible for juvenile red sea bream, as it had no influence on growth performance.  aPublisher supplied data  aSNG2018054cScience and Technology Development Project of Suzhou  aGPKLMB201802cGuangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Marine Biology Open Fund  aSZ_SQ2017026cSpecial Project of Science and Technology in North of Jiangsu 3aGracilaria 3aPagrus major 3aadipose tissue 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acarcass composition 3acholesterol 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afish 3afish feeding 3afish feeds 3aglycogen 3agrowth performance 3ahepatosomatic index 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3alipoprotein lipase 3aliver 3amacroalgae 3ametabolism 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aspecific growth rate 3aweight gain1 aLi, Wenjia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8737-47071 aZhu, Wenting1 aWang, Shuqi0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2019 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.3213-3222dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01787-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009200172520108200264592002801346650001201374650001301386650001001399650001601409650001901425653002701444653004001471653003601511653001801547700002301565700001801588700002101606700001901627700002401646773009101670856009001761852000901851655001201860IND60736464220221116152640.0210619e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073646422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1064482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez, Colin10aResin Transfer molding of High-Fluidity Polyamide-6 with modified Glass-Fabric preforms  aIn Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), resin precursors of thermoset or, more recently, thermoplastic polymers are generally employed, raising issues related to the chemical reaction taking place during and after part processing. In this study, already polymerized polyamide-6 with low melt-viscosity (~30 Pa·s at 280 °C), is injected at low pressure (<30 bar) in a custom-made mold, so as to impregnate glass fabric preforms via in-plane impregnation. Composite plates were produced using interply spacers acting as flow-enhancers. A three-step impregnation strategy, involving fast in-plane resin injection, a successive saturation step through transverse flow, followed by further micro-saturation caused by the collapse of the spacers, ensured industrially relevant impregnation kinetics. The influence of the spacer, the saturation time, pressure and temperature on the process kinetics and part quality were evaluated with three-point bending tests as well as microstructural analyses.

Compared to the control group, C. vulgaris MBFJNU-1 at 3% CO₂ achieved higher microalgal biomass (478.5 mg/L) and total fatty acids content (21.3%), higher CO₂ bio-fixation (63.2 mg/L/d) and lipid (9.1 mg/L/d) productivities, and greater nutrients removals (total nitrogen, 82.1%; total phosphorus, 28.4%; chemical oxygen demand, 37.1%). The highest biodiesel conversion (93.3%) was attained by enzymatic transesterification of wet disrupted Chlorella biomass with 5% lipase TL and 5% phospholipase PLA. Moreover, the enzymatic transesterification gave around 83% biodiesel conversion in a 15-L stirred tank bioreactor. Furthermore, the integrated process was a cost-effective approach to treat RSW and mitigate CO₂ for microalgal biodiesel production, based on the mass and energy balances analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3achemical oxygen demand 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3aphospholipases 3aswine 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3atransesterification 3awastewater 0aReal swine wastewater 0aNutrients removal 0aCO2 mitigation 0aEnzymatic transesterification1 aJi, Xiaowei1 aZhou, Youcai1 aDai, Jingxuan1 aHe, Yongjin1 aSun, Han1 aGuo, Zheng1 aYang, Yi1 aZheng, Xing1 aChen, Bilian0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Apr., v. 349 p.126886-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1268863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245012600209520138200335592002801717650001501745650002601760650002201786650002001808650001001828650002001838650001701858650001301875650001901888650001701907650001701924650001201941650000801953650002201961650002001983650000902003650001502012651001102027651001302038653002202051653003402073653001802107653001302125653001502138653003002153700005802183700002002241700005902261700006402320773009102384856008502475852000902560655001202569IND60688974920221120195407.0200607e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068897492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pedobi.2020.1506452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSellan, Giacomo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5606-395710aImpact of soil nitrogen availability and pH on tropical heath forest organic matter decomposition and decomposer activity  aDecomposition is a key process for rain forest nutrient cycling, and this may be altered by the increasing rate of deposition of reactive nitrogen on rain forests. Tropical heath forests are characterised by slow litter decomposition rates due to low quality litter, along with acidic soil pH and low availability of soil nitrogen (N). To investigate whether soil N or pH is most important in regulating tropical heath forest organic matter decomposition, we used a factorial N and CaCO₃ addition experiment, and measured wood and leaf litter decomposition rates and mesofaunal activity (using bait-lamina sticks and numbers of worm casts). Our heath forest site in the Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve (Sabah, Malaysia) had a decomposition rate (calculated using standard tea material) comparable to that of temperate forest soils. Overall, the experimental modification of both soil pH and available N had weak effects on decomposition rates, although different materials responded differently to the experimental treatments. There was a clear, but transient, increase in number of worm casts in the CaCO₃ and N + CaCO₃ treatment. Although we obtained some evidence that low soil acidity reduced decomposer activity, it may take longer than one year for the decomposer community, and associated processes, to be influenced by the experimentally altered edaphic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acalcium carbonate 3aedaphic factors 3afauna 3aforest reserves 3aforest soils 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aplant litter 3arain forests 3asoil pH 3atea 3atemperate forests 3atemperate soils 3awood 3aworm casts 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia 0aWhite sand forest 0aKabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve 0aDecomposition 0aKerangas 0aLitterfall 0aN and CaCO3 fertilization1 aThompson, Jill1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4370-25931 aMajalap, Noreen1 aRobert, Rolando1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6830-66021 aBrearley, Francis Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5053-56930 tPedobiologia.g2020 May, v. 80 p.150645-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1957x0031-40567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2020.1506453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245008600174300001600260520215800276592002802434650002002462650001202482650001502494650001102509650001302520650001902533650001902552650000902571650001102580650001102591650001402602650001902616650001402635650002502649650001502674651001002689700001402699700002702713773010202740856008702842852000902929655001202938IND60084086620221119174947.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008408662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Dileep K.10aRecent trends in sediment load of the tropical (Peninsular) river basins of India  ap. 108-118.  aThe tropical river basins of India are important because of the coastal ecosystem that they sustain and the densely populated economic zones that they serve. This study examines the recent trends in sediment load and also explores the influence of the climatic and human forcing mechanisms on the land–ocean fluvial systems. A large dataset comprised of the sediment time series of different timescale during the period 1986–87 to 2005–06 from 133 gauging stations spreading across tropical river basins of India was analyzed. Results indicate dramatic reductions in sediment load in the tropical river basins, which is beyond the fold of assignable natural variability. Around 88% (62%) of the total 133 gauging stations showed decline in sediment loads in the monsoon (non-monsoon) season. The significant downward trends outnumbered the corresponding upward trends in high proportions for both the seasons. Striking spatial coherence was observed among the significant trends, suggesting the presence of the cross-correlation among the sediment records. The regional trends, which account the spatial correlation, also indicated the widespread nature of the sediment declines. The rainfall, which is characterized by the non-significant decreasing trends and also frequent drought years, is the primary controller of the sediment loads for most of the river basins. It may be inferred that a little change in rainfall towards the deficit side leads to a significant reduction in sediment load. This is due to the diversion and storage of runoff to meet the manifold increases in water requirements for the agriculture and industry. Among the tropical rivers, the maximum reduction in sediment flux has taken place for the Normada River (−2.07×10⁶t/yr) due to the construction of dam. Although the sea level is rising, we speculate that the significant reduction in sediment loads may also have influenced the coastal erosion in recent years. The results of this study can be utilized for the sustainable management of the tropical river basins in the backdrop of a predicted erratic monsoon rainfall and the growing anthropogenic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adrought 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3aindustry 3amonsoon season 3apollution load 3arain 3arivers 3arunoff 3asea level 3asediment yield 3asediments 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aKumar, A.1 aMohanty, Sheelabhadra,0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 Feb., v. 75, no. 3-4 p.108-118dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008000168300001800248500001900266520069500285536019000980592002801170596001301198596001601211650004401227650002101271650001901292650001101311650001001322650002101332650002101353653002801374653003401402653001601436653002001452653002301472700001801495700001901513773012501532856008501657852000901742655001201751IND60696822220221119082203.0200601e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069682222DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2018.15545172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Mingming10aEffects of Different Modification Methods on the Properties of Sisal Fibers  ap. 1048-1057.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, sisal fibers were modified by different methods such as alkali treatment, γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane treatment, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) sol-gel treatment, TEOS, and silane combination treatment.

Chlorophyll and accessory pigments absorb light at some of the wavelengths present in the solar spectrum. If all other requirements are available in abundance, introducing more light to the system at wavelengths that can be absorbed will increase the growth rate of microalgae and the final biomass achieved up to the level of photosaturation. Therefore, the effect of shifting the spectrum of light available such that the photons unutilized in photosynthesis are converted to those that can be utilised was investigated. Spectral shifts converting UV light to blue light and green light to red light were carried out using films produced with Coumarin and Solvent Orange respectively. Dunaliella salina (CCAP 19-30) was grown in an airlift photobioreactor (ALB) which was coated with the wavelength shifting films.

Yunnan pine forests are the most widespread conifer forest type in Southwest China, and are frequently threatened by fire disturbance. Post-fire regeneration of this forest type, however, has not been previously studied. In this study, we investigated the early post-fire regeneration in mixed Yunnan pine forests five months after a severe burn in 2013 on Mt. Qinglongling, Yunnan Province, China. We found very active post-fire regeneration in the burned area likely facilitated by ample summer rainfall, with an average regeneration density of ∼105stemsha−1. Species composition of the post-fire regeneration was highly similar to the pre-fire community–the similarity between the pre- and post-fire communities was 0.530±0.222. Elevation, pre-fire community type, and slope position were the three primary factors in the variations in regeneration density and species composition, while the impact of fire severity was low. The regeneration density of Pinus species and evergreen broadleaf species showed contrasting patterns across the environmental gradients, and the results implied that Yunnan forests are generally resilient to fire disturbance. The controlling impacts of the pre-fire community on post-fire regeneration are driven by the efficient regenerating strategies of dominant species, and are a comprehensive reflection of habitat conditions, which are primarily mediated by topographic features. Species regeneration strategies and the high resilience of the community to fire disturbance should be taken into account in fire prevention and management approaches for this forest type.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus yunnanensis 3abroadleaved evergreens 3aconiferous forests 3afire severity 3aforest regeneration 3ahabitats 3arain 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3aChina 0aYunnan pine forest 0aPost-fire regeneration 0aFire severity 0aPre-fire community 0aTopography 0aRegeneration density 0aSpecies composition 0aRandom forest analysis1 aShen, Zehao1 aYing, Lingxiao1 aLi, Guixiang1 aChen, Anping0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 356 p.31-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245009600183300001600279520099100295592002801286650000801314650001901322650002401341650001201365650002701377650001101404650001401415650001501429650002401444650001101468650001601479650001201495650001001507650001501517650001001532650000901542650002901551650004701580650001001627650002101637650001901658650001101677650001101688650001101699650002001710650000901730650001601739650002201755650002301777650001201800650001601812650001601828651001001844651001001854653001401864653003001878653001901908653001601927700001901943700001801962700001801980700001401998700001902012700001902031700001602050773008902066856008402155852000902239655001202248IND60086730020221117230805.0160903e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673002DNAL7 a233770362pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2012.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jun10aGlobal climate change: Impact of diurnal temperature range on mortality in Guangzhou, China  ap. 131-136.  aDiurnal temperature range (DTR) is an important meteorological indicator associated with global climate change, but little is known about the effects of DTR on mortality. We examined the effects of DTR on cause-/age-/education-specific mortality in Guangzhou, a subtropical city in China during 2003–2010. A quasi-Poisson regression model combined with distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the effects of DTR, after controlling for daily mean temperature, air pollutants, season and day of the week. A 1 °C increase in DTR at lag 0–4 days was associated with a 0.47% (95% confidence interval: 0.01%–0.93%) increase in non-accidental mortality. Stroke mortality was most sensitive to DTR. Female, the elderly and those with low education were more susceptible to DTR than male, the youth and those with high education, respectively. Our findings suggest that vulnerable subpopulations should pay more attention to protect themselves from unstable daily weather.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aclimate change 3aconfidence interval 3aelderly 3alow educational status 3amodels 3amortality 3apollutants 3aregression analysis 3astroke 3atemperature 3aweather 3ayouth 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aAir Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aClimate Change 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMortalityxtrends 2aNonlinear Dynamics 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 2aYoung Adult 3aChina 0aChina 0aMortality 0aDiurnal temperature range 0aCardiovascular 0aRespiratory1 aLiu, Hua-Zhang1 aOu, Chun-Quan1 aLin, Guo-Zhen1 aZhou, Qin1 aShen, Gi-Chuan1 aChen, Ping-Yan1 aGuo, Yuming0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 Apr., v. 175 p.131-136dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245018800166300001800354520216200372592002802534650002702562650002002589650001602609650002402625650002002649650001202669650001102681650001502692650001502707650001402722700002602736700002402762700002602786700006002812700006102872773011802933856008403051852000903135655001203144IND60754851720220220000000.0211027e20211014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.1c003732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Muyang10aIncorporation and Assembly of a Light-Emitting Enzymatic Reaction into Model Protein CondensatesbPublished as part of the Biochemistry virtual special issue “Protein Condensates”  ap. 3137-3151.  aEukaryotic cells partition enzymes and other cellular components into distinct subcellular compartments to generate specialized biochemical niches. A subclass of these compartments form in the absence of lipid membranes, via liquid–liquid phase separation of proteins to form biomolecular condensates or “membraneless organelles” such as nucleoli, stress granules, and P-bodies. Because of their propensity to form compartments from simple starting materials, membraneless organelles are an attractive target for engineering new functionalities in both living cells and protocells. In this work, we demonstrate incorporation of a novel enzymatic activity in protein coacervates with the light-generating enzyme, NanoLuc, to produce bioluminescence. Using condensates comprised of the disordered RGG domain of Caenorhabditis elegans LAF-1, we functionalized condensates with enzymatic activity in vitro and show that enzyme localization to coacervates enhances assembly and activity of split enzymes. To build condensates that function as light-emitting reactors, we designed a NanoLuc enzyme flanked by RGG domains. The resulting condensates concentrated NanoLuc by 10-fold over bulk solution and displayed significantly increased reaction rates. We further show that condensate viscosity impacts light emission due to diffusion-limited behavior. Because our model condensates have low viscosities, we predict NanoLuc diffusion-limited behavior in most other condensates and thus propose the condensate-Nanoluc system as a potential strategy for high-throughput screening of condensate targeting drugs. By splitting the NanoLuc enzyme into its constituent components, we demonstrate that NanoLuc activity can be reconstituted via co-condensation. In addition, we demonstrate control of the spatial localization of the enzyme within condensates by targettng NanoLuc to the surface of in vitro condensates. Collectively, this work demonstrates that membraneless organelles can be endowed with localized enzymatic activity and that this activity can be spatially and temporally controlled via biochemical reconstitution and design of protein surfactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3abioluminescence 3acondensates 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3alipids 3aorganelles 3aseparation 3aviscosity1 aGarabedian, Mikael V.1 aLeutenegger, Marcel1 aSchuster, Benjamin S.1 aGood, Matthew C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6367-10341 aHammer, Daniel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3522-31540 tBiochemistry.g2021 Oct. 14, v. 60, no. 42 p.3137-3151dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.1c003733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245014700176300001800323500001900341520074100360536013801101592002801239596002401267596002401291650002201315650001601337650001201353650001901365650001401384650001601398650001601414650001101430650002301441650001901464650000901483650002101492650001901513653001801532653002501550653000801575653003301583653001501616700001701631700002501648700002401673773012501697856008501822852000901907655001201916IND60696822420221119082359.0200601e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069682242DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2018.15581422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisdayana, Nurmalisa10aThermoplastic Starch–PVA Nanocomposite Films Reinforced with Nanocellulose from Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunches (OPEFBs): Effect of Starch Type  ap. 1069-1080.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis research studied the effect of three types of starch on the properties of thermoplastic starch (TPS)–Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)–cellulose nanocomposite films.

However, recent patterns suggest that the traditional sequence of events and factors involved in forest decline are changing. Several reports in recent decades involve emergent mortality agents, many of which are native insects and diseases. In addition, changing climate and weather patterns place increasing emphasis on root dynamics in forest decline, given the critical role of roots in susceptibility (loss of fine roots) and tolerance (deep-rooting) to drought. Contrasting successive extremes of wet and dry periods could negatively affect tree carbon (C) balance and water relations, which may provide an advantage to secondary agents such as root pathogens (e.g. Armillaria and Phytophthora spp.). We searched for patterns potentially implying mechanisms of mortality among several recent hardwood decline events (mostly in oak forests, Quercus spp.) linked to novel associations often involving drought – or hot drought, an apparent absence of defoliation, and a secondary bark- or wood-boring insect in a more aggressive tree-killing role than has been typically observed. To further explore one likely mechanism, we utilized a case study featuring an emergent mortality agent, the red oak borer, Enaphalodes rufulus (Haldeman) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), which, interacting with drought and forest history, resulted in an unprecedented oak mortality event (1999–2003, Ozark region, USA). Examination of long-term patterns of radial growth revealed that oaks surviving decline episodes often exhibited slow growth early during forest development, yet became superior competitors later on, and exhibited non-linear growth dynamics throughout their lives; trees that died often exhibited the opposite pattern, with rapid growth early in life and linear growth dynamics. We speculate that these different growth strategies could be related to patterns of resource allocation facilitated by root origins (sprout vs. seedling) and/or microsite conditions, and driven or influenced by repeated drought. Carbon balance dysfunction, a long-term affliction of oaks that eventually manifests itself in an episode of decline, may be the underlying mechanism of oak mortality during decline. It is likely caused by changes in C supply and demand during drought and/or defoliation that compromise oaks by depleting C reserves, or somehow inhibiting translocation of stored C to repair damaged tissues and resist secondary biotic agents. Ultimately, successive drought and persistent activity by these insects and pathogens kill affected oaks. Parallels among different hardwood ecosystems exist, and can be used to help predict future scenarios and guide new avenues of study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArmillaria 3aseedlings 3adrought 3atrees 3acarbon 3aforests 3aboring insects 3aQuercus 3aecosystems 3acase studies 3apathogens 3aforest decline 3aresource allocation 3aPhytophthora 3aclimate change 3adefoliation 3amortality 3aEnaphalodes rufulus 3ahardwood 3afine roots 3aindigenous species 3aUnited States 3aEurope 3aOzarks 0aLymantria dispar 0aCallus 0aAgrilus spp 0aOzark Plateau 0aForest decline 0aForest succession 0aDefoliator 0aOak borer 0aFire suppression 0aWood borer 0awater balance 0aEmergent pest 0aHydraulic failure 0aClimate change 0aCarbon starvation 0aCarbon balance1 aBillings, Sharon A.1 aGuldin, James M.1 aStephen, Fred M.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 354 p.190-205dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245008200207300001800289520111900307592002801426650002601454650002701480650002901507650002001536650001701556650001401573650001301587650002101600650001601621650001601637650001701653700002201670700002001692700002101712700006501733773011801798856008401916852000902000655001202009IND60754851920220220000000.0211027e20211006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.1c005672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreußke, Nils1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7887-620310aDesigned Trp-Cage Proteins with Antimicrobial Activity and Enhanced Stability  ap. 3187-3199.  aα-Helical antimicrobial peptides (αAMPs) are among the potential candidates for new anti-infectives to tackle the global crisis in antibiotic resistance, but they suffer from low bioavailability due to high susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. Here, we describe a strategy to increase the resistance of αAMPs against proteases. Fusing the 12-residue αAMP KR-12 with a Trp-cage domain induces an α-helical structure in the otherwise unfolded KR-12 moiety in solution. The resulting antimicrobial Trp-cage exhibits higher proteolytic resistance due to its stable fold as evidenced by correlating sequence-resolved digest data with structural analyses. In addition, the antimicrobial Trp-cage displays increased activity against bacteria in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of NaCl, while the hemolytic activity remains negligible. In contrast to previous strategies, the presented approach is not reliant on artificial amino acids and is therefore applicable to biosynthetic procedures. Our study aims to improve the pharmacokinetics of αAMPs to facilitate their use as therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3abioavailability 3abiosynthesis 3ahemolysis 3amoieties 3apharmacokinetics 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3atherapeutics1 aLipfert, Matthias1 aRothemund, Sven1 aLeippe, Matthias1 aSönnichsen, Frank D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4539-37550 tBiochemistry.g2021 Oct. 06, v. 60, no. 42 p.3187-3199dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.1c005673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100001900186245011900205300001200324506007600336520034200412592002800754506003700782650000900819650002400828650001400852650001400866650000900880651001800889700002200907700002300929700002700952700002400979700002001003700001901023700001901042700001601061700002301077700001701100700002201117700002001139700001701159700002301176700002001199700002501219700001701244700002601261700001801287773009201305856007901397852000901476655001201485IND60081697320221207075854.0161029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008169732DNAL7 aPMC41672872pmcid7 a251858292pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-7-4172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStich, Roger W10aQuantitative factors proposed to influence the prevalence of canine tick-borne disease agents in the United States  ap. 417.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Companion Animal Parasite Council hosted a meeting to identify quantifiable factors that can influence the prevalence of tick-borne disease agents among dogs in North America.
