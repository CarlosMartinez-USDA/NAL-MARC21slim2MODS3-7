Food intake and anthropometric data and resting metabolic rates (RMRs) also were determined. It was found that the TEF was related to meal size in both groups. The RMR increased about 21 and 28% in the elderly group and about 26 and 38% in the young control group in response to a 2.0 versus a 4.0 MJ meal, respectively. While the elderly subjects were fatter than the control subjects, the elderly had lower daily food intakes. This finding was consistent with the observation of lower RMR and TEF values for the elderly relative to the young controls.

Significantly less selenium was lost in the feces (although more was lost in the urine) when subjects were fed high protein diets than with low protein diets. Even more urinary selenium was excreted when the men were fed low protein diets containing added amino acids. Thus, greater selenium absorption resulted with high levels of dietary protein. These differences may be due to other amino acids in the protein, differential absorption of sulfur amino acids from the gut, or to differences in the forms of selenium contained in the diets. 3aselenium 3aexperimental diets 3amales 3aphosphorus 3aamino acids 3amineral metabolism 3aintestinal absorption 3ametabolic studies 0aprotein modified diets 0aMineral modifications1 aMarcus, R.E.0 tAnnals of nutrition & metabolism.g1981 , v. 25, no. 2 p.97-108x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810729c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02063naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245015000127300001800277520109000295650001101385650002301396650002301419650001101442650001301453650001301466650001201479653001501491653001801506653001601524700001801540773008701558852000901645930003301654945001301687946001301700655001201713IND2163821120221122062111.0980903e199707  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216382112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFearon, R.J.10aPreliminary evidence supporting the ability of hermatypic corals to affect adversely larvae and early settlement stages of hard coral competitors  ap. 1769-1780.  aCrude, aqueous extracts of five species of hermatypic coral from three scleractinian families were assayed for bioactivity against the early life stages of scleractinian corals. At concentrations between 62.5 and 250 micrograms/ml, extracts of all species were lethal to at least three of the five species of coral planulae larvae tested. To test for behavioral changes, extracts from four species were tested on planulae of the scleractinian Pocillopora damicornis. All four caused immediate but reversible behavioral aberrations in the larvae at concentrations as low as 7.8 micrograms/ml. To determine the effects on newly settled corals, postmetamorphosis juveniles (spat) of P. damicornis were exposed to extracts from four hermatypic species. They were either killed or suffered a reduction in growth rates. If released under natural conditions, substances with lethal or sublethal activities against the early life stages of other scleractinians could allow hermatypic corals to influence patterns of scleractinian recruitment, thus playing a role in ordering coral communities. 3acorals 3adefense mechanisms 3acolonizing ability 3alarvae 3atoxicity 3aextracts 3afouling 0ainhibition 0aepisettlement 0aantifouling1 aCameron, A.M.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1997 July, v. 23, no. 7 p.1769-1780x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02096naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006800128300001800196500001500214520063900229650001500868650001900883650002800902650002100930650001600951650001200967650001800979650001800997650001401015650001801029650001101047650002801058650001201086650001301098650001901111650001601130650001301146650001501159653002301174653001901197653002401216653000901240653001901249653002101268653001101289700001901300700001601319700001901335773010801354852000901462930003301471945001301504946001301517655001201530IND2123276120221122062256.0980610s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212327612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhoades, J.D.10aDetermining soil and water sodicity from electrode measurements  ap. 1737-1765.  a2019-12-05  aA method is presented for estimating the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of the saturated soil-paste extract from three electrode measurements made directly in the saturated soil-paste.

E9-12:Ald and E9,11-12:Ald were most abundant in female S. asigna pheromone extracts. In field trapping experiments in Palembang, Indonesia, synthetic E9-12:Ald and E9,11-12:Ald at a 1:1 ratio, but not singly, attracted S. asigna males. Attractiveness of these two aldehydes could not be enhanced further through the addition of their corresponding alcohols and/or other aldehydic candidate pheromone components. Use of E9-12:Ald and E9,11-12:Ald for pheromone-based monitoring of S. asigna populations will require lure formulations that minimize pheromone degradation by ultra-violet radiation and atmospheric oxidation. 3aLimacodidae 3asex pheromones 3achemical composition 3afield experimentation1 aGries, G.1 aKhaskin, G.1 aGries, R.1 aHardi.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1997 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.2187-2196x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03634naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001900168245013400187300001800321500002400339520182000363650001702183650002002200650002202220650001902242650001102261650001002272650001302282650002202295650001002317650001002327650002202337650003002359650002002389650004102409650002702450650005702477650000902534650001102543650004002554650001102594650001302605650000902618650002502627650003402652650001602686700001802702700002302720700001802743700002502761700002002786700001802806700002102824773011402845852000902959856005202968655001203020IND4444253120221122053950.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444425312DNAL7 a199549492pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Chi Chun10aIn vitro and in vivo conjugation of dietary hydroxycinnamic acids by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases in humans  ap. 1060-1068.  aIncludes references  aHydroxycinnamic acids are a class of phenolic antioxidants found widely in dietary plants. Their biotransformation in the human organism primarily involves Phase II conjugation reactions. In this study, activities of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs) towards major dietary hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, dihydrocaffeic, dihydroferulic, ferulic and isoferulic acids) were investigated. Conjugate formation was evaluated using human liver and intestinal S9 homogenates, and in vitro characterization was carried out using recombinant human UGTs and SULTs. Analysis of the kinetics of hydroxycinnamic acid conjugation in human S9 homogenates revealed that intrinsic clearance (V max/K m) is much greater for sulfation than for glucuronidation. Assessment of activity using a panel of recombinant human SULTs showed that SULT1A1 is most active in the sulfation of caffeic, dihydrocaffeic and isoferulic acids, while SULT1E1 is most active in the sulfation of ferulic and dihydroferulic acids. Only isoferulic acid was significantly glucuronidated by human liver S9 homogenates, explained by the high activity of liver-specific UGT1A9. Studies on the kinetics of active SULTs and UGTs demonstrated a markedly lower K m for SULTs. To further corroborate our findings, we carried out an intervention study in healthy humans to determine the hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates in urine after consumption of hydroxycinnamate-rich coffee (200 ml). Analysis showed that sulfates are the main conjugates in urine, with the exception of isoferulic acid, which is mainly glucuronidated. These data suggest that sulfates are the predominant hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates in humans, and that SULT mediated sulfation is a major factor determining the bioavailability of hydroxycinnamic acids in vivo. 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3abiotransformation 3acoumaric acids 3ahumans 3aliver 3asulfates 3asulfotransferases 3aurine 2aAdult 2aBiotransformation 2aCaffeic Acidsxmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCinnamatesxmetabolism 2aCoumaric Acidsxmetabolismxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aGlucuronosyltransferasexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aMale 2aSulfatesxmetabolism 2aSulfotransferasesxmetabolism 2aYoung Adult1 aMeinl, Walter1 aGlatt, Hans-Rudolf1 aBarron, Denis1 aStalmach, Angélique1 aSteiling, Heike1 aCrozier, Alan1 aWilliamson, Gary0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2010 Nov., v. 21, no. 11 p.1060-1068dElsevier Sciencex0955-28637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.09.001 7aarticle03040naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100003000154245012100184300001400305500002400319500001500343520156300358650001301921650002701934650001901961650003701980650001102017650002002028650002302048650001302071650001902084650002502103650002002128650004302148653002802191653002502219700001802244700002702262700001902289773008702308852000902395856008502404930003302489945002502522946001102547655001202558IND4435240020221122053954.0100409e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443524002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-010-0125-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aGeethanjali, Subramaniam 10aDevelopment and characterization of tomato SSR markers from genomic sequences of anchored BAC clones on chromosome 6  ap. 85-97.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSimple sequence repeat motifs are abundant in plant genomes and are commonly used molecular markers in plant breeding. In tomato, currently available genetic maps possess a limited number of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers that are not evenly distributed in the genome. This situation warrants the need for more SSRs in genomic regions lacking adequate markers. The objective of the study was to develop SSR markers pertaining to chromosome 6 from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences available at Solanaceae Genomics Network. A total of 54 SSR primer pairs from 17 BAC clones on chromosome 6 were designed and validated. Polymorphism of these loci was evaluated in a panel of 16 genotypes comprising of Solanum lycopersicum and its wild relatives. Genetic diversity analysis based on these markers could distinguish genotypes at species level. Twenty-one SSR markers derived from 13 BAC clones were polymorphic between two closely related tomato accessions, West Virginia 700 and Hawaii 7996 and were mapped using a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between these two accessions. The markers were distributed throughout the chromosome spanning a total length of 117.6 cM following the order of the original BAC clones. A major QTL associated with resistance to bacterial wilt was mapped on chromosome 6 at similar location of the reported Bwr-6 locus. These chromosome 6-specific SSR markers developed in this study are useful tools for cultivar identification, genetic diversity analysis and genetic mapping in tomato. 3atomatoes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant breeding 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3agenome 3avegetable crops 3achromosome mapping 3agenomics 3awild relatives 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aChen, Kai-Yi 1 aPastrana, Davidson V. 1 aWang, Jaw-Fen 0 tEuphytica.g2010 May, v. 173, no. 1 p.85-97dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-010-0125-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02123naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245009800133300001600231300003000247520116300277650002701440650001301467650001401480650001901494650001701513650002201530650002301552651001201575700001601587700002101603773008801624852000901712939003301721945000801754946001101762655001201773991574708700742620221122054107.0870617e198612  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870012422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdeyemi, T.O.10aErythrocyte protoporphyrin in screening for iron deficiency anaemia among children in Nigeria  ap. 374-379.  ap. 374-379. ill., charts.  aExtract: Erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EPP) concentration was determined in 87 children who presented at the Adeoyo General Hospital and the University Teaching Hospital (Ibadan, Nigeria) for various ailments. Presence or absence of anaemia was based on haemoglobin concentration. There was a significant difference (p less than 0.01) between the mean haemoglobin values of the severely anaemic, mildly anaemic and control children. There was no significant difference (p more than 0.05) between the mean haematocrit, mean EPP and mean EPP:Hb ratio of the mildly anaemic and control groups, but corresponding values for the severely anaemic group differed significantly (p less than 0.001) from the values for the others. The increase in EPP was correlated with the decrease in Hb concentration (r=-0.8263, p less than 0.001), suggesting that iron deficiency was a major cause of severe anaemia. EPP alone or in combination with Hb is effective in identifying anaemic individuals, while Hb alone tends to over-estimate the occurrence of iron deficiency anaemia. EPP values above 100 micrograms/100 milliliters of erythrocytes identified severe anaemia.(author) 3airon deficiency anemia 3achildren 3ascreening 3aprotoporphyrin 3aerythrocytes 3ablood composition 3anutritional status 3aNigeria1 aAjayi, O.A.1 aAdeyokunnu, A.A.0 tAnnals of nutrition and metabolism.g1986 , v. 30, no. 6 p.374-379x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19870617c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01945naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245010000172300001800272520077900290650002601069650001101095650001901106650002101125650001901146650002001165650002801185650002601213653002101239700001801260700001801278700001701296773008801313852000901401856007801410930003301488945001301521946001301534655001201547IND2061253020221122042807.0980113e199609  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206125302DNAL7 a242264722pmid7 a10.1007/BF022723992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarada, H.10aCalcium chloride as a major component contributing to aphid resistance of Nicotiana benthamiana  ap. 1579-1589.  aSubstances with antiaphid activity were extracted from the leaf surface of aphid-resistant N. benthamiana and purified.

Trap catches in single apple trees (N = 3) were monitored for six cycles of six days' duration, using delta traps baited with synthetic pheromone. Polyethylene dispensers (0, 1, 10 per tree) releasing pheromone and inhibitor were present for only the first three days of each cycle. Application of 10 dispensers per tree resulted in complete disruption of trapping, which continued for one day after dispensers were removed. Over the three nights following the removal of the dispensers (days 4-6), trap catch was 0, 10, and 15% of the control catch. In contrast, the presence of only one dispenser per tree led to 0-20% of control catches, but on the three nights following dispenser removal catches were 35, 40, and 80% of the control catch. Field EAGs indicated significantly higher relative pheromone concentrations in the trees with 10 dispensers present, compared to trees with single dispensers, but removal of dispensers produced no detectable treatment effect compared to the control trees one day after dispenser removal. In a second experiment, releases of marked male moths into apple orchard plots following the removal of polyethylene dispensers (1 hr earlier that day) resulted in significantly lower catches in traps baited with virgin females in blocks that had been treated, compared to controls. Recovery of pheromone by solvent washing of leaves loaded with 50 microgram of the main component of the sex pheromone (1.26 microgram/cm2) was low (2.5%). Leaves held in a pheromone-saturated atmosphere were loaded with 0.045 +/- 0.007 microgram pheromone/cm2. Analysis of apple leaves taken from a pheromone-treated tree at different distances from the pheromone dispenser showed a decay of the pheromone load per square centimeter with increasing distance from the dispenser, as previously indicated by EAG. 3aEpiphyas postvittana 3aelectroantennography 3achemical constituents of plants 3aabsorption 3aMalus domestica 3amating disruption 3apheromones 3aleaves 0arelease 0aEpiphyas1 aKarg, G.1 aBradley, S.J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1996 Feb., v. 22, no. 2 p.325-341x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF020551023Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03230naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002100172245010900193300001400302500002400316500001500340520162900355650000901984650002001993650001602013650001002029650002302039650002302062650001302085650001702098650002602115650002002141650002802161650002302189650002902212650001602241650002802257650002002285650002502305651001002330653001402340700001802354700002202372700001902394773008802413852000902501856008502510930003302595945002502628946001102653655001202664IND4435196020221122043521.0100409e20100508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443519602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2010.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aF600 0aF2001 aKatsura, Keisuke10aRadiation use efficiency, N accumulation and biomass production of high-yielding rice in aerobic culture  ap. 81-89.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe concept of aerobic culture is to save water resource while maintaining high productivity in irrigated rice ecosystem. This study compared nitrogen (N) accumulation and radiation use efficiency (RUE) in the biomass production of rice crops in aerobic and flooded cultures. The total water input was 800-1300mm and 1500-3500mm in aerobic culture and flooded culture, respectively, and four high-yielding rice cultivars were grown with a high rate of N application (180kgNha⁻¹) at two sites (Tokyo and Osaka) in Japan in 2007 and 2008. The aboveground biomass and N accumulation at maturity were significantly higher in aerobic culture (17.2-18.5tha⁻¹ and 194-233 kgNha⁻¹, respectively) than in flooded culture (14.7-15.8tha⁻¹ and 142-173kgNha⁻¹) except in Tokyo in 2007, where the surface soil moisture content frequently declined. The crop maintained higher N uptake in aerobic culture than in flooded culture, because in aerobic culture there was a higher N accumulation rate in the reproductive stage. RUE in aerobic culture was comparable to, or higher than, that in flooded culture (1.27-1.50gMJ⁻¹ vs. 1.20-1.37gMJ⁻¹), except in Tokyo in 2007 (1.30gMJ⁻¹ vs. 1.37gMJ⁻¹). These results suggest that higher biomass production in aerobic culture was attributable to greater N accumulation, leading to higher N concentration (N%) than in flooded culture. Cultivar differences in response to water regimes were thought to reflect differences in mainly (1) early vigor and RUE under temporary declines in soil moisture in aerobic culture and (2) the ability to maintain high N% in flooded culture. 3arice 3asolar radiation 3agrain crops 3avigor 3asoil water content 3aaerobic conditions 3anitrogen 3aOryza sativa 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3adry matter accumulation 3aflooded conditions 3aradiation use efficiency 3agrain yield 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3acrop management 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aJapan 0acultivars1 aOkami, Midori1 aMizunuma, Hiroaki1 aKato, Yoichiro0 tField crops research.g2010 May 8, v. 117, no. 1 p.81-89dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2010.02.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/19  aNon-US 7aarticle01983naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245011200174300001600286520068900302650001600991650001501007650002301022650002201045650002501067650002001092650001601112650001701128650001801145650001201163650001401175650001101189650002101200650001801221653002101239700002001260700001401280773008501294852000901379856007801388930003301466945001301499946001301512655001201525IND2061067320221122043544.0980102e199604  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206106732DNAL7 a242275862pmid7 a10.1007/BF020335872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenuelas, J.10aEffects of allelochemicals on plant respiration and oxygen isotope fractionation by the alternative oxidase  ap. 801-805.  aThe goal of this investigation was to determine the effects of allelochemicals on plant respiration that thereby may be responsible for their role in growth inhibition. We have tested the effects of juglone, quercetin, cinnamic acid, and alpha-pinene on respiration rates, and electron partitioning through the cytochrome and alternative respiratory pathways, by measuring on-line oxygen consumption and oxygen isotope fractionation in soybean cotyledon tissue. Cinnamic acid and alpha-pinene decreased the oxygen consumption rate and increased the relative partitioning of electron transport to the alternative pathway. Possible biochemical mechanisms of these effects are discussed. 3aGlycine max 3acotyledons 3aoxygen consumption 3aenergy metabolism 3abiochemical pathways 3aoxidoreductases 3aallelopathy 3aalpha-pinene 3acinnamic acid 3ajuglone 3aquercetin 3aoxygen 3aisotope labeling 3afractionation 0arespiration rate1 aRibas-Carbo, M.1 aGiles, L.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1996 Apr., v. 22, no. 4 p.801-805x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF020335873Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03679naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002300163245013200186300001800318500001500336520148200351650001301833650001201846650002901858650001701887650002801904650002001932650001701952650001501969650002401984650001202008650001202020650001202032650001602044650003302060650001902093650002602112650002102138650001302159650001102172650001202183650002702195650002802222650002802250650002602278650001702304650004802321650005602369650002702425650002902452650002402481650001102505650002602516650004002542650002902582650002402611653001202635653002902647700001802676700002202694700002002716700001802736773008702754852000902841930003302850945002502883946001302908655001202921IND4426380520221122043650.0090922e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442638052DNAL7 a197778862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We evaluated the efficacy of EW in killing Escherichia coli O157:H7 on iceberg lettuce, cabbage, lemons, and tomatoes by using washing and/or chilling treatments simulating those followed in some food service kitchens. Greatest reduction levels on lettuce were achieved by sequentially washing with 14-A (amperage) acidic EW (AcEW) for 15 or 30 s followed by chilling in 16-A AcEW for 15 min. This procedure reduced the pathogen by 2.8 and 3.0 log CFU per leaf, respectively, whereas washing and chilling with tap water reduced the pathogen by 1.9 and 2.4 log CFU per leaf. Washing cabbage leaves for 15 or 30 s with tap water or 14-A AcEW reduced the pathogen by 2.0 and 3.0 log CFU per leaf and 2.5 to 3.0 log CFU per leaf, respectively. The pathogen was reduced by 4.7 log CFU per lemon by washing with 14-A AcEW and 4.1 and 4.5 log CFU per lemon by washing with tap water for 15 or 30 s. A reduction of 5.3 log CFU per lemon was achieved by washing with 14-A alkaline EW for 15 s prior to washing with 14-A AcEW for 15 s. Washing tomatoes with tap water or 14-A AcEW for 15 s reduced the pathogen by 6.4 and 7.9 log CFU per tomato, respectively. Application of AcEW using procedures mimicking food service operations should help minimize cross-contamination and reduce the risk of E. coli O157:H7 being present on produce at the time of consumption. 3atomatoes 3aacidity 3aantibacterial properties 3afood service 3abacterial contamination 3adecontamination 3aelectrolytes 3asanitizing 3asodium hypochlorite 3acooling 3acabbage 3awashing 3aplate count 3aLactuca sativa var. capitata 3afood pathogens 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aalkali treatment 3akitchens 3alemons 3aaerobes 2aBrassicaxmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aElectrolysis 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & development 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxprevention & control. 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Servicesxstandards 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aLettucexmicrobiology 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmicrobiology. 2aVegetablesxmicrobiology 2aWaterxpharmacology 0aproduce 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aHung, Yen-Con1 aBeuchat, Larry R.1 aKing, C.

  1 aZevenbergen, H.10aFoods with a High Fat Quality Are Essential for Healthy Diets  ap. 15-24.  a2019-12-05  aFat is generally a highly valued element of the diet to provide energy, palatability to dry foods or to serve as a cooking medium. However, some foods rich in fat have a low fat quality with respect to nutrition, i.e., a relative high content of saturated (SFA) as compared to unsaturated fatty acids, whereas others have a more desirable fat quality, i.e., a relative high content of unsaturated fatty acids as compared to SFA. High-fat dairy products and fatty meats are examples of foods with low fat quality, whereas vegetable oils (tropical oils such as palm and coconut oil excluded) are products with a generally high fat quality. The aim of this paper is to explore the nutritional impact of products made of vegetable oils, e.g. margarines and dressings, and how they can be designed to contribute to good health. Since their first industrial production, the food industry has endeavored to improve products like margarines, including their nutritional characteristics. With evolving nutrition science, margarines and cooking products, and to a lesser extent dressings, have been adapted to contain less trans fatty acids (TFA), less SFA and more essential (polyunsaturated, PUFA) fatty acids. This has been possible by using careful fat and oil selection and modification processes. By blending vegetable oils rich in the essential PUFAs -linolenic acid (vegetable omega-3) or linoleic acid (omega-6), margarines and dressings with both essential fatty acids present in significant quantities can be realized. In addition, full hydrogenation and fat rearrangement have enabled the production of cost-effective margarines virtually devoid of TFA and low in SFA. Dietary surveys indicate that vegetable oils, soft margarines and dressings are indeed often important sources of essential fatty acids in people's diets, whilst providing negligible amounts of TFA and contributing modestly to SFA intakes. Based on empirical and epidemiological data, the public health benefit of switching from products with a low fat quality to products with a high fat quality can be predicted. For example, switching from butter or palm oil to a soft margarine shows a substantial improvement in the nutritional quality of the diet. These simple, practical dietary adaptations can be expected to contribute to the healthy growth and development of children and to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease. 3anutrient content 3adietary fat 3avegetable oil 3amargarine 3afatty acid composition 3alinolenic acid 3acardioprotective effect 3adietary nutrient sources 3asaturated fatty acids 3atrans fatty acids 3ahydrogenated oils 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3asalad dressings 3agrowth and development 3ahydrogenation 3anutritive value 3aesterification 3acardiovascular system 0acooking fats and oils 0aessential fatty acids 0adiet 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aBree, A. de1 aZeelenberg, M.1 aLaitinen, K.1 aDuijn, G. van1 aFloter, E.0 tAnnals of nutrition & metabolism.g2009, v. 54 p.15-24x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a20090916b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/16  aNon-US 7aarticle04329naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163072000900181072000900190100001700199245009600216300001600312500002400328500001500352506007600367520201700443506003702460650001502497650001002512650000902522650001402531650001002545650002002555650001902575650001002594650001502604650001302619650001402632650001702646650003602663650002702699650002402726650004202750650001102792650001102803650005602814650003102870650000902901650001402910650001402924650002302938650006602961650003203027650003303059650001603092653001803108653002603126700001803152700001703170700001703187700001703204700001703221700001903238700001703257773011503274852000903389856008003398930003303478945002503511946001103536655001203547IND4417862620221207082416.0090318e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441786262DNAL7 a190480152pmid7 aPMC26433282pmcid7 a10.1038/ijo.2008.2552doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aHolsen, L.M.10aGenetic subtype differences in neural circuitry of food motivation in Prader-Willi syndrome  ap. 273-283.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Differences in behavioral phenotypes between the two most common subtypes of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) (chromosome 15q deletions and maternal uniparental disomy 15 (UPD) indicate that distinct neural networks may be affected. Though both subtypes display hyperphagia, the deletion subgroup shows reduced behavioral inhibition around food, whereas those with UPD are generally more able to maintain cognitive control over food intake impulses. Objective: To examine the neural basis of phenotypic differences to better understand relationships between genetic subtypes and behavioral outcomes. We predicted greater food motivation circuitry activity in the deletion subtype and greater activity in higher order cognitive regions in the UPD group, especially after eating. Design and participants: Nine individuals with PWS due to UPD and nine individuals with PWS due to (type 2) deletion, matched for age, gender and body mass index, underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing food images during two food motivation states: one before (pre-meal) and one after (post-meal) eating a standardized 500 kcal meal. Results: Both PWS subgroups showed greater activity in response to food pre- and post-meal compared with the healthy-weight group. Compared with UPD, the deletion subtype showed increased food motivation network activation both pre- and post-meal, especially in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala. In contrast, the UPD group showed greater activation than the deletion subtype post-meal in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). Conclusion: These preliminary findings are the first functional neuroimaging findings to support divergent neural mechanisms associated with behavioral phenotypes in genetic subtypes of PWS. Results are discussed within the framework of genetic mechanisms such as haploinsufficiency and gene dosage effects and their differential influence on deletion and UPD subtypes, respectively.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amotivation 3afoods 3adiet 3aphenotype 3abrain 3aneural pathways 3ahuman genetics 3agenes 3aovereating 3apatients 3alifestyle 3ameals (menu) 2aAppetitexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBrainxphysiopathology 2aChromosome Deletion 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 15xgenetics 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHyperphagiaxgeneticsxphysiopathologyxpsychology. 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aMale 2aNerve Net 2aPhenotype 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aPrader-Willi Syndromexgeneticsxphysiopathologyxpsychology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aUniparental Disomyxgenetics 2aYoung Adult 0aeating habits 0aPrader-Willi syndrome1 aZarcone, J.R.1 aChambers, R.1 aButler, M.G.1 aBittel, D.C.1 aBrooks, W.M.1 aThompson, T.I.1 aSavage, C.R.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2009 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.273-283dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2008.2553Available from publisher's Web site  a20090506b20090608c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03285naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007700126300001800203500001500221520194500236650002302181650001002204650001002214650001102224650002302235650002502258650002102283650001502304650000902319650001902328650001202347650001802359650002202377650001302399650002502412651001002437653002102447653002602468653002702494653002102521653002802542700001702570700001602587773010802603852000902711930003302720945001302753946001302766655001202779IND2079994920221122014222.0980506s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207999492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomda, Z.C.10aSoil pH and nitrogen changes following cattle and sheep urine deposition  ap. 1253-1268.  a2019-12-05  aThe relationship between animal urine deposition and variability in soil chemical composition and crop growth is not well established in the semi-arid region of West Africa. This study was conducted to examine the changes over time in soil pH and mineral nitrogen (N)concentrations at the micro sites of cattle and sheep urine patches in comparison to those occurring in fertilizer urea placement zones. The urine and fertilizer solution containing each 400 mg N (800 kg N ha-1) were spread onto individual plots covering a surface area of 4-cm radius. The treatments included a control, which consisted of distillate water. Soil samples from three replicate plots were taken in 4-cm increments to a depth of 16 cm and distance of 16 cm on a grid pattern at days 1, 7, 21, 49, 90, 120, and 150 after application. Significant pH and mineral N gradients develop in the vicinity of the fertilizer and urine placement zones declining towards the periphery and the deeper soil layers. The pH at the center of the urine zone remained above 7.5 throughout the 150 days of the study period. After the initial increase, the soil pH below the fertilizer placement sites declined to the control level by day 90. Concentrations of ammonium (NH4) + nitrate (NO3) also increased markedly in the immediate soil layers of the urine and urea placement zones, and then decreased over time probably due to N losses by volatilization and leaching. Concentrations of mineral N at the periphery of the placement site were similar for all treatments throughout the study period, indicating very little lateral N diffusion. These results provided evidence that animal urine causes significant variabilities in soil chemical composition, even in short distance from the deposition zones. The high soil solution pH in the vicinity of the urine patches alleviate the potential of aluminum (Al) toxicity while increasing the phosphorus (P) availability to crop plants. 3atemporal variation 3aurine 3asheep 3acattle 3asoil heterogeneity 3aspatial distribution 3anitrate nitrogen 3asoil depth 3aurea 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3aammonium nitrogen 3aAlfisols 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aNiger 0anitrogen content 0avertical distribution 0amicroscale variability 0anutrient sources 0ahorizontal distribution1 aPowell, J.M.1 aBationo, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1997, v. 28, no. 15/16 p.1253-1268x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02655naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137072000900155072000900164100001800173245007400191300001600265500002400281500001500305520140400320650001901724650001601743650001701759650001501776650001501791650001501806650001401821650002001835653002001855700001401875700001801889700001601907700001601923773009701939852000902036856009502045930003302140945002502173946001102198655001202209IND4417883420140725000000.0090319e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441788342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2008.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ502 0aQ1021 aHuan, Le Ngoc10aAutomatic extraction of lean-tissue contours for beef quality grading  ap. 251-264.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn evaluating beef quality, proper extraction of the boundary of lean-tissue from the section of beef rib is the crucial first step. The quality features of a beef carcass are determined by size, marbling state, and the colour of the lean-tissue on the 13th rib. Because of the inhomogeneous distribution and fuzzy pattern of the fat and lean-tissues on various beef-cuts, it is difficult to automatically extract a proper contour of the lean-tissue. In this research, image-processing algorithms have been developed to automatically extract the boundary of the lean-tissue in a robust way as human expert does. Algorithms include automatic threshold determination using Rényi entropy for beef-cut segmentation and contour modification, along with binary morphological approaches. The algorithms were applied to 36 beef-cut samples and successfully demonstrated contour extraction with average percentage error of 2.63% and average pixel distance error of 2.51 pixels when compared to results from a human expert. Computing time for the contour extraction process was around 5 s. A mobile image acquisition and processing system was also developed for on-site application. The system was composed of a hand-held image acquisition unit and a mobile computing unit mounted with a touch-pad screen. The algorithms developed were applied to the mobile processing unit as a supplementary grading device. 3aimage analysis 3ameat grades 3abeef quality 3aautomation 3aalgorithms 3aextraction 3alean meat 3acarcass grading 0aproduct grading1 aChoi, Sun1 aCho, Seong-In1 aLee, Moo-Ha1 aHwang, Heon0 tBiosystems engineering.g2009 Mar., v. 102, no. 3 p.251-264dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2008.11.0303Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03143naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137072000900155072000900164100001900173245010400192300001600296500002400312500001500336520187400351650000902225650001902234650002002253650003602273650001002309650001702319650002702336650001002363653003502373700002402408700001902432773009702451852000902548856009502557930003302652945002502685946001102710655001202721IND4417883520221122014624.0090319e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441788352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2008.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX387 0aS2001 aAyalew, Gashaw10aRanking of risk of injury from glass contaminants using Fourier shape measures of fragment outlines  ap. 265-273.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe inclusion of glass contaminants in a horticultural peat product supplied to the domestic market, where it may be manipulated by hand, exposes customers to the risk of injury, especially if the fragment is encountered at a sharp edge or pointed corner, and at a high enough velocity. Fragment shape is considered the most important factor in the process of accidental injury, and its determination with a reasonable accuracy would be of great benefit. Glass contaminants included in peat were detected using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and resulting images processed to isolate glass fragment outlines. Four shape measures derived from the Zahn-Roskies Fourier series of fragment outlines were compared to a corresponding visually determined rank of risk of injury. A similar procedure was also carried out on ranks generated from Cartesian distances of fragments based on the shape measures and those based on visual ranking. Comparison of ranks was carried out using Kendall's Rank Correlation Test. It was observed that the parameter of the polygonal approximation of fragment outlines and the highest Fourier harmonic considered affected rank correlation. Results show that the individual shape measures performed reasonably well, the best correlation being τ = -0.721 (p < 0.0000005) at the most suitable polygonal approximation and harmonics considered, both of which were low values demanding a lower computational effort compared to other measures. Combination shape measures were also tested for their utility with the best performing two shape-measure combination resulting in a ranking performance of τ = 0.839 (p < 0.0000005) which is a 16.4% improvement over the best single shape measure. It can be concluded that the Zahn-Roskies Fourier based combination shape measures will enable a high-accuracy online injurious shape identification. 3apeat 3aimage analysis 3aanimal injuries 3ahorticultural products industry 3aglass 3arisk factors 3aoccupational accidents 3ashape 0aoccupational health and safety1 aHolden, Nicholas M.1 aWard, Shane M.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2009 Mar., v. 102, no. 3 p.265-273dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2008.12.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02326naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011100126300001600237520125300253650002601506650002701532650002001559650002501579650002301604700001501627700002101642700002301663700001401686700001401700700002301714700001801737700001501755700001701770773008501787852000901872930003301881945001301914946001301927655001201940IND2163641220221122014410.0980826e199704  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216364122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, A.L.10aAggregation pheromones and host kairomones of West Indian sugarcane weevil, Metamasius hemipterus sericeus  ap. 869-888.  aCoupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analyses and coupled GC-mass spectrometry (MS) of volatiles produced by male and female West Indian sugarcane weevils (WISW), Metamasius hemipterus sericeus (Oliv.), revealed eight male specific, EAD-active compounds: 3-pentanol (1), 2-methyl-4-heptanol (2), 2-methyl-4-octanol (3), 4-methyl-5-nonanol (4), and the corresponding ketones. In field experiments in Florida, alcohols 1-4 in combination with sugarcane were most attractive, whereas addition of the ketones or replacement of alcohols with ketones significantly reduced attraction. In Costa Rica field experiments testing alcohols 1-4 singly and in all binary, ternary, and quaternary combinations revealed 4 in combination with 2 was the major aggregation pheromone, equally attracting male and female WISW. Stereoisomeric 4 and (4S,5S)-4, the only isomer produced by WISW, were equally attractive. Addition of 4S-, 4R- or (+/-)-2 to (4S,5S)-4 significantly enhanced attraction. Sugarcane stalks in combination with 2 plus 4 (ratio of 1:8) were highly synergistic, whereas EAD-active sugarcane volatiles ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate, or ethyl butyrate only moderately increased attractiveness of the pheromone lure. 3aMetamasius hemipterus 3aaggregation pheromones 3astereochemistry 3achemical composition 3avolatile compounds1 aCampos, Y.1 aChinchilla, C.M.1 aOehlschlager, A.C.1 aGries, G.1 aGries, R.1 aGiblin-Davis, R.M.1 aCastrillo, G.1 aPena, J.E.1 aDuncan, R.E.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1997 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.869-888x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02663naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005700128300001800185500001500203520146700218650001301685650002101698650002801719650003601747650001301783650002601796650002101822650001501843650002101858650002201879650002501901651001301926653002001939653004101959653001902000653001802019700001602037773010802053852000902161930003302170945001302203946001302216655001202229IND2079996020221121225807.0980506s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207999602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvanylo, G.K.10aPresidedress soil nitrogen test for corn in Virginia  ap. 1285-1301.  a2019-12-05  aThe presidedress soil nitrate test (PSNT) and the presidedress tissue nitrogen test (PTNT) have been developed to assess residual soil nitrogen (N) sufficiency for corn (Zea mays L.) in the humid eastern U.S. We conducted field studies at 47 sites during 1990 and 1991 to evaluate the use of the PSNT and PTNT for corn in Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian Ridge and Valley regions of Virginia. Seven rates of fertilizer N (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, and 270 kg/ha) were applied at corn height of 0.40 to 0.50 m and replicated four times in a randomized complete block design. Whole corn plants and soil to a depth of 0.30 m were sampled when corn height was 0.15 to 0.30 m to estimate available soil N prior to the application of fertilizer N treatments. Corn grain yield response to fertilizer N was used to assess residual soil N availability. Nitrogen concentration of whole corn plants at 0.15 to 0.30 m height was not an accurate indicator of plant-available soil N. Corn yields were maximized without sidedress N at the 19 sites where soil NO3-N was at least 18 mg.kg-1 and at the 17 sites where soil (NO3+NH4)-N was at least 22 mg.kg-1. The PSNT predicted corn N sufficiency regardless of soil physiographic region or surface texture; however, the critical values for NO3-N and (NO3+NH4)-N were 3 to 5 mg.kg-1 lower than those established in Pennsylvania and Maryland, where cooler soil temperatures may permit greater residence time of inorganic N. 3aZea mays 3anutrient content 3afertilizer requirements 3achemical constituents of plants 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anitrate nitrogen 3acrop yield 3asoil test values 3aammonium nitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aVirginia 0aplant nutrition 0afertilizer requirement determination 0aplant analysis 0asoil analysis1 aAlley, M.M.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1997, v. 28, no. 15/16 p.1285-1301x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03121naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245012600171300001600297500002400313520179400337650001002131650001202141650001402153650002102167650002602188650001302214650001502227650002702242650001102269651001502280653002002295653002702315653002302342653002702365653003002392653002902422653002502451700002402476700002102500773009702521852000902618856004802627655001202675IND4447265020221121225855.0110107e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444726502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-010-9542-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanahan, Danielle F.10aModels based on individual level movement predict spatial patterns of genetic relatedness for two Australian forest birds  ap. 137-148.  aIncludes references  aFine-scale landscape change can alter dispersal patterns of animals, thus influencing connectivity or gene flow within a population. Furthermore, dispersal patterns of different species may be influenced by the landscape in varying ways. Our research first aimed to examine whether the spatial genetic structure within populations of closely related bird species differs in response to the same landscape. Second, we examined whether individual-level movement characteristics are a mechanistic driver of these differences. We generated a priori predictions of how landscape features will influence dispersal (particularly the response of individuals to habitat boundaries both natural and human-induced) based on a movement model developed by Fahrig (Funct Ecol 21:1003-1015, 2007). This model allowed us to predict genetic relatedness patterns in populations of two passerine bird species with different life-history traits from Queensland, Australia (yellow-throated scrubwren Sericornis citreogularis, a habitat specialist; white-browed scrubwren Sericornis frontalis, a habitat generalist). We quantified our predictions using cost-distance modelling and compared these to observed pairwise genetic distances (a r ) between individuals as calculated from microsatellite markers. Mantel tests showed that our a priori models correlated with genetic distance. Euclidean distance was most closely correlated to genetic distance for the generalist species (r = 0.093, P = 0.002), and landscape models that included the avoidance of unsuitable habitat were best for the specialist species (r = 0.107, P = 0.001). Our study showed that predictable movement characteristics may be the mechanism driving differences in genetic relatedness patterns within populations of different bird species. 3abirds 3aforests 3agene flow 3agenetic distance 3agenetic relationships 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3aQueensland 0aAnimal movement 0aHabitat specialisation 0aLandscape genetics 0aWhite-browed scrubwren 0aYellow-throated scrubwren 0aSericornis citreogularis 0aSericornis frontalis1 aPossingham, Hugh P.1 aRiginos, Cynthia0 tLandscape ecology.g2011 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.137-148dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-010-9542-6 7aarticle02278naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011200127300001800239520118600257650001301443650002701456650001401483650002701497650001601524651001301540651001401553651001201567651002101579651001501600653001601615700001701631700001601648700001801664700001601682700001501698773008701713852000901800930003301809945001301842946001301855655001201868IND2163595920221121225823.0980825e199708  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216359592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, D.R.10aGeographic variation in response of pine engraver, Ips pini, and associated species to pheromone, lanierone  ap. 2013-2031.  aLanierone strongly synergized the attraction of male and female Ips pini (Say) to ipsdienol in New York and Wisconsin. Synergy was only weakly significant in Montana and British Columbia and not significant in California. Catches of I. pini in ipsdienol-baited traps were increased 0% (i.e., nonsignificant) to 9942% by lanierone, with the highest increases in eastern North America. Lanierone had the least effect in California. The effects of lanierone on sex ratios of I. pini in trap catches varied significantly between regions. The addition of lanierone to ipsdienol-baited traps resulted in a general increase in male representation at nine of 12 sites. Ips integer (Eichhoff) was attracted to lanierone alone. Ipsdienol reduced the response of I. integer to lanierone. Enoclerus lecontei (Wolcott) (Cleridae) preferred traps baited with the combination of ipsdienol and lanierone. (R)-(-)-Ipsdienol was attractive to E. sphegeus (F.), Thanasimus undatulus (Say) (Cleridae), and Temnochila chlorodia (Mannerheim) (Trogositidae), while racemic ipsdienol was attractive to E. nigrifrons var. gerhardi Wolc. and Thanasimus dubius (F.).

The concentration of DOM in the various soil solutions ranged from 2.5 to 32.8 mg.L-1DOC. More than 80% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was usually isolated with DEAE cellulose. High concentrations of aluminum (Al)and sulfate (SO4(2-)) in the soil solutions have reduced DOC recovery. More than 90% of potassium (K(+)), calcium (Ca(2+)), and magnesium (Mg(2+)), were removed during the isolation procedure, but 10 to 20% of Al and 30 to 40% of iron (Fe) were isolated together with the DOC, probably due to strong complexation to DOM. The advantages of using DEAE cellulose were that the use of strong acids and bases was limited and that pH adjustments of the sample, leading to chemical modification of DOM, was not required. 3asoil solution 3asoil organic matter 3acellulose 3asolutes 3aanion exchange resins 3aforest soils 3adissolved organic carbon 3aanion exchange 0aefficiency 0ainorganic solutes 0aisolation 0aorganic anions 0aevaluation1 aOgner, G.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1997, v. 28, no. 15/16 p.1311-1321x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03042naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245010700188300001800295500002400313520123800337650002601575650001601601650001301617650003001630650001101660650001801671650002201689650001301711650001201724650002901736650002501765650002201790650002501812650001301837650001401850650001401864650002301878650002301901650002701924651001901951651002201970651001901992651002202011653001602033653002202049653002302071653001902094653002802113653001302141700002002154700001902174700003102193700002502224773010302249852000902352856005502361655001202416IND4418541820221121230837.0090403e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441854182DNAL7 a193023522pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04136.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAurahs, Ralf10aGeographical distribution of cryptic genetic types in the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber  ap. 1692-1706.  aIncludes references  aWe present SSU rDNA data resolving the seasonal and geographical distribution of 'cryptic' genetic types of the planktonic foraminifer morphospecies Globigerinoides ruber in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Analysis of 262 sequences revealed the presence of five genetic types belonging to two distinct lineages. Although the morphospecies G. ruber occurs throughout the investigated region, its constituent 'cryptic' genetic types show a pattern of widespread exclusion, which is difficult to reconcile with the concept of ubiquitous dispersal. One of the newly discovered genetic types was exclusively found at stations in the Mediterranean Sea, possibly representing the smallest-scale example of endemism known in planktonic foraminifera. In general, our results suggest that the geographical scale of mutual exclusion between the genotypes is negatively correlated with their phylogenetic relatedness: the most similar and most recently diverged pair of siblings showed the strongest evidence for small-scale competitive exclusion. This pattern is consistent with the concept of niche partitioning, implying decreasing level of competition between genetic types with increasing degree of genetic divergence. 3acompetitive exclusion 3acorrelation 3agenotype 3ageographical distribution 3aniches 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asiblings 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aGeography 2aPhylogeny 2aPlanktonxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aMediterranean Sea 0aAtlantic Ocean 0aMediterranean Sea 0acompetition 0acryptic diversity 0aniche partitioning 0aphylogeography 0aplanktonic foraminifera 0aSSU rDNA1 aGrimm, Guido W.1 aHemleben, Vera1 aHemleben, Ch.q(Christoph)1 aKucera, M.q(Michal)0 tMolecular ecology.g2009 Apr., v. 18, no. 8 p.1692-1706dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04136.x 7aarticle03731naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245012400180300001800304500002400322500001500346520181800361650002402179650001002203650001302213650001502226650001102241650001902252650001002271650002302281650000902304650001102313650001702324650001002341650000902351650001402360650001902374650001402393650001102407650002402418650001502442650001602457650002102473650001202494650001902506650002402525650001102549650002002560650000902580650002302589650001402612650002902626650002202655650001402677651001102691651001102702653002802713700001902741700001702760700002002777700001902797700001702816773011902833852000902952856004802961655001203009IND4428277320221121230924.0091106e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442827732DNAL7 a194590612pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-009-9374-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafi, S.

Vitamins A and E and selenium concentrations were determined on 448 blood samples. Using the forward selection procedure of the logistic regression module, models with statistically significant risk factors (P < 0.05) were constructed for three outcomes; pregnancy, twinning and fetal loss. Serum vitamin A concentration levels were associated with pregnancy (OR = 2.26, 2.48), twinning (OR = 6.49, 17.74) and fetal loss (OR = 0.13, 0.19). Primiparous ewes were 48% less likely to become pregnant than fourth or higher parity ewes. The likelihood of twinning increased significantly in ewes up to the third parity. Ewes that were fed 700-900 g barley, 250-300 g wheat-bran per head per day and grazed on vegetables residues were 4.15 times more likely to have twins than ewes that were fed 600 g barley and 200 g wheat-bran per head per day. Fetal loss in first and second parity ewes was about 3 times more likely than that in third or higher-parity ewes. Ewes pregnant with twins were about 14 times more likely to have fetal loss than ewes carrying single fetus. Pregnant ewes of the stationary flocks were 37% less likely to have fetal loss than ewes of the semi-nomadic flocks. These results demonstrate that stationary Awassi sheep flocks had higher pregnancy and twinning rates and less pregnancy loss. Supplementation of vitamin A, providing sufficient quantity of dry feed and increasing ram: ewe ratio for primiparous ewes of semi-nomadic flocks is essential to improve Awassi sheep reproductive performance. 3aprospective studies 3afeeds 3aselenium 3awheat bran 3abarley 3ablood sampling 3atwins 3astatistical models 3arams 3aflocks 3arisk factors 3afetus 3aewes 3avitamin A 3apregnancy rate 3avitamin E 3aAwassi 3aregression analysis 3avegetables 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aCohort Studies 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aPregnancy 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSheepxphysiology 2aVitamin A 3aJordan 0aJordan 0aepidemiological studies1 aTalafha, A.

Moreover, comparative estimates on changes in browsing pressure (proportion of available shoots browsed) following long-term winter feeding are currently lacking. We quantified spatiotemporal changes in browsing pressure of moose (Alces alces L.) on commercial and non-commercial tree species around 30 feeding stations after 15-20 years of winter feeding. The results were compared with browsing pressure indices recorded at the same feeding stations 10 years previously. We expected leader stem and lateral twig browsing to have increased over time at a fine spatial scale (≤200m from feeding station) and to have increased in spatial extent away from feeding stations. Furthermore, we tested whether moose browsing patterns conformed to central-place foraging theory. Despite 2-3-fold higher faecal pellet group numbers in the vicinity of feeding stations, leader stem browsing increased only on the commercially valuable Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), a species normally avoided by moose. Lateral twig browsing largely decreased within 200m of feeding stations while at a broader scale (≤1km from feeding stations), leader stem browsing was high on most tree species (ca. 60% of available stems browsed) as expected, Peak browsing on lateral twigs of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) occurred further from feeding stations after 15-20 years of winter feeding than 10 years earlier. Browsing pressure on active feeding stations (n =18) was comparable to that on inactive feeding stations (n =12), suggesting the occurrence of rebrowsing. The ability of central-place foraging theory to explain fine-scale browsing patterns around feeding stations decreased as diversionary feeding continued over time. Long-term diversionary winter feeding of moose in unproductive boreal forests has serious implications for the intensity of fine-scale browsing pressure, which may lead to resource depletion close to feeding stations followed by high browsing pressure at distances further away from feeding stations. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering the longevity of a winter feeding programme at its inception. 3aAlces alces 3awildlife food habits 3awinter 3atrees 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aforage 3aboreal forests 3atemporal variation 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial variation 3aNorway 0abrowsing pressure1 aGundersen, Hege1 aMathisen, Karen Marie1 aMilner, J.

Many herbivores are also N-limited and so increased herbivore damage in response to N deposition may moderate, or even eliminate, gains in plant growth under elevated N. Thus the response of herbivores to N deposition could influence the onset and magnitude of N saturation resulting in expedited decreases in C storage. Since tree susceptibility to herbivores is partially under genetic control and will be influenced by site characteristics, we tested whether the interaction between N deposition, tree growth, and herbivore damage depends on tree genetic variation in susceptibility to herbivores at different locations. By monitoring 12 half-sib families of northern red oak (Quercus rubra) saplings at two common garden sites in south-central Pennsylvania, we found that herbivores were pervasive at both sites, resulting in 13% chewing damage, 16% galling damage and 28% browsing damage. N addition significantly affected browsing damage (8% overall increase) and chewing damage (19% overall increase) but did not affect galling damage. However, this effect was strongly dependent on the Q. rubra family and location, both of which influenced oak susceptibility to herbivore damage independent of N additions. Greater browsing damage on trees under N addition caused reductions in relative height growth, and this effect also depended on tree family and location. Our result suggests that herbivory, mediated by tree genetic lineage and site-specific conditions, may represent an important component of C sinks and N saturation under elevated N deposition. 3atree growth 3aatmospheric deposition 3aforest damage 3aforest trees 3aQuercus rubra 3adeer 3anitrogen 3aherbivores 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3agenotype-environment interaction 3acarbon sequestration 3aplant response 3agenetic variation 3avertebrate pests 3abrowsing 0atraits1 aAppel, Heidi M.1 aFrost, Christopher J.1 aSchultz, Jack C.1 aSteiner, Kim C.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 30, v. 259, no. 10 p.1930-1937dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.02.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03054naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002500166245008700191300001800278500002400296520173100320650001302051650001302064650001202077650001302089650002502102650001502127650001902142650002302161650002102184650001802205650001702223650001002240700002302250700002402273700002102297773011202318852000902430856008802439930003302527945002502560946001102585655001202596IND4435192120221121220354.0100409e20100430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443519212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.01.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF400 0aK0011 aWeiskittel, Aaron R.10aModelling primary branch frequency and size for five conifer species in Maine, USA  ap. 1912-1921.  aIncludes references  aQuantitative models of crown structure have been developed for several conifer species, but these studies have rarely simultaneously fit the models across multiple species. This study used extensive crown structure data for the five primary conifer species in Maine to test for species differences in maximum branch diameter profile, branch density, and relative branch diameter distribution. The species included balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill], northern white-cedar [Thuja occidentalis (L.)], eastern hemlock [Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.], eastern white pine [Pinus strobus (L.)], and red spruce [Picea rubens (Sarg.)]. After accounting for key covariates, significant species differences were found in all crown structural attributes examined in this study. Profiles for the mean tree indicated that northern white-cedar had the smallest maximum branch diameters throughout the crown and white pine had the largest, except near the base of the crown where the species switched in rank. The density of live branches in a crown had the widest range of variation of the examined crown structural attributes. Red spruce had a significantly higher density of primary branches than the other conifers, particularly in the upper crown. The relative branch diameter distribution indicated that balsam fir had a distribution more skewed towards larger relative branch sizes, while eastern hemlock and red spruce had distributions shifted towards smaller relative branches. This study highlights the range of variability in key crown structural attributes due to inherent species differences, but indicates that models fit across multiple species can perform quite well as the amount of explained variation was relatively high. 3aconifers 3abranches 3adensity 3adiameter 3aspatial distribution 3atree crown 3aAbies balsamea 3aThuja occidentalis 3aTsuga canadensis 3aPinus strobus 3aPicea rubens 3atrees1 aSeymour, Robert S.1 aHofmeyer, Philip V.1 aKershaw, John A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 30, v. 259, no. 10 p.1912-1921dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.01.0523Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01655naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008100124300001600205520086900221650000901090650000901099650002501108650001501133650002001148650001501168650000901183700001801192773009001210852000901300939003301309946001101342655001201353IND9302007320221121220137.0930406e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930200732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, R.10aInfluence of milk factors on riboflavin uptake by rat intestinal everted sac  ap. 279-282.  aThe uptake of riboflavin was measured in Krebs' medium and a system consisting of riboflavin-free dialyzed milk (providing milk factors) equalized to Krebs' medium with respect to different salt concentration and pH.

Don) Pic. Sern. et Bizarri in Argentina suffer decline and mortality throughout their natural distribution known as ‘mal del ciprés'. While several aspects of this, to date, temporally unpredictable process of overstory tree mortality have been the focus of detailed studies, there has been little research on tree growth and stand dynamics in symptomatic forests nor stand development patterns and prediction of future stand structure. We studied 12 stands in northern Patagonia (Province of Río Negro) using stand reconstruction studies to examine the changes in stand structure over time as a consequence of overstory mortality and the implications of these structural changes on the establishment and growth of the residual overstory. Dendrochronological analyses were used to reconstruct stand establishment and structure over time, and to study past diameter growth patterns. Mortality in A. chilensis forests was variable in time among stands. As expected, overstory mortality led to the successful establishment of trees in the understory in all stands; however, the response of residual overstory trees was variable. Understory establishment was low in some stands and high in others depending on the density of the overstory. While overstory trees in almost all stands released after the onset of the mortality, the pattern was not distinctive, varying in time, number and magnitude. In some stands, growth releases occurred after single or multiple tree deaths suggesting a relationship between processes, while in others this was not the case. Even when the patterns of recruitment in the understory and the overstory response varied greatly among stands, when examined together, some general patterns emerged. This study is the first to intensively explore the dynamics of A. chilensis forests affected by ‘mal del ciprés'. Additionally, this study showed that arbitrarily categorizing disturbances as discrete or chronic masks the true process of release of growing space and the resulting stand dynamics. 3atree growth 3aforest decline 3aLibocedrus chilensis 3aforest stands 3aforest stand establishment 3auneven-aged management 3adendrochronology 3atree mortality 3apopulation dynamics 3astand structure 3aforests 3aAustralia 0aforest stand dynamics 0astand characteristics 0aforest health1 aLarson, Bruce C.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 30, v. 259, no. 10 p.1981-1992dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.02.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01932naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006400128300001800192520092200210650001601132650001701148650002501165650002101190650001301211650001701224650002001241653002001261653002301281653001401304700001601318700001701334700002501351700001501376773008701391852000901478930003301487945001301520946001301533655001201546IND2163594320221121110425.0980825e199708  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216359432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, J.O.10a(Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol, a major component of Apis cerana venom  ap. 1929-1939.  aThe unusual venom of Apis cerana contains large oily droplets within an otherwise aqueous secretion. Chemical analysis (GC-MS) revealed that the venom oil consists of (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol (81.2%), other linear alcohols (7.7%), and linear hydrocarbons (11.1%). The eicosenol is present in extremely large quantities, averaging over 250 micrograms per insect, and is absent, or present in small quantities, in other parts of the sting apparatus. An investigation of the site of eicosenol storage in A. mellifera showed it to be absent from the venom and to be associated with the setose area where the more volatile components of the alarm pheromone are stored, as previously shown by others. A third honeybee species, A. dorsata, does not to contain the alcohol. The function of eicosenol in A. cerana is not clear, but may serve to mark stung intruders with pheromone or to attract foragers to marked floral resources. 3aApis cerana 3aApis dorsata 3achemical composition 3aalarm pheromones 3aalcohols 3ahydrocarbons 3asting apparatus 0ahoney bee venom 0aapis koschevnikoni 0avenom sac1 aMorgan, Ed.1 aOldham, N.J.1 aNascimento, R.R. do.1 aDani, F.R.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1997 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.1929-1939x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03191naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245008300176300001300259520178000272650001902052650002502071650001802096650001402114650000802128650002202136650001202158650001102170650001202181650001302193650001502206650002302221651001202244651001002256653002002266653003402286653002102320653003402341700002902375700002502404700002402429773012702453852000902580856007602589930003302665946001102698655001202709IND4387047120221121110433.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438704712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1477-9552.2007.00080.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Ittersum, Koert10aConsumers' Appreciation of Regional Certification Labels: A Pan-European Study  ap. 1-23.  aSuccessful regional products, such as Florida oranges, Idaho potatoes and Parma ham, often have to compete against products passing themselves off as the authentic product using the exact same name. This unfair competition misleads consumers, discourages small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from marketing products based on their region of origin, and may end up hurting rural economies. To protect consumers, and support SMEs and rural economies, many countries around the world have introduced regulations enabling SMEs to legally protect the names of their regional products. The success of these regulations largely depends on consumers' appreciation of regional certification labels that inform consumers that the name of the regional product is protected and that it denotes the authentic product. To gain an understanding about consumers' appreciation of regional certification labels, this paper investigates consumers' image of these labels and proposes a model that relates this image to consumers' willingness to buy and pay for protected regional products. The model is tested based on Regulation No. 2081/92 that was introduced by the EEC allowing European SMEs to protect their regional products and market their products with a protected-designation-of-origin (PDO) label. Structural equation modelling results suggest that consumers' image of regional certification labels consists of a quality warranty dimension and an economic support dimension, which positively relate to consumers' willingness to buy and pay for the protected regional product. Protecting regional products and marketing them with regional certification labels may be beneficial for SMEs producing and marketing regional products. Policy and managerial implications are discussed. 3aEuropean Union 3abusiness enterprises 3acertification 3aequations 3aham 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3aoranges 3apotatoes 3aprovenance 3awillingness to pay 3aFlorida 3aIdaho 0aplace of origin 0aregional certification labels 0aregional product 0astructural equation modelling1 aMeulenberg, Matthew T.G.1 aTrijp, Hans C.M. van1 aCandel, Math J.J.M.0 tJournal of agricultural economics.g2007 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.1-23dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-857X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-9552.2007.00080.x3electronic resource  a20070123b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02511naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001500177245014100192300001600333500002400349520103400373650001701407650001101424650002301435650002001458650002301478650001901501650000901520650001401529650003501543650001101578650001701589650001501606650002601621650002401647653002101671700002401692700002101716773011201737852000901849856009001858930003301948945002501981946001102006655001202017IND4435191420221121080826.0100409e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443519142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ400 0aQ1101 aLi, Yao O.10aIodine stability in iodized salt dual fortified with microencapsulated ferrous fumarate made by an extrusion-based encapsulation process  ap. 232-238.  aIncludes references  aThe development of a novel, extrusion-based process for making microencapsulated ferrous fumarate for salt double fortification has been reported earlier. This paper focuses on the results of a one-year storage test, specifically the stability of both iodine and ferrous iron in the double fortified salt (DFS) samples prepared using optimal formulations of the iron premix. The study was devised to test the effectiveness of the encapsulation system in the prevention of interaction between ferrous fumarate and iodine, and preservation of the iodine in iodized salt. The results confirmed that direct iodine-iron interaction occurred in the DFS samples when the iron compound was added without proper coating. However, when an appropriately encapsulated iron premix was used, the interaction could be completely prevented. The extrusion-based process has proven to be an effective approach to producing a stable, bioavailable iron premix, suitable for incorporation into iodized salt for combating iodine and iron deficiencies. 3aiodized salt 3aiodine 3afood fortification 3afortified foods 3amicroencapsulation 3aferrous alloys 3airon 3aextrusion 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3amixing 3afood storage 3ashelf life 3anutrient availability 3aoxidative stability 0aferrous fumarate1 aDiosady, Levente L.1 aWesley, Annie S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 July, v. 99, no. 2 p.232-238dElsevier Science Pub.

Volatiles from crushed medium or dark red fruit of Coffea arabica cv. arabica plants were significantly more attractive than volatiles from cut leaves or stems of such plants, volatiles from less-ripe crushed C. arabica fruit, and volatiles from crushed red fruit of C. racemosa, C. canephora, or C. dewevari. Volatiles from C. arabica cv. arabica crushed red fruit were equally attractive as volatiles from crushed red fruit of C. congensis or C. arabica cv. mundo, cv. bourbon, cv. kents or cv. catura. Volatiles from as little as 2 g of crushed red C. arabica fruit (= 1 fruit) were as attractive as volatiles from 32 g of such fruit, demonstrating sensitivity of the bioassay approach used to a small amount of source material. Odor of C. arabica red fruit refrigerated for 1-10 days after picking was significantly more attractive than odor of fresh-picked fruit, while odor of a 24-hr water extract of intact red C. arabica fruit was significantly more attractive than odor of 24-hr extracts of such fruit with methanol, methylene chloride, or hexane or 1- or 6-hr extracts with water. Extraction studies suggested that at least some of the volatiles of red coffee fruit attractive to medflies may be polar water-soluble molecules. In our final test, volatiles from crushed red C. arabica fruit trapped on Super Q and eluted with methylene chloride proved just as attractive as volatiles emanating directly from crushed fruit of the same type. Together, our findings define optimal source material and effective handling procedures of source material for future identification of volatile components of coffee fruit attractive to medflies. 3aCoffea arabica 3aodors 3ainsect attractants 3aCeratitis capitata 3achemical constituents of plants1 aPhillips, T.W.1 aVargas, R.I.1 aJang, E.B.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1997 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.1577-1587x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02030naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006000127300001800187520077800205650001800983650001501001650000901016650002601025650002601051650001901077650001601096650001301112650002801125650002001153650002101173650001201194650002401206650002901230650000901259650003601268651001401304653001601318653001601334653001801350700001601368773010801384852000901492930003301501945001301534946001301547655001201560IND2123362220221121051127.0980613s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212336222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArriechi, E.10aSoil test for available zinc in acid soils of Venezuela  ap. 1471-1480.  aZinc (Zn) deficiencies have been identified in Venezuela with increasing frequency in recent years However, there are no established critical values for available Zn in the acid soils of this country.

The primary analyses involve comparisons between securely attached infants (Group B) and anxiously attached infants (Groups A and C combined). Additional analyses compare anxious-resistant with anxious-avoidant infants. Secure classification in the Strange Situation was associated with quality of secure-base behavior at home (i.e., higher Q-sort security scores) and with sociability, but not with dependency scores. Descriptive analyses of individual Q-set items support the secure-base interpretation of Strange Situation security classifications.

This study evaluated the constituents of turfgrass thatch in terms of organic matter (OM), cellulose, and lignin content. Ten samples were analyzed containing two or three layers of 2-cm thick for a total of 30 layers. As thatch layers may often include mineral matter, a technique was developed to separate the OM from any mineral particles in the samples. An important loss of OM was observed during the separation process. Despite problems encountered during the constituent analyses due to the heterogeneity of the samples and the presence of mineral matter, results showed a significant increase in lignin content with depth. 3aorganic matter 3alawns and turf 3acellulose 3athatch 3alignin 0achemical composition 0aash1 aTurgeon, A.J.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1997, v. 28, no. 13/14 p.1199-1207x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03029naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010700127300001800234520199600252650001802248650002102266650001202287650001902299650001602318650001302334650001002347650001402357650001302371650001802384650001502402653001102417653002102428653001802449773010802467852000902575930003302584945001302617946001302630655001202643IND2062978220221121040634.0980407s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206297822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoutinho, J.10aCalibration of the single- and double- buffer SMP lime requirement methods by root elongation bioassay  ap. 1127-1139.  aChemical and biological lime requirement (LR) reference values of 154 soils were obtained by six months of incubation of each soil with five levels of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Levels of CaCO3 addition differed among soils according to their characteristics. Chemical LR values were based on the individual neutralization curves to achieve a desired pH (PHd) value of 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5 in water or 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 in 0.01M calcium chloride (CaCl2). Biological LR values were estimated to achieve 90% relative root elongation on each soil after a growth period of 48 h using wheat cv Abe. Chemical values of LR suggest that SMP method is valid for a wide range of mineral soils from different geographic regions. However, the proportion of soil acidity reacting with the buffer is not constant. Results indicate that values obtained with the routine methods need to be calibrated with equations different from the originals. The use of curvilinear models to adjust one single pH of the soil-buffer system improved substantially its accuracy, allowing the single-buffer (SB) results to be comparable to the more time consuming and labourious double-buffer (DB) technique. No advantage was noticed with the use of curvilinear equations for DB technique. The adoption of pHd in 0.01 M CaCl2 leads to an increase of precision of the predicted LR. Regression equations are provided for calculating LR rates to different pHd values. Accuracy is high (r2=0.887) even for pH values (5.0 in 0.01 M CaCl2) lower than normally considered in methods based on buffer solutions. An overestimation of biological LR values was observed with both SMP methods. Notwithstanding, a calibration can be also made with the root bioassay, adjusting the chemical values to lime rates based on biological constraints related with aluminum (Al) toxicity. Regression equations are provided. Once more, the use of quadratic model for SB method allows an accuracy (r2=0.836) comparable with the DB technique (r2=0.850). 3asoil analysis 3alime requirement 3asoil pH 3aneutralization 3acalibration 3aTriticum 3aroots 3abioassays 3aaluminum 3asoil toxicity 3aacid soils 0agrowth 0aexchange acidity 0adetermination0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1997, v. 28, no. 13/14 p.1127-1139x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03555naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100002300172245009800195300001600293500001500309520183900324650001502163650002602178650002302204650001302227650002502240650003402265650001102299650002002310650002002330650001402350650001602364650004302380650001002423650001402433650003102447650001102478650001102489650000902500650001502509650002202524650002002546651001802566653002102584653001502605653001602620653002002636653001102656653001302667700001402680773007502694852000902769856009402778939003302872946001302905990002302918655001202941IND9003269220221121040635.0900713e199004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900326922DNAL7 a23447922pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02802.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson-Le Gall, S.10aCognitive-motivational influences on the task-related help-seeking behavior of black children  ap. 581-589.  a2019-12-04  aThe present study examined the relation between children's mastery motivation performance, and task-related help-seeking behavior during task performance. Average-achieving black American children, varying in mastery motivation as measured by subscales of the Harter's Intrinsic-Extrinsic Orientation in the Classroom Scale, performed a multitrial verbal task and were given the opportunity to seek help on each trial after making a tentative response and assessing their performance by rating their confidence in the correctness of the response. A response-contingent payoff system was implemented to encourage children to restrict their help seeking to those instances in which they perceived that they could not make a correct response without assistance. As predicted, children's self-assessments of performance, regardless of their accuracy, appeared to influence help seeking more than the actual performance outcomes. Neither children's self-assessments of performance nor their overall rate of help seeking varied with level of measured mastery motivation. However, the type of help sought varied as expected with mastery motivation. Children characterized by high intrinsic orientations toward independent mastery in academic achievement contexts sought indirect help (i.e., hints) more often than they sought direct help (i.e., answers), whereas children characterized by low intrinsic orientations toward independent mastery showed no preference. These differences in motivational orientation influenced requests for help only when children perceived their initial solutions to be incorrect. These findings are discussed in the context of the analyses of help seeking as an instrumental learning and achievement strategy. The implications of the findings for analyses of black children's achievement styles are highlighted. 3amotivation 3acognitive development 3agender differences 3achildren 3asocioeconomic status 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3aBlacks 3aproblem solving 3aself-perception 3aeducation 2aAchievement 2aBlack or African Americanxpsychology. 2aChild 2aCognition 2aDependency, Psychological. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMotivation 2aPersonality Tests 2aProblem Solving 3aUnited States 0alearning ability 0ainfluences 0aachievement 0aage differences 0askills 0abehavior1 aJones, E.0 tChild development.g1990 Apr., v. 61, no. 2 p.581-589x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02802.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02783naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002200161245012000183300001400303500012400317520150000441650002501941650002301966650001201989650002202001650001902023650001802042650001802060650002002078650001602098650002502114651001102139653004102150700001602191773007602207852000902283930003302292945002502325946001102350655001202361IND4409736520221121040817.0080903s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440973652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Elmadfa and H. Freisling.  aBackground: The European Nutrition and Health Report contains data about the nutritional situation of elderly of 11 EU countries. Methods: The assessment of the energy and nutrient intake was performed using different methods: 24-hour recall, (semiquantitative) FFQ, 4/7-day-weighed record, personal interview, HBS. Results: Compared to adults of the same country, the energy intake of elderly was on average lower. In most EU countries, the mean proportion of protein intake was within the recommended range while the share of carbohydrates was considerable low. The mean fat intake was remarkably high, the dietary fatty acid pattern predominantly imbalanced and the intake of cholesterol exceeded 300 mg/day in most European elderly. The average intake of vitamin D and folic acid was clearly below 10 and 400 μg/day, respectively, in elderly of all countries. Sodium intake was quite high in several participating countries, whereas calcium intake remained below 800 mg/d in all investigated states. The supply of vitamin A/C, thiamine, niacin, cobalamin, and the elements: magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, and manganese could generally be regarded as sufficient. Only in some countries the intake of these nutrients had to be assessed as unsaturated. Conclusion: Data analysis showed that the proportions of macronutrient intake of European elderly are not balanced. Apart from vitamin D, calcium, folate, iodine, and sodium the mean intake of micronutrients could be regarded as acceptable. 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3aelderly 3aelderly nutrition 3aEuropean Union 3ahealth status 3aenergy intake 3anutrient intake 3adiet recall 3anutritional adequacy 3aEurope 0aEuropean Nutrition and Health Report1 aElmadfa, I.0 tAnnals of nutrition & metabolism.g2008, v. 52 p.57-61x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a20081120b20081206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/11/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03596naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013000125300001800255520256400273650001302837650001302850650002002863650002602883650002302909650002002932650002102952650002102973650003602994653002203030653001803052773010803070852000903178930003303187945001303220946001303233655001203246IND2062980220221121040820.0980407s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206298022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClay, D.E.10aComparison of the difference and delta 15nitrogen approaches for evaluating liquid urea ammonium nitrate utilization by maize  ap. 1151-1161.  aIsotopic nitrogen (N) research techniques may be required in watershed studies to determine the impact of landscape position on fertilizer efficiency and the soil supplying power. However, traditional approaches using 15N labeled fertilizer may not be suitable when farmer equipment is used. The delta 15N natural abundance isotopic approach has been used to evaluate N cycling in watersheds. The objectives of this study were to measure the precision of the delta 15N measurement by the Europa 20-20 ratio mass spectrometer (Europa Scientific Ltd, UK), and to compare the difference and delta 15N approaches for measuring fertilizer use by maize (Zea mays). A replicated field study containing two different N rates (0 and 15.7 g N m-2) were used for the study. Maize samples were collected at the 8th-leaf, silking, and plant maturity in 1992 and 1993. Samples were dried (80 degrees C), ground (<1-mm), weighed (stover 12 mg and grain 3 mg), and analyzed for total N and delta 15N. Fertilizer utilization at the three growth stages was determined using the natural abundance delta 15N and nonisotopic difference (fertilizer-control) techniques. During the study, the Europa 20-20 ratio mass spectrometer (Europa Scientific Ltd, UK) analyzed over 100 samples a day and had consumable costs of less than $2.00 per sample. The standard deviations of the mean were less than 0.11 and 0.21 per thousand in 51 and 77% of the stover samples, respectively. In 1992, grain yields were not influenced by N fertilizer additions, while in 1993 grain yields were increased by N fertilizer. The difference method estimated that in 1992, 16% of the N fertilizer was utilized by the crop, while the natural abundance delta 15N approach estimated that 36% of the fertilizer N was used by the crop. Differences between calculated values by the two techniques resulted from the difference method calculating net fertilizer use, while the delta 15N approach calculated fertilizer contained in the plant. Because the delta 15N approach estimates fertilizer use, this approach can be used to calculate soil N contained in the plant. In watershed studies, this information may provide the tools needed to evaluate N use in responsive and nonresponsive sites within a field. This research shows that the delta 15N method compliments the difference method, can be used to measure actual fertilizer use when farmer equipment is used, and that the Europa 20-20 ratio mass spectrometer (Europa Scientific Ltd, UK) has acceptable precision for the delta 15N natural abundance approach. 3aZea mays 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3aurea ammonium nitrate 3aliquid fertilizers 3astable isotopes 3anitrogen content 3aapplication rate 3achemical constituents of plants 0acrop growth stage 0adetermination0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1997, v. 28, no. 13/14 p.1151-1161x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02911naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009800123300001600221520175900237650002001996650001302016650001602029650002002045650001002065650002002075650001802095650002602113650001202139650001402151650000902165650001502174650000902189650000902198700001202207700001402219700001602233700001602249700001702265700001702282773008802299852000902387930003302396945001302429946001102442655001202453IND2333426220221121040841.0030709e200205  sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233342622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhta, M.12aA caffeine diet can alter the mechanical properties of the bones of young ovariectomized rats  ap. 108-113.  aThe general public widely consumes caffeine which is contained in various foods, beverages, and over-the-counter medications. The relationships between caffeine intake and bone fractures is controversial. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to determine what effects, if any, caffeine intake in early life exerts on mechanical properties and mineral contents of bone in growing ovariectomized rats. A total of 8 dams with pups were divided into two groups. Group 1 was fed a 20% protein diet. Group 2 was fed a 20% protein diet supplemented with caffeine (4 mg/100 g). The respective diets were fed to the dams during lactation and to the pups continuously after weaning on day 22 until the end of the experimental period. On day 32, offspring from both groups were ovariectomized. On day 52, the rats were sacrificed and the femora removed. The biomechanical properties of the femora were determined by three-point bend testing to failure at a rate of 2 mm/min, with continuous data sampling at 10 samples/s. The properties determined included the modulus of elasticity, yield load, yield stress, ultimate load, ultimate stress, and the second moment of area. The caffeine group exhibited a decrease in the various mechanical properties (ranging from approximately 7 to 20%), except for yield strain and moment of inertia. The decreases in maximum stress and elastic modulus values were significant. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous values for the caffeine group were significantly decreased. These results suggest that the bone in the caffeine group is weaker and less stiff, with greater deformation under applied loading. It could be concluded that caffeine intake during the early growing period affects the mechanical properties of bone. 3achild nutrition 3acaffeine 3afood intake 3aadverse effects 3abones 3amineral content 3abone strength 3amechanical properties 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3azinc 3aphosphorus 3apups 3arats1 aIde, K.1 aCheuk, G.1 aCheuk, S.L.1 aYazdani, M.1 aNakamoto, T.1 aThomas, K.A.0 tAnnals of nutrition & metabolism.g2002 , v. 46, no. 3/4 p.108-113x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle02720naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001700172245009000189300001600279500001500295520111600310650002201426650001201448650002301460650001101483650001601494650003401510650001501544650004301559650003001602650001101632650002001643650001101663650002801674650000901702650001501711650002701726650002301753650001901776651001801795653002801813653001801841653002301859653002001882700001701902773007501919852000901994856009402003939003302097946001302130990002302143655001202166IND9003268820221121040842.0900713e199004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900326882DNAL7 a23447872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02797.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuBois, D.L.10aSchool and neighborhood friendship patterns of blacks and whites in early adolescence  ap. 524-536.  a2019-12-04  aThis research examined the school and neighborhood friendships of 292 black and white children who attended an integrated junior high school. Most students reported having a close other-race school friend, but only 28% of the sample saw such a friend frequently outside of school. Reports of an interracial school friendship that extended to nonschool settings were significantly more common among black students than whites and among children who lived in integrated neighborhoods rather than segregated ones. Race differences in reported friendship behavior were also found on other friendship variables. Compared to whites, blacks reported more extensive neighborhood friendship networks but indicated that they talked to fewer friends during the school day. In addition, the study replicated prior findings that white girls report more peer social support than white boys but failed to find a gender difference in peer support among blacks. The discussion emphasizes the importance of the school/nonschool ecology and the need for further comparative study of white and black children's friendship patterns. 3ayouth development 3aschools 3agender differences 3aWhites 3aadolescents 3a4-H Youth Development Program 2aAdolescent 2aBlack or African Americanxpsychology. 2aCross-Cultural Comparison 2aFemale 2aGender Identity 2aHumans 2aInterpersonal Relations 2aMale 2aPeer Group 2aPsychology, Adolescent 2aSocial Environment 2aSocial Support 3aUnited States 0ainterracial friendships 0aneighborhoods 0apeer relationships 0aage differences1 aHirsch, B.J.0 tChild development.g1990 Apr., v. 61, no. 2 p.524-536x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02797.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03560naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190100001700199245010400216300001600320500002400336500001500360520156800375650002601943650001101969650001201980650001701992650002302009650003502032650002502067650002702092650002102119650002202140650002202162650002702184650002002211650001002231650001202241650003702253650002902290650001102319650003702330650003902367650003102406650004702437650002902484650005202513653001402565700001602579700001702595700001502612773010602627852000902733856007502742930003302817945002502850946001102875655001202886IND4417801720140725000000.0090314e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441780172DNAL7 a191657612pmid7 a10.1002/ps.16972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF200 0aL200 0aL300 0aL0011 aZhao, Xin C.10aModified female calling behaviour in Cry1Ac-resistant Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 353-357.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: The resistance risk in Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) to transgenic cotton that expresses Cry1Ac from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has raised concerns about the sustainable deployment of Bt cotton. Mating behaviour between resistant and susceptible individuals is an important factor that affects resistance evolution of the insect. The female calling behaviours of the Cry1Ac-resistant strain and its susceptible control were compared in the laboratory to understand the difference in mating biology.RESULTS: The proportion of females of the resistant strain calling was significantly reduced by 14%, and the age of the calling peak was delayed by 1 night compared with that of the susceptible strain. During the scotophase, females of the resistant strain started calling more than 100 min later on nights 3 to 7, and spent 30-100 min less time on nights 2 to 7 than the susceptible females. The onset time of calling advanced and the time spent calling increased as a function of age in both susceptible and resistant strains.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that there is a fitness cost in terms of the female calling behaviour of the resistant strain. The lower proportion of females of the resistant strain showing calling behaviour could reduce the mating frequency of the resistant strain. The delayed onset time of calling in the resistant strain could reduce its mating time, and a reduction in the time spent calling could reduce the attractiveness of resistant females; this could also reduce the mating frequency of the resistant strain. 3ainsecticidal proteins 3acotton 3afemales 3ainsect pests 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aplant-incorporated protectants 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acrystal proteins 3adiurnal variation 3anatural selection 3ainsecticide resistance 3amating behavior 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxpharmacology 2aEndotoxinsxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aHemolysin Proteinsxpharmacology 2aInsecticide Resistancexphysiology 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aMothsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aVocalization, Animalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0aevolution1 aWu, Kong M.1 aliang, Ge M.1 aGuo, Yu Y.0 tPest management science.g2009 Apr., v. 65, no. 4 p.353-357dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.16973Available from publisher's Web site  a20090507b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02476naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001500172245009100187300001600278520107600294650001401370650003401384650001301418650002001431650001301451650000801464650001001472650002201482650002101504650002501525650001101550650001101561650000901572650002801581650001701609651001101626653001601637653002001653653001601673653001901689653001501708773007501723852000901798856009401807939003301901946001301934990002301947655001201970IND9003786120221121030431.0900813e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900378612DNAL7 a23070402pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02772.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, R.14aThe effects of mastery and competitive conditions on self-assessment at different ages  ap. 201-210.  aIt was hypothesized that self-evaluative accuracy will increase with age in a competitive condition, while even young children will appraise their performance quite accurately in a mastery condition. Children at ages 5, 7, and 10 working in either a match-the-standard or a competitive condition copied a drawing and then evaluated their copies. As hypothesized, competing 5-year-olds overestimated the quality of their copies, and self-assessments became less positive and better correlated with adult judgments with age. There were no age differences in self-evaluative accuracy in the mastery condition. Examination of children's explanations for their ratings and their interest in the task supported the interpretation that young children are guided by a nonnormative concept of ability, which can lead to overoptimistic perceptions of competence under competition. Older children tended to adopt normative goals and criteria for self-assessment in competition and mastery ones in the match the standard condition, and were realistic about their performance in both. 3aeducation 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3achildren 3aself-perception 2aAptitude 2aArt 2aChild 2aChild Development 2aChild, Preschool 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPsychomotor Performance 2aSelf Concept 3aIsrael 0acompetition 0aage differences 0aachievement 0aself appraisal 0acompetence0 tChild development.g1990 Feb., v. 61, no. 1 p.201-210x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02772.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02658naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001500172245006700187300001600254500001500270520117600285650002201461650002601483650002501509650003401534650002301568650001401591650001001605650002101615650001801636650002201654650000901676650001101685650001101696650002501707650000901732650003201741650001901773650002201792653002101814653001301835653001501848700001801863773007501881852000901956856009401965939003302059946001302092990002302105655001202128IND9005694020221121020701.0901119e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900569402DNAL7 a23647452pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02813.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeal, C.R.14aThe development of message evaluation skills in young children  ap. 705-712.  a2019-12-04  aThe goal of this research was to learn if young children overestimate message quality because they evaluate their knowledge or assumptions about the intended meaning of the message, rather than its literal meaning. 2 experiments were conducted with preschoolers (4 years) and kindergartners (5-6 years). Second graders (8 years) also participated in the first experiment. Children evaluated the communicative quality of informative, ambiguous, and ineffective picture messages in a simple communication game. In the first experiment, children knew the intended referent when they evaluated the message. The results showed that younger children overestimated the informativeness of the ambiguous and ineffective messages, while older children evaluated message quality accurately, even though they knew the intended meaning. In the second experiment, younger children detected more of the message ambiguities when they did not know the target referent than when they were informed of the intended interpretation. The results suggest that young children overestimate message quality because they evaluate their interpretation of the message rather than its literal meaning. 3ayouth development 3acognitive development 3acommunication skills 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3apreschool children 2aAttention 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCommunication 2aConcept Formation 2aCues 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLanguage Development 2aMale 2aPattern Recognition, Visual 2aPilot Projects 2aSpeech Perception 0asocial cognition 0achildren 0aevaluation1 aBelgrad, S.L.0 tChild development.g1990 June, v. 61, no. 3 p.705-712x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02813.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02018naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005900128300001800187500001500205520080000220650002501020650001601045650001301061650002801074650003601102650001801138650001401156650002201170650001501192650002301207653006001230653002001290653004101310653001901351653001201370653001101382700001501393773010801408852000901516930003301525945001301558946001301571655001201584IND2062976420221121020654.0980407s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206297642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranzen, D.W.10aSpatial variability of plant analysis potassium levels  ap. 1081-1091.  a2019-12-05  aPlant samples were taken from a forty-acre field in an 82.5 ft. grid at two sampling dates each year during a three-year study.

Plant K analyzed using both techniques were correlated with soil test K levels. Plant K analyzed with acid-digestion was also highly correlated with the acetic acid-extracted K. Mapping of early sampled plant K better represented soil K level patterns than later sampling. Plant K maps described areas of low K not represented by soil K level maps.

Acute experiments (A, B) were carried out in healthy volunteers and in diabetics, by evaluating plasma glucose, triglyceride and insulin changes after a single meal. Plasma glucose and triglyceride rises were almost completely prevented by the pasta in normal volunteers; plasma insulin levels were modified to a lesser extent. In diabetics, the rise of plasma glucose after the meal was significantly delayed. The pasta was also administered for more prolonged periods of time to diabetic and hyperlipidemic patients (experiments C-E). In the first instance, a significant improvement both in the plasma glucose levels, as well as in the daily glucose profile and glycosuria was observed. In hyperlipidemics, a reduction of triglyceride levels was particularly evident; however, in mixed types of hyperlipidemias, a significant hypocholesterolemic effect was also demonstrated. Guar gum pasta may provide a simple dietary addition for the management of common metabolic disorders.

Ripening in fruits, such as tomatoes, is a complex phenomenon which affects chemical and physiological properties as a function of time. Attempts to solve the problem of ripening classification focus mostly on single sensors; however, there is not yet a complete solution. In this work, the use of repeated measurements obtained from two different non-destructive sensors incorporated into a Bayesian classifier for data fusion is proposed. Two independent measurements, from a novel non-destructive acoustic impact technique and from colorimeter sensors, were used. The problem of using repeated measurements to describe the probability density function for each class was addressed. The effect of correlated data and number of sensor characteristics on the artificial classifier was explained by an analysis of classification error. The results showed that the error classification rate is affected by the correlation between repeated measurements. The proposed Bayesian data fusion scheme reaches a classification error of as low as 5%, compared with 25-50% when single sensors are used. 3atomatoes 3apostharvest technology 3aBayesian theory 3aprobability analysis 3aripening 3apostharvest physiology 3aquality control 0asensors 0astatistical analysis1 aBaltazar, Arturo1 aGonzalez-Aguilar, Gustavo0 tBiosystems engineering.g2009 Mar., v. 102, no. 3 p.274-284dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2008.12.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02519naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245007700154300001600231500002400247520137300271650001301644650002601657650002401683650001601707650002001723650001401743650002001757650001801777650002001795650001601815650002801831650001401859650001701873650002001890650002601910700002101936773010401957852000902061856003902070655001202109IND4439536720221120234800.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443953672DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.31712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuqman, Suaib10aNFκB: a promising target for natural products in cancer chemoprevention  ap. 949-963.  aIncludes references  aThe transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) is found in nearly all animal cell types. It is involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidized LDL and microbial antigens, and has been shown to regulate the expression of a number of genes including bcl-2, bcl-xl, cIAP, suvivin, TRAF, COX-2, MMP-9, iNOS and cell cycle-regulatory components. Many carcinogens, inflammatory agents and tumor promoters have been shown to activate NFκB, and resulting tumors demonstrate misregulated NFκB. Incorrect regulation of NFκB has been linked to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, septic shock, viral infection and improper immune development. Aberrant regulation of NFκB is involved in cancer development and progression as well as in drug resistance. Inhibitors of NFκB mediate effects potentially leading to antitumor responses or greater sensitivity to the action of antitumor agents. Tools have been developed for the rapid assessment of NFκB activity, so in concert with a better understanding of NFκB activation mechanisms, many agents capable of suppressing NFκB activation have been identified. The present article focuses on the functions of NFκB, its role in human cancer and the therapeutic potential and benefit of targeting NFκB by natural products in cancer chemoprevention. 3aantigens 3aantineoplastic agents 3aautoimmune diseases 3acarcinogens 3achemoprevention 3acytokines 3adrug resistance 3afree radicals 3agene expression 3airradiation 3alow density lipoprotein 3aneoplasms 3aseptic shock 3astress response 3atranscription factors1 aPezzuto, John M.0 tPhytotherapy research.g2010 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.949-963dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3171 7aarticle01942naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245004500128300001800173520089700191650002201088650002001110650002001130650002601150650001201176650001301188650001501201650001401216650001201230650001401242650001201256650003601268651001401304653000901318700001401327700001501341773010801356852000901464930003301473945001301506946001301519655001201532IND2080000520221120203330.0980506s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND208000052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, O.10aValencia orange DRIS norms for Venezuela  ap. 1461-1468.  aTissue diagnostic norms for Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis L.

The study involved trees of different ages, grafted on different rootstocks in several plantations, located in the most important orange producing areas (four states) of Venezuela. Data for 214 leaf samples, corresponding to the top 20% of the trees sampled, were used to develop the norms. Norms developed were compared for validation against previously published sufficiency range values and other published orange Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) norms. The close general agreement among the published values and the norms developed here, suggests that this approach could become an economic, relatively fast and reliable method for developing tissue diagnostic norms. 3adisease diagnosis 3aCitrus sinensis 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient deficiencies 3atropics 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3asurveys 3achemical constituents of plants 3aVenezuela 0adris1 aRojas, E.1 aSumner, M.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1997, v. 28, no. 15/16 p.1461-1468x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02282naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014500128300001800273500001500291520095500306650001501261650002101276650001701297650002701314650001801341650001301359650002001372650001801392650002301410650001501433650002101448650002401469651001101493653002001504700001501524700001901539700002001558700001901578700001601597700002301613773010801636852000901744930003301753945001301786946001301799655001201812IND2123274720221120203428.0980610s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212327472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, E.C.10aSeasonal variation of selenium, crude protein, and in vitro organic matter digestibility of Brachiaria humidicola from Marajo Island, Brazil  ap. 1683-1691.  a2019-12-05  aNutritional content of Brachiaria humidicola grass in relation to crude protein (CP), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), and selenium (Se) as related to wet and dry seasons in the Amazon region of Marajo Island, Brazil, was determined. Twenty-four samples, 12 from the dry and 12 from the wet season, were analyzed. Grass selenium concentrations were not influenced by season and the means were above the minimal requirement for beef cattle in both seasons (0.14 or 0.15 ppm). Factors other than rainfall may be involved. Crude protein concentrations were lower (P<0.05) in the dry (3.5%) than in the rainy season (4.8%) and in both seasons were lower than the critical level for cattle (<7.0%). The IVOMD means were extremely low, 33.5% in the wet season and 33.6% in the dry season. These analytical values indicate that Brachiaria humidicola grown at Marajo Island has nutritional limitations for grazing buffalo and cattle production. 3adry season 3anutrient content 3aforage crops 3ain vitro digestibility 3ahumid tropics 3aselenium 3anutritive value 3acrude protein 3aseasonal variation 3awet season 3aclimatic factors 3aUrochloa humidicola 3aBrazil 0aprotein content1 aVale, W.G.1 aMcDowell, L.R.1 aWilkinson, N.S.1 aSimao Neto, M.1 aVeiga, J.B.1 aLourenco, J.B.

(Pieridae, Lepidoptera) caterpillars. This was done both for caterpillars feeding on an artificial diet and for caterpillars feeding on excised leaf material of a host plant, Brassica oleracea L. Gravimetry produced significantly greater variation in the total amount of matter respired and the metabolic efficiency than indirect calorimetry for caterpillars feeding on plant material, while the two methods gave similar results for the caterpillars reared on a meridic artificial diet. Respirometry (indirect calorimetry) revealed that caterpillars feeding on the artificial diet were growing with a higher metabolic efficiency than caterpillars feeding on the host plant. This difference was not revealed by conventional gravimetry. It is argued that metabolic efficiencies as derived from gravimetric budget calculations are subject to a number of random errors that distort precise determination of metabolic efficiencies in studies involving plant food. 3aBrassica oleracea 3aPieris brassicae 3aartificial diets 3acalorimetry 3agravimetry 3ahost plants 3ainsect larvae 3aleaves 3arearing0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1993 May, v. 67, no. 2 p.135-142dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw36103x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1993.tb01661.x 7aarticle02466naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013900128300001800267520152300285650002601808650002701834700001701861700002301878700001901901700001601920700001501936700002001951700001401971773008701985852000902072930003302081945001302114946001302127655001202140IND2163687120221120193121.0980828e199704  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216368712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayaraman, S.10aSynthesis, analysis, and field activity of sordidin, a male-produced aggregation pheromone of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus  ap. 1145-1161.  aAn efficient synthesis of the diastereoisomers of sordidin (1), a male-produced aggregation pheromone of Cosmopolites sordidus, has been developed from commercially available 4-methylpent-4-en-2-ol (2). Preparation of exo-beta-sordidin (1a) and endo-beta-sordidin (1b) is via the anti epoxide, 4d, which is derived via iodocarbonation of 2. The endo-alpha-sordidin (1c) and exo-alpha-sordidin (1d) are prepared from the corresponding syn epoxide, which is available via stereo-controlled epoxidation of the triisopropylsilyloxy derivative, 3b. Silyloxy derivatives of the epoxides, 4, efficiently alkylate the anions of N-cyclohexyldiethylketimine (6a) and 3-pentanone N,n-dimethylhydrazone (6b). Acidic work-up of these alkylation reactions promotes cyclization to give 1. Gram quantities of 1a-1d, 1a + 1b and 1c + 1d have been prepared by this route. In field tests in a banana plantation in Costa Rica, compounds 1a-1d significantly increased capture rates of standard pseudostem traps. Comparable numbers of adults were attracted to pseudostem traps baited with the major naturally occurring isomers of sordidin 1c + 1d or 1a-1d. Although addition of the minor naturally occurring isomers of sordidin (1a and 1b) to pseudostem traps increased capture rates above controls, these compounds did not increase attraction of pseudostem traps to the same extent as 1a-1d. In comparison tests with conventional pseudostem traps, significantly more adults were trapped in water-containing pitfall traps baited with 1a-1d. 3aCosmopolites sordidus 3aaggregation pheromones1 aNdiege, I.O.1 aOehlschalger, A.C.1 aGonzalez, L.M.1 aAlpizar, D.1 aFalles, M.1 aBudenberg, W.J.1 aAhuya, P.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1997 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.1145-1161x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02184naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245007900173300001600252500002400268520088000292650002801172650001801200650001201218650001401230650001201244650000901256650001101265650002601276650002301302650001001325650001301335650001601348650001901364650002001383650002101403700003401424700003101458700002801489700002701517700002401544773010101568852000901669856004801678655001201726IND4456849820221120203658.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445684982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-010-0615-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraxedes, Sidney Carlos10aSalt tolerance is unrelated to carbohydrate metabolism in cowpea cultivars  ap. 887-896.  aIncludes references  aUnder salinity stress, plants commonly accumulate carbohydrates for osmotic adjustment to balance the excess accumulated ions and to protect biomolecules. We selected two cowpea cultivars with contrasting response to salinity, Pitiúba (salt-tolerant) and TVu (salt-sensitive), to investigate whether the salt tolerance could be associated with changes in carbohydrate accumulation and metabolism in leaves and roots during a long-term experiment. Two salt treatments (0 and 75 mM NaCl) were applied to 10-day-old plants grown in nutrient solution for 24 days. Despite some changes in carbohydrate accumulation and carbohydrate metabolism enzymes induced by salt stress, no consistent alterations in carbohydrates could be found in leaves or roots in this study. Therefore, we suggest that tolerance to salt stress is largely unrelated to carbohydrate accumulation in cowpea. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acarbohydrates 3acowpeas 3acultivars 3aenzymes 3aions 3aleaves 3along term experiments 3anutrient solutions 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3astress tolerance1 ade Lacerda, Claudivan Feitosa1 aFerreira, Thalita Montoril1 aPrisco, José Tarquinio1 aDaMatta, Fábio Murilo1 aGomes-Filho, Enéas0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2011 May, v. 33, no. 3 p.887-896dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-010-0615-6 7aarticle02143naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013200128300001600260500001500276520104200291650002701333650003501360650002301395650002801418650004101446650002001487650001301507650001201520650002001532653003101552700002101583773013401604852000901738939003301747946001301780655001201793IND9303795620221120193146.0930624e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930379562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorelli, J.L.14aThe role of aminoglycoside antibiotics in the regeneration and selection of neomycin phosphotransferase-transgenic apple tissue  ap. 311-316.  a2019-12-04  aRegeneration from apple (Malus X domestica Borkh.) M.26 leaf tissue was completely inhibited by (microgram.ml-1) 1 geneticin, 5 kanamycin, 10 to 25 paromomycin, and 100 neomycin. nptII-transgenic M.26 had an increased tolerance to all four of the antibiotics tested, with inhibition of regeneration occurring at (microgram.ml-1) 2.5 geneticin, 100 kanamycin, 375 paromomycin, and 375 neomycin. Paromomycin (100 to 250 microgram.ml-1) and neomycin (250 microgram.ml-1) significantly increased the amount of regeneration from nptII-transgenic M.26 apple leaf tissue. p35SGUS-INT, a plasmid with a chimeric beta-glucuronidase gene containing a plant intron, was useful for studying the early events of apple transformation by eliminating GUS expression from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It was used to determine that the optimal aminoglycoside concentrations for the selection of nptII-transgenic M.26 cells were (microgram-ml-1)2.5 to 16 kanamycin, 63 to 100 neomycin, and 25 to 63 paromomycin.

Compounds extracted from female pheromone glands were identified by coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), and one compound, 10Me14Me-1-ene-18Hy, also by coupled GC-mass spectrometry. In field trapping experiments, 10Me14Me-1-ene-18Hy, 5Me9Me-18Hy, and 5Me9Me-17Hy singly were unattractive to males but in ternary combination attracted numerous male moths. Attractiveness of the three-component blend significantly exceeded that of two-component blends. No attraction of males to pheromone lures without 10Me14Me-1-ene-18Hy indicates that this compound is essential for pheromone communication of L. prunifoliella. Common C-5 and C-9 methyl branches in lyonetiid pheromone hydrocarbons suggest a common biosynthetic pathway; the presence of 5Me9Me-17Hy and 5Me9Me-18Hy in pheromone blends of L. prunifoliella and Leucoptera malifoliella provides evidence for phylogeny of lyonetiid chemical communication. Determination of the stereoisomeric composition is required to completely describe the pheromone blend of L. prunifoliella and to support the hypothesis of phylogenetically related sex pheromones. 3aLyonetia 3asex pheromones 3achemical composition1 aGries, G.1 aKing, G.G.S.1 aMaier, C.T.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1997 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.1119-1130x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01752naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015500128300001600283520083200299650002401131650001901155650002301174650001601197650001701213650002001230700001601250700001901266773008501285852000901370930003301379945001301412946001301425655001201438IND2163642520221120193140.0980826e199704  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216364252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurchie, A.K.10aResponses of Dasineura brassicae and its parasitoids Platygaster subuliformis and Omphale clypealis to field traps baited with organic isothiocyanates  ap. 917-926.  aThe responses of Dasineura brassicae and its parasitoids Platygaster subuliformis and Omphale clypealis to allyl and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanates have been investigated using a new design of trap in winter oilseed rape. Traps baited with allyl isothiocyanate caught more male and female D. brassicae and more female O. clypealis than traps baited with 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate or unbaited traps, whereas traps baited with 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate caught more male and female Platygaster subuliformis than traps baited with allyl isothiocyanate or unbaited traps. The implications of these results for host-plant and oviposition-site location by D. brassicae and for host habitat and host location by the parasitoids are discussed, as is the potential for using these responses in integrated pest management strategies. 3aDasineura brassicae 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3aparasitoids 3ainsect traps 3aisothiocyanates1 aSmart, L.E.1 aWilliams, I.H.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1997 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.917-926x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01915naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245010900122300001800231500002400249500001500273520078500288650002601073650002701099650002501126650002001151650002101171653002701192700001401219700001301233700001801246700001901264773011501283852000901398856007701407930003301484945001301517946001101530655001201541IND2328720220221120172722.0020829e200207  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232872022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, U.10aRegulation of the xylanase gene, cgxA, from Chaetomium gracile by transcriptional factors, XlnR and AnRP  ap. 1089-1096.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe roles of XlnR and AnRP in regulating the expression of the xylanase gene, cgxA, from Chaetomium gracile were investigated using Aspergillus nidulans as an intermediate host.

The cgxA gene was induced when xylan was used as a carbon source but this inducibilitywas abolished when the XlnR binding sequence was mutated. Furthermore, the induction by xylan was increased when the AnRP binding sequence -TTGACAAAT- was mutated. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using partially purified AnRP and an Aspergillus oryzae XlnR fusion protein, MalE-AoXlnR, provided evidence that the binding of the two proteins to their respective sites in the cgxA promoter region was mutually exclusive. 3atranscription factors 3agenetic transformation 3aAspergillus nidulans 3agene expression 3apromoter regions 0aAspergillus nidulellus1 aMarui, J.1 aKato, M.1 aKobayashi, T.1 aTsukagoshi, N.0 tBiotechnology letters.g2002 July, v. 24, no. 13 p.1089-1096dKluwer/Plenum Publishers [etc.]x0141-54927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0141-5492/contents3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02079naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010800124300001800232500002400250520106800274650001101342650001701353650002001370653003501390700001201425700001401437700001401451700001801465773011501483852000901598856007701607930003301684945001301717946001101730655001201741IND2328719920221120172534.0020829e200207  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232871992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiura, T.10aSuperoxide dismutase is involved in high tolerance to copper in the deep-sea yeast, Cryptococcus sp.

Using cell extracts, two distinct bands exhibiting SOD activity appeared on native PAGE: one band, with higher mobility, appeared when the cells were grown without CuSO4, and the other band appeared when the cells were grown with 10 mM CuSO4. Cells grown with 3 mM CUSO4 produced both SOD isoforms. Western blot analysis, using a monoclonal antibody against human SOD-1, showed that SOD protein was expressed in the absence of CuSO4 and that the expression level increased when the cells were grown with 3 or 10 mM CuSO4. The molecular weight of SOD from strain N6 was approx. 18 kDa. Treatment of the cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide at 0.5 microgram ml-1, did not affect cell growth in the absence of CuSO4 but significantly inhibited growth in the presence of 10 mM CuSO4 and inhibited expression of SOD protein. This suggests that SOD may play a role in cell growth in the presence of high concentrations of CuSO4. 3ayeasts 3amarine fungi 3ametal tolerance 0acryptococcus (deuteromycotina)1 aAbe, F.1 aInoue, A.1 aUsami, R.1 aHorikoshi, K.0 tBiotechnology letters.g2002 July, v. 24, no. 13 p.1069-1074dKluwer/Plenum Publishers [etc.]x0141-54927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0141-5492/contents3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01426naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008600123300001800209500002400227520059300251650001600844650001200860700001800872773011500890852000901005856007701014930003301091945001301124946001101137655001201148IND2328720020221120172519.0020829e200207  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232872002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeok, J.10aHeterogeneous biofilm activity in a segregated anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactor  ap. 1083-1087.  aIncludes references  aBed segregation in a fluidized bed bioreactor profoundly influenced biofilm thickness and microbial activities of the biofilm along the bed height.

Adjustment patterns were found to be complex and highly differentiated. Self-esteem was unchanged from the end of sixth through the middle of seventh grades, rising by the end of seventh grade. Girls reported an increase in depressive and other symptoms over time relative to boys. Perceived quality of school life plunged. Peer social support increased only for blacks of high academic competence. Although there were no race differences on overall self-esteem, multivariate analyses of symptom data revealed that blacks reported greater distrust of the environment than they reported negative internal states, whereas whites reported the opposite pattern. The discussion emphasizes the developmental and ecological context of the transition. 3ayouth development 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3aadolescents 3aelementary education 3asecondary education 3aself-esteem 3amental health 3asocial adjustment 3asupport systems 3agender differences 3aBlacks 3alongitudinal studies 3aWhites 3aacademic achievement 2aAchievement 2aAdaptation, Psychological 2aAdolescent 2aChild 2aHumans 2aPeer Group 2aPersonality Development 2aPsychological Tests 2aSelf Concept 2aSocial Adjustment 2aSocial Environment 2aSocial Support 3aUnited States 0apeer relationships 0achange 0aearly adolescents 0aeducational environment 0aschool transition 0asocial support 0aschool satisfaction1 aRapkin, B.D.0 tChild development.g1987 Oct., v. 58, no. 5 p.1235-1243x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1987.tb01454.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01882naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009700129300001400226500002300240520095300263650001801216650002001234650001801254650002001272650001301292650000801305650001001313651001201323700001501335700001401350773010201364852000901466930003301475945001301508946001101521655001201532IND2042013220221120172541.0940914e199404  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204201322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBright-See, E.10aAssessment of the relative validity of the Ontario Health Survey food frequency questionaire  ap. 33-38.  aSummary in French.  aA self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed as one section of the Ontario Health Survey to assess the food and nutrient intake of a sample of about 50,000 Ontario residents (> 12 years of age). The FFQ focused on the "priority" nutrients, fat, as per cent of energy, fibre and calcium. In order to assess the relative validity of the FFQ, it was compared to a four-day weighted food record (FR) in a group of 147 adults. Average absolute values of energy, fat, fibre and calcium from the FFQs were higher than those of the FRs. However, fat and fibre, expressed in relation to energy intake, were essentially the same by the two methods. FFQ/FR comparisons of carbohydrate, protein, vitamins (except vitamin A), iron, cholesterol and servings of food were as good or better than those of the priority nutrients. Issues to be considered in interpreting data from this, and other food frequency questionnaires, are discussed. 3aeating habits 3anutrient intake 3aenergy intake 3adietary surveys 3aaccuracy 3amen 3awomen 3aOntario1 aCatlin, G.1 aGodin, G.0 tJournal of the Canadian Dietetic Association.g1994 Spring, v. 55, no. 1 p.33-38x0008-33997nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02579naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009700125300001400222500002300236520165600259650001601915650001701931650002201948650002301970650002001993651001102013651001802024700001302042700001802055773010202073852000902175930003302184945001302217946001102230655001202241IND2042013020221120162751.0940914e199404  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204201302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarr, S.I.10aNutrient analysis using computer programs: comparison of a Canadian and an American database  ap. 29-32.  aSummary in French.  aThis study was conducted to assess the comparability of results obtained when food intake records were analyzed using a Canadian and an American database. Two-hundred twenty-two diet records were obtained from 40 women aged 20-40 years, half of whom were vegetarians. Each record was coded and analyzed twice: initially using a Canadian database (derived from the Canadian Nutrient File, 1992), which contains variable proportions of missing values, and then using the ESHA II American database, which has < 1% missing values. Differences in results appeared to be due to differences in nutrient content of similar foods in Canada and the U.S. and/or to the presence of missing values in the Canadian database. Results revealed: 1) for energy, proteins, total lipids, carbohydrates, cholesterol, calcium, vitamin C, pantothenate, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, there were no differences in the results, or the differences were so small as to be of little biological relevance; 2) for thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and iron, results from the American database appeared to falsely overestimate Canadian values by 5-12%; 3) for nutrients such as pyridoxine, folacin, copper, magnesium and zinc, missing values in the Canadian database appeared to result in underestimates of 6-14%; and 4) for dietary fibre and vitamin E, the proportion of missing values in the Canadian database was so high that use of the results would be inappropriate. In conclusion, dietetic practitioners need to be aware of the advantages and limitations of using databases, be they Canadian or American. The appropriate choice will depend on the nutrients of greatest interest. 3afood intake 3afood records 3acomputer software 3anutrient databanks 3anutrient intake 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aKwan, S.1 aJanelle, K.C.0 tJournal of the Canadian Dietetic Association.g1994 Spring, v. 55, no. 1 p.29-32x0008-33997nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01713naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007200126300001400198500002300212520090000235650002001135650001601155650002001171650001801191650002301209651001101232773010201243852000901345930003301354945001301387946001101400655001201411IND2042012620221120162746.0940914e199404  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204201262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruce, V.M.10aApplication of food technology to reduced fat intakes for Canadians  ap. 20-23.  aSummary in French.  aThe reduction in dietary fat to "no more than 30% of energy" will require a major change in the food practices of Canadians. In addition to the use of traditional low-fat foods, the Canadian public has the option to select fat-reduced foods produced by the food industry. Fat substitutes such as Simplesse and olestra can be used in the manufacture of reduced- or non-fat foods. The substitution of these foods for traditional higher-fat foods not only reduces fat intake, but can improve total nutrient intake. Energy intake is maintained by a net reduction of energy from fat and an increase in energy from carbohydrates. The use of fat-reduced foods does not result in the selection of fat-containing foods. Dietitians will find that this new food technology will be a useful adjunct to maintaining nutrient intakes and enabling clients to meet the recommended guidelines for fat consumption. 3afood technology 3adietary fat 3anutrient intake 3aenergy intake 3aDietary Guidelines 3aCanada0 tJournal of the Canadian Dietetic Association.g1994 Spring, v. 55, no. 1 p.20-23x0008-33997nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle03150naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001700172245011000189300001600299500001500315520135200330650002201682650001501704650002201719650003401741650002201775650001201797650001501809650001101824650002701835650002401862650001001886650001901896650002101915650002501936650001101961650001101972650002501983650002602008650002402034650002202058651001302080653001302093653003302106653003302139653002602172653001502198700001602213700001702229700001602246700001502262773007502277852000902352856009402361939003302455946001302488990002302501655001202524IND8904698620221120162806.0890829e198804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890469862DNAL7 a33598602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1988.tb01471.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLerner, J.V.12aA longitudinal study of negative emotional states and adjustment from early childhood through adolescence  ap. 356-366.  a2019-12-04  aThe relations among various negative emotional and behavioral characteristics (e.g., aggression, anxiety, under-compliance, depressive mood) and adjustment were examined through use of data from the 31-year-old New York Longitudinal Study. 75 white, middle-class children were rated on these negative characteristics from infancy to adolescence. Measures of family, peer, and personal adjustment were also obtained. Because of the longitudinal nature of the data, we were able to use structural equation models to address the following questions: (1) How stable are these negative behaviors from early life through adolescence? (2) What is the degree of relations between these emotional characteristics and adjustment in childhood and adolescence? and (3) To what degree do these emotional characteristics differentially predict multiple adjustment dimensions in adolescence? 2 factors of negative emotional behavior, labeled as Aggression and Affect, respectively, were identified in early and late childhood and were found to have relatively high stability of individual differences. Aggression significantly predicted adolescent maladjustment, whereas Affect had no independent prediction of maladjustment. Moreover, emotional problems provided better prediction of adolescent adjustment problems than did earlier childhood adjustment ratings. 3ayouth development 3aaggression 3achild development 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3asocial adjustment 3aanxiety 2aAdolescent 2aAffect 2aAggressionxpsychology 2aAnxietyxpsychology 2aChild 2aChild Behavior 2aChild, Preschool 2aCooperative Behavior 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aModels, Psychological 2aRegression Analysis 2aSocial Adjustment 3aNew York 0aemotions 0anegative emotional behaviors 0asocial emotional development 0aadolescent adjustment 0adepression1 aHertzog, C.1 aHooker, K.A.1 aHassibi, M.1 aThomas, A.0 tChild development.g1988 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.356-366x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1988.tb01471.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02235naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245011100169300001600280500001500296520094600311650002201257650003101279650001201310650001301322650002201335650001301357650003401370651001201404653002201416653002101438653001901459653002001478653002101498653001501519700002001534773007501554852000901629856009401638939003301732946001301765990002301778655001201801IND8904626120221120162835.0890825e198708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890462612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1987.tb01434.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCovell, K.10aUnderstanding emotion in the family: children's and parents' attributions of happiness, sadness, and anger  ap. 985-991.  a2019-12-04  aThis study is an investigation of children's and parents' attributions of children's and mothers' happiness, sadness, and anger. 123 children ages 5 to 15 years answered questions on casual attributions of their own and their mothers' emotions, method of inference, and change of maternal emotion. 54 parents were asked reciprocal questions. Major findings were age differences in causal attribution of maternal emotion, age increases in use of behavioral rather than expressive cues for inferring emotion, and a majority of children believing themselves able to alter maternal emotion. Unlike previous findings, only 5- and 6-year old children attributed maternal anger to themselves only. Older children did not causally attribute maternal anger to themselves only; however, across ages children cited themselves as a cause of maternal anger and causally attributed their own anger, rather than their happiness or sadness, to their family. 3ayouth development 3aparent-child relationships 3amothers 3aemotions 3amaternal behavior 3achildren 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3aOntario 0aparental emotions 0asocial cognition 0aparental anger 0aage differences 0afamily relations 0aevaluation1 aAbramovitch, R.0 tChild development.g1987 Aug., v. 58, no. 4 p.985-991x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1987.tb01434.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02065naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009200129300001600221520099800237650002401235650001001259650002601269650001501295650001601310650002101326650001801347650001801365650003601383653001601419653001601435653001801451700002001469700001601489773010601505852000901611930003301620945001301653946001301666655001201679IND2061737320221120142218.0980206s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206173732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsadilas, C.D.10aMethods of assessing boron availability to kiwifruit plants growing on high boron soils  ap. 973-987.  aFive soil boron (B) extraction methods were evaluated for their ability to predict available B to kiwifruit plants in soils with high B concentration. The methods were hot water soluble (Hws-B), 0.05M mannitol in 0.01M calcium chloride (CaCl2) extractable (Man-B), 0.05M hydrochloride acid (HCl) soluble (HCl-B), resin extractable (Resin-B), and saturation extract (Sat-B).

In addition, children with more time in high-quality day-care showed more physical affection during peer interactions, were more often assigned to the gifted program, and received higher math grades. 3ainfants 3achild care 3achildren 3asocial behavior 3alongitudinal studies 3aacademic achievement 3achild development 2aAggressionxpsychology 2aChild 2aChild Behaviorxpsychology 2aChild Day Care Centers 2aChild, Preschool 2aEducational Measurement 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Care 2aPsychology, Child 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSchools 2aSocial Behavior 0apeer relationships 0aprimary education 0aquality0 tChild development.g1991 Aug., v. 62, no. 4 p.863-870x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1991.tb01575.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02317naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013900125300001600264500002400280520108100304650002201385650001901407650001501426650002101441650001501462650002101477650001901498650001401517650002501531650002101556650001901577651001701596653001101613700001701624773011501641852000901756856008501765930003301850945001301883946001101896655001201907IND2328806620221120131941.0020904s2001    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232880662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtto, W.M.10aResponse of soil phosphorus content, growth and yield of wheat to long-term phosphorus fertilization in a conventional cropping system  ap. 283-292.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of annual banding of superphosphate (0-45 kg P ha(-1)) on soil phosphorus (P) content, growth, and yield of wheat was investigated from 1982 to 1998 in a major rainfed wheat production area of South Africa. Conventional tillage practices in a wheat monoculture cropping system were followed under summer rainfall conditions. The responses of wheat growth to fertilizer P application were evident during early and late tillering growth stages, with decreased responses towards maturity. Although average yields varied between cropping seasons (0.881 to 3.261 t ha(-1)) due to climatic conditions, significant exponential response patterns between yield and fertilizer P applications existed. Optimum yields were achieved with P applications of 10 to 15 kg P ha(-1). The recovery of fertilizer P in the grain decreased with increasing P applications. Results of soil P analyses and calculated P balance indicated a more rapid increase in soil P content with application of fertilizer P at levels above 20 kg P ha(-1), with gradual increases occurring at lower levels. 3aTriticum aestivum 3asoil fertility 3aphosphorus 3anutrient content 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3asuperphosphate 3atillering 3adevelopmental stages 3aapplication rate 3aband placement 3aSouth Africa 0agrowth1 aKilian, W.H.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2001, v. 61, no. 3 p.283-292dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnltoc.htm?1385-13143Tables of contents  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01744naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245006700148300001600215520021100231650001000442650001400452650002100466650001600487650002300503650003600526650004400562650002200606650005100628650003600679650003000715650002700745650003300772650002800805650004600833650005200879651001500931651001500946653001600961700001700977700001400994700001201008700001501020700002201035700001901057773007201076852000901148930003301157945001301190946001101203655001201214IND2322557720221120131923.0010816e200102  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232255772DNAL7 a112491052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShikishima, Y.10aPhenylbutanoids and stilbene derivatives of Rheum maximowiczii  ap. 377-381.  aThe methanol extract of the dried roots of Rheum maximowiczii afforded four phenylbutanoid and two stilbene derivatives.

The experimental diet containing a high protein level (30%) was aimed at increasing the metabolic need for PN. Microbiological analysis on the basal ration revealed a marginal content of 4.7 micromole PN/kg. The vitamin B6 status was assessed at the end of the experiment according to the basal activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) in plasma and in erythrocytes, and the in vitro stimulated activity with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). None of the deficient chicks had any clinical signs attributable to malfunction of the nervous system, and they grew as well as those receiving the control diet. Vitamin B6 deficiency was biochemically confirmed by a significant depression of AspAT activity in plasma (p < 0.001) and in erythrocytes (p < 0.01). The addition of PLP in vitro enhanced the catalytic activity of the plasma enzyme, but had negligible effect on the erythrocyte enzyme. The degree of stimulation in vitro of the apoenzyme of AspAT not only depends on the endogenous vitamin B6 content, but also on the basal activity of the enzyme. A 15-day repletion period with a daily oral dose (50 micromole PN) did not result in a complete restoration of the enzyme activity, indicating that the availability of apoenzyme had been curtailed. This experiment demonstrated that chicks fed a high protein corn-soyamin diet with a limited amount of PN but containing Saccharomyces yeast showed no nervous signs or perosis, but significant metabolic disturbances. The study was aimed at simulating an early stage (asymptomatic) of pyridoxine deficiency, as found in humans afflicted by a physiological or metabolic stress condition such as pregnancy or alcoholism. 3achicks 3avitamin deficiencies 3apyridoxine 3apyridoxal phosphate 3atransamination 3aenzyme activity 3aaspartate transaminase 2aAnimals 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aChickens 2aDiet 2aErythrocytesxenzymology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aPyridoxal Phosphatexpharmacology 2aVitamin B 6 Deficiencyxenzymologyxetiology.1 aVuilleumier, J.P.1 aWeiser, H.0 tAnnals of nutrition and metabolism.g1991, v. 35, no. 1 p.25-33x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02335naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245010800142300001600250520089700266650000901163650000901172650001301181650002501194650000901219650002201228650001201250650002101262650003701283650002701320650003601347650003501383650001501418650000901433650002101442650001001463650002801473650006301501650003901564650002201603650002401625653001001649700001501659700001401674773008801688852000901776939003301785946001101818655001201829IND9005695420221120132643.0901119e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900569542DNAL7 a22447512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSable, R.10aSteroid pattern of bile and feces in response to a fruit-enriched diet in hypercholesterolemic hamsters  ap. 303-310.  aThe effect of a fruit (apple)-enriched diet on bile secretion and on fecal steroid excretion was studied in two strains of hamster: normal hamsters with normal cholesterolemia and spontaneous hypercholesterolemic hamsters with high-level hepatic cholesterol esters (FEC hamsters). Quantitative and qualitative alterations in the steroid composition in bile and feces were accompanied by changes in intestinal morphology. The fruit diet displayed a choleretic effect and increased the output of bile acids from liver in FEC hamsters. In addition, bile collected continuously from cannulated apple-fed animals was enriched with conjugates of cholic acid. Moreover, apple consumption lowered the lithogenic index of the bile. In response to the fruit diet, fecal excretion of bile acids and neutral sterols increased essentially in the form of primary bile acids and sterol esters, respectively. 3adiet 3abile 3asteroids 3ahypercholesterolemia 3arats 3afeces composition 2aAnimals 2aBilexmetabolism 2aBile Acids and Saltsxmetabolism 2aBile Ductsxmetabolism 2aCholesterolxbloodxmetabolism. 2aCholesterol Estersxmetabolism 2aCricetinae 2aDiet 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFruit 2aGallbladderxmetabolism 2aHypercholesterolemiaxdiet therapyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aIntestinesxmetabolismxpathology. 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aSterolsxmetabolism 0afruit1 aSicart, R.1 aBerry, E.0 tAnnals of nutrition and metabolism.g1990 , v. 34, no. 5 p.303-310x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02444naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008000127300001400207500002300221520142500244650003201669650002101701650002301722650002001745650002001765650001501785650002001800651001801820653001301838653002001851700001401871700001701885773010201902852000902004930003302013945001302046946001102059655001202070IND2052589520221120122828.0960813e199604  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205258952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKell, C.J.10aEstablishing partnerships to enhance the preventive practices of dietitians  ap. 12-17.  aSummary in French.  aMembers of the New Brunswick Association of Dietitians (NBAD) formed a partnership with the New Brunswick Heart Health Program in 1992 to enhance the health promotion practices of dietitians in New Brunswick. The first step in this process was to collect baseline data on the continuing education needs of dietitians in relation to health promotion and preventive practice. The methods used to collect this data consisted of a mail-out survey and focus group sessions. Using an adaptation of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, a 52-item survey was designed by NBAD members to examine the predisposing enabling and reinforcing factors that influence dietitians' health promoting behaviours. In May 1993 70% of be membership responded to the survey IN=1421 and approximately 70 dietitians were able to attend the regional focus group sessions. Results suggest that enabling factors such as skills training in behaviour change theory and outcome evaluation are required. The findings also suggest the need for dietitians to strengthen their ties with representatives from be community and private sector. These result have implications on the design of future continuing education activities which emphasize health promotion and partnership building. Continuing education targeting these issues will facilitate the advancement of the dietetic profession as the healthcare system shifts toward community health and health promotion. 3afood and nutrition programs 3ahealth promotion 3adisease prevention 3adietary surveys 3aadult education 3adietitians 3abehavior change 3aNew Brunswick 0atraining 0ainterest groups1 aChase, C.1 aBalram, B.C.0 tJournal of the Canadian Dietetic Association.g1996 Spring, v. 57, no. 1 p.12-17x0008-33997nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02846naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001400172245010800186300001600294500001500310520124300325650002201568650001301590650002501603650002101628650003401649650002301683650001301706650001501719650001001734650001301744650001001757650002201767650000901789650001301798650001101811650001101822650000901833650001601842650002201858651001301880653002101893653001301914653002301927653003101950653002001981700002002001773007502021852000902096856009402105939003302199946001302232990002302245655001202268IND8904524620221120122932.0890821e198806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890452462DNAL7 a33836802pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1988.tb03232.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGnepp, J.10aChildren's use of personality attributions to predict other people's emotional and behavioral reactions  ap. 743-754.  a2019-12-04  aGnepp, Jackie, and Chilamkurti, Chinni, Children's Use of Personality Attributions to Predict Other People's Emotional and Behavioral Reactions. Child Development, 1988, 59, 743-754. This study examines children's abilities to take other people's personality traits into account when predicting their future emotional and behavioral reactions to events. Kindergarten, second-grade, fourth-grade, and college students listened to a series of stories. Each story described 3 examples of a child's past behavior from which a personality trait could be inferred. Subjects were asked to predict and explain the story character's behavioral or emotional reaction to a new event. Their responses were compared to those of subjects who were not given any information about the protagonist's past behavior, and to those subjectswho received prompts. There was an increase with age in the use of personality attributions to predict and explain future reactions. Subjects were more influenced by the trait information when predicting behavior than when predicting emotion. Understanding emotion may be more difficult in that it requires a conceptualization of personality traits as implying thoughts and feelings, as well as behavioral dispositions. 3ayouth development 3aemotions 3apsychosocial factors 3acollege students 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3apreschool children 3abehavior 3aprediction 2aAdult 2aBehavior 2aChild 2aChild Development 2aCues 2aEmotions 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPersonality 2aSocial Perception 3aIllinois 0asocial cognition 0achildren 0apersonality traits 0aindividual characteristics 0aage differences1 aChilamkurti, C.0 tChild development.g1988 June, v. 59, no. 3 p.743-754x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1988.tb03232.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01574naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012700126300001600253520081300269650001301082650002501095650001901120700001601139773008501155852000901240930003301249945001301282946001301295655001201308IND2137977420221120122924.0980804e199702  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213797742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByers, J.R.10aIdentification of sex pheromones of Leucania anteoclara Sm. and Leucania commoides Gn.

The youngsters were then contrasted along 4 sets of outcomes; psychosocial development, school achievement, internalized distress, and problem behavior. Results indicate that adolescents who characterize their parents as authoritative score highest on measures of psychosocial competence and lowest on measures of psychological and behavioral dysfunction; the reverse is true for adolescents who describe their parents as neglectful. Adolescents whose parents are characterized as authoritarian score reasonably well on measures indexing obedience and conformity to the standards of adults but have relatively poorer self-conceptions than other youngsters. In contrast, adolescents from indulgent homes evidence a strong sense of self confidence but report a higher frequency of substance abuse and school misconduct and are less engaged in school. The results provide support for Maccoby and Martin's framework and indicate the need to distinguish between two types of "permissive" families: those that are indulgent and those that are neglectful. 3ayouth development 3aHispanics 3aAsians 3afamily structure 3aparents 3apsychological stress 3agender differences 3aacademic achievement 3asocioeconomic status 3abehavior problems 3aWhites 3aadolescents 3aBlacks 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3asocial adjustment 3aparenting 2aAchievement 2aAdolescent 2aAuthoritarianism 2aChild Abusexpsychology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInternal-External Control 2aMale 2aParent-Child Relations 2aPersonality Development 2aSocial Adjustment 2aSocial Behavior 2aSocialization 3aCalifornia 3aWisconsin 0aparenting style 0aparental academic attainment 0anationalities and ethnic groups 0afamily relations1 aMounts, N.S.1 aSteinberg, L.1 aDornbusch, S.M.0 tChild development.g1991 Oct., v. 62, no. 5 p.1049-1065x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1991.tb01588.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02556naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001600159245013000175300001600305500002400321500001500345520123200360650001101592650001601603650001601619650001001635650001201645650001501657650001101672650001201683653001401695653001201709653001101721700001401732773018001746852000901926856008001935856004802015930003302063945001302096946001302109655001202122IND2328828720221120111704.0020905e200203  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232882872DNAL7 a216656402pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.89.3.4412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshii, H.S.10aTemporal variation in floral display size and individual floral sex allocation in racemes of Narthecium asiaticum (Liliaceae)  ap. 441-446.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe analyzed the effects of temporal variation in floral display size (number of flowers open at one time on a plant) on the rate of pollen removed and receipt of individual flowers for the sequential blooming plant Narthecium asiaticum (Liliaceae). Because of the acropetal blooming of this species, the display sizes when upper flowers opened was much greater than the display sizes when lower flowers opened. Our experiments revealed that large displays lead to a high rate of pollen removal from individual flowers, though they do not lead to a high rate of ovule fertilization. Consequently, the rate of pollen grains removed per flower by pollinators was greater in upper flowers than in lower flowers. The pattern of sex allocation in individual flowers within a raceme was consistent with such variation. Namely, both maleness [stamen mass/(stamen mass + pistil mass)] and pollen:ovule ratio were larger in upper flowers. We suggest that the temporal variation in display size, in addition to such factors as dichogamy and pollinator directionality, also produces variation in the probability of successful pollen transfer from individual flowers that may cause the variation in the sex allocation of individual flowers. 3aovules 3apollination 3apollinators 3amales 3aflowers 3aNarthecium 3apollen 3afemales 0agynoecium 0astamens 0aratios1 aSakai, S.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2002 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.441-446dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.89.3.4413Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03626naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012600126300001600252500001500268520237900283650000802662650001002670650001602680650001502696650002302711650002402734650001702758650001102775650001102786650001102797650001902808650001302827651001602840651001402856653001702870653002102887653003602908700002302944700001602967700001902983773008803002852000903090930003303099945001303132946001103145655001203156IND2321045520221120101452.0010516e200009  sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232104552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerkman, A.12aA comparison between composition and density of the fat-free mass of young adult Singaporean Chinese and Dutch Caucasians  ap. 235-242.  a2019-12-05  aBackground: The body composition was measured in 30 female Singapore Chinese and 34 female Dutch Caucasians aged (mean +/- SD) 22.7 +/- 3.6 years and in 39 male Singapore Chinese and 39 male Dutch Caucasians aged 23.3 +/- 3.2 years. Methods: The body fat percentage (BF%) was measured using densitometry and deuterium oxide dilution as well as a chemical four-compartment model, including fat mass, water, mineral, and protein. The chemical composition of the fat-free mass (FFM) and its density were calculated. Results: Mean body mass index (kg/m2) and BF% based on the four-compartment model in the four subgroups were 20.3 +/- 1.5 and 29.7 +/- 5.3 for the Singapore Chinese females, 22.1 +/- 1.2 and 28.9 +/- 5.2 for the Dutch females, 21.5 +/- 2.5 and 19.4 +/- 6.1 for the Singapore males, and 22.2 +/- 1.8 and 15.8 +/- 4.9 for the Dutch males. The contributions to the FFM of water, protein, and mineral were, respectively, 72.8 +/- 1.5, 19.2 +/- 1.8, and 7.9 +/- 0.8% for the Singaporean females and 74.2 +/- 1.4, 18.3 +/- 1.5, and 7.6 +/- 0.5% for the Dutch females. In males these figures were 73.2 +/- 1.7, 19.6 +/- 1.7, and 7.3 +/- 0.5% for the Singaporeans and 72.9 +/- 1.4, 20.5 +/- 1.4, and 6.6 +/- 0.5% for the Dutch. In females, these figures were for all components significantly different between the ethnic groups; in males the differences were significant for protein and mineral only. The calculated densities (kg/l) of the FFM were 1.1074 +/- 0.0057, 1.1012 +/- 0.0051, 1.1027 +/- 0.0065, and 1.1004 +/- 0.0055 for the Chinese females, Caucasian females, Chinese males, and Caucasian males, respectively. Conclusions: Although it cannot be excluded that the differences in density and composition of the FFM are due to methodological differences between the study sites, the findings may have consequences for the validity of single (reference) methods due to violation of normally used assumptions. The findings explain the observed underestimation of BF% from density using Siri's formula in the Chinese subjects, especially in females. The use of deuterium oxide as a single method to determine the BF% resulted in a smaller bias than densitometry (overall 1.6 +/- 2.0% for densitometry, 0.3 +/- 1.7% for deuterium dilution), suggesting that the deuterium oxide method may be more suitable as a single method in comparative body composition studies. 3amen 3awomen 3abody weight 3abody water 3agender differences 3abone mineralization 3ayoung adults 3aheight 3aWhites 3aAsians 3alean body mass 3abody fat 3aNetherlands 3aSingapore 0abody density 0abody composition 0anationalities and ethnic groups1 aDeurenberg-Yap, M.1 aSchmidt, G.1 aDeurenberg, P.0 tAnnals of nutrition & metabolism.g2000 , v. 44, no. 5/6 p.235-242x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03467naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111024003300141040001800174100001900192245012000211300001600331500002400347500001500371506002800386506003000414520166500444596004402109596004502153506003702198650001802235650001902253650002002272650002002292650001602312650001902328650003102347650001802378650002602396650001802422653001602440700001902456700001802475700001602493773019802509852000902707856008002716856004802796903002202844930003302866945001302899946001302912655001202925IND2328827720221207085700.0020905e200203  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232882772DNAL7 a216656352pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.89.3.4012doi7 a10.3732/ajb.89.3.4012chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnston, M.K.10aSlow heating of barley aleurone layers to heat-shock temperature preserves heat-shock-sensitive cellular properties  ap. 401-409.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aIn barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Himalaya) aleurone layers, heat shock causes the selective suppression of alpha-amylase synthesis by destabilizing this secretory protein's mRNA. The lamellar stacks of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which serve as the site of alpha-amylase mRNA translation, are dissociated by heat shock, suggesting that heat-shock-induced changes in ER may be important in selectively targeting alpha-amylase mRNAs for destabilization. We have found that samples maintained at heat-shock temperature (40 degrees C) for 18 h recover the ability to synthesize alpha-amylase and that the ER membranes in these samples contain membrane phospholipids with enhanced levels of fatty acid saturation. This present study investigated whether gradual warming to 40 degrees C over 3-6 h (ramping) would preserve alpha-amylase synthesis by permitting ER membrane phospholipid retailoring during the gradual temperature increase. Analyses by sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that alpha-amylase synthesis was markedly increased in ramped samples. Furthermore, northern hybridization analyses and transmission electron microscopy showed that these samples had increased alpha-amylase mRNA levels and stacks of ER lamellae, respectively. Gas chromatographic analyses of ER membrane phospholipids indicated that the fatty acids of ramped samples were more saturated than their heat-shocked counterparts. These data indicate that heat-induced increases in aleurone ER membrane phospholipid fatty acid saturation may be important in maintaining secretory protein expression at normally nonpermissive heat-shock temperatures.  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3aheat stability 3aHordeum vulgare 3aair temperature 3aheat stress 3aaleurone layer 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aalpha-amylase 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aphospholipids 0atemperature1 aBenson, P.A.S.1 aRodgers, T.M.1 aBrodl, M.R.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2002 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.401-409dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic GardenswJournal:jnl35737x0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.89.3.4013Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  aVersion of Record  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03267naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009400131300001600225500015100241520171800392650002002110650001902130650000802149650001902157650001002176650003402186650002302220650001202243650002302255650001102278650002602289650002102315650001102336650001502347650002302362650002502385650001002410650001602420700002402436700001702460700001302477700001602490700001602506700002002522700001402542773014502556856005102701852000902752655001202761IND4511367420221120071127.0150519e20150218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451136742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro-Rico, J.10aQuality changes of Chinese jujube from deficit irrigation stored in controlled atmosphere  ap. 503-509.  aPaper presented at the XI International Controlled and Modified Atmosphere Research Conference â CaMa2013, held June 3-7, 2013, Trani (Italy)  aThe severe drought in the southeast Spanish Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems, has led to the implementation of deficit irrigation strategies (DI). In this work the effect of combined DI and controlled atmosphere (CA) storage on the quality parameters and shelf-life of Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujube) was studied. Three different irrigation treatments were applied during the fruit production: control (T0), trees watered at 112.34% of crop evapotranspiration (ET0), half irrigation (T1), trees irrigated at 64.19 % of ET0, and no irrigation (T2), were no irrigation was applied. Harvested fruit were stored for 37 days at 5Â°C and 90% RH under 5 kPa O2 + 10 kPa CO2 followed by a simulated retail sale period of 5 days at 15Â°C in air. At the end of CA storage and shelf-life period, the soluble solids content (SSC), pH, titratable acidity (TA), color parameters, size, weight loss and decay development were determined. As expected, the T2 fruits at harvest showed the smallest size. After CA storage T2 fruits showed the highest SSC and TA levels. After retail sale no noticeable differences in color among treatments were found. As main conclusion, T2 fruits showed the best overall quality and the lowest weight loss and decay (about 5%) after both CA storage and shelf-life while saving 2128.4 m3 ha-1 compared to the ones that received regular irrigation. However, the size of these fruits was lower than in control. As far as we know, the combined effects of DI and CA on quality parameters of jujube fruits are first reported here. However, more research should be conducted in order to optimize the overall Chinese jujube quality, while saving great irrigation water amounts at the same time. 3aZiziphus jujuba 3aagroecosystems 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acolor 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3afruits 3airrigation management 3airrigation water 3aoxygen 3ashelf life 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3atrees 3aweight loss1 aArtes-Hernandez, F.1 aGomez, P.

However, the direct role of edges in regulating forest regeneration is relatively unknown. The pattern of tree establishment across a forest-old field edge was experimentally examined to determine the response of three tree species to the edge gradient. We placed 100 1-m2 plots in a 90 x 90 m grid that began 30 m inside the forest, extended across the edge, and ended at 60 m into the old field. Into each plot, we planted seeds of Acer rubrum, Acer saccharum, and Quercus palustris. Emergence increased with distance into the field for both A. saccharum and Q. palustris. Emergence for A. rubrum increased from forest to field, reaching a maximum near 20 m into the field, and then declined with further distance. Nearly all A. rubrum seedlings died shortly after emergence. Survival of A. saccharum increased with distance into the old field, while survivorship of Q. palustris did not respond to the edge gradient. Establishment probabilities increased with distance into the old field for both A. saccharum and Q. palustris. Growth of Q. palustris and allocation patterns of A. saccharum also varied across the edge gradient. These results suggest that edges have complex, species-specific effects on tree establishment and growth that can influence the spatial pattern and species composition of regenerating forests. 3ainterspecific variation 3aecotones 3aseedlings 3amicroclimate 3abotanical composition 3amortality 3aQuercus palustris 3anatural regeneration 3aAcer saccharum 3astand structure 3aforests 3aNew Jersey 0aspecies differences 0arecruitment 0aestablishment 0aplant communities 0aold fields 0aforest borders1 aPickett, S.T.A.1 aHandel, S.N.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2002 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.466-471dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.89.3.4663Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02069naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245006800143300001600211500001500227520057300242650002800815650001400843650001500857650002200872650003600894650002300930650006600953650003601019650002401055650003901079650004601118650001301164651002301177651001601200653002401216700001701240700001601257700001401273700001301287700001301300700001601313700001301329700001501342700001701357700001501374773007201389852000901461930003301470945001301503946001101516655001201527IND2322227520221120060036.0010726e200107  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232222752DNAL7 a113974392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsano, N.10aDihydroxynortropane alkaloids from calystegine-producing plants  ap. 721-726.  a2019-12-05  aThree dihydroxynortropanes, 2alpha,7beta-dihydroxynortropane, 2alpha,3beta-dihydroxynortropane, and 3alpha,7beta-dihydroxynortropane, were isolated from calystegine-producing plants in the families Convolvulaceae and Solanaceae. 2alpha,7beta-Dihydroxynortropane was isolated from six species in the Convolvulaceae whereas only Calystegia soldanella contained it and 2alpha,3beta-dihydroxynortropane.

Maize juvenile leaves are coated with epicuticular wax, lack specialized cells, such as trichomes and bulliform cells, and epidermal cell walls stain a uniform purple color. Adult maize leaves are pubescent, lack epicuticular waxes, and have crenulated epidermal cell walls that stain purple and blue. All bluegrass and rice blades are pubescent, coated with epicuticular waxes, and show purple and blue wall staining. In all three grasses, blade width steadily increases at each node until a threshold size is achieved several nodes before reproductive competence is acquired. Blade-to-sheath length showed a similar trend of continuous change followed by discontinuous change prior to reproduction. Analysis of leaf development demonstrated that maize primordia initiate more rapidly relative to blade and sheath growth than do either bluegrass or rice. We conclude that leaf shape, as defined by blade width and blade-to-sheath ratio, is a reliable indicator of phase, whereas anatomy is not a universal indicator of phase change in the grasses. We speculate that different growth patterns among these grasses may be attributed to changes in the timing of embryonic and postembryonic development. 3aPoa pratensis 3ainterspecific variation 3aZea mays 3aOryza sativa 3adevelopmental stages 3acell walls 3atrichomes 3aplant cuticle 3awidth 3ashape 3aplant morphology 3aleaf primordia 3awaxes 0aspecies differences 0aplant anatomy 0aleaf sheaths 0aleaves1 aParker-Clark, V.1 aMurray, G.A.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2001 Dec., v. 88, no. 12 p.2157-2167dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02879naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001200128245010400140300001400244520123700258650000901495650002601504650001301530650001201543650001701555650002101572650002501593650001601618650001601634650000901650650002501659650001201684650002101696650002201717650004201739650003201781650003801813650002801851650002101879650001801900650002201918650000901940650002601949650003401975650003502009650001502044650000902059650002502068650002402093700001702117700001702134773008502151852000902236939003302245946001102278655001202289IND9102332220221120034535.0910524s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910233222DNAL7 a16477472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIde, T.10aHypolipidemic effects of guar gum and its enzyme hydrolysate in rats fed highly saturated fat diets  ap. 34-44.  aThe effects of guar gum and its enzyme hydrolysate as well as fructooligosaccharide on lipid metabolism were compared in rats fed high-fat diets employing lard or palm oil as dietary fat (25% in the diets). Guar gum and the enzyme hydrolysate greatly increased cecal volatile fatty acid contents to a similar extent. Fructooligosaccharide also increased the variable but to a lesser extent. Not only guar gum but also the hydrolysate and the oligosaccharide reduced serum cholesterol levels irrespective of dietary fat sources but to a lesser extent. The triglyceride-lowering effects of the hydrolysate and the oligosaccharide were comparable to that of guar gum. Although guar gum enzyme hydrolysate and fructooligosaccharide doubled the biliary bile acid excretion, these materials only slightly increased the activities of hepatic enzymes of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis. Guar gum and its hydrolysate suppressed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activities in the ileum to one half the control value in the experiment where dietary fat was lard. The highly polymeric structure does not appear to be a prerequisite for nonabsorbable carbohydrate to alter lipid metabolism at least in rats fed high-fat diets. 3adiet 3asaturated fatty acids 3aguar gum 3aenzymes 3ahydrolysates 3alipid metabolism 3avolatile fatty acids 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3arats 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBilexmetabolism 2aCecumxmetabolism 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fiberxpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aGalactansxpharmacology 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLipidsxblood 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMannansxpharmacology 2aMicrosomes, Liverxenzymology 2aOligosaccharidesxpharmacology 2aPlant Gums 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aalpha-Galactosidase1 aMoriuchi, H.1 aNihimoto, K.0 tAnnals of nutrition and metabolism.g1991, v. 35, no. 1 p.34-44x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02901naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245014200146300001400288520137600302650000901678650002501687650001801712650001701730650001601747650002201763650001501785650000901800650001601809650001201825650003301837650005001870650002001920650004601940650001101986650003201997650002502029650005402054650002502108650000902133650002502142700001802167700002102185700002002206700001802226773008602244852000902330939003302339946001102372655001202383IND9104604620221120034634.0911118e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910460462DNAL7 a18725972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzzolin, I.R.10aEffect of protein malnutrition on glycoprotein, protein and lipid synthesis in the rat cerebellum during the period of brain growth spurt  ap. 82-88.  aFemale Wistar rats were fed a normal-protein diet (25% casein) or a low-protein diet (8% casein) during pregnancy and lactation. The two diets were isocaloric and contained appropriate amounts of mineral salts and vitamins. Pups from dams submitted to the low-protein diet had a lower body weight than normally fed controls as early as on the day of birth, but a difference in cerebellar weight between the two groups was observed only on the 15th postnatal day. Malnutrition had no effect on cerebellar protein concentration, which increased with age in both groups. The cerebellar DNA concentration was higher at 7 and 15 days of age in normally fed rats than in malnourished rats, whereas at 21 days of age it was higher in the malnourished animals. [U-14C]Leucine and [2-3H]mannose incorporation into proteins and lipid synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) derived from [U-14C]leucine markedly decreased with age in the cerebellum of rats fed both diets. [2-3H]Mannose incorporation into cerebellar glycoproteins was greater in malnourished rats during the period of brain growth spurt than in normally fed rats at all ages studied. Prenatal and postnatal protein malnutrition had no effect on [U-14C]leucine incorporation into cerebellar proteins or on cerebellar lipid synthesis from acetyl-CoA derived from [U-14C]leucine during the period of brain growth spurt. 3adiet 3aprotein deficiencies 3aglycoproteins 3abiosynthesis 3alipogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3acerebellum 3arats 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxmetabolism 2aCerebellumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aGlycoproteinsxbiosynthesis 2aLipidsxbiosynthesis 2aNutrition Disordersxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains1 aBernard, E.A.1 aTrindade, V.M.T.1 aGamallo, J.L.G.1 aPerry, M.L.S.0 tAnnals of nutrition and metabolism.g1991 , v. 35, no. 2 p.82-88x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02688naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245010100149300001800250500002400268520133300292650001701625650001001642650002301652650002401675650001101699650002801710650001601738650001101754650001701765650001201782650001701794650001401811650001401825653001601839653001101855700001801866700002301884700001201907773018301919852000902102856004802111930003302159945001302192946001302205655001202218IND2328863720221123042115.0020910e200112  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232886372DNAL7 a216696542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrison-Pige, L.10aCarbon allocation to volatiles and other reproductive components in male Ficus carica (Moraceae)  ap. 2214-2220.  aIncludes references  aVolatile compounds are often mediators of plant-pollinator interactions. Their emission is presumed to be costly, but this cost has seldom been quantified. Figs of Ficus carica (a dioecious species) release volatile compounds when receptive, thus attracting the agaonid wasp Blastophaga psenes. In dioecious fig species, wasps lay eggs inside male figs and pollinate female ones. For a male tree, we estimated carbon allocation to reproduction using the annual growth module (AGM) as the unit of measurement. Over the growing season, leaf and fig carbon exchange and construction costs were measured, as well as carbon investment in stamens, provisioning pollinators, and biosynthesis and release of volatile compounds. Representativity of the tree studied was evaluated by measuring some of these parameters on seven other male fig trees. The results show that 7.6-16.4% of the carbon assimilated by leaves and figs was invested in reproduction. Of the carbon invested in reproduction, pollinator attraction and feeding represented only 0.08-0.12% and 1.84-2.33%, respectively, while pollinator sheltering (fig construction and respiration) represented 97.6-98.0%. In this strict and coevolved plant-pollinator association, the main male reproductive investment was thus in the structures sheltering the associated pollinators. 3aFicus carica 3amales 3avolatile compounds 3asexual reproduction 3acarbon 3adry matter partitioning 3apollinators 3adioecy 3agas exchange 3astamens 3abiosynthesis 3amutualism 3aemissions 0arespiration 0afruits1 aSalager, J.L.1 aHossaert-McKey, M.1 aRoy, J.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2001 Dec., v. 88, no. 12 p.2214-2220dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03882naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245010000146300001800246500002400264500001500288520258200303650002302885650002302908650001402931650002202945650001402967650001202981650002102993650001103014650002103025651001203046653001903058653001203077653001503089653001603104700001703120773018303137852000903320856004803329930003303377945001303410946001303423655001203436IND2328863620221123042101.0020910e200112  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232886362DNAL7 a216696532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhardwaj, M.10aFunctional analysis of synchronous dichogamy in flowering rush, Butomus umbellatus (Butomaceae)  ap. 2204-2213.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDichogamy is one of the most widespread floral mechanisms in flowering plants and is thought to have evolved to reduce interference between pollen import and export within flowers, especially self-pollination. Self-pollination between flowers may also be reduced if dichogamy is synchronous among flowers on an inflorescence. The analysis of dichogamy at both levels requires that the sexual phases of individual flowers be defined functionally in terms of pollen deposition and removal. We conducted morphological and functional analyses to investigate the degree of dichogamy within flowers and the synchronicity of dichogamy between flowers within inflorescences in an emergent, aquatic monocot, flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus). Based on daily observations of the development of marked flowers, data on the schedule of anther dehiscence within flowers, and repeat surveys of floral sex ratios in three populations, individual flowers appear to be strictly protandrous. On average, each flower spends approximately 1 d in each of male and female phases with an intervening 1-d neuter phase during which there is no available pollen in anthers and stigmas are not yet exposed to receive pollen. Morphological criteria used to delimit the beginning and end of each of these three sex phases were validated by quantifying the temporal schedule of pollen removal from anthers and pollen deposition on stigmas. Experimental pollinations showed that the morphological changes marking the end of female phase are hastened by pollen deposition. At the umbel level, synchronous development within sequential cohorts of flowers reduced overlap of male and female sexual phases between flowers. On average (+/- 1 SE), 72 +/- 3% of flowers completed their female phase while no other flowers on the same umbel were in male phase. Computer simulations of umbel development showed that this value is significantly higher than expected if the timing of flower development within umbels was random (30 +/- 1%). Surveys of floral sex ratios in three populations revealed that 87% of umbels were either unisexual male or female at any given time. Pollinators usually visited more than one flower in sequence when foraging on umbels, suggesting that synchronous dichogamy may be an adaptation to avoid geitonogamy. The adaptiveness of both flower- and umbel-level dichogamy is also suggested because both traits are expressed to a lesser extent in obligately clonal, triploid populations, where flowers do not make seeds and hence floral adaptations are not maintained by natural selection. 3atemporal variation 3aButomus umbellatus 3aflowering 3asimulation models 3asex ratio 3aflowers 3aplant morphology 3apollen 3aself-pollination 3aOntario 0ainflorescences 0aanthers 0aadaptation 0apollination1 aEckert, C.G.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2001 Dec., v. 88, no. 12 p.2204-2213dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02132naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245006600148300001600214520093800230650002501168650001201193650001801205650001001223650001101233650001001244650002301254650002501277650001001302650001201312650001601324650001301340650001201353650001101365650001401376650003801390650001701428650001301445650002001458700001601478700001901494773007101513852000901584930003301593945001301626946001101639655001201650IND2322180220221123042039.0010724e200105  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232218022DNAL7 a113362522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashotte, A.M.10aCuticular waxes on eceriferum mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 115-123.  aWe present cuticular wax chemical profiles for the leaves and stems of Arabidopsis wildtype Landsberg erecta and eleven isogenic eceriferum mutants: cer5, cer10 to cer15, and cer17 to cer20. These cer mutants have wax profiles that are different from those of wildtype in chemical chain length distribution, amount per chemical class, and/or total wax load. Analyses of detailed leaf and stem wax profiles for these cer mutants have allowed us to place some of these mutants at specific steps in wax production. The cer13 gene is predicted to affect release of the 30 carbon fatty acid from the elongation complex or the reduction of C30 fatty acid to C30 aldehyde. The CER19 gene product is predicted to be involved in C28 to C30 fatty acyl-CoA elongation. The CER20 gene is predicted to affect the oxidation of C29 alkane to C29 secondary alcohol. Several predicted gene products affect only stem specific steps in the wax pathway. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3aplant cuticle 3awaxes 3aleaves 3astems 3achemical structure 3abiochemical pathways 3agenes 3aalkanes 3afatty acids 3aalcohols 3aketones 3aesters 3aaldehydes 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, Plant 2aMutation 2aWaxesxanalysis1 aJenks, M.A.1 aFeldmann, K.A.0 tPhytochemistry.g2001 May, v. 57, no. 1 p.115-123x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02284naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245012200169300001600291500001500307520109200322650002201414650001501436650002501451650002301476650003401499651001101533653001601544653001901560653001301579653002001592653001401612653001301626773007501639852000901714856009401723930003301817946001301850990002301863655001201886IND8905226720221123042056.0890921e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890522672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1989.tb02737.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, R.10aInterest in the task and interest in peers' work in a competitive and noncompetitive condition: a developmental study  ap. 562-570.  a2019-12-04  aThis study tested the hypothesis that focusing attention on relative performance will promote ego involvement and undermine intrinsic motivation in school-age children but not in preschoolers who do not have a normative conception of ability. Children at ages 4-5, 7-8, and 9-10 made pictures from stickers in either a competitive or a noncompetitive condition. As expected, among fourth graders, competition enhanced interest in peers' work, measured during the manipulation, and reduced subsequent interest in the task during a free-play period 4 days later, relative to the noncompetitive condition. Similar, but weaker, trends were obtained at first grade. Among preschool children, the competitive focus did not affect interest in peers' work and slightly enchanced subsequent intrinsic motivation. The correlation between interest in peers' work and subsequent task interest was negative for older children but positive for preschoolers. The results are discussed in terms of the light they shed on developmental shifts in ego involvement and in the functions of social comparison. 3ayouth development 3amotivation 3aacademic achievement 3apreschool children 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3aIsrael 0acompetition 0apeer influence 0achildren 0aage differences 0aeducation 0abehavior0 tChild development.g1989 June, v. 60, no. 3 p.562-570x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1989.tb02737.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19950320b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02698naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001800172245008700190300001400277500001500291520119300306650002201499650003101521650002701552650001301579650002201592650003401614650001801648650001001666650001101676650001801687650002101705650001101726650001101737650001101748650000901759650002201768650002701790650001801817653001201835653001101847653001401858700001801872700002101890773007301911852000901984856009401993939003302087946001302120990002302133655001202156IND8905296220221123042005.0890926e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890529622DNAL7 a27028742pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1989.tb02694.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKochanska, G.10aCorrespondence between mothers' self-reported and observed child-rearing practices  ap. 56-63.  a2019-12-04  aThe correspondence between self-reported child-rearing attitudes and practices and actual child management was examined among 68 mothers of young children. Data on mothers' verbal and physical control techniques along with children's responses (cooperation vs. resistance) were obtained during 90 min of spontaneous interaction in a naturalistic setting. Self-report data (the Block Q-Sort) were obtained 1-2 weeks later. The Block Q-Sort factors were combined to represent authoritarian and authoritative patterns of attitudes. The authoritarian pattern was positively associated with the use of direct commands, physical enforcements, reprimands, and prohibitive interventions, and negatively associated with the use of suggestions. The authoritative pattern was positively related to the use of suggestions and positive incentives, and negatively related to the use of physical enforcements, prohibitive interventions, and direct commands. Mothers' enjoyment of the parental role and their negative affect toward the child, as expressed in the Block Q-Sort, were more a result of the child's cooperation/resistance during the interaction than predictors of maternal control strategies. 3ayouth development 3aparent-child relationships 3aattitudes and opinions 3aemotions 3amaternal behavior 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3aparental role 2aAdult 2aAffect 2aChild Rearing 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMaternal Behavior 2aMother-Child Relations 2aSocial Values 0abeliefs 0avalues 0aparenting1 aKuczynski, L.1 aRadke-Yarrow, M.0 tChild development.g1989 Feb., v. 60, no. 1 p.56-63x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1989.tb02694.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01667naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245009200142300001600234500001500250520031400265650002100579650002100600650002000621650004400641650003600685650002000721650001900741650001400760650002200774650001300796650002400809650002300833650002600856650002400882650005700906650002200963653001400985700001500999700001701014700001701031773007101048852000901119930003301128945001301161946001101174655001201185IND2322180020221123042000.0010724e200105  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232218002DNAL7 a113362512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoto, Y.10aAllelopathic sesquiterpenoids from rhizomes of Petasites japonicus ssp. giganteus Kitam  ap. 109-113.  a2019-12-05  aFour sesquiterpenoids were isolated from Petasites japonicus (Siebold and Zucc.)

Compared to nonaggressive children, aggressive children placed more value on achieving control of the victim and placed less value on suffering by the victim, retaliation from the victim, peer rejection, and negative self-evaluation. Boys differed from girls in the same ways that aggressive children differed from nonaggressive children. Results indicate that outcome values, which should be distinguished from outcome expectancies, make a unique contribution to the prediction of aggression. 3ayouth development 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3aaggression 3achildren 3agender differences 3aUnited States 0avalues1 aPerry, D.G.1 aPerry, L.C.0 tChild development.g1989 June, v. 60, no. 3 p.571-579x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1989.tb02738.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19950320b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02406naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100002300172245006700195300001300262500001500275520062200290650002200912650003100934650002000965650003200985650001201017650001601029650001701045650002001062650002301082650002501105650001301130650003401143650002201177650001301199650003001212650001001242650004101252650001201293650001101305650001101316650002301327650002801350651001301378653002001391653001901411653002101430653001601451653003101467653002301498653001501521773007201536852000901608856009401617939003301711946001301744990002301757655001201780IND8905295820221123031837.0890926e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890529582DNAL7 a26493202pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-8624.1989.tb02690.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHetherington, E.M.10aCoping with family transitions: winners, losers, and survivors  ap. 1-14.  a2019-12-04  aThis article presents the results of a longitudinal study of the effects of divorce and remarriage on children's adjustment.

Although boys in divorced families and children in remarried families showed more problems in adjustment than did children in nondivorced families, some also showed remarkable resiliency in the face of multiple life stressors. 3ayouth development 3aparent-child relationships 3afamily problems 3ainterpersonal relationships 3adivorce 3atemperament 3agrandparents 3asupport systems 3agender differences 3alongitudinal studies 3achildren 3a4-H Youth Development Program 3asocial adjustment 3asiblings 2aAdaptation, Psychological 2aChild 2aChild Reactive Disordersxpsychology 2aDivorce 2aFamily 2aHumans 2aLife Change Events 2aPersonality Development 3aVirginia 0aage differences 0asocial support 0afamily relations 0apersonality 0aindividual characteristics 0apeer relationships 0aremarriage0 tChild development.g1989 Feb., v. 60, no. 1 p.1-14x0009-39207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1989.tb02690.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02732naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245009600143300001600239500001500255520127500270650002801545650001201573650003101585650001501616650001301631650001501644650003601659650001101695650002701706650001801733650001101751650002601762650003601788650002301824650003501847651001001882653002401892653001401916653000901930653001101939653001601950700001701966700001401983700001601997700001402013700001302027773007202040852000902112930003302121945001302154946001102167655001202178IND2322229620221123031935.0010726e200107  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232222962DNAL7 a113974422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, K.10a3',5'-Di-C-beta-glucopyranosylphloretin, a flavonoid characteristic of the genus Fortunella  ap. 737-742.  a2019-12-05  aDihydrochalcone derivative, 3',5'-di-C-beta-glucopyranosylphloretin (1), is present in the genus Fortunella, (F. crassifolia, F. japonica, F. margarita, F. polyandra and F. hindsii). These species accumulate a large quantity of 1 in their fruits (peel, 6.5-15.2 mg/g in dry wt; juice sac, 1.5-10.5 mg/g) and in their leaves (21.3-60.2 mg/g). Twenty-seven Tanaka's Citrus species examined lack 1, but C. madurensis and C. halimii contain 1 in large quantities in their peels (25.1 and 33.6 mg/g) and juice sacs (4.1 and 4.2 mg/g). Poncirus species do not contain 1. Fortunella-citrus hybrids, the Orangequat [C. unshiu x F. crassifolia], the Thomasville citrangequat [Fortunella sp. x (C. sinensis x Poncirus trifoliata)], and seven hybrid progenies [F. margarita x C. junos], contain large amounts of 1 in their peels (17.0-7.9 mg/g) and juice sacs (2.0-9.9 mg/g). These facts suggest that accumulation of 1 is a generic trait of the genus Fortunella and that the inheritance of the trait among the intergeneric hybrids is controlled by a dominant allele. Thus C. madurensis and C. halimii are thought to originate from natural hybrids between the genera Citrus and Fortunella. Phloridzin, which has the same aglycon as 1, was not detected in the citrus plants examined. 3ainterspecific variation 3aalleles 3aintergeneric hybridization 3aFortunella 3aPoncirus 3aflavonoids 3achemical constituents of plants 3aCitrus 3ainheritance (genetics) 3achemotaxonomy 3aleaves 2aFlavonoidsxchemistry 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aRosalesxchemistry 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 3aJapan 0aspecies differences 0adominance 0apeel 0afruits 0aderivatives1 aKawasaki, A.1 aOmura, M.1 aYoshida, T.1 aIkoma, Y.1 aYano, M.0 tPhytochemistry.g2001 July, v. 57, no. 5 p.737-742x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02123naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100001900132245009100151300001600242300002100258500001500279520054500294650002000839650002100859650001300880650002000893650001700913650001200930650006000942650001101002650005101013650001101064650001101075650003301086650003201119650006401151650003201215650003601247650003001283653001801313653002801331653003401359700002001393700001701413700002101430773007901451852000901530939003301539945000801572946001301580655001201593991603822390742620221121160144.0800905e197810  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800021902DNAL7 a5681732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoel, Krishan.10aMonosaccharide intolerance and soy-protein hypersensitivity in an infant with diarrhea  ap. 617-619.  ap. 617-619. ill.  a2019-12-05  aA frequent cause of prolongation of diarrhea following acute gastroenteritis is secondary carbohydrate malabsorption.

Methods: Subjects (N = 57) were 7 to 11 years of age; their percentage of body fat ranged from 10% to 58%. The percentage of fat was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, maximal aerobic capacity was measured on a tread-mill, fat distribution was expressed as the waist/hip circumference ratio and blood pressures were measured with an automated monitor. Measurements of several lipoproteins and apoproteins were combined into one atherogenic index. Results: The percentage of fat was related to the atherogenic index (p = 0.38; p > 0.01) and insulin level (p = 0.78; p > 0.001). Aerobic capacity was inversely related to the atherogenic index (p = -0.27; p > 0.05) and insulin level (p = -0.72; p > 0.001). The waist/hip ratio was not related to the risk factors and blood pressures were not related to fatness or aerobic capacity. In multiple regression analyses only fatness explained significant independent proportions of the variance in the atherogenic index and insulin level. After control for fatness the black children had higher insulin levels (p > 0.05). Conclusion: At early ages (7- to 11-year-old children) fatness was related to risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 3abody fat 3adiabetes 3aatherosclerosis 3abreathing 3achildren 3arisk 0acapacity 0adistribution1 aIslam, S.1 aManos, T.1 aCucuzzo, N.1 aSmith, C.1 aStachura, M.E.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g1994 Dec., v. 125, no. 6:pt.1 p.847-852x0022-34767nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle02103naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245011800150300001600268300002400284520073900308650001201047650002301059650001401082650001501096650001601111650000901127650002301136650002001159650001201179650002401191650001101215650002001226650002201246650000901268650001601277650004501293650003101338653001701369653002701386700001401413700001401427700001301441773008001454852000901534939003301543945000801576946001301584655001201597991603819350742620221121070228.0840831e198308  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840054762DNAL7 a68757302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenterre, J.10aEffects of vitamin D and phosphorus supplementation on calcium retention in preterm infants fed banked human milk  ap. 305-307.  ap. 305-307. charts.  aThirty 3-day metabolic balance studies were carried out to assess the effects of vitamin D and phosphorus (P) supplementation on calcium (Ca) absorption and retention in 10 appropriate-for-gestational-age, preterm infant boys fed banked human milk.

Older white children (11 to 17 years) with a parental history of heart attack or diabetes were 4.3 and 5.6 times, respectively, more likely to have high levels (greater than or equal to 95th percentile) of serum total cholesterol than those without such a history (all p less than 0.05). White children with a parental history of heart attack or diabetes were twice as likely to have an elevated (greater than or equal to 95th percentile) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level than those without such a history (both p less than 0.05). In contrast, parental history of cardiovascular disease did not predict elevated levels of total cholesterol or LDL-C in black children. However, older black children with a parental history of heart attack, hypertension, or diabetes were 4 1/2 to 5 times more likely to have low levels (less than or equal to 5th percentile) of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than those without such a history (all p less than 0.05). Only 40% of white children and 21% of black children with elevated LDL-C levels had a parental history of vascular diseases. These findings raise questions about the current practice of screening only children with a family history of cardiovascular disease to identify those with elevated total cholesterol and LDL-C levels. 3acardiovascular diseases 3aBlacks 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alow density lipoprotein 3acholesterol 3ascreening 3achildren 3aWhites 0agenetic factors1 aKikuchi, D.A.1 aSrinivasan, S.R.1 aWebber, L.S.1 aBerenson, G.S.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g1989 Aug., v. 115, no. 2 p.186-194x0022-34767nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245015000129300001400279300002800293520146300321650001701784650001201801650001601813650002001829650002001849650002601869650001601895650002001911653002301931700001701954700001301971700001401984773007801998852001302076939003302089945000802122946001302130852000902143655001202152991603815510742620221121011441.0851028e198407  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850079952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPutet, G.10aNutrient balance, energy utilization, and composition of weight gains in very-low-birth-weight infants fed pooled human milk or a preterm formula  ap. 79-85.  ap. 79-85. ill., charts.  aExtract: Growth, protein, and energy balances were studied in two groups of very-low-birth-weight premature infants fed pooled pasteurized human milk (HM) or a preterm formula (PF). Each infant was studied at 33 and 36 weeks gestational age with a combined technique of nutrient balance and indirect calorimetry measurement. Weight and length gains were higher with PF than with HM, but head circumference growth was similar with both milks. Although the volume of milk given was lower, energy intake was higher with PF than with HM in both studies. Percentage of energy absorbed was better with PF than with HM at 33 weeks, and similar with both milks at 36 weeks. Energy expenditure, which had increased from 33 weeks to 36 weeks, was higher with PF than with HM during both studies. Energy retention accounted for about 50% of energy absorbed with both milks, but was higher with PF than with HM in both studies, and resulted in fat accretion well above that seen during intrauterine growth for both milks in both studies. Protein intake was higher with PF than with HM in both studies, giving a protein accretion similar to the intrauterine accretion with PF, but lower with HM. Our results suggest that the nutritional value of pooled pasteurized human milk for VLBW infants should be reconsidered, especially because of its low protein content, and that energy density of preterm formulas must be questioned in view of elevated fat deposition.

Twenty adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa underwent maximal exercise tests, and the result were compared with those in 15 age-matched adolsecent girls. In the patients with anorexia maximal values were heart rate 174 bpm, systolic blood pressure 127, oxygen consumption 31/kg/min, and plasma norepinephrine concentration 1581 pg/ml. In the controls, corresponding values were signicantly higher heart rate 193 bpm, systolic blood pressure 163 mm Hg, oxygen consumption 39.3 ml/kg/min, and plasma noreppinephrine 2695. Anaerobic threshold occurred at the same percent of maximal work in patients and controls. Results of exercise ECGs in all controls were normal, but five patient with anorexia nervosa developed significant ST segment depression. Thus, in patients with anorexia nervosa there is abnormal working capacity and cardiovascular responses to exercise and abnormal sympathetic responses to the stimulus of exercise, and a myocardial abnormality manifested as ST segment depression during exercise in some.

We have diagnosed and successfully treated biotin deficiency in three patients. Each patient had alopecia totalis, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Two developed the characteristic scaly periorificial dermatitis; one had only an intermittent scaly rash on the cheeks and occipital scalp. Zinc and essential fatty acid supplements were adequate; serum zinc levels and triene/tetraene ratios confirmed sufficiency of these nutrients. None of the patients received biotin prior to diagnosis, and each had decreased excretion of urinary biotinand increased urinary excretion of organic acids diagnostic of deficiency of two biotin-dependent enzymes. Only one patient had a plasma biotin concentration below the normal range. The rash, alopecia, and neurologic findings responded dramatically to biotin therapy and did not recur. However, abnormal organic acid excretion persisted in one patient who did not receive the larger dose. We conclude that plasma biotin concentration does not reflect biotin status in all cases and speculate that the biotin supplement currently recommended for pediatric patients may not be adequate therapy for biotin deficiency and might not even be adequate to maintain normal biotin status during TPN.

Here we report on local extinctions among a wide range of terrestrial and freshwater taxa from Singapore (540 km2) in relation to habitat loss exceeding 95% over 183 years. Substantial rates of documented and inferred extinctions were found, especially for forest specialists, with the greatest proportion of extinct taxa (34-87%) in butterflies, fish, birds and mammals. Observed extinctions were generally fewer, but inferred losses often higher, in vascular plants, phasmids, decapods, amphibians and reptiles (5-80%). Forest reserves comprising only 0.25% of Singapore's area now harbour over 50% of the residual native biodiversity. Extrapolations of the observed and inferred local extinction data, using a calibrated species-area model, imply that the current unprecedented rate of habitat destruction in Southeast Asia will result in the loss of 13-42% of regional populations over the next century, at least half of which will represent global species extinctions. 3ahabitat destruction 3athreatened species 3atropical forests 3adeforestation 3aextinction 3abiodiversity 3apopulation dynamics 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTreesxphysiology 3aSingapore 0aSingapore 0acommunity ecology 0apopulation ecology1 aSodhi, N.S.1 aNg, P.K.L.0 tNature.g2003 July 24, v. 424, no. 6947 p.420-423aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b00000000c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle01310naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004200133300001600175300002100191520053200212650003000744650001900774650001600793653001800809700002000827700001900847773007900866852000900945939003300954945000800987946001300995655001201008991603809160742620221120184641.0790918e197904  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794556972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPittard, W.B.10aExcretion of technetium in human milk  ap. 605-607.  ap. 605-607. ill.  aInformation on the problem of contamination of human milk by radiopharmaceuticals used in scanning procedures is reported.

The effect of rapid high-temperature treatment on bacteria and viruses and on the nutritional and immunologic quality of pooled human milk was examined. Growth of endogenous bacteria and infectivity of added cytomegalovirus were undetectable after heating at 72 degrees C for 15 and 5 seconds, respectively. Folic acid and vitamins B1, B2, B6, and C were not affected, whereas bile salt-stimulated lipase was inactivated by these conditions. The concentration of lactoferrin and secretory IgA, and SIgA antibody activity were not changed by heating at 72 degrees C. Lysozyme concentration and enzymatic activity were increased significantly by heat treatment, suggesting that this component may be largely sequestered in milk. Findings suggest that rapid high-temperature treatment can reduce microbial contamination without destroying the unique nutritional and immunoligic qualities of human milk.

The results indicted that significantly greater fat remained in the feeding sets when MTCO was premixed with milk than if MCTO and milk were sequentially administered. This finding indicated that intake calories from fat by such infants will be underestimated if MCTO is blended to produce a fortified milk than if MCTO and milk are administered in sequence without blending. 3amedium chain fatty acids 3ainfant feeding 3abreast milk 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 2aEnteral Nutrition 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFood, Fortified 2aHumans 2aInfant Food 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Premature 2aMilk, Human 2aTriglyceridesxadministration & dosage 0afood and nutrition controversies 0afortification1 aHamosh, M.1 aBitman, J.1 aWood, L.D.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g1988 Mar., v. 112, no. 3 p.474-476x0022-34767nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19880713c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245013600150300001600286300002400302520130700326650001601633650002301649650003001672650001601702650001301718650002301731650002001754650002001774650002401794650001901818650003601837650002101873650006601894650001101960650002201971650001101993650001102004650002002015650003102035650002702066650002902093650005802122650001402180650003802194650004202232700001602274700001402290700001602304700001902320700001402339773008002353852001302433939003302446945000802479946001302487852000902500655001202509991603806100742620221120161402.0890214e198812  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890002682DNAL7 a31429882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGladen, B.C.10aDevelopment after exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene transplacentally and through human milk  ap. 991-995.  ap. 991-995. charts.  aObjective: To determine whether exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (DDE), either transplacentally or through breast feeding, affected scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 6 or 12 months of age. Design: Cohort followed from birth to 1 year of age. Setting: General community. Participants: Volunteer sample of 858 infants, of whom 802 had Bayley scores available at either 6 months or 12 months or both. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Bayley scales and chemical measurements were done independently. Higher transplacental exposure to PCBs was associated with lower psychomotor scores at both 6 and 12 months of age; the difference between the mean scores in the lowest and highest PCB groups was 7 points at 6 months and 8 points at 12 months. Higher transplacental exposure to DDE was associated with higher mental scores at 6 months of age (the difference between the mean scores in the lowest and highest DDE groups was 6 points), but no relationship was seen at 12 months. Exposure to either chemical through breast feeding was apparently unrelated to Bayley scores. Conclusions: Transplacental exposure to PCBs was associated with lower psychomotor scores. No deleterious effects were associated with breast feeding. 3abreast milk 3afood contamination 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3ametabolites 3aplacenta 3ainfant development 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aDDE (pesticide) 2aBrainxdrug effects 2aBreast Feeding 2aChild Developmentxdrug effects 2aChild, Preschool 2aDichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylenexadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aIntelligencexdrug effects 2aMilk, Humanxanalysis. 2aNeuropsychological Tests 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aPregnancy 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects 2aPsychomotor Performancexdrug effects1 aRogan, W.J.1 aHardy, P.1 aThullen, J.1 aTingelstad, J.1 aTully, M.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g1988 Dec., v. 113, no. 6 p.991-995x0022-34767nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012000163300001600283520100500299653001501304653001601319653002501335700001901360700002401379700001901403700002301422773010201445852000901547856008501556930003301641946001101674655001201685IND4418107320221120144226.0090320e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441810732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10683-008-9207-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlatas, Vivi 10aSubject pool effects in a corruption experiment: A comparison of Indonesian public servants and Indonesian students  ap. 113-132.  aWe report results from a corruption experiment with Indonesian public servants and Indonesian students. Our results suggest that the Indonesian public servant subjects have a significantly lower tolerance of corruption than the Indonesian students. We find no evidence that this is due to a selection effect. The reasons given by the subjects for their behaviour suggest that the differences in behavior across the subject pools are driven by their different real life experiences. For example, when abstaining from corruption, public servants more often cite the need to reduce the social costs of corruption as a reason for their actions, and when engaging in corruption, they cite low government salaries or a belief that corruption is a necessary evil in the current environment. In contrast, students give more simplistic moral reasons. We conclude by emphasizing that results obtained from different subject pools can complement each other in illuminating different aspects of the same problem. 0aCorruption 0aExperiments 0aSubject pool effects1 aCameron, Lisa 1 aChaudhuri, Ananish 1 aErkal, Nisvan 1 aGangadharan, Lata 0 tExperimental economics.g2009 Mar., v. 12, no. 1 p.113-132dBoston : Springer USx1386-41577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10683-008-9207-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01943naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245006000160300001800220520081900238650002101057650001101078650001001089650001501099650001401114650001101128650001701139650001201156653002201168653001701190653002001207653001601227653002401243700001601267773012401283852000901407856008501416930003301501946001101534655001201545IND4418109120221120035148.0090320e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441810912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-008-8544-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasak, O. 10aStem cells of the adult mammalian brain and their niche  ap. 1057-1072.  aThe mammalian brain is a paradox of evolution. Although the advance in complexity of the human brain has exceeded the development of other organs, it has practically lost the ability to regenerate, and damage is repaired mainly by functional plasticity. This disparity is, however, not due to the lack of progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain, but to their diminished or repressed capacity to replace neurons in most brain regions. Here, we discuss the current literature describing the processes of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain, and the recent advances in adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) with a focus on their identity, cell cycle and niche signals. Understanding these processes may hopefully lead to therapies in the future to reinstate self-repair of the brain from endogenous progenitors. 3aadult stem cells 3aadults 3abrain 3acell cycle 3aevolution 3ahumans 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 0aNeural stem cells 0aneurogenesis 0astem cell niche 0aadult brain 0asubventricular zone1 aTaylor, V. 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2009 Mar., v. 66, no. 6 p.1057-1072dBasel : Birkhäuser-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-008-8544-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091002b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01393naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008900166300001600255520038900271653001400660653001700674653002300691653002600714653002000740653003300760653004000793773010600833852000900939856008500948930003301033946001301066655001201079IND4418105720221120035220.0090320e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441810572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10913-008-0049-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeryakov, V.

Direct effects on non-target species, and the possibility of unintentionally transferring traits of ecological relevance onto landraces and wild relatives have also been sources of concern. The degree of genetic connectivity between industrial crops and their progenitors in landraces and wild relatives is a principal determinant of the evolutionary history of crops and agroecosystems throughout the world. Recent introductions of transgenic DNA constructs into agricultural fields provide unique markers to measure such connectivity. For these reasons, the detection of transgenic DNA in crop landraces is of critical importance. Here we report the presence of introgressed transgenic DNA constructs in native maize landraces grown in remote mountains in Oaxaca, Mexico, part of the Mesoamerican centre of origin and diversification of this crop. 3aZea mays 3agene flow 3alandraces 3agenetically modified organisms 3aintrogression 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgenetics 2aBacillus thuringiensisxgenetics 2aCaulimovirusxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDNA, Plantxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDNA, Recombinantxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDNA, Viralxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aZea maysxgenetics 3aMexico 0aMexico1 aChapela, I.H.0 tNature.g2001 Nov. 29, v. 414, no. 6863 p.541-543aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02684naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245010100146300001400247520106000261650001101321650002201332650002001354650001901374650002501393650001201418650001401430650001601444650002201460650002401482650002501506650002501531650003401556650004001590650004601630650002001676651001101696651001101707651002001718653001801738700001801756700001701774700002201791700002001813700001201833700001701845700001701862700002201879700001801901700001501919773009401934852000902028930003302037945001302070946001102083655001202094IND2326554320221120035021.0020415e20020103enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232655432DNAL7 a117801172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKane, R.B.10aResource-based niches provide a basis for plant species diversity and dominance in arctic tundra  ap. 68-71.  aEcologists have long been intrigued by the ways co-occurring species divide limiting resource. Such resource partitioning, or niche differentiation, may promote species diversity by reducing competition. Although resource partitioning is an important determinant of species diversity and composition in animal communities, its importance in structuring plant communities has been difficult to resolve. This is due mainly to difficulties in studying how plants compete for belowground resources. Here we provide evidence from a 15N-tracer field experiment showing that plant species in a nitrogen-limited, arctic tundra community were differentiated in timing, depth and chemical form of nitrogen uptake, and that species dominance was strongly correlated most productive species used the most abundant nitrogen forms, and less productive species used less abundant forms. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation that the composition of a plant community is related to partitioning of differentially available forms of a single limiting resource. 3atundra 3aspecies diversity 3anutrient uptake 3asoil fertility 2aBiological Evolution 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aGenetic Variation 2aGlycinexmetabolism 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlantsxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aSoilxanalysis. 3aAlaska 0aAlaska 0aArctic regions. 0asoil nitrogen1 aJohnson, L.C.1 aShaver, G.R.1 aNadelhoffer, K.J.1 aRastetter, E.B.1 aFry, B.1 aGiblin, A.E.1 aKielland, K.1 aKwiatkowski, B.L.1 aLaundre, J.A.1 aMurray, G.0 tNature.g2002 Jan. 3, v. 415, no. 6867 p.68-71aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03369naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245011500144300001600259520140000275650001401675650002701689650001301716650001301729650001501742650002501757650002401782650001201806650002601818650003801844650002701882650005101909650002301960650006401983650004702047650002602094650003502120650001802155650005202173650001402225650001102239650004302250650005002293650002302343650002802366650001302394650002802407650003402435650002402469653003402493700002002527700001902547700001402566773009702580852000902677930003302686945001302719946001102732655001202743IND2327212220221117184443.0020523e20011213enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232721222DNAL7 a117424012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichel, T.10aDrosophila Toll is activated by Gram-positive bacteria through a circulating peptidoglycan recognition protein  ap. 756-759.  aMicrobial infection activates two distinct intracellular signalling cascades in the immune-responsive fat body of Drosophila. Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spatzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition in receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spatzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway. 3ainfection 3aGram-positive bacteria 3afat body 3aimmunity 3aDrosophila 3abiochemical pathways 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agents 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxmetabolism 2aBacillus thuringiensis 2aCarrier Proteinsxbloodxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDrosophilaxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEnterococcus faecalis 2aFungiximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Insect 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aHemolymph 2aHumans 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicrococcus luteus 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aReceptors, Cell Surface 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aToll-Like Receptors 0asignalling pathway activation1 aReichhart, J.M.1 aHoffmann, J.A.1 aRoyet, J.0 tNature.g2001 Dec. 13, v. 414, no. 6865 p.756-759aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02326naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245012200162300001400284500002400298520119500322650002601517650001201543650002301555650001301578650001501591650001501606650001001621650001601631650001301647650001401660650001001674650001101684650002501695650001001720700001801730700001601748773009501764852000901859856004801868655001201916IND4385647920221122135347.0061203e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438564792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11056-006-9015-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCicek, Emrah10aEffects of Seedbed Density on One-Year-Old Fraxinus angustifolia Seedling Characteristics and Outplanting Performance  ap. 81-91.  aIncludes references  aTo assess the effects of seedling spacing on one-year-old seedling morphology in the nursery, seeds of three provenances of Fraxinus angustifolia were sown at five different seedling spacings within rows of two different spacings in the seedbed. Subsequent growth performance of one-year-old seedlings was assessed by planting in the forest. Within row spacings were: 4.3, 5.0, 6.3, 8.3, and 12.5 cm, and there were five rows at 20 cm apart, or three rows at 33 cm apart across the 1.2 m wide seedbeds. Both spacings within and between rows significantly affected shoot height, root collar diameter, root dry weight and shoot dry weight, but not root/shoot ratio. Wider spacings produced larger seedlings, but only the wider spacing within rows significantly increased fine and coarse root mass. Provenances showed significant differences in diameter, root/shoot ratio, and fine and coarse roots, and they also showed interactions with row spacings in height and diameter measurements. One year after outplanting, diameter growth was significantly related to provenance, and diameter growth was 88% greater for trees from 33 cm nursery row spacing than those from 20 cm nursery row spacing. 3aFraxinus angustifolia 3aforests 3agrowth performance 3aplanting 3aprovenance 3aroot crown 3aroots 3arow spacing 3aseedbeds 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 3aspatial distribution 3atrees1 aCicek, Nurten1 aBilir, Nebi0 tNew forests.g2007 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.81-91dKluwer Academic Publishersx0169-42867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-006-9015-6 7aarticle02557naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245006000147300001600207500001500223520091900238650002301157650001301180650001601193650001201209650003901221650001001260650003301270650001401303650001101317650001301328650005001341650000901391650003201400650003201432650001601464650004001480650004001520650002401560650001701584650002101601651001801622651001101640653001501651653002201666653002101688653002501709653001201734700001801746700001401764700001501778773009601793852000901889930003301898945001301931946001101944655001201955IND2324687720221122124306.0020102e20010517enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232468772DNAL7 a113571312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiggins, C.D.10aReproductive isolation caused by colour pattern mimicry  ap. 302-305.  a2019-12-05  aSpeciation is facilitated if ecological adaptation directly causes assortative mating, but few natural examples are known. Here we show that a shift in colour pattern mimicry was crucial in the origin of two butterfly species. The sister species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno recently diverged to mimic different model taxa, and our experiments show that their mimetic coloration is also important in choosing mates. Assortative mating between the sister species means that hybridization is rare in nature, and the few hybrids that are produced are non-mimetic, poorly adapted intermediates. Thus, the mimetic shift has caused both pre-mating and post-mating isolation. In addition, individuals from a population of H. melpomene allopatric to H. cydno court and mate with H. cydno more readily than those from a sympatric population. This suggests that assortative mating has been enhanced in sympatry. 3aassortative mating 3asympatry 3aLepidoptera 2aAnimals 2aButterfliesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aColor 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHybridization, Geneticxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMolecular Mimicryxgenetics 2aPattern Recognition, Visual 2aProbability 2aReproductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 2aWingxphysiology 0aFrench Guiana 0aPanama 0aspeciation 0asympatric species 0aheliconius cydno 0aheliconius melpomene 0amimicry1 aNaisbit, R.E.1 aCoe, R.L.1 aMallet, J.0 tNature.g2001 May 17, v. 411, no. 6835 p.302-305aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02312naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245008200150300001600232500001500248520105300263650003201316650002201348650001401370650002501384650002801409650001401437650003801451650003901489651001701528651001701545653001101562653002201573700001601595700001401611700001801625700001701643700001501660700001601675773009701691852000901788930003301797945001301830946001101843655001201854IND2324727320221122075530.0020108e20010712enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232472732DNAL7 a114492732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, J.E.10aRapid and recent origin of species richness in the Cape flora of South Africa  ap. 181-183.  a2019-12-05  aThe Cape flora of South Africa grows in a continental area with many diverse and endemic species. We need to understand the evolutionary origins and ages of such 'hotspots' to conserve them effectively. In volcanic islands the timing of diversification can be precisely measured with potassium-argon dating. In contrast, the history of these continental species is based upon an incomplete fossil record and relatively imprecise isotopic paleotemperature signatures. Here we use molecular phylogenetics and precise dating of two island species within the same clade as the continental taxa to show recent speciation in a species-rich genus characteristic of the Cape flora. The results indicate that diversification began approximately 7-8 Myr ago, coincident with extensive aridification caused by changes in ocean currents. The recent origin of endemic species diversity in the Cape flora shows that large continental bursts of speciation can occur rapidly over timescales comparable to those previously associated with oceanic island radiations. 3anatural resource management 3aspecies diversity 2aEcosystem 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlantsxclassificationxgenetics. 2aRosalesxclassificationxgenetics. 3aSouth Africa 0aSouth Africa 0aplants 0acenters of origin1 aWeitz, F.M.1 aFay, M.F.1 aCronk, Q.C.B.1 aLinder, H.P.1 aReeves, G.1 aChase, M.W.0 tNature.g2001 July 12, v. 412, no. 6843 p.181-183aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02048naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010700164300001600271500002400287500001500311520088200326650001101208650002101219650001901240650001201259650001001271650002601281650002101307650001401328651001101342653001501353700002701368700002201395700001901417700002401436700002701460773009401487852000901581856004801590655001201638IND4410741720221122075457.0080926e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441074172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-008-9418-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiguchi, Pedro10aSpatio-temporal patterns of tree community dynamics in a tropical forest fragment in South-east Brazil  ap. 125-135.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe tree community (dbh > 5 cm) of a fragment of tropical montane semi-deciduous forest in South-east Brazil was repeatedly surveyed over a 19-year period in order to assess spatial and temporal patterns of dynamics. The surveys took place in 1987, 1992, 1996, 2001, and 2006 in a grid of 126 20 x 20 m permanent plots covering almost the entire fragment (5.8 ha). Overall patterns indicated that a self-thinning process has taken place in the fragment since 1992. Community dynamics varied in space and time, with most dynamics highly spatially clustered. With exception of mortality rates, there were no changes in the spatial patterns of community dynamics through time. No relation between edges and dynamics variables was found. Most species with increasing density and basal area were shade-bearers, while most decreasing species were canopy light demanders and pioneers. 3acanopy 3atropical forests 3aspace and time 3asurveys 3atrees 3ahabitat fragmentation 3astand basal area 3amortality 3aBrazil 0abasal area1 aOliveira-Filho, Ary T.1 aBebber, Daniel P.1 aBrown, Nick D.1 aSilva, Ana Carolina1 aMachado, Evandro L.

This paper presents a more detailed analysis of these transgenic lines. Gene expression analysis of auxin-responsive genes show that SlARF7 may regulate only part of the auxin signalling pathway involved in tomato fruit set and development. Also, part of the GA signalling pathway was affected by the reduced levels of SlARF7 mRNA, as morphological and molecular analyses display similarities between GA-induced fruits and fruits formed by the RNAi SlARF7 lines. Nevertheless, the levels of GAs were strongly reduced compared with that in seeded fruits. These findings indicate that SlARF7 acts as a modifier of both auxin and gibberellin responses during tomato fruit set and development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aauxins 3afruiting 3afruits 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3atomatoes 3atransgenic plants 2aFruitxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGibberellinsxmetabolism 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction1 aWolters-Arts, Mieke1 aGarcía-Martínez, José L.1 aMariani, Celestina1 aVriezen, Wim H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 Jan., v. 62, no. 2 p.617-626dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq2933Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02748naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245006900145300001600214520139200230650001201622650002101634650001401655650002301669650002601692650002201718650001201740650002101752650003101773650002501804650002801829650001401857650003101871650002401902650002401926650002101950651001501971700001501986700001702001700001802018700001502036700001402051700001402065773009702079852000902176930003302185945001302218946001102231655001202242IND2328932620221122004902.0020916e20020425enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232893262DNAL7 a119766812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovotny, V.10aLow host specificity of herbivorous insects in a tropical forest  ap. 841-844.  aTwo decades of research have not established whether tropical insect herbivores are dominated by specialists or generalists. This impedes our understanding of species coexistence in diverse rainforest communities. Host specificity and species richness of tropical insects are also key parameters in mapping global patterns of biodiversity. Here we analyse data for over 900 herbivorous species feeding on 51 plant species in New Guinea and show that most herbivorous species feed on several closely related plant species. Because species-rich genera are dominant in tropical floras, monophagous herbivores are probably rare in tropical forests. Furthermore, even between phylogenetically distant hosts, herbivore communities typically shared a third of their species. These results do not support the classical view that the coexistence of herbivorous species in the tropics is a consequence of finely divided plant resources; non-equilibrium models of tropical diversity should instead be considered. Low host specificity of tropical herbivores reduces global estimates of arthropod diversity from 31 million to 4-6 million species. This finding agrees with estimates based on taxonomic collections, reconciling an order of magnitude discrepancy between extrapolations of global diversity based on ecological samples of tropical communities with those based on sampling regional faunas. 3ainsects 3ahost specificity 3aphylogeny 3ainsect communities 3atropical rain forests 3aspecies diversity 2aAnimals 2aFeeding Behavior 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Leavesxparasitology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTreesxparasitology 2aTropical Climate 0aNew Guinea1 aBasset, Y.1 aMiller, S.E.1 aWeiblen, G.D.1 aBremer, B.1 aCizek, L.1 aDrozd, P.0 tNature.g2002 Apr. 25, v. 416, no. 6883 p.841-844aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03447naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013700163300001500300500002400315500001500339520211800354650001402472650002502486650002302511650001602534650000902550650001702559650000902576650001302585650001602598650001702614650003302631650001402664650002702678650001102705650001702716650001602733653003102749700002002780700002002800773011202820852000902932856004802941655001202989IND4437059620221122004834.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443705962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-009-0183-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoël, Marie10aDevelopment of Time-Resolved Description of Aerosol Properties at the Particle Scale During an Episode of Industrial Pollution Plume  ap. 93-107.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSingle-particle analysis of short-term aerosol samplings can provide unique information on the rapid evolution of size distribution and chemical composition of industrial aerosols. In this work, the potential of scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX) for the time-resolved description of physicochemical properties of individual aerosol particles is investigated. Two sampling campaigns were carried out at a densely populated and industrialised coastal site. The first sampling campaign corresponded to low and stable atmospheric particle loads. Low temporal variations in PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅ mass concentrations during the preceding hours and during samplings were observed. In these conditions suitable to evaluate the accuracy of our sampling and analytical methodologies, very low temporal variation of physicochemical characteristics of atmospheric particles were observed, as expected. During the second sampling campaign, the ability of automated SEM-EDX to describe short temporal variation in PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅ chemical composition was demonstrated. We report the tracking of a steelworks emission plume transported over an urban area by means of short-term aerosol samplings and explore how this transient industrial emission contributed to ambient particulates. Steelworks are important point-source emitters of metallic pollutants such as iron, manganese, and zinc species. Detailed assessment of the microphysical and chemical properties of aerosols collected in the vicinity of steelworks enables to precisely describe how industrial aerosols affect the composition of urban particulate matter. The studied pollution event caused dramatic changes in the composition of urban aerosols by an input of fine metallic particles containing Fe, Mn or Zn oxides and mixed particles (Mn-Fe, Zn-Mn, Zn-Fe oxides). Metal-rich particles were often found internally mixed with marine and/or continental compounds, demonstrating how industrial aerosols efficiently coagulate with particles from other sources, thereby acting as carriers of heavy metals. 3amanganese 3achemical composition 3atemporal variation 3acoagulation 3azinc 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aaerosols 3aurban areas 3aparticulates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aemissions 3apoint source pollution 3aoxides 3aspectroscopy 3aX-radiation 0aphysicochemical properties1 aDeboudt, Karine1 aFlament, Pascal0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2010 June, v. 209, no. 1-4 p.93-107dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0183-9 7aarticle02573naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008900128300001600217500001500233520132900248650002501577650001701602650001901619650002401638650002301662650002001685650001601705650001501721650001901736650001001755650003601765650001501801653001401816653002001830653001601850653001101866653001401877653001701891700001701908700001501925773009701940852000902037930003302046945001302079946001102092655001202103IND2328752620221122004818.0020829e20020711enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232875262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavison, P.A.10aOverexpression of beta-carotene hydroxylase enhances stress tolerance in Arabidopsis  ap. 203-206.  a2019-12-05  aPlant stress caused by extreme environmental conditions is already a principal reason for yield reduction in crops. The threat of global environment change makes it increasingly important to generate crop plants that will withstand such conditions. Stress, particularly stress caused by increased sunlight, leads to the production of reactive oxygen species that cause photo-oxidative cell damage. Carotenoids, which are present in the membranes of all photosynthetic organisms, help protect against such light-dependent oxidative damage. In plants, the xanthophyll cycle (the reversible interconversion of two carotenoids, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin) has a key photoprotective role and is therefore a promising target for genetic engineering to enhance stress tolerance. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana overexpression of the chyB gene that encodes beta-carotene hydroxylase--an enzyme in the zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathway--causes a specific twofold increase in the size of the xanthophyll cycle pool. The plants are more tolerant to conditions of high light and high temperature, as shown by reduced leaf necrosis, reduced production of the stress indicator anthocyanin and reduced lipid peroxidation. Stress protection is probably due to the function of zeaxanthin in preventing oxidative damage of membranes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiosynthesis 3aheat tolerance 3agene overexpression 3alipid peroxidation 3alight intensity 3aheat stress 3azeaxanthin 3aphotosynthesis 3agenes 3achemical constituents of plants 3aoxygenases 0atolerance 0agene expression 0acarotenoids 0astress 0achyb gene 0axanthophylls1 aHunter, C.N.1 aHorton, P.0 tNature.g2002 July 11, v. 417, no. 6894 p.203-206aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03172naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245012400204300001800328500002400346500001500370506007600385520158100461506003702042650000902079650001802088650002202106650001402128650002302142650001002165650001302175650002802188650001402216650001002230650000802240650001202248650001802260650001302278650002102291653005602312700001302368700001602381700001302397700001902410773013602429852000902565856008002574655001202654IND4429000120221207100639.0091120e20091201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442900012DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01380-092doi7 aPMC27864242pmcid7 a198014612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChinivasagam, H.N.10aMechanically Ventilated Broiler Sheds: a Possible Source of Aerosolized Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli  ap. 7417-7425.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study assessed the levels of two key pathogens, Salmonella and Campylobacter, along with the indicator organism Escherichia coli in aerosols within and outside poultry sheds. The study ranged over a 3-year period on four poultry farms and consisted of six trials across the boiler production cycle of around 55 days. Weekly testing of litter and aerosols was carried out through the cycle. A key point that emerged is that the levels of airborne bacteria are linked to the levels of these bacteria in litter. This hypothesis was demonstrated by E. coli. The typical levels of E. coli in litter were ~10⁸ CFU g⁻¹ and, as a consequence, were in the range of 10² to 10⁴ CFU m⁻³ in aerosols, both inside and outside the shed. The external levels were always lower than the internal levels. Salmonella was only present intermittently in litter and at lower levels (10³ to 10⁵ most probable number [MPN] g⁻¹) and consequently present only intermittently and at low levels in air inside (range of 0.65 to 4.4 MPN m⁻³) and once outside (2.3 MPN m⁻³). The Salmonella serovars isolated in litter were generally also isolated from aerosols and dust, with the Salmonella serovars Chester and Sofia being the dominant serovars across these interfaces. Campylobacter was detected late in the production cycle, in litter at levels of around 10⁷ MPN g⁻¹. Campylobacter was detected only once inside the shed and then at low levels of 2.2 MPN m⁻³. Thus, the public health risk from these organisms in poultry environments via the aerosol pathway is minimal.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arisk 3apublic health 3aindicator species 3aserotypes 3aSalmonella Chester 3afarms 3aaerosols 3aairborne microorganisms 3apathogens 3asheds 3aair 3apoultry 3aCampylobacter 3abacteria 3aEscherichia coli 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Chester1 aTran, T.1 aMaddock, L.1 aGale, A.1 aBlackall, P.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 Dec. 1, v. 75, no. 23 p.7417-7425dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01380-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01995naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010900167300001600276500002400292500001500316520077100331650001101102650001301113650001801126650001601144650001401160650001601174650001101190650002301201650002201224650001401246651001301260653001401273700002101287700001801308700002401326700002001350700001801370773011601388852000901504856004801513655001201561IND4457593320221122004838.0110506e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445759332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-011-9743-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvidente, Antonio10aPhytotoxic polyketides produced by Phomopsis foeniculi, a strain isolated from diseased Bulgarian fennel  ap. 173-182.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRecently, a new fungal disease caused by Diaporthe angelicae (anamorph Phomopsis foeniculi) has been found with increasingly frequency on fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) in Bulgaria. Using a bioassay-guided isolation and purification procedure, different metabolites were isolated from the fungal culture filtrates. They were identified by spectroscopic methods as nectriapyrone, a pentaketide monoterpenoid, and altersolanols A and J and macrosporin, three octaketides anthracenones.

Nectriapyrone and altersolanols A and J showed a modulated phytotoxicity, while macrosporin was not toxic.

These compounds are well preserved during physical refining, but in current industrial practice, RBO is mostly refined chemically because this results in a lighter color. However this process removes most of the γ-oryzanol. The challenge is to develop a refining process which combines a high γ-oryzanol retention with the commercially desired light color. A modified physical refining process was developed, consisting of an acid degumming, prebleaching, dewaxing, physical removal of free fatty acids using packed column technology, a modified washing step, conventional bleaching and deodorization. A RBO with acceptable oryzanol retention of 39% had a Lovibond red color value (measured with a 5.25-inch cell) of 2.8, approaching very close the color of a chemically refined RBO (red = 2). At the process step where high (94%) retention of γ-oryzanol was achieved, a somewhat darker Lovibond red value of 5.2 was obtained. 3ableaching 3acolor 3adegumming 3adeodorization 3afree fatty acids 3aoryzanol 3aphytosterols 3arefining 3arice bran oil 3atocotrienols 3awashing1 aVila Ayala, Jose1 aCzarnowska, Marta1 aDe Greyt, Wim1 aVerhé, Roland.0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2010 Oct., v. 87, no. 10 p.1227-1234dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-010-1606-x 7aarticle01330naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245003300147300001600180520016400196650001500360650002700375650001000402650002000412650001400432650001900446650001200465650003600477650002500513650004900538650004800587650003700635650002500672650003400697650002600731773009700757852000900854930003300863945001300896946001100909655001200920IND2326197120221121232457.0020326e20020221enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232619712DNAL7 a118593492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevin, Miron.10aHow insects lose their limbs  ap. 848-849.  aEvolution has produced marvellous variety in the arthropods, and in their various appendages.

The intensive use of compounds such as the pyrethroids has led to the emergence of resistance, and previous studies have suggested that resistance to both pyrethroids and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) may result from reduced sensitivity of the insecticide target, the voltage-gated sodium channel. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying pyrethroid resistance in S. zeamais, the domain II region of the voltage-gated sodium channel (para-orthologue) gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced from susceptible and resistant laboratory S. zeamais strains that were selected with a discriminating dose of DDT. A single point mutation, T929I, was found in the para gene of the resistant S. zeamais populations and its presence in individual weevils was strongly associated with survival after DDT exposure. This is the first identification of a target-site resistance mutation in S. zeamais and unusually it is a super-kdr type mutation occurring in the absence of the more common kdr (L1014F) substitution. A high-throughput assay based on TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was developed for sensitive detection of the mutation and used to screen field-collected strains of S. zeamais. This showed that the mutation is present at low frequency in field populations and is a useful tool for informing control strategies. 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aSitophilus zeamais 3agenes 3agenotyping 3ainsecticides 3apests 3apoint mutation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apyrethrins 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asodium channels 3astored grain 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDDT 2aGenetic Testingxmethods 2aInsecticide Resistancexgenetics 2aInsecticides 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPoint Mutation 2aPyrethrins 2aSodium Channelsxgenetics 2aWeevilsxgenetics 3aBrazil1 aWilliamson, Martin S.1 aBass, Christopher1 aField, Linda M.1 aDuce, I.

Of these, nitrate is thought to be particularly mobile, being responsible for nitrogen loss to deep soil and stream waters. But human activities--such as fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer production and land-use change--have substantially altered the nitrogen cycle over large regions, making it difficult to separate natural aspects of nitrogen cycling from those induced by human perturbations. Here we report stream chemistry data from 100 unpolluted primary forests in temperate South America. Although the sites exhibit a broad range of environmental factors that influence ecosystem nutrient cycles (such as climate, parent material, time of ecosystem development, topography and biotic diversity), we observed a remarkably consistent pattern of nitrogen loss across all forests. In contrast to findings from forests in polluted regions, streamwater nitrate concentrations are exceedingly low, such that nitrate to ammonium ratios were less than unity, and dissolved organic nitrogen is responsible for the majority of nitrogen losses from these forests. We therefore suggest that organic nitrogen losses should be considered in models of forest nutrient cycling, which could help to explain observations of nutrient limitation in temperate forest ecosystems. 3abiogeochemical cycles 3anitrate nitrogen 3alosses from soil 3aforests 3atemperate zones 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Pollution 2aFresh Water 2aHumans 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aSoil 2aTrees 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aSouth America 0anutrient limitation1 aHedin, L.O.0 tNature.g2002 Jan. 24, v. 415, no. 6870 p.416-419aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02525naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245008800149300001600237500001500253520143300268650001501701650001601716650002201732650001201754650001401766650001601780650002201796650002501818650001001843650002301853650002401876653001701900700001701917700001801934773009701952852000902049930003302058945001302091946001102104655001202115IND2326496020221121232422.0020411e20020124enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232649602DNAL7 a118075532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardinale, B.J.10aSpecies diversity enhances ecosystem functioning through interspecific facilitation  ap. 426-429.  a2019-12-05  aFacilitation between species is thought to be a key mechanism by which biodiversity affects the rates of resource use that govern the efficiency and productivity of ecosystems; however, there is no direct empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. Here we show that increasing the species diversity of a functional group of aquatic organisms induces facilitative interactions, leading to non-additive changes in resource consumption. We increased the richness and evenness of suspension-feeding caddisfly larvae (Insecta, Trichoptera) in stream mesocosms and found that the increased topographical complexity of the benthic habitat alters patterns of near-bed flow such that the feeding success of individuals is enhanced. Species diversity reduces 'current shading' (that is, the deceleration of flow from upstream to downstream neighbours), allowing diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources than is caught by any species monoculture. The fundamental nature of this form of hydrodynamic facilitation suggests that it is broadly applicable to freshwater and marine habitats; in addition, it has several analogues in terrestrial ecosystems where fluxes of energy and matter can be influenced by biophysical complexity. Thus, changes in species diversity may alter the probability of positive species interactions, resulting in disproportionately large changes in the functioning of ecosystems. 3aecosystems 3aTrichoptera 3aspecies diversity 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aFresh Water 2aGenetic Variation 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aLarva 2aModels, Biological 2aSpecies Specificity 0abiodiversity1 aPalmer, M.A.1 aCollins, S.L.0 tNature.g2002 Jan. 24, v. 415, no. 6870 p.426-429aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02339naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245005000146300001400196520112500210650002401335650001901359650002001378650001201398650001401410650001201424650001101436650002601447650003001473650002601503650001501529650000901544650002801553650002901581650002301610650004001633651001301673653002001686700001501706773009401721852000901815930003301824945001301857946001101870655001201881IND2326554420221121225351.0020415e20020103enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232655442DNAL7 a117801182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTregenza, T.10aPolyandrous females avoid costs of inbreeding  ap. 71-73.  aWhy do females typically mate with more than one male? Female mating patterns have broad implications for sexual selection speciation and conflicts of interest between the sexes, and yet they are poorly understood. Matings inevitably have costs, and for females, the benefits of taking more than one mate are rarely obvious. One possible explanation is that females gain benefits because they can avoid using sperm from genetically incompatible males, or invest less in the offspring of such males. It has been shown that mating with more than one male can increase off-spring viability, but we present the first clear demonstration that this occurs because females with several mates avoid the negative effects of genetic incompatibility. We show that in crickets, the eggs of females that mate only with siblings have decreased hatching success. However, if females mate with both a sibling and a non-sibling they avoid altogether the low egg viability associated with sibling matings. If similar effects occur in other species, inbreeding avoidance may be important in understanding the prevalence of multiple mating. 3aGryllus bimaculatus 3amating systems 3amating behavior 2aAnimals 2aCourtship 2aEcology 2aFemale 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aFertilizationxphysiology 2aGryllidaexphysiology 2aInbreeding 2aMale 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 0aBotswana 0amultiple mating1 aWedell, N.0 tNature.g2002 Jan. 3, v. 415, no. 6867 p.71-73aNature (London, England)x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03056naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002700178245017500205300001800380500002400398500001500422506007600437520112800513506003701641650001801678650001801696650004001714650001701754650002001771650004301791650002101834650001301855650001901868650000901887650006101896650003901957650005501996650002302051650001102074650001102085650000902096650001602105650002402121650001702145651001602162651001902178653000902197700002002206700002602226700002302252773010502275852000902380856007702389655001202466IND4413172820221207110344.0081128s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441317282DNAL7 a187966192pmid7 aPMC25841782pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-03122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCleveringa, Frits G.W.10aCombined Task Delegation, Computerized Decision Support, and Feedback Improve Cardiovascular Risk for Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A cluster randomized trial in primary care  ap. 2273-2275.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE:--The Diabetes Care Protocol combines task delegation (a practice nurse), computerized decision support, and feedback every 3 months.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--In a cluster randomized trial, mean changes in cardiovascular risk factors between the intervention and control groups after 1 year were calculated by generalized linear models. RESULTS:--Throughout the Netherlands, 26 intervention practices included 1,699 patients and 29 control practices 1,692 patients. The difference in A1C change was not significant, whereas total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure improved significantly more in the intervention group. The 10-year coronary heart disease risk estimate of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study improved 1.4% more in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS:--Delegation of routine diabetes care to a practice nurse combined with computerized decision support and feedback did not improve A1C but reduced cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes patients.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alinear models 3arisk estimate 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3arisk factors 3acontrol methods 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3acoronary disease 3apatients 3ablood pressure 2aAged 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aDecision Support Systems, Clinical 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplicationsxtherapy. 2aDisease Management 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrimary Health Care 2aRisk Factors 3aNetherlands 3aUnited Kingdom 0arisk1 aGorter, Kees J.1 avan den Donk, Maureen1 aRutten, Guy E.H.M.0 tDiabetes care.g2008 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.2273-2275dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-03123Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03681naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002400178245008800202300001800290500002400308506007600332520185400408506003702262650001302299650001902312650002802331650002502359650002502384650001402409650001702423650000802440650001102448650001502459650002602474650004302500650001502543650001302558650000902571650000902580650004502589650003602634650003702670650003502707650001102742650001102753650003202764650000902796650001602805700002602821700002102847700002002868773010502888852000902993856007703002655001203079IND4413172020221207110325.0081128s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441317202DNAL7 a187686752pmid7 aPMC25841702pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-12992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Caroline K.10aImpact of White-Coat Hypertension on Microvascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetes  ap. 2233-2237.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE:--The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of white-coat hypertension (WCH) on microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--A cross-sectional study was conducted in normotensive patients and patients with WCH selected from a cohort of 319 type 2 diabetic patients. Normotension was defined by office blood pressure <140/90 mmHg and daytime blood pressure <135/85 mmHg on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). WCH was defined as office blood pressure greater-than-or-equal140/90 mmHg and daytime blood pressure <135/85 mmHg on ABPM. Subjects were evaluated for diabetic nephropathy (24-h urinary albumin excretion rate) and diabetic retinopathy (classified according to the Global Diabetic Retinopathy Group). RESULTS:--Forty-six type 2 diabetic patients had WCH (14.4%; mean age 56.6 years; 45.3% men) and 117 had normotension (36.6%; mean age 55.8 years; 37.5% men). These groups did not differ in clinical and main laboratory characteristics. Systolic ABPM (24-h: 124.7 ± 6.7 vs. 121.0 ± 8.5 mmHg, P = 0.01 and daytime: 126.6 ± 7.2 vs. 123.2 ± 8.2 mmHg, P = 0.01) and blood pressure loads were higher in subjects with WCH than in the normotensive subjects. WCH was associated with an increased risk for macroalbuminuria (odds ratio 4.9 [95% CI 1.3-18.7], P = 0.01). On multivariate analysis models, WCH was associated with macroalbuminuria (2.0 [1.3-3.2], P = 0.02) and increased the risk for both nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (2.7 [1.2-6.6], P = 0.02 for any degree of diabetic retinopathy) after adjustments for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS:--Type 2 diabetic patients with WCH have an increased risk for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, WCH should not be considered a harmless condition, and treatment should be considered.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalbumins 3ablood pressure 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetic nephropathy 3adiabetic retinopathy 3aexcretion 3ahypertension 3amen 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3arisk 2aAged 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplications 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxetiology 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesxetiology 2aDiabetic Retinopathyxetiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxcomplications 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged1 aLeitão, Cristiane B.1 aCanani, Luís H.1 aGross, Jorge L.0 tDiabetes care.g2008 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.2233-2237dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-12993Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02813naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002300178245019400201300001800395500002400413506007600437520109200513506003701605650001801642650001201660650002101672650001701693650004301710650001301753650005201766650005601818650002401874650001101898650001101909650004101920650000901961650001601970650003301986650005202019700002002071700002102091700001602112773010502128852000902233856007702242655001202319IND4413173820221207110354.0081128s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441317382DNAL7 a188096312pmid7 aPMC25841882pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-10352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeFronzo, Ralph A.10aEfficacy and Safety of the Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitor Alogliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Inadequate Glycemic Control: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study  ap. 2315-2317.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE:--To evaluate the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor alogliptin in drug-naïve patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study included 329 patients with poorly controlled diabetes randomized to once-daily treatment with 12.5 mg alogliptin (n = 133), 25 mg alogliptin (n = 131), or placebo (n = 65) for 26 weeks. Primary efficacy end point was mean change from baseline in A1C at the final visit. RESULTS:--At week 26, mean change in A1C was significantly greater (P < 0.001) for 12.5 mg (-0.56%) and 25 mg (-0.59%) alogliptin than placebo (-0.02%). Reductions in fasting plasma glucose were also greater (P < 0.001) in alogliptin-treated patients than in those receiving placebo. Overall, incidences of adverse events (67.4-70.3%) and hypoglycemia (1.5-3.0%) were similar across treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS:--Alogliptin monotherapy was well tolerated and significantly improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, without raising the incidence of hypoglycemia.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood glucose 3afasting 3aglycemic control 3ahypoglycemia 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdrug therapy. 2aDipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitorsxtherapeutic use 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPiperidinesxtherapeutic use 2aUracilxanalogs & derivativesxtherapeutic use.1 aFleck, Penny R.1 aWilson, Craig A.1 aMekki, Qais0 tDiabetes care.g2008 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.2315-2317dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-10353Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02864naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002000178245007000198300001800268500002400286506007600310520125600386506003701642650001001679650001701689650001101706650001401717650004301731650001301774650001501787650002401802650000901826650001001835650000901845650001901854650004101873650001101914650001101925650000901936650001601945650003201961650002001993700001502013700002102028700001802049700002902067700002302096773010502119852000902224856007702233655001202310IND4413173520221207110347.0081128s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441317352DNAL7 a188096292pmid7 aPMC25841852pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-10472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWells, Brian J.10aPredicting 6-Year Mortality Risk in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes  ap. 2301-2306.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE:--The objective of this study was to create a tool that predicts the risk of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--This study was based on a cohort of 33,067 patients with type 2 diabetes identified in the Cleveland Clinic electronic health record (EHR) who were initially prescribed a single oral hypoglycemic agent between 1998 and 2006. Mortality was determined in the EHR and the Social Security Death Index. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was created using medication class and 20 other predictor variables chosen for their association with mortality. A prediction tool was created using the Cox model coefficients. The tool was internally validated using repeated, random subsets of the cohort, which were not used to create the prediction model. RESULTS:--Follow-up in the cohort ranged from 1 day to 8.2 years (median 28.6 months), and 3,661 deaths were observed. The prediction tool had a concordance index (i.e., c statistic) of 0.752. CONCLUSIONS:--We successfully created a tool that accurately predicts mortality risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. The incorporation of medications into mortality predictions in patients with type 2 diabetes should improve treatment decisions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adeath 3adrug therapy 3amodels 3amortality 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xmortality 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRisk Assessment1 aJain, Anil1 aArrigain, Susana1 aYu, Changhong1 aRosenkrans, Wayne A.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Diabetic patients hospitalized in a diabetic foot department with a foot ulcer were prospectively enrolled if they had been free of antibiotic treatment over the previous 6 months. At admission, ulcers were classified as infected or noninfected on the basis of clinical examination, according to the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot system. Only patients carrying S. aureus as the sole pathogen were included. In individuals with a grade 1 ulcer, a second bacterial specimen was obtained 1 month later. Using virulence genotyping markers, clonality tools, and an in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans model, we correlated the virulence of 132 S. aureus strains with grade, time of collection, and ulcer outcome. RESULTS:--Among virulence genes, the most relevant combination derived from the logistic regression was the association of cap8, sea, sei, lukE, and hlgv (area under the curve 0.958). These markers were useful to distinguish noninfected (grade 1) from infected (grades 2-4) ulcers and to predict wound status at the follow-up. With use of the nematode model, S. aureus strains isolated from grade 1 ulcers were found to be significantly less virulent than strains from ulcers at or above grade 2 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:--This study highlights the coexistence of two S. aureus populations on diabetic foot ulcers. A combination of five genes that may help distinguish colonized grade 1 from infected grade greater-than-or-equal2 wounds, predict ulcer outcome, and contribute to more appropriate use of antibiotics was discovered.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibiotics 3aclinical examination 3agenes 3agenotyping 3amodels 3apathogens 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3avirulence 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aFemale 2aFoot Ulcerxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aVirulence1 aLina, Gérard1 aRichard, Jean-Louis1 aCombescure, Christophe1 aBourg, Gisèle1 aVidal, Laure1 aJourdan, Nathalie1 aEtienne, Jérôme1 aLavigne, Jean-Philippe0 tDiabetes care.g2008 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.2318-2324dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-10103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02597naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245016200165300001600327500002400343500001500367520132000382650001901702650002001721650002201741650002301763650002301786650002301809650003201832650001901864650001601883650004101899653004101940700001701981700001801998773009802016852000902114856008802123655001202211IND4413095620221121092415.0081128s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441309562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.10.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Hsin-Pin10aPurge-assisted headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for determination of chlorophenols in aqueous samples  ap. 245-248.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA simple, economical and very effective method is demonstrated for simultaneous determination of 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol and pentachlorophenol, in aqueous samples, by using purge-assisted headspace solid-phase microextraction (PA/HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the new method, purging the sample enhances the removal of the trace chlorophenols without derivatization from the matrices to the headspace. Extraction parameters including extraction temperature, purge gas flow rate and extraction time were systematically investigated. Under optimal conditions, the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were 4-11% at 50pg/mL and 5-14% at 5pg/mL, respectively. The recoveries were in the range of 83-114%. Detection limits were determined at the fg level. These results indicate that PA/HS-SPME provides a significant contribution to highly efficient extraction of semi-volatile CPs, especially for pentachlorophenol, which has the smallest Henry's constant and large octanol-water partitioning coefficient. In addition, the proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of chlorophenols in landfill leachate.

The extraction fiber types and the desorption conditions were studied, and the method precision was also investigated. After the investigation, the optimal fiber was divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydemethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS), and the optimal desorption condition was 250°C for 3min. The method precision was from 2% to 11%. Finally, the proposed method was tested by its application of the analysis of VOCs in MCS from 10 brands of cigarettes and one reference cigarette. A total of 70 volatile compounds were identified by the proposed method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was a simple, rapid, reliable, and solvent-free technique for the determination of VOCs in MCS. 3aorganic compounds 3avolatile organic compounds 3arapid methods 3acigarettes 3asolid phase microextraction 3adesorption 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0agas-chromatography-mass spectrometry0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 Dec. 12, v. 1213, no. 2 p.239-244dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.10.0633Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02456naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245015000164300001400314500002400328520136300352650001401715650001201729650001401741650001101755650003201766650000901798650000901807650001501816650001601831650001901847650001101866700002501877773009501902852000901997856008802006655001202094IND4413096720221121092346.0081128s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441309672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Phil10aUse of complexing reagents as additives to the eluent for optimization of separation selectivity in high-performance chelation ion chromatography  ap. 45-49.  aIncludes references  aThis paper details a study of the selectivity characteristics of high-performance chelation ion chromatography when separating a range of metal ions with a number of complexing eluents. It shows that exploitation of competitive metal complexation between ligands in the eluent and surface bonded chelating groups allows a wide range of control over the retention order and selectivity coefficients of groups of metal ions for specific applications. An indication of the metal separation characteristics found for simple non-complexing eluents on iminodiacetic acid (IDA) silica bonded substrates is given first, followed by an illustration of the selectivity changes that can be achieved by using complexing eluents. Using a novel approach, plots of logβ₁ of the metal complexes of a chosen eluent ligand against the surface bonded IDA metal complexes were found to be useful indicators of which metals may show unusual selectivity changes during separation. Example chromatograms of metal separations are given for three selected complexing eluent reagents, namely, oxalic acid, picolinic acid, and chloride, either singly or in admixture. For special mention it was found that very specific retention control could be achieved for Cu(II) with picolinic acid, Fe(III) and Fe(II) speciation with oxalic acid, Pb with dipicolinic acid and Cd with chloride. 3aadditives 3acadmium 3achelation 3acopper 3aion exchange chromatography 3airon 3alead 3ametal ions 3aoxalic acid 3apicolinic acid 3asilica1 aNesterenko, Pavel N.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 Dec. 5, v. 1213, no. 1 p.45-49dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.10.0103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02351naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245012600166300001400292500002400306520118800330650001201518650001401530650001901544650001901563650002001582650002101602650001701623650001301640650000901653650001701662650001501679700001801694700001701712700001901729700001301748773009501761852000901856856008801865655001201953IND4413096920221121070114.0081128s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441309692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen-Tu, Chao10aArsenic species analysis by ion chromatography-bianode electrochemical hydride generator-atomic fluorescence spectrometry  ap. 56-61.  aIncludes references  aIn this work, a novel hyphenated technique ion chromatography-bianode electrochemical hydride generator-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (IC-BAECHG-AFS) system was developed for on-line simultaneous analysis of arsenite (As(III)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and arsenate (As(V)). Parameters that might affect hydride generation efficiency were investigated and the interference of various ions was also examined. Under the optimal conditions, the hydride generation efficiency of bianode electrochemical hydride generator (BAECHG) was close to the hydride generation efficiency of chemical hydride generator (CHG). The linear ranges were 5-200μgL⁻¹ for As(III), DMA and MMA and 10-200μgL⁻¹ for As(V). The limits of detection (LOD, S/N=3) were 3.04, 4.27, 3.97 and 9.30μgL⁻¹ for As(III), DMA, MMA and As(V), respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSD, n =7) of As(III), DMA, MMA and As(V) were 4, 3, 5 and 4%, respectively. The proposed method was also applied to the determination of the four arsenic species in dental pulp inactivative agent (type I).

This stationary phase, typically used for the separation of proteins, is composed of long chain poly-iminodiacetic acid groups grafted to a hydrophilic layer surrounding a 10μm polymeric bead. Through the use of a combination of a multi-step pH and picolinic acid gradient, the separation of magnesium, iron, cobalt, cadmium, zinc, lead and copper was possible, followed by post-column reaction with 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR) and absorbance detection at 510nm using a novel and inexpensive optical detector, comprised of two light emitting diodes with one acting as a light source and the other as a detector. Column efficiency for selective transition metals was in excess of N =10,000, with the baseline separation of seven metal cations in <3min possible under optimised conditions. Detection limits of between 5 and 81μg/L were possible based upon a 50μL injection volume. 3aabsorbance 3acadmium 3acations 3achromatography 3acobalt 3acopper 3adetection limit 3ahydrophilicity 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3apH 3apicolinic acid 3apolymers 3aproteins 3aresorcinol 3azinc1 aO'Toole, Martina1 aDiamond, Dermot1 aNesterenko, Pavel N.1 aPaull, Brett0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 Dec. 5, v. 1213, no. 1 p.31-36dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.08.0493Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02324naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008000165300001600245500002400261520108800285650001401373650001301387650001601400650001401416650001601430650001801446650006601464650001901530650002201549650001301571650001501584650001701599650002401616650002001640650001101660700001601671700002101687773010001708852000901808856008501817655001201902IND4412942020221121070205.0081121s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441294202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-008-0417-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiau, Rong-Jen10aIdentification of three proteins up-regulated by raw starch in Cytophaga sp  ap. 651-655.  aIncludes references  aRaw starch-digesting amylases (RSDAs) in many microorganisms convert starch granules into maltodextrins and simple sugars. We cloned and sequenced from Cytophaga sp. an RSDA with an excellent raw starch digestion activity. This RSDA was highly inducible by raw starch, but not by other sugars, suggesting that an unknown signal transduction mechanism is involved in the degradation of raw starch. We used a proteomic approach to investigate the effect of raw starch on protein expression in Cytophaga sp. Using MALDI-TOF MS protein analysis, we have identified three proteins up-regulated by raw starch, i.e., a 60-kDa chaperonin (cpn60), glutaminase, and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Subsequent time-course studies detected an increased expression of RSDA as well as the highest expression of PPDK occurring 6 h post-incubation with raw corn starch, implying that the latter enzyme may work along with RSDA on the digestion of raw starch. Finding these proteins up-regulated by raw starch may provide an insight into how Cytophaga sp. cells respond to raw starch stimulation. 3aCytophaga 3aamylases 3acorn starch 3adigestion 3aglutaminase 3amaltodextrins 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amicroorganisms 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3apyruvic acid 3asignal transduction 3astarch granules 3asugars1 aWen, Yu-Der1 aJeang, Chii-Ling0 tArchives of microbiology.g2008 Dec., v. 190, no. 6 p.651-655dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-008-0417-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02657naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245019500167300001600362500002400378520124300402650002001645650002701665650002201692650001001714650002701724650001101751650001201762650002501774650001601799651001001815700002001825700002401845700002101869700005601890700002001946700002601966700003301992700002602025773011502051852000902166856004802175655001202223IND4418729320221121053917.0090403e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441872932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-008-9367-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrasco, Basilio10aGenetic structure of highland papayas (Vasconcellea pubescens (Lenné et C.

Additionally this species produces latex with a high level of papain, an important and valuable proteolytic enzyme with industrial applications. In this investigation seven ISSR primers were used to study the level and organization of genetic diversity in 333 samples of V. pubescens. Out of the 114 bands recorded, 63 proved to be polymorphic (P = 55.3%). At the species level, the genetic diversity was rather low (h = 0.01 ± 6,80188E-05, Shannon's Index I = 0.16 ± 0,000148). The major portion of the genetic diversity was found within groups (65%). The genetic differentiation between the different groups was significant, as the AMOVA analysis suggested (Φpt = 0.35). When analysing the Northern area alone, the differentiation increased to Φpt = 0.40. When only the Southern area was analysed, Φpt decreased to 0.18, indicating greater genetic similarity among the samples. The results generated from Structure and Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure distinguished 8 genetically different groups, five of them located in the north and three in the south. The results are discussed in the light of the growers' practices. 3aBayesian theory 3aVasconcellea pubescens 3agenetic variation 3alatex 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apapain 3apapayas 3apopulation structure 3aproteolysis 3aChile1 aAvila, Patricio1 aPérez Diaz, Jorge.1 aMuñoz, Patricio1 aGarcía, Rolando V.q(Rolando Víctor),d1919-2012.1 aLavandero, Blas1 aZurita-Silva, Andrés1 aRetamales, J.

CHAPS prevents the adsorption of proteins to the stationary phase, i.e., weakly acidic cation-exchange resin, since it aggregates proteins without denaturing them. Addition of 1mM CHAPS to the eluent comprising 6mM tartaric acid and 7mM 18-crown-6 yielded reproducible separations of anions and cations in protein-containing saliva.

All the SSR markers were analyzed throughout the genome and compared among eight linkage groups. Linkage group 4 performed well in number of alleles per locus (Na) and effective number of alleles (Ne), in which marker BPPCT040 was prominent, with an Ne of 8.46 and Na of 10. For assessment of genetic diversity, the observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity were measured, resulting in average values of 0.419 and 0.644, respectively. Furthermore, the highest values occurred in linkage group 4 compared with all chromosomes. The mean values of Shannon's information index ranged from 0.9859 in linkage group 2 to 1.4773 in linkage group 8, with an average of 1.2025. All the apricot accessions were calculated under K=4 and grouped into four clusters according to the Q value inferred by STRUCTURE software, using a model-based method. More than 85% of apricot accessions had a maximum Q, which was more than 0.80 for the four inferred Q values. Four subgroups of 29 apricot accessions were irregular in their geographical origins, based on the results from STRUCTURE. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) indicated that the three inferred subgroup gene pools were closely related. The north Chinese apricot gene flow in the Yellow River Basin area is very complex and frequent. The reason is likely the introduction of cultivation and selection by humans of North China during their long history, and the complexity between the various eco-geographical groups for germplasm penetration. 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aalleles 3aapricots 3acomputer software 3aecology 3agene flow 3agene pool 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheterozygosity 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultidimensional scaling 3aprovenance 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYellow River1 aLiu, D.

The concentrations of copper, zinc, iron, calcium, potassium, and magnesium were determined in serum by atomic absorption spectrometry in two study groups (n = 25 each), one of which served as untreated controls. After exercising the horses by running 1,500 m in about 7 min, only the copper level and the copper/zinc ratio significantly increased (p < 0.05), but the concentrations of calcium, potassium, iron, and magnesium remained unchanged. In horses treated with vitamin E and selenium, the calcium and potassium levels decreased to levels lower than those of untreated controls before and after exercise. The iron levels were not changed by exercise or treatment alone but increased when the horses had been supplemented and exercised. The copper level and the copper/zinc ration increased as a result of exercise in both treated and untreated horses. These changes suggest that supplementation with vitamin E and selenium had an important effect on the serum concentrations of calcium, potassium, copper, iron, and the copper/zinc ratio. 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acopper 3aexercise 3ahorses 3airon 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3aselenium 3avitamin E 3azinc1 aDede, Semiha1 aDeger, Yeter1 aKilicalp, D.0 tBiological trace element research.g2008 Dec., v. 125, no. 3 p.223-228dHumana Press Incx0163-49847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-008-8109-83Available from publisher's Web site Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02279naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002900147245008300176300001600259500002400275520129800299650001801597650002001615650001901635650001201654650001201666650000901678650001701687700002401704700002301728773010601751852000901857856008701866655001201953IND4412263620221121033122.0081104s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441226362DNAL7 a10.1094/ATS-2008-0421-02-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalewski, Alexander R.10aPre-harvest Core Cultivation of Sod Provides an Alternative Cultivation Timing  ap. 450-459.  aIncludes references  aWhen sand-based athletic fields are renovated with sod, soil textural discontinuity between the sod and the underlying soil is often an issue. Core cultivation can address this issue, but when immediate use of the playing surface is required this practice is often delayed. One possible solution is pre-harvest core cultivation of the sod. Objectives of this study were to determine if pre-harvest core cultivation of Poa pratensis L. sod would decrease strength and weight of sod at harvest, and secondly, if pre-harvest core cultivation can be performed without being detrimental to sod establishment. Pre-harvest and post-establishment core cultivation treatments, both conducted to affect 6% and 12% surface area, plus non-cultivated controls were imposed on sod harvested with conventional (small rolls) and big roll methods at three sites. Pre-harvest core cultivation reduced sod weight up to 18% and strength up to 48% at harvest. Stability of the turf at 40 to 48 days after installation (DAI) was reduced with all core cultivation treatments, regardless of timing based on shear vane strength. However no differences in stability were measured at 72 DAI. Rooting strength and turf shear test strength of pre-harvest core treatments were not affected after 40 and 48 DAI respectively. 3aPoa pratensis 3aathletic fields 3alawns and turf 3arooting 3asodding 3asoil 3asurface area1 aRogers III, John N.1 aVanLoo, Timothy D.0 tApplied turfgrass science.g2008,  p.450-459dPlant Management NetworkwJournal:6163x1552-58217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/ATS-2008-0421-02-RS3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02511naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245010600165300001400271500002400285520145700309650001501766650001201781650002101793650001201814650001601826650002301842650003201865650002601897650001301923650001101936700001901947773009801966852000902064856008802073655001202161IND4412341120221121033009.0081107s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441234112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.09.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Yinying10aRapid monoclonal antibody adsorption on dextran-grafted agarose media for ion-exchange chromatography  ap. 70-79.  aIncludes references  aThe binding capacity and adsorption kinetics of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) are measured for experimental cation exchangers obtained by grafting dextran polymers to agarose beads and compared with measurements for two commercial agarose-based cation exchangers with and without dextran grafts. Introduction of charged dextran polymers results in enhanced adsorption kinetics despite a dramatic reduction of the accessible pore size as determined by inverse size-exclusion chromatography. Incorporation of neutral dextran polymers in a charged agarose bead results instead in substantially lower binding capacities. The effective pore diffusivities obtained from batch uptake curves increase substantially as the protein concentration is reduced for the resins containing charged dextran grafts, but are much less dependent on protein concentration for the resins with no dextran or uncharged dextran grafts. The batch uptake results are corroborated by microscopic observations of transient adsorption in individual particles. In all cases studied, the adsorption kinetics is characterized by a sharp adsorption front consistent with a shell-progressive, diffusion limited mechanism. Greatly enhanced transport rates are obtained with an experimental resin containing charged dextran grafts with effective pore diffusivities that are 1-9 times larger than the free solution diffusivity and adsorption capacity approaching 300mg/cm³ of particle volume. 3aadsorption 3aagarose 3abinding capacity 3adextran 3adiffusivity 3agel chromatography 3aion exchange chromatography 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolymers 3aresins1 aCarta, Giorgio0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 Nov. 21, v. 1211, no. 1-2 p.70-79dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.09.0963Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02373naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245015100176300001800327500002800345520123200373650003101605650001101636653002501647653002801672653002001700700002501720700002001745700002201765700002501787773011101812852000901923856009201932946001102024655001202035IND4418552020221120185614.0090403s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441855202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06979.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Monica E.10aActivator-binding domains of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex characterized in vitro are required for its recruitment to promoters in vivo  ap. 2557-2565.  aPublisher supplied data  aInteraction between acidic activation domains and the activator-binding domains of Swi1 and Snf5 of the yeast SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex has previously been characterized in vitro. Although deletion of both activator-binding domains leads to phenotypes that differ from the wild-type, their relative importance for SWI/SNF recruitment to target genes has not been investigated. In the present study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to investigate the individual and collective importance of the activator-binding domains for SWI/SNF recruitment to genes within the GAL regulon in vivo. We also investigated the consequences of defective SWI/SNF recruitment for target gene activation. We demonstrate that deletion of both activator-binding domains essentially abolishes galactose-induced SWI/SNF recruitment and causes a reduction in transcriptional activation similar in magnitude to that associated with a complete loss of SWI/SNF activity. The activator-binding domains in Swi1 and Snf5 make approximately equal contributions to the recruitment of SWI/SNF to each of the genes studied. The requirement for SWI/SNF recruitment correlates with GAL genes that are highly and rapidly induced by galactose. 3atranscriptional activation 3ayeasts 0achromatin remodeling 0acoactivator recruitment 0aSWI/SNF complex1 aProchasson, Philippe1 aBerndt, Kurt D.1 aWorkman, Jerry L.1 aWright, Anthony P.H.0 tFEBS journal.g2009 May, v. 276, no. 9 p.2557-2565dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06979.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03273naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245020800176300001800384520155100402650001501953650002301968650002501991650001202016650001402028650001402042650001902056650002102075650001902096650003002115650001402145650002402159650002002183650003602203653003402239653001802273653001002291653001002301700002702311700001902338700001802357700002602375700001202401700002002413700002502433700001702458773011102475852000902586856009202595930003302687946001102720655001202731IND4418551620221120185647.0090403e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441855162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06975.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTadlaoui Hbibi, Ali10aEfficient killing of SW480 colon carcinoma cells by a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 hairpin decoy oligodeoxynucleotide - interference with interferon-γ-STAT1-mediated killing  ap. 2505-2515.  aThe signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) convey signals from the membrane to the nucleus in response to cytokines or growth factors. STAT3 is activated in response to cytokines involved mostly in cell proliferation; STAT1 is activated by cytokines, including interferon-γ, involved in defence against pathogens and the inhibition of cell proliferation. STAT3, which is frequently activated in tumour cells, is a valuable target with respect to achieving inhibition of tumour cell proliferation. Indeed, its inhibition results in cell death. We previously observed that inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB, a key regulator of cell proliferation, with decoy oligodeoxynucleotides results in cell death. We used a similar approach for STAT3. A hairpin STAT3 oligodeoxynucleotide was added to a colon carcinoma cell line in which it induced cell death as efficiently as the STAT3 inhibitor stattic. The hairpin STAT3 oligodeoxynucleotide co-localized with STAT3 within the cytoplasm, prevented STAT3 localization to the nucleus, blocked a cyclin D1 reporter promoter and associated with STAT3 in pull-down assays. However, the same cells were efficiently killed by interferon-γ. This effect was counteracted by the STAT3 oligodeoxynucleotide, which was found to efficiently inhibit STAT1. Thus, although it can inhibit STAT3, the hairpin STAT3 oligodeoxynucleotide appears also to inhibit STAT1-mediated interferon-γ cell killing, highlighting the need to optimize STAT3-targeting oligodeoxynucleotides. 3acell death 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acyclins 3acytokines 3acytoplasm 3agrowth factors 3ainterferon-gamma 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apathogens 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0ahairpin decoy oligonucleotide 0ainterferon-γ 0aSTAT1 0aSTAT31 aLaguillier, Christelle1 aSouissi, Inès1 aLesage, Denis1 aLe Coquil, Stéphanie1 aCao, An1 aMetelev, Valeri1 aBaran-Marszak, Fanny1 aFagard, Remi0 tFEBS journal.g2009 May, v. 276, no. 9 p.2505-2515dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06975.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03243naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245015300172300001800325520185500343650002302198650003202221650001502253650002502268650001202293650001602305650001602321650001102337650000902348650001402357650001202371650001202383650001402395653002002409653001102429653001502440700002502455700002502480700002402505773011102529852000902640856009202649930003302741946001102774655001202785IND4418551820221120185718.0090403e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441855182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06977.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanuru, Madhavi10aIon-binding properties of Calnuc, Ca²⁺ versus Mg²⁺- Calnuc adopts additional and unusual Ca²⁺-binding sites upon interaction with G-protein  ap. 2529-2546.  aCalnuc is a novel, highly modular, EF-hand containing, Ca²⁺-binding, Golgi resident protein whose functions are not clear. Using amino acid sequences, we demonstrate that Calnuc is a highly conserved protein among various organisms, from Ciona intestinalis to humans. Maximum homology among all sequences is found in the region that binds to G-proteins. In humans, it is known to be expressed in a variety of tissues, and it interacts with several important protein partners. Among other proteins, Calnuc is known to interact with heterotrimeric G-proteins, specifically with the α-subunit. Herein, we report the structural implications of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ binding, and illustrate that Calnuc functions as a downstream effector for G-protein α-subunit. Our results show that Ca²⁺ binds with an affinity of 7 μ m and causes structural changes. Although Mg²⁺ binds to Calnuc with very weak affinity, the structural changes that it causes are further enhanced by Ca²⁺ binding. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry results show that Calnuc and the G-protein bind with an affinity of 13 n m. We also predict a probable function for Calnuc, that of maintaining Ca²⁺ homeostasis in the cell. Using Stains-all and terbium as Ca²⁺ mimic probes, we demonstrate that the Ca²⁺-binding ability of Calnuc is governed by the activity-based conformational state of the G-protein. We propose that Calnuc adopts structural sites similar to the ones seen in proteins such as annexins, c2 domains or chromogrannin A, and therefore binds more calcium ions upon binding to Giα. With the number of organelle-targeted G-protein-coupled receptors increasing, intracellular communication mediated by G-proteins could become a new paradigm. In this regard, we propose that Calnuc could be involved in the downstream signaling of G-proteins. 3aCiona intestinalis 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aG-proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3acalcium 3acalorimetry 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aions 3amagnesium 3aterbium 3atissues 3atitration 0aCa²⁺ binding 0aCalnuc 0aStains-all1 aSamuel, Jebakumar J.1 aBalivada, Lavanya M.1 aAradhyam, Gopala K.0 tFEBS journal.g2009 May, v. 276, no. 9 p.2529-2546dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06977.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02315naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245014200177300001600319520097800335650001501313650001401328650001201342650001501354650001501369650001101384650001801395650001401413650002101427650001401448650001301462650001801475651001401493653002301507653001101530653002301541700001901564700002401583773011701607852000901724856009201733930003301825946001101858655001201869IND4418544220221120182302.0090403e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441854422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02145.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco, Luz Adriana10aEffect of the density on the growth and survival of the Caribbean scallops Argopecten nucleus and Nodipecten nodosus in suspended culture  ap. 687-695.  aJuveniles of the Caribbean scallops Argopecten nucleus and Nodipecten nodosus were suspended in pearl nets at densities of 25%, 30% and 50% coverage of the bottom of the net (BC) during days. Additionally, adults of A. nucleus (>35 mm) were placed in lantern nets at densities of 40%, 50% and 65% BC during days. Stocking density affected the growth of animals, with higher growth rates obtained at the lower densities. Although the survival of the two scallops was not influenced at the densities studied, the 15-day net changes, and culture in water of <28 °C produced better survival of A. nucleus and N. nodosus respectively. Predators of the families Cymatiidae, Grapsidae, Portunidae, Majidae and Xanthidae were found in the culture nets of juvenile A. nucleus, but during the adult phase they were absent. Predators exhibited a dense-independent behaviour in relation to scallops. There was not any association between predator frequency and survival of A. nucleus. 3aArgopecten 3aGrapsidae 3aMajidae 3aNodipecten 3aPortunidae 3aadults 3aanimal growth 3ajuveniles 3anets (equipment) 3apredators 3ascallops 3astocking rate 3aCaribbean 0aArgopecten nucleus 0agrowth 0aNodipecten nodosus1 aBarros, Judith1 aGuerrero, Alejandra0 tAquaculture research.g2009 Apr., v. 40, no. 6 p.687-695dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02145.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03083naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245012100179300001600300520154400316650003101860650001901891650001001910650001901920650003101939650002401970650001001994650001002004650002602014650001902040650001502059650001802074650001402092650002402106650001102130650004202141650002702183650001302210650001902223653001502242653001002257700002402267700002402291773011702315852000902432856009202441930003302533946001102566655001202577IND4418543720221120182436.0090403e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441854372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02136.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWonglapsuwan, Monwadee10aDynamic changes in gene expression during vitellogenic stages of the white shrimp: Fenneropenaeus merguiensis de Man  ap. 633-643.  aOvarian maturation is a crucial step for shrimp brood stock. A suppressive subtractive hybridization was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the ovaries during vitellogenesis of Fenneropenaeus merguiensis. Three- to sevenfold up-regulated genes were selected. A blast search identified nine unique genes. The genes that may be involved in ovarian maturation, namely translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), H-L(3)MBT-LIKE, shrimp ovarian peritrophin (SOP), vitellin (Vn), thrombospondin (TSP) and ribosomal protein L10a (RPL10a), were further studied. The transcripts of HSP70, TCTP, SOP and RPL10a in the ovary showed their highest expression in the early stage and declined in the later stages. In contrast, the transcripts of the H-L(3)MBT-LIKE, TSP and Vn genes increased from the early stage to be significantly up-regulated during the late stage. A comparison of gene expression among organs during the vitellogenesis showed that the transcripts of HSP70, SOP, H-L(3)MBT-LIKE and TSP were down-regulated in the brain, intestine, hepatopancreas and lymphoid (except for TSP) when compared with their expression in shrimp with non-developed ovaries. The mRNA of TCTP and RPL10a was significantly over-expressed in the lymphoid and heart, whereas TCTP transcripts were significantly down-regulated in the brain during the vitellogenesis. The molecular behaviour of the transcripts in this study may, in the future, lead to an ability to stimulate the ovarian development in shrimp. 3aFenneropenaeus merguiensis 3aanimal ovaries 3abrain 3abreeding stock 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aheart 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ahepatopancreas 3aintestines 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasms 3aovarian development 3ashrimp 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3atranslation (genetics) 3avitellin 3avitellogenesis 0aexpression 0aovary1 aPhongdara, Amornrat1 aChotigeat, Wilaiwan0 tAquaculture research.g2009 Apr., v. 40, no. 6 p.633-643dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02136.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03567naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245015600203300001800359500002400377506007600401520192900477506003702406650001502443650002002458650001202478650001302490650001402503650002402517650001102541650001802552650002202570650003702592650001202629650001402641650003602655650001302691650001502704700002402719700002002743700001402763700002202777700002302799700002002822773011802842852000902960856008002969655001203049IND4412874820221207100459.0081121s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441287482DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.00843-082doi7 aPMC25835922pmcid7 a188096622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Lisa M.10aVibrio cholerae Flagellins Induce Toll-Like Receptor 5-Mediated Interleukin-8 Production through Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase and NF-κB Activation  ap. 5524-5534.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVaccine reactogenicity has complicated the development of safe and effective live, oral cholera vaccines. Δctx Vibrio cholerae mutants have been shown to induce inflammatory diarrhea in volunteers and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production in cultured intestinal epithelial cells. Bacterial flagellins are known to induce IL-8 production through Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). Since the V. cholerae genome encodes five distinct flagellin proteins, FlaA to FlaE, with homology to conserved TLR5 recognition regions of Salmonella FliC, we hypothesized that V. cholerae flagellins may contribute to IL-8 induction through TLR5 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Each purified recombinant V. cholerae flagellin induced IL-8 production in T84 intestinal epithelial cells and also induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation in HEK293T/TLR5 transfectants, which was blocked by cotransfection with a TLR5 dominant-negative construct, demonstrating TLR5 specificity. Supernatants derived from ΔflaAC and ΔflaEDB mutants induced IL-8 production in HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells and in HEK293T cells overexpressing TLR5, whereas ΔflaABCDE supernatants induced significantly less IL-8 production, demonstrating the contribution of multiple flagellins in IL-8 induction. NF-κB activation by ΔflaABCDE supernatants was partially restored by flaA or flaAC complementation. Western analysis confirmed the presence of V. cholerae flagellins in culture supernatants. Purified recombinant V. cholerae FlaA activated the MAPKs p38, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) in T84 cells. FlaA-induced IL-8 production in T84 cells was inhibited by the p38 inhibitor in combination with either the JNK or ERK inhibitors. Collectively, these data suggest that V. cholerae flagellins are present in culture supernatants and can induce TLR5- and MAPK-dependent IL-8 secretion in host cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3aVibrio cholerae 3acholera 3adiarrhea 3aflagellin 3agene overexpression 3agenome 3ainterleukin-8 3aintestinal mucosa 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3asecretion 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3avaccines 3avolunteers1 aRallabhandi, Prasad1 aMichalski, Jane1 aZhou, Xin1 aSteyert, Susan R.1 aVogel, Stefanie N.1 aKaper, James B.0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 Dec., v. 76, no. 12 p.5524-5534dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00843-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04185naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002400181245013400205300001800339500002400357500001500381506007600396520131700472506003701789650001401826650002101840650002201861650002301883650001101906650001401917650001701931650001601948650001601964650001501980650001101995650001002006650000902016650001902025650001502044650002202059650001202081650002802093650001502121650001202136650004602148650003802194650003102232650002802263650001102291650004102302650003302343650005402376650004302430650000902473650000902482650004002491650003102531650002802562650002702590650003502617650002202652653001602674700002502690700001902715700002502734700002502759700002502784700002402809700003102833700002102864700002702885700002302912700002202935700003002957700002502987700002403012700002803036773011803064852000903182856008003191655001203271IND4412875020221207100504.0081121s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441287502DNAL7 a187942822pmid7 aPMC25835942pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00683-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesquita, Rafael D.10aTrypanosoma cruzi Infection Is Enhanced by Vector Saliva through Immunosuppressant Mechanisms Mediated by Lysophosphatidylcholine  ap. 5543-5552.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTrypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, is transmitted by bug feces deposited on human skin during a blood meal. However, parasite infection occurs through the wound produced by insect mouthparts. Saliva of the Triatominae bug Rhodnius prolixus is a source of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Here, we tested the role of both triatomine saliva and LPC on parasite transmission. We show that vector saliva is a powerful inducer of cell chemotaxis. A massive number of inflammatory cells were found at the sites where LPC or saliva was inoculated into the skin of mice. LPC is a known chemoattractant for monocytes, but neutrophil recruitment induced by saliva is LPC independent. The preincubation of peritoneal macrophages with saliva or LPC increased fivefold the association of T. cruzi with these cells. Moreover, saliva and LPC block nitric oxide production by T. cruzi-exposed macrophages. The injection of saliva or LPC into mouse skin in the presence of the parasite induces an up-to-sixfold increase in blood parasitemia. Together, our data suggest that saliva of the Triatominae enhances T. cruzi transmission and that some of its biological effects are attributed to LPC. This is a demonstration that a vector-derived lysophospholipid may act as an enhancing factor of Chagas disease.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aparasites 3achemoattractants 3aRhodnius prolixus 3aetiological agents 3ahumans 3amonocytes 3anitric oxide 3amacrophages 3aparasitemia 3ablood meal 3asaliva 3afeces 3amice 3aChagas disease 3amouthparts 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3ainsects 3alysophosphatidylcholine 3achemotaxis 2aAnimals 2aChagas Diseaseximmunologyxtransmission. 2aChemotaxis, Leukocyteximmunology 2aChromatography, Thin Layer 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aHumans 2aImmunosuppressive Agentsximmunology 2aInsect Vectorsxparasitology 2aLysophosphatidylcholinesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aMacrophagesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aNeutrophil Infiltrationximmunology 2aNitric Oxidexbiosynthesis 2aParasitemiaximmunology 2aRhodniusxparasitology 2aSalivaxchemistryximmunology. 2aTrypanosoma cruzi 0arecruitment1 aCarneiro, Alan Brito1 aBafica, André1 aGazos Lopes, Felipe.1 aTakiya, Christina M.1 aSouto-Padron, Thaís1 aVieira, Danielle P.1 aFerreira-Pereira, Antônio1 aAlmeida, Igor C.1 aFigueiredo, Rodrigo T.1 aPorto, Bárbara N.1 aBozza, Marcelo T.1 aGraça-Souza, Aurélio V.1 aLopes, Angela H.C.S.1 aAtella, Geórgia C.1 aSilva-Neto, Mário A.C.0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 Dec., v. 76, no. 12 p.5543-5552dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00683-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03668naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003000171245013000201300001800331520136200349650000801711650001701719650001001736650001501746650001501761650001001776650001401786650002201800650001101822650000801833650001401841650001901855650002401874650001201898650003301910650002501943650001201968650002201980650002502002650001402027650003702041650001402078650002702092650002402119651001102143651001102154651001102165651001202176653001802188653001602206653001402222653001402236700001802250700001602268700001902284700002002303700002402323700002402347700002102371700002402392700002002416700002202436700002402458700002302482700002102505700002602526700002002552700001702572773011602589852000902705856009202714930003302806946001102839655001202850IND4418541620221120154358.0090403e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441854162DNAL7 a193023602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04134.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnett, A.

Using ancient DNA techniques, we obtained mitochondrial sequences from 52 individuals sampled across the present and former range of lions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three distinct clusters: (i) modern lions, Panthera leo; (ii) extinct Pleistocene cave lions, which formed a homogeneous population extending from Europe across Beringia (Siberia, Alaska and western Canada); and (iii) extinct American lions, which formed a separate population south of the Pleistocene ice sheets. The American lion appears to have become genetically isolated around 340 000 years ago, despite the apparent lack of significant barriers to gene flow with Beringian populations through much of the late Pleistocene. We found potential evidence of a severe population bottleneck in the cave lion during the previous interstadial, sometime after 48 000 years, adding to evidence from bison, mammoths, horses and brown bears that megafaunal populations underwent major genetic alterations throughout the last interstadial, potentially presaging the processes involved in the subsequent end-Pleistocene mass extinctions. 3aDNA 3aPanthera leo 3abison 3acarnivores 3aextinction 3afauna 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahorses 3aice 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3apopulation dynamics 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFossils 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aLionsxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 3aAfrica 3aAlaska 3aCanada 3aSiberia 0aAmerican lion 0aancient DNA 0acave lion 0amegafauna1 aShapiro, Beth1 aBarnes, Ian1 aHo, Simon Y.W.1 aBurger, Joachim1 aYamaguchi, Nobuyuki1 aHigham, Thomas F.G.1 aWheeler, H.

We examined the involvement of serine proteases in amoebic excystation and metacystic development using inhibitors specific for serine proteases. Entamoeba invadens IP-1 strain was used as the model of excystation and metacystic development of E. histolytica. Four serine protease inhibitors, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 4-(2-aminoethyl) bezensulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 3, 4-dichloroisocoumarin, and N-tosyl-phe-chloromethylketone, decreased the number of metacystic amoebae in a dose-dependent manner, without showing cytotoxicity to cysts. PMSF inhibited not only the increase but also the development of metacystic amoebae as determined by the change of nucleus number from four- to one-nucleate amoebae. The protease activity in cyst lysates was also inhibited by PMSF and the band of protease on gelatin sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was weaker than controls when treated with PMSF. Three serine protease families, S28 (three types), S9 (two), and S26 (one) were retrieved from the database of E. invadens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that amebic enzymes from the serine protease families formed different clades from those from other organisms. The expression levels of these serine proteases in cysts 5 h after the induction of excystation as assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were higher than those observed prior to induction assayed by real-time RT-PCR; the increase in one type of S9 (named S9-3) expression was the highest. The expression of S9 enzymes also increased from cysts to trophozoites higher than the other family serine proteases. Thus, the results show that Entamoeba uses their serine proteases in the excystation and metacystic development, which leads to successful infection. 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3acysteine proteinases 3acytotoxicity 3adatabases 3aexcystation 3agelatin 3amodels 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinase inhibitors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserine proteinases 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atrophozoites 2aAnimals 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aEntamoebaxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSerine Proteinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aTime Factors1 aKumagai, Masahiro1 aKobayashi, Seiki1 aTakeuchi, Tsutomu0 tParasitology research.g2009 Oct., v. 105, no. 4 p.977-987dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-009-1478-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02616naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245012200187300001800309500002400327500001500351520101700366650001001383650001601393650002801409650002301437650002101460650002001481650001501501650003101516650001201547650002201559650002701581650001101608650005801619650003001677650006001707650003201767650004201799651001001841651001001851653002401861700001801885700001401903773009901917852000902016856008502025655001202110IND4424943920221120104052.0090821s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442494392DNAL7 a195574362pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-009-1529-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagadum, Shivanand10aComparative efficacy of Annona squamosa and Azadirachta indica extracts against Boophilus microplus Izatnagar isolate  ap. 1085-1091.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the search of developing herbal acaricides, eight medicinal plants were screened for their efficacy against Boophilus microplus, the widely distributed tick species in India. Of the seven extracts screened, the extracts prepared from the Annona squamosa seed showed very high level of efficacy (70.8%) after 24 h of treatment. The effect of treatment on oviposition of the survived ticks was also assessed, and a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the reproductive index was noted in comparison to control. When efficacy of the in vitro optimized concentration of A. squamosa was compared with previously tested extract of Azadirachta indica in in vivo model, it was observed that the extracts prepared from A. indica is more efficacious than the extracts of A. squamosa. A comparable efficacy against B. microplus fed on animals treated with herbal extracts and commonly used synthetic acaricide was noted. The possibility of using the herbal extracts in IPM format for the management of ticks is discussed. 3aticks 3aoviposition 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aAzadirachta indica 3amedicinal plants 3aAnnona squamosa 3aacaricides 3aintegrated pest management 2aAnimals 2aAnnonaxchemistry 2aAzadirachtaxchemistry 2aCattle 2aInsecticidesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aOvipositionxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aRhipicephalusxdrug effects 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxdrug effects 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aBoophilus microplus1 aMondal, D.

TF administration increased the parasite-suppressed proliferative response of T and B lymphocytes of infected mice from weeks 8 to 12 or 14 post infection (p.i.), respectively, with the most stimulative effect after TF+ABZ therapy. The CD4 T cell presence in the spleen of infected mice with TF or TF+ABZ therapy was increased from weeks 6 to 12 or 14 p.i., respectively. The production of IFN-γ (Th1 cytokine) after TF or TF+ABZ therapy was significantly higher from weeks 6 to 12 p.i., and during this time, the significantly inhibited IL-5 synthesis (Th2 cytokine) was detected, particularly after TF+ABZ therapy. The superoxide anion (O ₂ ⁻ ) production in peritoneal macrophages of infected mice treated with TF or TF+ABZ was stimulated from weeks 8 to 18 p.i. The immunomodulative effect of TF reduced the growth of larval cysts till week 14 p.i. with a comparable intensity to the anthelmintic drug ABZ. Combined therapy TF+ABZ resulted in the greatest parasite restriction and reduced the cyst development till the end of the experiment. 3aB-lymphocytes 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aalbendazole 3aechinococcosis 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-5 3alarval development 3amacrophages 3amice 3aparasites 3aspleen 3asuperoxide anion 3atherapeutics 2aAlbendazolextherapeutic use 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxtherapeutic use 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aEchinococcosis, Pulmonaryxdrug therapyximmunology. 2aEchinococcus multilocularisxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aImmunologic Factorsxtherapeutic use 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesis 2aInterleukin-5xbiosynthesis 2aMacrophages, Peritonealximmunology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aSpleenximmunology 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 2aTransfer Factorxtherapeutic use1 aPorubcová, Jarmila1 aŠevčíková, Zuzana.0 tParasitology research.g2009 Oct., v. 105, no. 4 p.1067-1076dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-009-1520-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03105naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245014600166300001800312500002400330520186400354650001202218650001602230650001002246650000902256650002602265650001402291650001202305650001302317650001602330650001002346650001702356650001102373650001602384650002002400650001602420650001902436700002002455773011402475852000902589856008502598655001202683IND4424922820221122051622.0090821s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442492282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-009-0753-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurlure, Camille10aOn the consequences of aggressive male mate-locating behaviour and micro-climate for female host plant use in the butterfly Lycaena hippothoe  ap. 1581-1591.  aIncludes references  aThe distribution of ecological resources and their significance for males and females may vary considerably. Intersexual behavioural interactions may lead, combined with particular resource configurations, to sexual spatial segregation. We investigated this issue relative to host plant use in females of the purple-edged copper butterfly, Lycaena hippothoe. Males exhibited nectar resource-based territoriality, which is an uncommon mate-locating system in butterflies. They perched and patrolled in large territories harassing every passing female. In our study system, the percentage of spatial dimension shared for adult and larval resources was estimated at 50%, and males monopolised 28% of the nectar-rich zones. Under these conditions of harassment, females travelled between nectar-rich zones for feeding and zones with suitable host plants for egg laying, but often without nectar and hence with low male density. This is likely to limit their time budget and, potentially, their realised fecundity as suggested by the low number of eggs found relative to population size. Females were also highly specialised in selecting host plants under particular environmental conditions. Using test choice in experimental cages, we showed that, in the absence of males, only micro-climatic conditions may significantly influencing egg-laying decisions. Moreover, results of egg-rearing experiments under different temperature treatments suggested that eggs were laid in thermally suitable micro-environments. The highly selective egg-laying behaviour can be viewed as a preference-performance choice. Knowledge of individuals' behaviour, including sexual interactions, can be highly significant for our understanding of habitat use, which in turn can be essential for conservation. We discuss this for L. hippothoe, a species of regional conservation concern. 3aLycaena 3abutterflies 3acages 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3amales 3amicroclimate 3anectar 3aoviposition 3apopulation size 3atemperature 3aterritoriality1 aDyck, Hans van.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2009 Sept., v. 63, no. 11 p.1581-1591dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-009-0753-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02818naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245009800169300001800267500002400285500001500309520163200324650002001956650001001976650001101986650001401997650001102011650002302022650001102045650001702056650000802073650001102081650001702092650001302109650000902122653001802131700001902149700002002168773011402188852000902302856008502311655001202396IND4424923120221122051626.0090821s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442492312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-009-0758-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmaljohann, Heiko10aTrans-Sahara migrants select flight altitudes to minimize energy costs rather than water loss  ap. 1609-1619.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMeteorological conditions influence strongly the energy and water budget of birds. By adjusting their flights spatially and temporally with respect to these conditions, birds can reduce their energy expenditure and water loss considerably. By radar, we quantified songbird migration across the western Sahara in spring and autumn. There autumn migrants face the trade-off between (a) favorable winds combined with hot and dry air at low altitudes and (b) unfavorable winds combined with humid and cold air higher up. Thus, it can be tested whether birds may chose altitudes to minimize water loss instead of energy expenditure. We predicted optimal flight altitudes with respect to water loss and energy expenditure based on a physiological flight model when crossing the western Sahara and compared these model predictions spatially and temporally with measured songbird densities. The model aiming for minimal water consumption predicted a mean flight altitude of 3,400 m under autumn conditions. However, 64% of the nocturnal songbird migration flew at altitudes below 1,000 m above ground level profiting from tailwind. This preference for tailwind in autumn, despite the hot and dry air, emphasizes the importance of energy savings and diminishes the significance of possible water stress for the selection of flight altitude. Nevertheless, during daytime, high energy expenditure due to air turbulences and water loss due to warmer air and direct solar radiation prevent songbirds from prolonging their nocturnal flights regularly into the day.

Although no infanticides in wild orangutans have been reported to date, several authors have suggested that infanticide has been an important selection pressure influencing orangutan behavior and the evolution of orangutan social systems. In this paper, we critically assess this suggestion. We begin by investigating whether wild orangutans have been studied for a sufficiently long period that we might reasonably expect to have detected infanticide if it occurs. We consider whether orangutan females exhibit counterstrategies typically employed by other mammalian females. We also assess the hypothesis that orangutan females form special bonds with particular “protector males” to guard against infanticide. Lastly, we discuss socioecological reasons why orangutan males may not benefit from infanticide. We conclude that there is limited evidence for female counterstrategies and little support for the protector male hypothesis. Aspects of orangutan paternity certainty, lactational amenorrhea, and ranging behavior may explain why infanticide is not a strategy regularly employed by orangutan males on Sumatra or Borneo.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPongo pygmaeus 3aamenorrhea 3afemales 3ainfants 3amales 3amammals 3apaternity 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia1 aKahlenberg, Sonya M.1 aMarshall, A.

Forages included alfalfa hay (Medicago sativa L.), fescue hay (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), bromegrass hay (Bromus inermis L.), and corn Zea mays) silage. Diets were from lactating cow trials conducted by this laboratory and were formulated using the forages listed so that most of the dietary Ca would be supplied by forage. Mineral solubility and DM disappearance were measured in ruminally cannulated cows; nylon bags with samples were incubated for 0, 3, 12, 24, and 48 h. The 0-h bags were only washed with distilled water. For the 0-h samples, more than 60% of the P, Mg, and K in forages and diets was solubilized. However, 45% of the Ca in forages was soluble compared with 36% for diets. Magnesium solubility increased 22% with time for both forages and diets; otherwise, mineral solubilities at 3 h were not different from 0 h. Time for maximum solubility varied; K solubility was maximized by 0 h, Mg and P by 24 h, and Ca by 48 h. Across forages and diets, K was most soluble (99%) followed by Mg (92%), P (72%), and Ca (71%). Ruminal solubilities of K, Mg, and P were similar for forages and diets and averaged 93, 85, and 70%, respectively. Solubility of Ca from forages averaged 63% and was 12 percentage units greater than that of diets. These data indicate that rumen solubilization is not a factor limiting the ruminant's ability to absorb these macrominerals. 3adairy cows 3adietary minerals 3asolubility 3acalcium 3aphosphorus 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3aconcentrates 3arumen fermentation 0amineral absorption 0amineral nutrition1 aMartz, F.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.1654-1661x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03463naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011900144300001800263500001500281520189900296650001502195650002502210650001702235650002102252650002302273650000702296650001602303650001702319650001502336650002602351650001202377650004202389650002302431650003602454650001102490650001402501650002002515650003402535650003602569650002302605653001002628653002402638653001302662653001102675700001702686700002302703700001702726700001602743773008302759852000902842939003302851946001302884655001202897IND9103498220221122040845.0910909e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910349822DNAL7 a16525992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHogue, J.F.10aControlled ruminal infusion of sodium bicarbonate. 1. Influence of postfeeding infusion interval on ruminal milieu  ap. 1675-1683.  a2019-12-04  aFour ruminally cannulated, lactating Holstein cows were assigned to a 4 X 4 Latin square to monitor the effects of intraruminal NaHCO3 infusion on changes in die rumen environment. Sodium bicarbonate (110 g), dissolved in 3.8 L of water, was infused twice daily at a constant rate for 2 h starting at 0, 2, or 4 h postfeeding. An cows had access to their diet containing sorghum silage and concentrate in a 35:65 ratio (DM basis) for 45 min twice daily. Ruminal fluid was collected at feeding and every 30 min postfeeding for 12 h on the last day of each 7-d period. Dry matter intake was lower for buffer infusion at 2 to 4 h than for water-infused control but was not affected by the other NaHCO3 infusions. Although total milk yield was not affected, milk fat percentage and fat yield tended to be lower for the NaHCO3 treatments. Compared with the water infusion, the NaHCO3 infusion from 2 to 4 h postfeeding most effectively prevented the postfeeding increase in ruminal free proton concentration. Additionally, volume of ruminal liquid was increased for the NaHCO3 infusions from 0 to 2 h and 4 to 6 h; ruminal liquid turnover time was increased for die NaHCO3 infusion at 4 to 6 h, but ruminal kinetics otherwise were not affected by NaHCO3. Although infusion of NaHCO3 from 2 to 4 h prevented severe alterations in ruminal acid-base status, it did not increase total VFA concentration or the acetate:propionate ratio. Although total VFA concentrations were not affected by NaHCO3 infusion, acetate:propionate ratio was higher for the NaHCO3 infusion from 0 to 2 h than for the control. Based upon alterations in ruminal acid-base status, exogenous buffer ideally should be provided to the rumen from 2 to 4 h postfeeding; however, our results indicate that the effectiveness of this regimen might be improved if buffer is combined with a rapidly released or unprotected dietary buffer. 3adairy cows 3avolatile fatty acids 3aconcentrates 3amilk composition 3asodium bicarbonate 3apH 3afeed intake 3arumen fluids 3amilk yield 2aAcid-Base Equilibrium 2aAnimals 2aBicarbonatesxadministration & dosage 2aCattlexphysiology 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysis 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aMilkxchemistry 2aRumenxchemistryxphysiology. 2aSodiumxadministration & dosage 2aSodium Bicarbonate 0arumen 0aacid base disorders 0ainfusion 0atiming1 aTucker, W.B.1 aVan Koevering M.T.1 aVernon, R.K.1 aAdams, G.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.1675-1683x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03211naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008500143300001800228500001500246520151100261650001501772650001601787650001701803650002001820650002401840650001401864650002101878650001601899650001101915650001401926650001601940650002201956650001501978650002601993650001602019650001202035650002402047650002102071650001902092650002602111650003602137650003902173650001102212650004202223650001102265650001402276650002102290650003902311650003602350650001602386653000702402700001902409700001902428773008302447852000902530939003302539946001302572655001202585IND9103498120221122041035.0910909e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910349812DNAL7 a19088682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWest, J.W.10aChanging dietary electrolyte balance for dairy cows in cool and hot environments  ap. 1662-1674.  a2019-12-04  aTwo Latin square studies, each containing eight primiparous cows (four Holstein, four Jersey), were conducted to determine the effect of changing dietary electrolyte balance during cool and hot environmental conditions on performance of lactating dairy cows. Electrolyte balance, expressed as Na + K - Cl in milli-equivalents per kilogram of diet, was altered by changing K and Cl content in the diet using potassium bicarbonate or calcium chloride. Maximum and minimum temperatures averaged 26.7 and 15.0 degrees C during the cool phase and 32.3 and 22.5 degrees C during the hot phase of the study. Milk yield improved linearly with increasing electrolyte balance with nonsignificant treatment by phase interaction, whereas DMI of cows improved quadratically with increasing dietary electrolyte balance. A treatment by phase interaction for DMI was detected, although intake of DM reached a plateau at a similar dietary electrolyte balance during die cool and hot phases. Body (milk) temperature of cows appeared to be related to the level of feed consumed and varied by treatment within phase. Body (milk) temperature was higher during the hot phase of the experiment. Blood bicarbonate and pH were lowest in cows offered the low electrolyte balance (high Cl) diet, and blood d urinary Na + K - Cl increased linearly with increasing dietary electrolyte balance. The response to dietary electrolyte balance appeared to be mediated through blood buffering and the impact on physiologic systems of the cow. 3adairy cows 3ablood serum 3aelectrolytes 3afeed conversion 3aambient temperature 3achlorides 3abody temperature 3aheat stress 3asodium 3apotassium 3afeed intake 3aacid-base balance 3amilk yield 2aAcid-Base Equilibrium 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBicarbonatesxblood 2aBody Temperature 2aCalciumxblood 2aCarbon Dioxidexblood 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aChloridesxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aElectrolytesxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aPotassiumxadministration & dosage 2aSodiumxadministration & dosage 2aTemperature 0apH1 aMullinix, B.G.1 aSandifer, T.G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.1662-1674x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02656naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010100146300001800247520129900265650001501564650001301579650001001592650002301602650002601625650001501651650001701666650001901683650001201702650001301714650003401727650001601761650001101777650001301788650003701801650000901838651001801847651001301865651001101878651001601889651001801905653002001923653001801943700002001961700001901981773008302000852000902083939003302092946001302125655001202138IND9103498520221122040820.0910909e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910349852DNAL7 a18802722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanton, T.L.10aGenotype by environment interaction for Holstein milk yield in Colombia, Mexico, and Puerto Rico  ap. 1700-1714.  aComponents of (co)variance and genetic parameters were estimated by REML procedures from first lactation mature equivalent Holstein milk records from 54,604 Colombian, Mexican, and Puerto Rican cows and 198,079 US cows. The objective was to determine the cause of heterogeneous daughter response to sire selection for milk yield between the regions. Data from Latin America were partitioned by country and by herd-year SD class for milk to obtain five joint analyses between the US and Latin America, low herd-year SD, high herd-year SD, Colombia, and Mexico. Sire and residual variances for milk were 41 and 29% smaller in Latin America than in the US, 47 and 58% smaller for low than for high herd-year SD, and 31 and 49% smaller for Colombia than for Mexico. Resultant heritabilities ranged from .20 to .29. Genetic correlations for milk yield between the US and Latin America, low and high herd-year SD, Colombia, and Mexico were .91, .82, .89, .78, and .90. Expected correlated responses for milk in Latin America, low and high herd-year SD, Colombia, and Mexico were 70, 53, 79, 56, and 78% of the direct response in the US. The scaling effects of heterogeneous variance resulted in smaller daughter milk responses in Latin America compared with the US even when herd-year SD was similar. 3adairy cows 3aHolstein 3asires 3agenetic covariance 3aenvironmental factors 3amilk yield 3aheritability 3abreeding value 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aLactationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 3aLatin America 0aColombia 0aMexico 0aPuerto Rico 0aUnited States 0agenetic effects 0aheterogeneity1 aVan Vleck, L.D.1 aCarabano, M.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.1700-1714x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02337naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011400127300001800241500001500259520128000274650000901554650002201563650002101585650001101606650002201617650001301639650001901652650001101671650001501682651001101697653002001708653002401728700001801752700001701770700001401787773008301801852000901884939003301893946001301926655001201939IND9103497420221122030855.0910906e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910349742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgyemang, K.10aMilk production characteristics and productivity of N'Dama cattle kept under village management in The Gambia  ap. 1599-1608.  a2019-12-04  aOur objective was to quantify the milk production of N'Dama cattle kept under village conditions as part of an epidemiological study designed to identify production constraints and to develop strategies to improve livestock productivity of farmers with small holdings. Milk and component yields were monitored monthly by measurement of milk extracted for human use (milk offtake) plus that consumed by the calf, estimated from body weight changes. Least squares analyses of 668 lactations recorded over 4 yr gave mean lactation length, 420 d; milk offtake, 404.3 kg; fat, 5.1%; protein, 3.2%; calf weaning weight, 88.1 kg; and calving interval, 641 d. A productivity index incorporating milk offtake, calf weaning weight, calving rate, and viability gave a mean annual 140.6 kg of weaner calf plus the weight equivalent of milk offtake per 100 kg of cow metabolic weight. The index was higher than that recorded for larger Zebu (Bos indicus) cattle managed under similar production systems elsewhere in Africa. These results show that the trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle appear to be more productive than previously thought and should therefore be considered when promoting livestock development in Africa, especially in tsetse-infested areas where other breeds cannot survive. 3azebu 3abreed differences 3atrypanotolerance 3aN'dama 3amilking frequency 3avillages 3aweaning weight 3acalves 3amilk yield 3aGambia 0amilk production 0adual purpose cattle1 aDwinger, R.H.1 aGrieve, A.S.1 aBah, M.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.1599-1608x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02600naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006200127300001800189500001500207520158600222650002301808650002701831650002501858650001301883650002201896650002301918650002201941650002301963650002401986650001702010653002602027653001802053700001702071773008302088852000902171939003302180946001302213655001202226IND9103497720221122030805.0910906e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910349772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErdman, R.A.10aEffect of dietary rumen-protected in lactating dairy cows  ap. 1632-1640.  a2019-12-04  aThe accuracy with which the Streptomyces griseus, ficin, and neutral protease with amylase in vitro methods could be used to predict in situ protein degradation of concentrate feeds was evaluated. Four types of soy products and two types of distillers grains were incubated using each of the four techniques for .5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h. The percentages of initial CP that remained undegraded over time were determined. Comparison of the degradation curves and contrast analysis of the data indicated that the in vitro methods generated degradability estimates in conflict with those obtained by the in situ method. However, the neutral protease with amylase method ranked the test feeds according to the extent of CP degradation at 24 h most similar to that in situ. Regression equations developed with the neutral protease with amylase degradability estimates explained 78, 76, and 74% of the variation in the in situ estimates obtained after 12, 18, and 24 h of incubation, respectively. At least 69% of the variation in the 18-h in situ estimates could be explained by the neutral protease with amylase estimates obtained after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h of incubation. Little relationship was found between the ficin and S. griseus versus in situ results. Although none of the in vitro methods resulted in degradation curves consistently related to those generated by the in situ technique, relationships were found between protein degradability estimates obtained by the neutral protease with amylase method at specific time points and those obtained by the situ technique. 3adigestible protein 3ain vitro digestibility 3aStreptomyces griseus 3asoybeans 3aforage evaluation 3arumen fermentation 3adistillers grains 3aanalytical methods 3aprotein degradation 3asoybean meal 0ain situ digestibility 0adigestibility1 aSharma, B.K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.1632-1640x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03357naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245008400195300001600279500002400295520126000319650002801579650003901607650001501646650002501661650002201686650001001708650001001718650003301728650001201761650003201773650003401805650001801839650001401857650001401871650003701885650003901922650004501961650001602006650002302022650001502045650001502060650004502075650004102120650003302161650002302194650004002217650002402257650002802281650002702309650003602336650002002372650002402392650002502416650001702441700002502458700002002483773009802503852000902601856008502610655001202695IND4424962520221122003010.0090821s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442496252DNAL7 a196297312pmid7 a10.1007/s10577-009-9048-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavaliere, Filomena Monica10aInterspecific transfer of mammalian artificial chromosomes between farm animals  ap. 507-517.  aIncludes references  aIt is often desirable to transfer a mammalian artificial chromosome (MAC) from the cells of one species to those of another. Attempts to carry out such transfer have been successful in some cases and have failed in others. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that centromeric DNA sequence similarity could be a useful criterion for determining MAC host range. Homology studies indicated that the sheep should give positive transfer results. The prediction was tested by introducing into sheep cells a yeast artificial chromosome that contained swine centromeric sequences and that had previously been used to produce a de novo MAC in swine cells. The experiments resulted in the formation of a functional de novo MAC in sheep cells, as attested by FISH analysis. The newly formed MAC remained structurally and functionally stable in ovine up to 52 generations. The centromeric sequences present on the newly formed MAC are probably swine sequences, although it cannot be ruled out that some sheep sequences may also have migrated to the MAC. The size of the sheep MAC was determined by atomic force microscopy. Thus, centromeric sequence similarity appears to be a useful criterion for predicting the animal species between which MACs can shuttle. 3aatomic force microscopy 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3ahost range 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence homology 3asheep 3aswine 3ayeast artificial chromosomes 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxgenetics 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aBase Sequence 2aCHO Cells 2aCell Line 2aCentromerexchemistryxgenetics. 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Mammalian 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Yeastxgenetics 2aClone Cells 2aConsensus Sequence 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aDNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Satellitexchemistryxgenetics. 2aFluorescent Dyesxmetabolism 2aGenetic Techniques 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aIndolesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSheepxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSus scrofaxgenetics 2aTransfection1 aScoarughi, Gian Luca1 aCimmino, Carmen0 tChromosome research.g2009 May, v. 17, no. 4 p.507-517dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-38497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-009-9048-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03571naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245009700192300001600289500002400305520132300329650003201652650001001684650002201694650002301716650003101739650001401770650005201784650001801836650001801854650002001872650001401892650002201906650003001928650002201958650002201980650002402002650001202026650001802038650001602056650002302072650002202095650001102117650001602128650001102144650002002155650002602175650000902201650002802210650002902238650002402267650002002291650001402311650003202325650002902357650002802386650003002414650002302444650002702467650003402494650002102528700002002549700002602569700003802595773009802633852000902731856008502740655001202825IND4424962120221122003144.0090821s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442496212DNAL7 a193504012pmid7 a10.1007/s10577-009-9038-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezende-Teixeira, Paula14aThe R2 mobile element of Rhynchosciara americana: Molecular, cytological and dynamic aspects  ap. 455-467.  aIncludes references  aRibosomal RNA genes are encoded by large units clustered (18S, 5S, and 28S) in the nucleolar organizer region in several organisms. Sometimes additional insertions are present in the coding region for the 28S rDNA. These insertions are specific non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons that have very restricted integration targets within the genome. The retrotransposon present in the genome of Rhynchosciara americana, RaR2, was isolated by the screening of a genomic library. Sequence analysis showed the presence of conserved regions, such as a reverse transcriptase domain and a zinc finger motif in the amino terminal region. The insertion site was highly conserved in R. americana and a phylogenetic analysis showed that this element belongs to the R2 clade. The chromosomal localization confirmed that the RaR2 mobile element was inserted into a specific site in the rDNA gene. The expression level of RaR2 in salivary glands during larval development was determined by quantitative RT-PCR, and the increase of relative expression in the 3P of the fourth instar larval could be related to intense gene activity characteristic of this stage. 5'-Truncated elements were identified in different DNA samples. Additionally, in three other Rhynchosciara species, the R2 element was present as a full-length element. 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3agenes 3agenomic libraries 3alarval development 3anucleolus organizer region 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asalivary glands 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3aterminal repeat sequences 3azinc finger motif 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosomes 2aConserved Sequence 2aDipteraxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenes, rRNA 2aGenome 2aGenomic Library 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aOvaryxcytology 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aRetroelementsxgenetics 2aSalivary Glandsxcytology 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTestisxcytology1 aSiviero, Fábio1 ada Costa Rosa, Marina1 aMachado-Santelli, Gláucia Maria.0 tChromosome research.g2009 May, v. 17, no. 4 p.455-467dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-38497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-009-9038-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02542naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245015200145300001800297520123000315650001501545650001301560650001901573650001401592650001201606650001301618650002001631650003601651650002501687650001201712650003901724650001101763650002001774650001101794650004801805650002101853653001701874653002301891700001601914700001601930773008301946852000902029939003302038946001302071655001202084IND9103496620221122003033.0910906e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910349662DNAL7 a18802622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, D.J.10aN-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, etiologic agent, and duration of clinical signs for sequential episodes of chronic clinical mastitis in dairy cows  ap. 1539-1543.  aThis study examined effects of repeated episodes of clinical mastitis in chronically infected quarters on milk N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity and duration of clinical signs.

Teigh (MTCC-5166). The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of using different agro-industrial residues as nutritional supplements along with wheat bran to enhance the production of nigerloxin. Nigerloxin produced by SSF was quantified spectrophotometrically at 292 nm. The results indicate that the inhibitor production was influenced by the type of solid substrate supplemented, moisture content, pH and size of the inoculum. Individually optimized supplements were tested in different combinations to determine their effects on nigerloxin production. A twofold increase in the production of nigerloxin (4.9 ± 0.3 mg gds⁻¹) was achieved by supplementing wheat bran with 10% w/w sweet lemon peel and 5% v/w methanol at optimized process parameters, that is, an initial moisture content of 65% v/w and incubation period of 6 days with an initial inoculum size of 2 ml (8 x 10⁵ spores gds⁻¹). Nigerloxin production was stable between pH of 4 and 5. 3aAspergillus niger 3aspores 3amethanol 3asolid state fermentation 3awheat bran 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3apH 3awater content 3alemons 3adietary supplements 3ainoculum 2aAgriculture 2aAspergillus nigerxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBenzoatesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aBioreactors 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCitrus 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDietary Fiber 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIndustrial Waste 2aOxygenasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPropanexanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aWater 0alipoxygenase1 aJaveed, Saleem1 aSattur, Avinash P.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 36, no. 9 p.1179-1187dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-009-0599-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03510naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245008900181300001800270500002400288520141300312650002201725650002501747650001601772650002801788650001001816650003101826650002101857650001401878650002901892650008101921650003002002650004902032650004002081650002702121650002402148650002802172650004302200650003902243650001702282650003502299650002102334650004502355650004802400650005202448650001802500700002002518700001502538700002102553700001802574700001602592700001702608700001602625700002102641773012802662852000902790856008502799655001202884IND4424971720221121043232.0090821s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442497172DNAL7 a195217282pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-009-0601-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisch, K.

A library of epigenetic modifiers was tested using the fungus Aspergillus niger to determine the impact of small-molecule inhibitors on reversing the transcriptional suppression of biosynthetic genes involved in polyketide (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide (NRPS), and hybrid PKS-NRPS (HPN) production. Examination of expressed sequence tag libraries from A. niger demonstrated that >70% of its PKS-, NRPS-, and HPN-encoding gene clusters were transcriptionally suppressed under standard laboratory culture conditions. Using a chemical epigenetic methodology, we showed that treatment of A. niger with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and 5-azacytidine led to the transcriptional upregulation of many secondary-metabolite-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters. Chemical epigenetic modifiers exhibited positional biases for upregulating chromosomally distal gene clusters. In addition, a phylogenetic-based preference was noted in the upregulation of reducing clade I PKS gene clusters, while reducing clade IV PKS gene clusters were largely unaffected. Manipulating epigenetic features in fungi is a powerful method for accessing the products of silent biosynthetic pathways. Moreover, this approach can be readily incorporated into modern microbial screening operations. 3aAspergillus niger 3abiochemical pathways 3aepigenetics 3aexpressed sequence tags 3afungi 3agene expression regulation 3amultigene family 3ascreening 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAspergillus nigerxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aAzacitidinexpharmacology 2aBiological Productsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aBiosynthetic Pathwaysxdrug effects 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aEpigenesis, Genetic 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGene Library 2aHydroxamic Acidsxpharmacology 2aMultigene Family 2aPeptide Synthasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolyketide Synthasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aUp-Regulation1 aGillaspy, A.

In many cases efficient bioremediation of aquifers contaminated with these chemicals requires the addition of exogenous microorganisms, specifically members of the genus Dehalococcoides (DHC). This process is referred to as bioaugmentation. In this study a fed-batch fermentation process was developed for producing large volumes (to 3,200 L) of DHC-containing consortia suitable for treating contaminated aquifers. Three consortia enriched from three different sites were grown anaerobically with sodium lactate as an electron donor and PCE or TCE as an electron acceptor. DHC titers in excess of 10¹¹ DHC/L could be reproducibly obtained at all scales tested and with all three of the enrichment cultures. The mean specific DHC growth rate for culture SDC-9[trade mark sign] was 0.036 ± 0.005 (standard error, SE)/h with a calculated mean doubling time of 19.3 ± 2.7 (SE) h. Finished cultures could be concentrated approximately tenfold by membrane filtration and stored refrigerated (4°C) for more that 40 days without measurable loss of activity. Dehalogenation of PCE by the fermented cultures was affected by pH with no measurable activity at pH <5.0. 3aDehalococcoides 3aaquifers 3abatch fermentation 3abioremediation 3achlorination 3adehalogenation 3afiltration 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3asodium 3asolvents 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aChloroflexixgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCulture Media 2aFermentation 2aHalogenation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSolventsxmetabolism 2aTetrachloroethylenexmetabolism 2aTrichloroethylenexmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 2aWater Pollution 2aWater Purificationxmethods 3aUnited States1 aCondee, Charles W.1 aSteffan, Robert J.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 36, no. 9 p.1189-1197dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-009-0600-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle00898naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245008100137300001200218500005800230520010400288650001600392650001200408650001100420650002000431773019600451852000900647655001200656IND60119326520221120123906.0150202s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011932652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaston, Stephanie S.10aEthyl Alcohol for Chemical Arthrodesis of the Proximal Interphalangeal Joint  ap. 140.  aMeeting held December 4-8, 2010, Baltimore, Maryland.  aEthyl alcohol can be used for chemical arthrodesis of the proximal interphalangeal joint in horses. 3aarthrodesis 3aethanol 3ahorses 3ajoints (animal)0 tProceedings of the annual convention of the American Association of Equine Practitioners.g2010, v. 56 p.140-140dAmerican Association of Equine Practitioners.wJournal:12369x0065-71827nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001600273520117000289650001601459650001801475650001101493650001701504650001101521650002201532650001401554650002201568650001201590650001301602650001201615650001201627651001001639651001301649700002301662700001701685700002401702700002401726700001501750700002001765700001701785773011901802856004801921852000901969655001201978IND60610259620221120042126.0180827e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061025962DNAL7 a10.1007/s42161-018-0079-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunir, Samrah10aIdentification of pedilanthus leaf curl virus and associated betasatellite infecting turnip in Pakistan  ap. 317-321.  aComplete begomovirus and betasatellite genomes were isolated from turnip (Brassica rapa) plants exhibiting leaf crumpling symptoms in Pakistan. In this study, two complete begomovirus genomes and one betasatellite molecule were cloned, sequenced and characterized. The identified begomovirus isolates were 100% identical to each other and shared their highest nucleotide (nt) sequence identity at 94.4 and 92.7% with pedilanthus leaf curl virus (PeLCV) and tomato leaf curl Kerala virus (ToLCKeV), respectively. However, in phylogenetic analysis both isolates grouped separately in the ToLCKeV clade. The detailed phylogenetic and recombination analysis showed that the isolates have unique and recombinant nature thus, representing new isolates of PeLCV from turnip in Pakistan. The cloned betasatellite isolate (1371 nt in length) was a non-recombinant molecule and shared highest nt sequence identity (89.8%) with tobacco leaf curl betasatellite (TbLCB). This is the first report of a unique isolate of PeLCV associated with TbLCB infecting B. rapa in Pakistan. The present study extends our knowledge about the current diversity of PeLCV in the important crops. 3aBegomovirus 3aBrassica rapa 3agenome 3aleaf curling 3aleaves 3amolecular cloning 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3atobacco 3atomatoes 3aturnips 3aviruses 3aIndia 3aPakistan1 aKhurshid, Muhammad1 aKanwal, Hira1 aḤusain, Mujāhid,1 aSattar, Muhammad N.1 aAli, Irfan1 aAtiq-ur-Rehman,1 aIqbal, Zafar0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2018 July, v. 100, no. 2 p.317-321dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42161-018-0079-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01773naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012800128300001600256500001500272520077700287650002301064650003301087650002601120653002501146653001601171653002001187653003801207653002501245700001601270773008301286852000901369930003301378945001301411946001101424655001201435IND2331749620221120032606.0030402e200107  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233174962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonrozier, R.12aA quality measurement for sensory profile analysis.

Faced with this complex information, industry needs an operational tool for describing product sensory properties. Thus, the statistical analysis of profile data should yield a sharp and robust product picture. We set up quality criteria, based on extended cross-validation and re-sampling techniques, to quantify the relevance of factorial method results. We target PCA on mean product scores, and several MANOVA models. We used assessor cross-validation and assessor re-sampling to evaluate respectively the impact of each assessor and the impact of the panel make-up on the product results. PCA and simple MANOVA models are highly robust, whereas complex MANOVA models lead to unstable results. 3asensory evaluation 3aprincipal component analysis 3amultivariate analysis 0aanalysis of variance 0amethodology 0aconsumer panels 0aquantitative descriptive analysis 0astatistical analysis1 aDanzart, M.0 tFood quality and preference.g2001 , v. 12, no. 5/7 p.393-406x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle01314naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005700127300001600184520047600200650002500676650002500701650001500726650002100741653002000762653002600782653002400808700001900832773008300851852000900934930003300943945001300976946001100989655001201000IND2331749020221120032641.0030402e200107  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233174902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCourcoux, P.10aPreference mapping using a latent class vector model  ap. 369-372.  aAn application of a latent class vector model to preference data is presented.

C. capitata was most abundant in the Aeropuerto frontier location and the inland Gallinazo location. All frontier locations showed similar seasonal population trends and yearly variation in total catches between trap sites related to long-range fly movement. The synchronous population dispersal pattern of males and females suggests it is an important survival behavior mechanism for C. capitata populations in the arid areas of Chile and Peru. 3aCeratitis capitata 3apopulation dynamics 3ageographical distribution 3adeserts 3aPeru 3aChile 0adispersal1 aOlalquiaga, G.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1991 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.174-178x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02480naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009200124300001600216500001500232520127900247650002301526650001201549650002301561650001701584650002001601650002201621650002501643650001101668650002101679650001601700650001101716650001001727651001401737653002001751653001601771653001501787653003601802700001601838700001701854773008501871852000901956930003301965945001301998946001102011655001202022IND2328599920221117180444.0020820e200103  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232859992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, D.N.12aA cross-cultural methodological study of the uses of two common hedonic response scales  ap. 119-131.  a2019-12-05  aHedonic scale use, cross-culturally and particularly by Asian consumers, has received little attention but is of increasing concern with greater globalisation of food markets and opportunities for exporting to Asia. The study reported here sought to test whether there were cultural, scale and gender interactions between European-origin Australian (n = 61) and Malaysian (n = 54) consumers' hedonic responses to food and drink stimuli. A between-groups design, one group using a labelled nine-point category scale and the other an unstructured-anchored line scale, both using computerised responses, found no systematic cultural bias. However, there was some evidence of gender bias. In addition, a task in which semantic labels (from the labelled hedonic category scale) were assigned to a line scale found no statistically significant cultural differences in the scores attributed to the labels. These data indicated that, in the context of computerised responses, young Malaysians used both scales in a similar way to their Australian counterparts. However, further non-parametric analysis suggested that the unstructured line scale encouraged greater use of a range of possible responses and, therefore, line scales may be a preferred option for use in this population. 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3agender differences 3aorange juice 3apineapple juice 3acultural behavior 3aconsumer preferences 3abreads 3agrapefruit juice 3aAustralians 3aadults 3ataste 3aAustralia 0acategory scales 0amethodology 0amalaysians 0anationalities and ethnic groups1 aClark, M.R.1 aMialon, V.S.0 tFood quality and preference.g2001 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.119-131x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01788naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013300129300001600262300002200278500001500300520085100315650003001166650003001196650002301226651001301249651001801262653001101280700001701291700001701308773008201325852000901407939003301416946001301449655001201462IND8902719220221117180509.0890530e198704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890271922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaefer, P.W.10aNorth American distribution of Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and its mass appearance in coastal Delaware  ap. 368-373.  ap. 368-373. maps.  a2019-12-05  aThe Palearctic sevenspotted ladybeetle, Coccinella septempunctata L., well established in North America, has now spread through parts of five Canadian provinces and 34 contiguous eastern states of the United States. In southern coastal Delaware in June 1984, a mass appearance of C. septempunctata occurred where wind systems brought masses of these beetles into the area from unknown sources and dropped them into the seawater. Large numbers then washed up on beaches, and some surviving beetles annoyed vacationers and even bit some people. We speculate on the original establishment of this insect in North America. Presenting evidence previously overlooked, we add to speculation that early intentional releases led to establishment of this predator in North America. However, accidental importation on transoceanic ships cannot be ruled out. 3aCoccinella septempunctata 3ageographical distribution 3abiological control 3aDelaware 0aNorth America 0aspread1 aDysart, R.J.1 aSpecht, H.B.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1987 Apr., v. 16, no. 2 p.368-373x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02596naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006000129300001600189500017000205500001500375520135900390650001601749650002301765650001101788650002601799650001201825650001301837650001301850650001701863650001701880650001401897650001101911650001501922653001101937700001801948700002301966700002401989773008302013852000902096930003302105945001302138946001102151655001202162IND2202906520221117160516.0000307e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220290652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZandstra, E.H.10aLaboratory hedonic ratings as predictors of consumption  ap. 411-418.  aIn the special issue: Sense and sensibility / edited by E.

Thirty-six subjects (30 women, six men; mean age 21 years) participated in a taste-and-spit test, a taste-and-swallow test, a fixed quantity test in which an amount of 300 g was consumed, and an ad libitum consumption test. Subjects rated on a 10-point category scale pleasantness and perceived sweetness intensity of yogurts varying in sucrose concentration (1, 5.9, 10, 17.6 and 30% w/w). Consumption was measured in the ad libitum consumption test. Results showed that the optimal sucrose concentration as determined by the taste-and-spit test (10% w/w) was higher than that determined from the taste-and-swallow test, the fixed quantity test and the ad libitum consumption test (5.9% w/w). The mean of within-subject's correlation coefficients between pleasantness ratings and amount of yogurt eaten in the ad libitum consumption test were 0.45, 0.62, 0.75 and 0.81 for the taste-and-spit test, the taste-and-swallow test, the fixed quantity test and the ad libitum consumption test, respectively. The perceived sweetness intensity did not change as function of the sensory test used. We conclude that pleasantness ratings collected after the taste-and-swallow test give a better prediction of consumption than the taste-and-spit test. 3afood intake 3asensory evaluation 3asweets 3alaboratory techniques 3asucrose 3aappetite 3avalidity 3apalatability 3afood choices 3asweetness 3aadults 3aprediction 0aflavor1 aGraaf, C. de.1 aTrijp, H.C.M. van.1 aStaveren, W.A. van.0 tFood quality and preference.g1999 , v. 10, no. 4/5 p.411-418x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02677naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245018500126300001600311520151200327650001801839650001901857650002101876650002401897650001801921650002001939650001001959650001201969650001301981650001401994650002202008700001902030700001602049700001602065700002302081700001602104773008102120852000902201930003302210945001302243946001102256655001202267IND2229325820221117160435.0010117e200003  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222932582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomenda, J.10aDegradation of the Photosystem II D1 and D2 proteins in different strains of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 varying with respect to the type and level of psbA transcript  ap. 635-645.  aThe turnover of the D1 and D2 proteins of Photosystem II (PSII) has been investigated by pulse-chase radiolabeling in several strains of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 containing different types and levels of the psbA transcript. Strains lacking psbA1 and psbA3 gene and containing high levels of the psbA2 transcript showed the selective synthesis of D1 whose degradation could be slowed down by the protein synthesis inhibitor lincomycin. In contrast, in strains containing just the psbA3 gene, the intensity of the D1 protein labeling was lower and labeling of the D2 and CP43 proteins was stimulated in comparison to the psbA2-containing strains. In addition, the rate and selectivity of the D1 degradation and its dependence on the presence of lincomycin was proportional to the level of the psbA3 transcript in the particular strain. Consequently, there was parallel, lincomycin-independent and showed-down breakdown of the D1 and D2 proteins in strains with the lowest level of psbA3 transcript. These results are discussed in terms of a model in which the rate of D1 and D2 degradation in cyanobacteria is affected not only by the rate of PSII photodamage, but also by the availability of newly synthesized D1 protein. Moreover, the comparison of the non-oxygen-evolving D1 mutants D170A** and Y161F*** differing by the presence of tyrosine Z has indicated a minor role of the oxidized form of this secondary PSII electron donor in the donor side mechanism of D1 and D2 protein breakdown. 3aCyanobacteria 3aphotosystem II 3abinding proteins 3aprotein degradation 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutants 3atyrosine 3aoxidation 3aelectron transfer1 aHassan, H.A.G.1 aDiner, B.A.1 aDebus, R.J.1 aBarber, Yehonatan.1 aNixon, P.J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2000 Mar., v. 42, no. 4 p.635-645x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02132naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012400129300001600253500001500269520095500284650001201239650002301251650001201274650002001286650001101306650000801317650001701325650001701342650001301359650001001372650002301382650001001405651001201415653001101427653001501438653002001453653001701473700001701490700001601507773008501523852000901608930003301617945001301650946001101663655001201674IND2331248320221123040046.0030307e200304  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233124832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalviainen, N.14aThe relative importance of texture, taste and aroma on a yogurt-type snack food preference in the young and the elderly  ap. 177-186.  a2019-12-05  aThe study examined the relative importance of texture, taste and aroma for overall pleasantness of a yoghurt-like fermented oat bran product in the elderly (n = 45, 65-82 years) compared to the young (n = 47, 20-35 years). Texture (lumpy vs. smooth), taste intensity (sweetness) and aroma intensity (orange aroma) were varied using 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. For the young, the most important factor predicting overall pleasantness of the samples was aroma, while taste and texture had only little importance. The elderly responded equally strongly to aroma and taste and found both textures almost equally acceptable. However, texture had a relatively small effect on the overall pleasantness in general. In conclusion, the relative importance of texture, taste and aroma of the fermented oat bran product differed from the young to the elderly: the relative importance of taste was more pronounced in the case of the elderly compared to the young. 3aelderly 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3afermented foods 3asnacks 3aage 3afood quality 3ayoung adults 3aoat bran 3aodors 3afood acceptability 3ataste 3aFinland 0atastes 0aperception 0aconsumer panels 0afood choices1 aRoininen, K.1 aTuorila, H.0 tFood quality and preference.g2003 Apr., v. 14, no. 3 p.177-186x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01906naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010900127300001600236500001500252520080600267650002201073650002301095650002101118650001301139650003301152650001301185650001601198650002301214653001701237653002501254653001801279700002201297700001801319700002001337773008501357852000901442930003301451945001301484946001101497655001201508IND2328600620221123035919.0020820e200103  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232860062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendes, L.C.10aOptimization of the roasting of robusta coffee (C. canephora conillon) using acceptability tests and RSM  ap. 153-162.  a2019-12-05  aWith the objective of optimizing the roasting of robusta coffee (Coffea canephora Conillon), a two factor central composite design (11 samples) was used to optimise the settings for roasting time and the initial internal temperature of the roaster drum on response variables of acceptance with 25 consuming assessors, for the sensory attributes of beverage aroma, flavour and colour.

Pekinensis. Differential screening led to the isolation of a floral nectary-specific cDNA clone. Northern hybridization indicated that its mRNA transcript is 1450 nucleotides long and specific to the flower base. In situ hybridization and immunolocalization showed its mRNA and protein are localized specifically to both the lateral and median nectaries of flowers. The cDNA codes for a 43.8 kDa polypeptide 392 amino acids long. The protein was named nectarin1 (NTR1) after floral nectary protein. NTR1 was located in the cytoplasm of nectariferous cells in the nectaries and was also observed in nuclei at a much lower level. The level of the transcript increases with flower development, especially during nectary development, but decreases abruptly with the opening of the flower. Genomic Southern in blot analysis indicated that at least three copies of homologous genes were present in the genome of B. campestris, but that only a single copy was present in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Lycopersicon esculentum. The deduced amino acid sequence of NTR1 shows similarity to S-adenosyl-L-methhionine:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase of Clarkia breweri which is expressed mostly in petals. The function of the gene is speculated to be involved in the methylation of a plant secondary metabolite in the floral nectaries. 3amessenger RNA 3aBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis 3aflowering 3acomplementary DNA 3anectaries 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3agene dosage 3anucleotide sequences 3acytoplasm 3acytochemistry 3amultigene family 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3atransferases 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBrassicaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aImmunoblotting 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlant Structuresxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTissue Distribution 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 0aflowers 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris 0anectarin 1 0aadenosylmethionine salicylic acid methyltransferase1 aSeo, H.S.1 aSong, S.I.1 aLee, J.S.1 aChoi, Y.D.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2000 Mar., v. 42, no. 4 p.647-655x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02763naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245010500173300001800278500002400296520136700320650001001687650002301697650001101720650002301731650001601754650001101770650001201781650001701793650002201810650002601832650002001858650002201878650002601900650001101926650001201937650001501949650002201964650002001986650001702006650002502023700002202048700002302070773012402093852000902217856005502226655001202281IND4396457220221123010344.0071021e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439645722DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1672-9072.2007.00556.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, J. Miguel10aDeficit Irrigation as a Strategy to Save Water: Physiology and Potential Application to Horticulture  ap. 1421-1434.  aIncludes references  aWater is an increasingly scarce resource worldwide and irrigated agriculture remains one of the largest and most inefficient users of this resource. Low water use efficiency (WUE) together with an increased competition for water resources with other sectors (e.g. tourism or industry) are forcing growers to adopt new irrigation and cultivation practices that use water more judiciously. In areas with dry and hot climates, drip irrigation and protected cultivation have improved WUE mainly by reducing runoff and evapotranspiration losses. However, complementary approaches are still needed to increase WUE in irrigated agriculture. Deficit irrigation strategies like regulated deficit irrigation or partial root drying have emerged as potential ways to increase water savings in agriculture by allowing crops to withstand mild water stress with no or only marginal decreases of yield and quality. Grapevine and several fruit tree crops seem to be well adapted to deficit irrigation, but other crops like vegetables tend not to cope so well due to losses in yield and quality. This paper aims at providing an overview of the physiological basis of deficit irrigation strategies and their potential for horticulture by describing the major consequences of their use to vegetative growth, yield and quality of different crops (fruits, vegetables and ornamentals). 3acrops 3adeficit irrigation 3adrying 3aevapotranspiration 3afruit trees 3afruits 3agrowers 3ahorticulture 3airrigated farming 3airrigation management 3amicroirrigation 3aornamental plants 3aprotected cultivation 3arunoff 3atourism 3avegetables 3avegetative growth 3awater resources 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency1 aOrtuño, Maria F.1 aChaves, M.

Poor enrichment of these proteins at specific sites may be due to dispersed binding, poor epitope availability or cell cycle stage-specific binding. Here, we have mapped sites of biotin-tagged ORC and MCM protein binding in G1-synchronized populations of Chinese hamster cells harboring amplified copies of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) locus, using avidin-affinity purification of biotinylated chromatin followed by high-density microarray analysis across the DHFR locus. We have identified several sites of significant enrichment for both complexes distributed throughout the previously identified initiation zone. Analysis of the frequency of initiations across stretched DNA fibers from the DHFR locus confirmed a broad zone of de-localized initiation activity surrounding the sites of ORC and MCM enrichment. Mapping positions of mononucleosomal DNA empirically and computing nucleosome-positioning information in silico revealed that ORC and MCM map to regions of low measured and predicted nucleosome occupancy. Our results demonstrate that specific sites of ORC and MCM enrichment can be detected within a mammalian intitiation zone, and suggest that initiation zones may be regions of generally low nucleosome occupancy where flexible nucleosome positioning permits flexible pre-RC assembly sites.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChinese hamsters 3aDNA 3acell cycle 3adihydrofolate reductase 3aepitopes 3aloci 3amicroarray technology 3anucleosomes1 aSasaki, Takayo1 aKuipers, Marjorie A.1 aLucas, Isabelle1 aLe Beau, Michelle M.1 aCarignon, Sandra1 aDebatisse, Michelle1 aPrinz, Joseph A.1 aDennis, Jonathan H.1 aGilbert, David M.0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 Apr., v. 39, no. 8 p.3141-3155x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq12763Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110429  aNon-US 7aarticle02478naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100004600145245008800191300001600279520133400295650001401629650001101643650001001654650000901664650001301673650001201686650001301698650001001711650001201721650001201733650001201745653001801757653002101775700002101796773012301817852000901940856008501949930003302034946001302067655001202080IND4396235120221122231219.0071021e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439623512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-006-9087-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnston, C.

In birds, which usually provide extensive post-hatching parental care, acoustic signals are learned in some species but are innate in others. Almost no fishes provide extensive post-hatching parental care and, consequently, the offspring have little opportunity to hear and learn sounds produced by the parents (usually the male in fishes); they may, however, be exposed to acoustic signals of conspecifics in the same habitat. We used a cyprinid, Codoma ornata, to test whether sound production is learned from the parents or whether it is innate. Fertilized eggs of this species were raised in isolation from adults. Upon maturity, these fish were tested for sound production in aggressive and reproductive contexts. Fish which had no contact with adults, and therefore no opportunity to hear the acoustic signals of their species, produced sounds that were similar to those produced by their parents, and they produced these in the same contexts. Significant differences were observed in dominant frequency for one context, with the smaller F₁ fish having signals of higher frequency than parental fish. Since no opportunity for learning existed, this provided evidence that the ability to produce sounds is innate in this minnow species. 3aacoustics 3aadults 3abirds 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3ahearing 3alearning 3amales 3aminnows 3aparents 3aprogeny 0aCodoma ornata 0aSound production1 aBuchanan, H.

A total of 43 anguillid leptocephali were collected during the cruise and they were genetically identified as 41 Anguilla bicolor bicolor, 1 Anguilla marmorata, and 1 Anguilla interioris. A. bicolor bicolor leptocephali were 44.1-55.5 mm TL and most of them were at the fully grown stage. Reexamination of the historical data of Jespersen (1942) also suggested a relatively low abundance of small size leptocephali (<40 mm) of this species off west Sumatra. Although the study area has long been considered to be a spawning site of A. bicolor bicolor, the distributions of leptocephali from the two surveys and the patterns of ocean currents in the region suggest the possibility that the main spawning area of this species is located farther offshore. 3aAnguilla anguilla 3aAnguilla bicolor 3aAnguilla marmorata 3aecology 3aleptocephalus larvae 3aspawning 3asurveys 3awater currents 3aIndian Ocean 3aIndonesia 0aLarval migration 0aDistribution 0aSpawning area1 aWouthuyzen, Sam 1 aMiller, Michael J. 1 aMinegishi, Yuki 1 aKuroki, Mari 1 aSuharti, Sasanti Retno.1 aKawakami, Tatsuya 1 aSumardiharga, Krunaen O. 1 aTsukamoto, Katsumi 0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2007 Dec., v. 80, no. 4 p.445-452dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0378-19097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9143-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02185naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006000126300001600186500011800202500001500320520119700335650002201532650001801554650002301572653001601595653001101611653001601622653003601638653002401674773008301698852000901781930003301790945001301823946001101836655001201847IND2332876520221122184819.0030603e200307  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233287652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyners, M.10aMethods to analyse sensory profiling data--a comparison  ap. 507-514.  aPaper presented at the 6th Sensometrics meeting "The Sixth Sense" held July 31-August 2, 2002, Dortmund, Germany.  a2019-12-05  aThe analysis of sensory profiling data demands specialized statistical methods to account for different variations that are unknown in other statistical applications. Besides others, these are the different use of the descriptors by the assessors and the different use of the scales. The two most important approaches to cope with such data are given by Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) and STATIS. Recently, for the latter one several variants have been proposed in order to either simplify the calculation or to improve the results. The aim of this paper is to compare these methods with respect to their performance. For this purpose, a model will be stated to describe the outcomes of a sensory profiling study. On the basis of this model, we give a short insight into the ideas of the methods under consideration, and simulations to compare these methods are realised. From those, systematical differences between the methods occur. Finally, a comparison between the methods with respect to the interpretation of the estimated consensuses is given by means of graphically displaying the outcomes. For the considered data, it will be found that the choice of the method is arbitrary. 3asimulation models 3adata analysis 3asensory evaluation 0acomparisons 0astatis 0amethodology 0ageneralized procrustes analysis 0acomputer simulation0 tFood quality and preference.g2003 , v. 14, no. 5/6 p.507-514x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle02252naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012800128300001600256500011800272520096000390650001801350650001101368650001401379650001701393650001201410650001101422650001001433650002301443650001801466650002601484650001601510653001101526653003901537700001401576700001701590700001801607700001601625700001601641773008301657852000901740930003301749945001301782946001101795655001201806IND2332875620221122184723.0030603e200307  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233287562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehinagic, E.10aRelationship between sensory analysis, penetrometry and visible-NIR spectroscopy of apples belonging to different cultivars  ap. 473-484.  aPaper presented at the 6th Sensometrics meeting "The Sixth Sense" held July 31-August 2, 2002, Dortmund, Germany.  aNineteen French apple cultivars were characterised by sensory profiling, penetrometry and visible/near infrared (vis/NIR) spectroscopy. The main purpose was to investigate the relationships between sensory attributes, including apple texture and flavour, and destructive penetrometric measurements and non-destructive vis/NIR spectroscopy. Sensory crunchiness, touch resistance and crispness correlated well with total puncture force, flesh rupture breakdown force, and the work associated with that force. Juiciness and mealiness, two very important quality indices, were strongly correlated with the slope of force-deformation curves. A relationship was also found between different vis/NIR wavelengths and sensory attributes for apples (roughness, crunchiness, mealiness, sour and sweet taste). Subsequent studies will investigate the possible benefit of using vis/NIR spectroscopy to estimate certain sensory attributes measured by trained panellists. 3awater content 3aapples 3acultivars 3afood quality 3atexture 3aflavor 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 3apenetrometers 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3acorrelation 0atastes 0avisible-near infrared spectroscopy1 aRoyer, G.1 aBertrand, D.1 aSymoneaux, R.1 aLaurens, F.1 aJourjon, F.0 tFood quality and preference.g2003 , v. 14, no. 5/6 p.473-484x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle02221naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245012200212300002000334500001900354520095600373592002801329650001301357650001501370650001701385650001401402650001201416700006001428700006201488700005901550700006501609773011601674856008401790852000901874655001201883IND60718334320221120123117.0201124e20201111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071833432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c022362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeddon, William D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4862-837710aAdhesion of Grafted-to Polyelectrolyte Brushes Functionalized with Calix[4]resorcinarene and Deposited as a Monolayer  ap. 13843-13852.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolyelectrolyte adhesives, either poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] or poly(methacrylic acid), functionalized with a surface-active calix[4]resorcinarene were grafted onto silicon wafers. Adhesion studies on these grafted-to brushes using polyelectrolyte hydrogels of opposite charge showed that it is the calix[4]resorcinarene, rather than adsorption of polyelectrolyte monomers, that adheres the brush to the silicon substrate. The adhesion measured was similar to that measured using polymers grafted from the surface, and was stronger than a control layer of poly(vinyl acetate) under the same test conditions. The limiting factor was determined to be adhesive failure at the hydrogel-brush interface, rather than the brush-silicon interface. Therefore, the adhesion has not been adversely affected by changing from a grafted-from to a grafted-to brush, demonstrating the possibility of a one-pot approach to creating switchable adhesives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogels 3asilicon1 aAlfhaid, Latifah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8966-20801 aDunbar, Alan D.

Seeds were collected from La Campana National Park (Chile). The study was carried out under controlled conditions at the Laboratory of Ecology, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.Methods: During April 2001, 200 seeds were assigned to four experimental treatments: high precipitation, with and without litter and low precipitation, with and without litter. Each treatment had 50 individual seeds, each seed in an individual pot. For statistical purposes, we considered each seed as one replicate. High and low values of artificial rainfall corresponded to mean dry and wet years, respectively, for the period 1958 –– 1993 in the central zone of Chile.Results: Seeds germinated earlier, and in higher proportion, in the presence of leaf litter, but only under low rainfall. Seedling survival was insensitive to both litter and precipitation.Conclusions: We conclude that the presence of litter in native populations facilitates seed germination and recruitment of B. miersii, particularly during dry years. We suggest that the reduction of leaf litter due to extraction for gardens and horticultural activities might preclude regeneration of this endangered species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeilschmiedia miersii 3aendangered species 3agardens 3anational parks 3aplant litter 3apopulation 3aprobability 3arain 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atrees 3aChile 0aChile 0aFacilitation 0aMediterranean ecosystem 0aPlant recruitment 0aPlant regeneration 0aThreatened species1 aCelis-Diez, Juan L.1 aBustamante, Ramiro O.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2004 Dec., v. 7, no. 2 p.253-257dOpulus Pressx1402-20017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1402-2001%282004%29007%5B0253%3AEOLLAP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  a20051128b20051202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02634naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245009300160520167100253592002801924650002301952650000901975650001401984650001301998650002202011650002202033700001702055700002702072700001502099773012102114856007602235852000902311655001202320IND60792670920221118054224.0220908e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079267092DNAL7 a10.3390/ani121722512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shuolei 10aBenefits and Conflicts: A Systematic Review of Dog Park Design and Management Strategies  aDog ownership and dog walking brings various health benefits for urban dwellers, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, but trigger a number of controversies. Dog parks have become increasingly significant public resources in the pandemic to support these benefits while facing intense conflicts. To develop effective dog parks in urban settings, growing numbers of scholars have provided insights into the design and management strategies for addressing the benefits and conflicts. The objective of this study is to synthesize and analyze various aspects of dog park design and management and to assess identified strategies for enhancing their benefits while mitigating their drawbacks. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic study was conducted to synthesize the benefits, conflicts, and management strategies of dog parks, supported by Citespace. Benefits and conflicts in dog park design and management have been synthesized and organized according to their frequency of presence and the statistical results. We analyzed and assessed existing design and management strategies. Through this systematic study, we discovered the need obtain o po experimental evidence on effective dog park design and management to enhance their benefits while mitigating their sources of conflict and limitations in the intensity of park visitors’ physical activity in off-leash areas. Guidelines for the design and management strategies for effective dog parks were made to enhance their benefits while alleviating conflicts in the future development of sustainable dog parks that promote healthy relationships between canines and residents in urban built environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adogs 3aownership 3apandemic 3aphysical activity 3asystematic review1 aWu, Zhuoran 1 aSleipness, Ole Russell1 aWang, Hao 0 tAnimals.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 12, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121722513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245012400207300002000331500001900351520133000370592002801700650001301728650002301741650001801764650001201782650002101794650001501815650001301830650001101843700007001854700002001924700006501944700002302009700006102032773011602093856008402209852000902293655001202302IND60718334520221120122738.0201124e20201111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071833452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c022612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCummins, Cian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6338-399110aStrategy for Enhancing Ultrahigh-Molecular-Weight Block Copolymer Chain Mobility to Access Large Period Sizes (>100 nm)  ap. 13872-13880.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAssembling ultrahigh-molecular-weight (UHMW) block copolymers (BCPs) in rapid time scales is perceived as a grand challenge in polymer science due to slow kinetics. Through surface engineering and identifying a nonvolatile solvent (propylene glycol methyl ether acetate, PGMEA), we showcase the impressive ability of a series of lamellar poly(styrene)-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) BCPs to self-assemble directly after spin-coating. In particular, we show the formation of large-period (≈111 nm) lamellar structures from a neat UHMW PS-b-P2VP BCP. The significant influence of solvent–polymer solubility parameters are explored to enhance the polymer chain mobility. After optimization using solvent vapor annealing, increased feature order of ultralarge-period PS-b-P2VP BCP patterns in 1 h is achieved. Isolated metallic and dielectric features are also demonstrated to exemplify the promise that large BCP periods offer for functional applications. The methods described in this article center on industry-compatible patterning schemes, solvents, and deposition techniques. Thus, our straightforward UHMW BCP strategy potentially paves a viable and practical path forward for large-scale integration in various sectors, e.g., photonic band gaps, polarizers, and membranes that demand ultralarge period sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acomposite polymers 3amethyl ethers 3aphotons 3apropylene glycol 3asolubility 3asolvents 3avapors1 aAlvarez-Fernandez, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2607-30351 aBentaleb, Ahmed1 aHadziioannou, Georges1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7377-60401 aPonsinet, Virginie1 aFleury, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0779-191X0 tLangmuir.g2020 Nov. 11, v. 36, no. 46 p.13872-13880dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c022613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011500172300001200287520163000299592002801929650002001957650001501977650002001992650001302012650001302025650002002038650001002058650004202068650003002110650001602140650002002156650000902176650002602185650001102211650001402222650001302236650001702249650001802266650002002284653002002304653001402324653002002338653002002358653001802378653003102396700001402427700005602441773008402497856008602581852000902667655001202676IND60604118520221119201005.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060411852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2015.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yŏng-suk,10aHigh-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing reveals alterations of mouse intestinal microbiota after radiotherapy  ap. 1-7.  aThe mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors a highly complex microbial community that comprises hundreds of different types of bacterial cells. The gastrointestinal microbiota plays an important role in the function of the host intestine. Most cancer patients undergoing pelvic irradiation experience side effects such as diarrhea; however, little is currently known about the effects of irradiation on the microorganisms colonizing the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gamma irradiation on the compositions of the large and small intestinal microbiotas. The gut microbiotas in control mice and mice receiving irradiation treatment were characterized by high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Irradiation treatment induced significant alterations in the bacterial compositions of the large and small intestines at the genus level. Unexpectedly, irradiation treatment increased the number of operational taxonomic units in the small intestine but not the large intestine. In particular, irradiation treatment increased the level of the genera Alistipes in the large intestine and increased the level of the genus Corynebacterium in the small intestine. By contrast, compared with that in the corresponding control group, the level of the genera Prevotella was lower in the irradiated large intestine, and the level of the genera Alistipes was lower in the irradiated small intestine. Overall, the data presented here reveal the potential microbiological effects of pelvic irradiation on the gastrointestinal tracts of cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium 3aPrevotella 3aadverse effects 3abacteria 3adiarrhea 3agamma radiation 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintestinal microorganisms 3airradiation 3alarge intestine 3amice 3amicrobial communities 3amucosa 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aradiotherapy 3aribosomal RNA 3asmall intestine 0aGut microbioota 0aRadiation 0aLarge intestine 0aSmall intestine 0a16S rRNA gene 0aNext-generation sequencing1 aKim, Jinu1 aPark, Soo-Je1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0359-74310 tAnaerobe.g2015 June, v. 33 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2015.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006700154245010300221520117900324592002801503650001201531650001301543650002701556650002001583650001601603650001801619650001001637650002001647650002001667650001001687650001601697650001501713650001401728650001901742650002301761650001501784650001601799653000801815653000901823653000701832653001301839653001801852653001601870653001401886653001301900653001601913653001501929653001501944653000701959653000801966653000901974653000901983653000801992653000802000653000902008653000802017653000902025653001002034653000902044653000802053653001902061653001402080653001602094653000802110653000802118653001602126653001202142653001402154653002702168653002002195653002702215700002502242700006102267700002002328700002002348773011802368856008902486852000902575655001202584IND60723416520221116203717.0211017e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072341652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.1148262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAitfella Lahlou, Radhia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6911-694710aDietary use of Rosmarinus officinalis and Thymus vulgaris as anticoccidial alternatives in poultry  aCoccidiosis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoa belonging to the genus Eimeria and whose propagation has a tremendous economic impact on poultry production. The parasite develops in the intestinal tract and causes disturbances in homeostasis that may lead to the death of the animal. Anticoccidial drugs and vaccination are the main preventive measures used against this disease. However, the rapid spread of drug resistance and the emergence of environmental pollutants have led to search other alternatives that do not hinder the health and productivity of broilers. The use of medicinal plants or plant-derived products could be one of these approaches; in fact, plants are reservoirs of bioactive compounds that could be developed as new chemical entities. Two members of the Lamiaceae family, Rosmarinus officinalis and Thymus vulgaris included in the Algerian pharmacopoeia have been reviewed herein, as well as their anticoccidial activity. We discuss their potential uses as natural growth promoters, referring their phytochemical constituents and biological properties that could play a crucial role in improving the symptoms caused by coccidiosis in poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria 3aProtozoa 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aThymus vulgaris 3acoccidiosis 3acoccidiostats 3adeath 3adrug resistance 3aeconomic impact 3afeeds 3ahomeostasis 3aintestines 3aparasites 3aphytochemicals 3apoultry production 3atechnology 3avaccination 0aADI 0aAP-1 0aBW 0aCLEC-213 0aE. acervulina 0aE. brunetti 0aE. maxima 0aE. mitis 0aE. necatrix 0aE. praecox 0aE. tenella 0aEU 0aFAO 0aIC50 0aIL-6 0aISO 0aJNK 0aLC50 0aLPS 0aMDBK 0aNF-kB 0aPCKC 0aPCR 0aR. officinalis 0aTNF-alpha 0aT. vulgaris 0aUSD 0aWHO 0aCoccidiosis 0aPoultry 0aLamiaceae 0aRosmarinus officinalis 0aThymus vulgaris 0aAnticoccidial activity1 aBounechada, Mustapha1 aMohammedi, Arezki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2065-30711 aSilva, Luís R.1 aAlves, Gilberto0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2021 Mar., v. 273 p.114826-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.1148263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007100165300001800236520142800254592002801682650002201710650002001732650001301752650001701765650001401782650001701796650002001813650004301833650002201876650002301898650001101921650001801932650001301950651001001963700001701973700001601990700001702006700001902023700001802042700001802060700001602078700001902094700001602113773012502129856008102254852000902335655001202344IND60746293620221119123427.0210730e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074629362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-020-0251-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Qiaoying10aIdentification of potential sex-related genes in Siniperca chuatsi  ap. 1500-1512.  aMandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) is an economically important freshwater fish cultured in China. In this species, females grow faster than males. However, due to the lack of available genomic and transcriptome information, the mechanisms of sex differentiation remain poorly understood. In this study, Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology was used to sequence four cDNA libraries; the tissues examined included hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovary, and testis. A total of 134 124 high-quality unigenes were obtained on average length of 1 361 bp and N50 of 3 312 bp. A search of all-unigene sequences against NR, NT, SwissProt, KOG, KEGG, GO, and InterPro databases resulted in 59 688 (44.50%), 76 329 (56.91%), 50 432 (37.60%), 45 741 (34.10%), 48 760 (36.35%), 5 241 (3.91%), and 46 099 (34.37%) annotations, respectively. In a comparison of ovarian and testicular libraries, 15 289 ovary-biased genes and 10 035 testis-biased genes were identified, including a series of genes related to sex determination and differentiation, such as cyp19a1a, foxl2, sox9, dmrtl, amh, and others. In addition, 49 495 SSRs and 85 899 SNPs were detected in transcriptome data. Quantitative real-time PCR results of 15 sex-related functional genes indicated that RNA-seq data was reliable. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of sex differentiation and development in Mandarin fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiniperca chuatsi 3afreshwater fish 3agenomics 3ahypothalamus 3alimnology 3aoceanography 3apituitary gland 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asex determination 3asexual development 3atestes 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 3aChina1 aHan, Chŏng,1 aPeng, Cheng1 aZhou, Xingni1 aWang, Chongwei1 aHan, Linqiang1 aLi, Shuisheng1 aLi, Guifeng1 aLim, Jonathan,1 aZhang, Yong0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2021 July, v. 39, no. 4 p.1500-1512dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-020-0251-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245008200170520137200252592002801624650001401652650000901666650002001675650001401695650001901709650001401728650001901742650001901761650001301780650001501793650002201808650001601830700002201846700002301868700002101891700002101912700002301933773012101956856007602077852000902153655001202162IND60792671020221118054303.0220908e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079267102DNAL7 a10.3390/ani121722532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandido, Marcus Vinicius10aCan Chromoendoscopy Improve the Early Diagnosis of Gastric Carcinoma in Dogs?  aChromoendoscopy has improved the early diagnosis of gastric cancer in humans but its usefulness in dogs is unknown. This study aimed at assessing whether adding narrow band imaging (NBI) or indigo carmine (IC) chromoendoscopy (CE) can improve the diagnostic yield of standard white light endoscopy (WLE). We compared the real-time findings of canine WLE, NBI-CE, and IC-CE and corresponding histology reports with endoscopic mucosal pattern assessment templates used in human medicine. Belgian Shepherd dogs are predisposed to gastric carcinoma. Therefore, 30 dogs of this breed served as the study population. According to histology, 17/30 dogs had mucosal changes (mucous metaplasia, glandular dysplasia, and gastric carcinoma). Diagnostic yield was best when targeted biopsies were taken with WLE and NBI-CE combined (15/17 cases). WLE alone positively identified only 8/17 cases and missed a gastric carcinoma in 3/6 cases. CE assessment templates based on macroscopic mucosal patterns, broadly used in human medicine, were not readily applicable in dogs. In conclusion, the study provides evidence that using CE in dogs has the potential to improve the diagnosis of precancerous gastric mucosal pathology and early gastric carcinoma. However, current image assessment templates from human medicine need major adjustments to the patterns of canine gastric mucosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinoma 3adogs 3aearly diagnosis 3aendoscopy 3agastric mucosa 3ahistology 3aimage analysis 3aindigo carmine 3amedicine 3ametaplasia 3astomach neoplasms 3awhite light1 aSyrjä, Pernilla 1 aKilpinen, Susanne 1 aMeisner, Søren 1 aHanifeh, Mohsen 1 aSpillmann, Thomas 0 tAnimals.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 12, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121722533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245008200187300001600269520105100285592002801336650002701364650000801391650002101399650001001420650003701430650003001467650001201497650001401509653004401523653002901567653001901596653002001615653001801635653002001653700002201673773011701695856008201812852000901894655001201903IND60517231520221121072138.0190729e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051723152DNAL7 a220757482pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820110017882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHUANG, JIMMY J.10aRNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans: Uptake, mechanism, and regulation  ap. 560-573.  aRNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful research tool that has enabled molecular insights into gene activity, pathway analysis, partial loss-of-function phenotypes, and large-scale genomic discovery of gene function. While RNAi works extremely well in the non-parasitic nematode C. elegans, it is also especially useful in organisms that lack facile genetic analysis. Extensive genetic analysis of the mechanisms, delivery and regulation of RNAi in C. elegans has provided mechanistic and phenomenological insights into why RNAi is so effective in this species. These insights are useful for the testing and development of RNAi in other nematodes, including parasitic nematodes where more effective RNAi would be extremely useful. Here, we review the current advances in C. elegans for RNA delivery methods, regulation of cell autonomous and systemic RNAi phenomena, and implications of enhanced RNAi mutants. These discussions, with a focus on mechanism and cross-species application, provide new perspectives for optimizing RNAi in other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aRNA 3aRNA interference 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3aphenotype 0aCaenorhabditis elegans RNA interference 0areverse genetics methods 0aRNAi transport 0aRNAi regulation 0asystemic RNAi 0aautonomous RNAi1 aHunter, Craig P.,0 tParasitology.g2012 Apr., v. 139, no. 5 p.560-573dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820110017883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245008700212300002000299500001900319520153700338592002801875650001801903650001301921650001201934650001601946650000901962650001101971650001301982650001801995650002202013650002402035650002002059700001802079700002002097700001802117700005702135700006002192773011602252856008402368852000902452655001202461IND60718334620210903000000.0201124e20201109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071833462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c022722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGünay, A.

In the past 3 centuries, transient techniques have been developed to characterize the evaporation of sessile droplets. These methods have difficulty in reconciling transient effects induced by the droplet shape and size changes during evaporation. Furthermore, investigation of evaporation of microdroplets residing on wetting substrates, or fluids having low surface tensions (<30 mN/m), is difficult to perform using established approaches. Here, we use the steady method to study the microdroplet evaporation dynamics of low surface tension liquids. We start by employing the steady method to benchmark with water droplets having base radii (20 ≤ Rb ≤ 260 μm), apparent advancing contact angle (45° ≤ θₐ,ₐₚₚ ≤ 162°), surface temperature (30 < Tₛ < 60 °C), and relative humidity (40% < ϕ < 60%). Following validation, evaporation of ethanol (≈22 mN/m), hexane (≈18 mN/m), and dodecane (≈25 mN/m) were studied for 90 ≤ Rb ≤ 400 μm and 10 < Tₛ < 25 °C. We elucidate the mechanisms governing the observed behavior using heat and mass transport scaling analysis during evaporation, demonstrating our steady technique to be particularly advantageous for microdroplets, where Marangoni and buoyant forces are negligible. Our work not only elucidates the droplet evaporation mechanisms of low surface tension liquids but also demonstrates the steady method as a means to study phase change processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3aethanol 3aevaporation 3aheat 3ahexane 3aindustry 3amass transfer 3arelative humidity 3asurface temperature 3asurface tension1 aGnadt, Marisa1 aSett, Soumyadip1 aVahabi, Hamed1 aKota, Arun K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9061-78961 aMiljkovic, Nenad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0866-36800 tLangmuir.g2020 Nov. 09, v. 36, no. 46 p.13860-13871dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c022723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245011400192300001600306520183200322592002802154650001402182650001402196650001102210650002002221650001602241650001202257650001402269650001202283650001102295650001302306650004002319650001502359650002502374650001402399650000902413653001702422653001502439653002302454653001202477653002502489653001102514653001602525700002302541700001802564773009702582856011702679852000902796655001202805IND60449368720221119072234.0151031e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044936872DNAL7 a10.1658/1402-2001(2004)007[0267:PSOTTP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBissels, Stephanie10aPopulation structure of the threatened perennial Serratula tinctoria in relation to vegetation and management  ap. 267-274.  aQuestion: How does vegetation and management affect the population stage structure of Serratula tinctoria, a species indicative of highly endangered and species-rich flood-plain meadows? Are different management regimes suitable to support viable populations of S. tinctoria?Location: Flood-plain of the northern Upper Rhine, Germany.Methods: We analysed the population structure of S. tinctoria at 24 meadow sites which differed in vegetation and management. In this comparative study the investigated meadows were either (1) late mown in September; (2) early mown in June or (3) mown in June and then grazed by sheep.Results: The structure of the surrounding vegetation had a clear effect on the population structure of S. tinctoria. The percentage of bare soil, as well as the cover of bryophytes, were positively related, whereas the Ellenberg N-value of the established vegetation was negatively related to the density and proportion of seedlings. Generally, we found only slight differences between the population structure of S. tinctoria in early and late mown meadows. Both management regimes had high densities of seedlings. In contrast, the meadow pastures supported significantly lower densities of seedlings and generative adults but relatively high densities of juveniles and vegetative adults, indicating a greater importance of clonal propagation under grazing pressure.Conclusions: Our results clearly showed that viable populations of S. tinctoria may occur in all of the studied management regimes. Although S. tinctoria was considered to be highly sensitive to early mowing, our findings suggest a facilitation of the species at more nutrient-rich sites by mowing in June, which is also a benefit for the integration of management in farming systems.Abbreviation: PAR == Photosynthetically active radiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryopsida 3aSerratula 3aadults 3afarming systems 3afloodplains 3agrazing 3ajuveniles 3ameadows 3amowing 3apastures 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3apopulation 3apopulation structure 3aseedlings 3asoil 0aConservation 0aDemography 0aFlood-plain meadow 0aGrazing 0aLong-lived perennial 0aMowing 0aRecruitment1 aHöölzel, Norbert1 aOtte, Annette0 tApplied vegetation science.g2004 Dec., v. 7, no. 2 p.267-274dOpulus Pressx1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1402-2001%282004%29007%5B0267%3APSOTTP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01723naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245015600170300001600326500001900342520058600361592002800947650001700975650001600992650002501008651001101033653001901044653001301063653002301076653001701099653001501116700002601131773012501157856008201282852000901364655001201373IND60699883720221119204148.0200623e20200619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069988372DNAL7 a10.1649/0010-065X-74.2.4472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado, Leonardo12aA New Species of Cyclocephala Dejean (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae) from Eastern Mexico, with New Records for Mexican Species of Cyclocephalini  ap. 447-453.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCyclocephala marquezi Delgado and Mora-Aguilar, new species, from the tropical dry forest of the state of Veracruz, Mexico, is described and illustrated.

We develop a simulation‐based framework to quantify changes in the hydrologic triggering conditions for debris flows as postwildfire infiltration properties evolve through time. Our approach produces time‐varying rainfall intensity‐duration thresholds for runoff‐ and infiltration‐generated debris flows with physics‐based hydrologic simulations that are parameterized with widely available hydroclimatic, vegetation reflectance, and soil texture data. When we apply our thresholding protocol to a test case in the San Gabriel Mountains (California, USA), the results are consistent with existing regional empirical thresholds and rainstorms that caused runoff‐ and infiltration‐generated debris flows soon after and three years following a wildfire, respectively. We find that the hydrologic triggering mechanisms for the two observed debris flow types are coupled with the effects of fire on the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity. Specifically, the rainfall intensity needed to generate debris flows via runoff increases with time following wildfire while the rainfall duration needed to produce debris flows via subsurface pore‐water pressures decreases. We also find that variations in soil moisture, rainfall climatology, median grain size, and root reinforcement could impact the median annual probability of postwildfire debris flows. We conclude that a simulation‐based method for calculating rainfall thresholds is a tractable approach to improve situational awareness of debris flow hazard in the years following wildfire. Further development of our framework will be important to quantify postwildfire hazard levels in variable climates, vegetation types, and fire regimes.  aPublisher supplied data  a1332KP20FNRMT0012cNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3aclimatology 3ageophysics 3amass movement 3aprobability 3arain 3arain intensity 3arainfall duration 3areflectance 3aresearch 3arunoff 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3awildfires 3aCalifornia1 aRengers, Francis K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-09431 aKean, Jason W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3089-03691 aMcGuire, Luke A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8178-79221 aStaley, Dennis M.1 aBarnhart, Katherine R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5682-455X1 aEbel, Brian A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5413-39630 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 June, v. 126, no. 6 p.e2021JF006091-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF0060913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245019400167500001900361520204000380592002802420650001502448650002302463650001702486650001102503650001602514650003102530650001402561650001902575650001302594651001102607653001502618653002002633700002102653700002102674700001902695700001902714700002702733773010702760856008502867852000902952655001202961IND60698555220221120133701.0200819e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069855522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1149922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelin, Jodie10aHow to select relevant metabolites based on available data for parent molecules: Case of neonicotinoids, carbamates, phenylpyrazoles and organophosphorus compounds in French water resources  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe presence of pesticide in water resources is a topical issue in France as in many other countries. Resources can be contaminated by current-used pesticides and their metabolites but also by molecules banned 50 years ago. The number of reported studies on the impact of these substances on human health and environment increases every day. Currently, pesticides and their relevant degradation products are subjected to the European regulation for water intended for human consumption. It sets an individual quality limit of 0.1 μg/L, and another of 0.5 μg/L for the sum of their concentrations. The constant improvement of analytical methods allows laboratories to detect pesticides, at lower and lower concentrations but also more and more metabolites. However, regulation does not provide a national indicative metabolites list to be monitored. Each regional health agency offers their own list based on local agricultural practices and quantities of pesticides sold. This article reports a prioritization method allowing to identify new metabolites to be monitored in water resources, along drinking water treatment plants and in treated water; it describes its application in France in order to anticipate possible non-compliance with raw water and treated water and to provide solutions upstream of changes in sanitary control. This methodology has been developed to rank pesticides and to select the corresponding metabolites by combining three main criteria: use (sale and type of use), toxicity, and environmental fate (based on physical and chemical properties). Prioritization method was applied to four families of pesticides: carbamates, organophosphorus compounds, phenylpyrazoles and neonicotinoids, for which there is a real lack of knowledge as regards the occurrence of their metabolites in metropolitan France. 146 pesticides have been prioritized. The first 50 molecules were considered allowing the identification of 72 metabolites to be monitored in water resources and along drinking water treatment plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbamates 3aenvironmental fate 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3apollution 3aprioritization 3atoxicity 3aFrance 0aPesticides 0aWater resources1 aGuillon, Amélie1 aEnault, Jérôme1 aEsperanza, Mar1 aDauchy, Xavier1 aBouchonnet, Stéphane,0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Oct., v. 265 p.114992-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1149923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013100164300001400295520138700309592002801696653002301724653002401747653002301771653003401794653001901828653001801847700001501865700001701880773010101897856008101998852000902079655001202088IND60596112920221120102351.0180613e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059611292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mvr.2017.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjit, N.K.10aJoule heating and zeta potential effects on peristaltic blood flow through porous micro vessels altered by electrohydrodynamic  ap. 74-89.  aIn most of the medical therapies, electromagnetic field plays important role to modulate the blood flow and to reduce the pain of human body. With this fact, this paper presents a mathematical model to study the peristaltic blood flow through porous microvessels in the presence of electrohydrodynamics. The effects of Joule heating and different zeta potential are also considered. Darcy law is employed for porous medium. The mathematical analysis is carried out in the form of electroosmosis, flow analysis and heat transfer analysis. Velocity slip conditions are imposed to solve momentum equation and thermal energy equation. Time dependent volumetric flow rate is considered which varies exponentially. Closed form solutions for potential function is obtained under Debye-Hückel approximation and velocity and temperature fields are obtained under low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The influence of Hartmann number, electroosmotic parameter, slip parameters, Zeta potential, and couple stress parameter on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics and trapping phenomenon is computed. The effects of thermal slip parameters, Joule heating parameter, and Brinkman number on heat transfer characteristics are also presented graphically. Finally, the effect of Brinkman number on a graph between Nusselt number and Joule heating parameter is examined.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPeristaltic motion 0aCouple stress fluid 0aPorous microvessel 0aElectro-magneto-hydrodynamics 0aZeta potential 0aJoule heating1 aShit, G.C.1 aTripathi, D.0 tMicrovascular research.g2018 May, v. 117 p.74-89dElsevier Inc.wJournal:26766x0026-28627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mvr.2017.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013300172300001400305520142100319592002801740650002501768650001201793650001601805650002601821650001501847650001601862650001301878650002001891650001801911650001601929650001301945650001301958650002401971650001801995650001702013650001602030650002102046650001702067650001402084650002102098650001702119651001002136653000902146653001302155653001402168653002902182653000802211700002502219700003002244700001602274700003002290773008602320856008602406852000902492655001202501IND60604118920221119151959.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060411892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2015.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkar, Anirban10aDetection of integron-associated gene cassettes and other antimicrobial resistance genes in enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis  ap. 18-24.  aTwenty seven Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) strains isolated from children in Kolkata, India, were tested for their antimicrobial resistance, presence of integrons and resistance encoding genes. Almost all the strains (>90%) were resistant to two or more antimicrobials. About 59–92% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Most of these antimicrobial agents have been used in the treatment of diarrhea and other infectious diseases. In addition, about half a number of strains (48–55%) were resistant to clindamycin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ampicillin/sulbactam and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Moxifloxacin and metronidazole resistance ranged from 30 to 40%. All strains however, were found to be susceptible to chloramphenicol and imipenem. Class 1 integrase (intI1) was detected in seven and class 2 integrase (intI2) in one of the twenty seven ETBF strains. Resistance gene cassettes carried by these integrons had different alleles of dfr or aad genes. Beside these integron-borne genes, other genes encoding different antimicrobial resistance were also detected. Resistance genes such as cep(A) and tet(Q) were detected in most of the ETBF strains. To the best of our knowledge, this work constituted the first extensive report from India on the detection of integrons and antimicrobial resistance genes in ETBF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides fragilis 3aalleles 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acefotaxime 3aceftazidime 3achildren 3achloramphenicol 3aciprofloxacin 3aclindamycin 3adiarrhea 3aimipenem 3ainfectious diseases 3ametronidazole 3amoxifloxacin 3anorfloxacin 3aresistance genes 3astreptomycin 3asulbactam 3asulfamethoxazole 3atrimethoprim 3aIndia 0aETBF 0aDiarrhea 0aIntegrons 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aMIC1 aPazhani, Gururaja P.1 aDharanidharan, Ramamurthy1 aGhosh, Amit1 aRamamurthy, Thandavarayan0 tAnaerobe.g2015 June, v. 33 p.18-24dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2015.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015400169500002200323520143500345592002801780650002801808650002401836650001901860650002001879650002201899650001101921650001601932650001401948650002801962650001101990650001302001653001802014653002202032653001802054653001902072700002502091700001902116700001602135773009002151856008602241852000902327655001202336IND60659334620221117054527.0190822e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065933462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.1052832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShekh, Kamran10aSensitivity of white sturgeon and rainbow trout to waterborne copper exposure: a comparative study of copper-induced disruption of sodium homeostasis  aPre-press version  aRecent studies have demonstrated that white sturgeon are more sensitive to acute exposure to Cu than rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), especially during early life-stages. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying this difference in sensitivity to Cu is not known. In the present study, we first confirmed the higher sensitivity (lower 96 h LC50 values) of white sturgeon to Cu at three different life stages (larva, swim-up, and juvenile) relative to their counterparts in rainbow trout. We also demonstrated that acute exposure to Cu (50 µg/L for 4.5 h) caused a significantly greater reduction in the rate of waterborne Na uptake in white sturgeon relative to that in rainbow trout across all three life-stages. In agreement with this observation, we also found that acute exposure to Cu (20 µg/L for 48 h) elicits a significantly greater decrease in whole body Na level in all life stages of white sturgeon compared to rainbow trout. In contrast, white sturgeon demonstrated a higher or similar level of Cu body burden relative to rainbow trout during acute Cu exposure (20 µg/L for 24 h), thereby indicating that Cu bioaccumulation is not a good indicator of its toxicity in these species. Overall, our study demonstrated that the differences in sensitivity to acute Cu exposure between white sturgeon and rainbow trout can be explained on the basis of differential effects of Cu on Na homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser transmontanus 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aacute exposure 3abioaccumulation 3acomparative study 3acopper 3ahomeostasis 3ajuveniles 3alethal concentration 50 3asodium 3atoxicity 0asodium uptake 0awhole body sodium 0arainbow trout 0awhite sturgeon1 aAlcaraz, Alper James1 aHecker, Markus1 aNiyogi, Som0 tAquatic toxicology.g2019 Aug. 20, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.1052833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010600176300001600282520200700298592002802305650001502333650002702348650002002375650001802395650001302413650002402426650001702450650001902467650001102486650001602497650001602513650001802529650003502547650002402582650001502606653002002621653001602641653001502657653002002672700002702692700002202719700002802741700003702769700002502806700002902831700002902860773010802889856008602997852000903083655001203092IND50068577920221120161237.0190318e20130830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006857792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalemi, Luiz Felippe10aLand-use change in the Atlantic rainforest region: Consequences for the hydrology of small catchments  ap. 100-109.  aThe Atlantic forest of Brazil is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world. Despite approximately 500years of intense land-use change in this biome, the influence of land-use changes on hydrological processes have yet to be investigated in-depth. To bridge this gap, we studied various features of three small catchments covered by pristine original montane cloud forest, pasture, and eucalyptus for 2years (January 2008–December 2009), including the hydraulic properties of soils, throughfall, overland flow and streamflow processes. The forest saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) was higher near the soil surface (0.15m depth) compared to eucalyptus and pasture. As a consequence, higher overland flow generation in terms of volume was observed in pasture and eucalyptus. Despite this increase in overland flow generation, overland flow coefficients (overland flow: precipitation ratio) were substantially low throughout the study period with slightly higher values in 2009. These low overland flow coefficients were attributed to the large predominance of low rainfall intensities (<10mmh−1) as well as high Ksat spatial variability. These overland flow results and the absence of perched water table showed that catchments seem still to be dominated by vertical flowpaths irrespective of land-use. In this sense, the annual streamflow is still dominated by baseflow in all of the catchments. Therefore, despite reductions regarding interception and saturated hydraulic conductivity when converting forest to eucalyptus and pasture, the prevailing rainfall intensities do not cause runoff generation processes to be substantially different among land-uses. Forest and eucalyptus convert a similar proportion of annual precipitation to annual streamflow, with the more likely factors for these results being the high interception under forest and high transpiration under eucalyptus. Finally, cloud forest conversion to pasture does not promote significant monthly streamflow change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aland use change 3aoverland flow 3apastures 3aperched water table 3arain forests 3arain intensity 3arunoff 3astream flow 3athroughfall 3atranspiration 3atropical montane cloud forests 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 0aSmall watershed 0aWater cycle 0aConversion 0aTropical forest1 aGroppo, Juliano Daniel1 aTrevisan, Rodrigo1 ade Moraes, Jorge Marcos1 ade Barros Ferraz, Silvio Frosini1 aVillani, João Paulo1 aDuarte-Neto, Paulo José1 aMartinelli, Luiz Antonio0 tJournal of hydrology.g2013 Aug. 30, v. 499 p.100-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002700135245014200162300001600304500001900320520122500339592002801564650001601592650000901608650002101617650001701638650001401655650001501669650002301684651001101707653001601718653002001734653001401754653001501768700002101783700001801804700002501822700002001847700002301867700002401890773014001914856006902054852000902123655001202132IND60699883920221119203921.0200623e20200623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069988392DNAL7 a10.1645/19-992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, Rafaela N.

Both infected birds were in poor physical condition, with atrophied pectoral muscles, and died soon after starting treatment. The parasitological and pathological examination of the carcasses revealed the presence of C. (C.) phenisci in the trachea, resulting in tracheitis, as well as severe parasitic granulomatous bronchopneumonia caused by eggs deposited in the lungs. In our opinion, these serious pathological changes were the primary cause of chronic respiratory illness. This is the first description of fatal cyathostomiasis in a fish-eating avian host caused by infection by a member of the subgenus Cyathostoma (Cyathostoma). Therefore, it is reasonable to consider C. (C.) phenisci to be a real threat to a wide range of their definitive hosts, and cyathostomiasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis for fish-eating marine birds, even in cases without respiratory signs. This is also the first record of the genus Cyathostoma in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyathostoma 3aSula 3abronchopneumonia 3aparasitology 3apathogens 3atracheitis 3aveterinary clinics 3aBrazil 0aBrown Booby 0aCyathostomiasis 0aPathology 0aSyngamidae1 aBaldassin, Paula1 aJerdy, Hassan1 aCarvalho, Eulogio C.1 aKanarek, Gerard1 aZaleśny, Grzegorz1 aWerneck, Max Rondon0 tJournal of parasitology.g2020 June 23, v. 106, no. 3 p.400-405dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/19-993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245007700189300001600266520075600282592002801038650002701066650000801093650002101101650003101122650001001153650001101163650001801174650002901192653003001221653000901251653001301260653001301273700002201286700001901308700002201327773011701349856008201466852000901548655001201557IND60517231920221121105933.0190729e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051723192DNAL7 a224594332pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820110023322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSELKIRK, MURRAY E.14aThe development of RNA interference (RNAi) in gastrointestinal nematodes  ap. 605-612.  aDespite the utility of RNAi for defining gene function in Caenorhabditis elegans and early successes reported in parasitic nematodes, RNAi has proven to be stubbornly inconsistent or ineffective in the animal parasitic nematodes examined to date.

In this work fundamental concepts on the use of the Student’s test were reviewed and Monte Carlo simulations were done to ascertain whether relevant differences arise when the two options are considered. It was concluded that for small sample sets (as it is usual in analytical laboratories) the Student’s t-test based on the standard error of regression models must be used and special attention must be paid on the equality of the models variances.

This attribute affects the demography and population genetic structure of the resident populations. Further, human populations residing in the mountains in India are poorly studied for their genetic make-up and allele distribution patterns. In the present study, we genotyped 594 unrelated individuals using PowerPlex® 21 System (Promega, USA) from eight different populations belonging to 12 districts of Himachal Pradesh which differed in ethnicity, language, geography and social organization. Altogether, we obtained 1415 alleles with a mean of 8.84 ± 0.26 alleles per locus and 0.80 mean observed heterozygosity. Locus Penta E showed the highest combined power of discrimination and was found most informative for forensic purposes. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis grouped the populations of Rajputs, Scheduled castes and Brahmins into one cluster, which indicated a deep genetic admixture in the ancestral populations. This study documents the first-ever report on the population genetic assignment of various castes in Himachal Pradesh and unveils the facts of cryptic gene flow among the diverse castes in the northern hilly state of India. Our results showed a genetic relationship among the various ethno-linguistically diverse populations of India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aancestry 3ademography 3aforensic sciences 3agene flow 3agenotyping 3ageography 3aheterozygosity 3ahuman population 3aloci 3amountains 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aphylogeny 3apopulation 3asocial structure 3aIndia 0aPopulation structure 0aGenetic diversity 0aPowerPlex® 21 system 0aHimachal Pradesh 0aHuman forensics1 aSahajpal, Vivek1 aKumar, Satish1 aShukla, Malay1 aBhandari, Deepika1 aSharma, Shivkant1 aSharma, Arun1 aChandra, Kailash1 aKumar Sharma, Lalit1 aThakur, Mukesh0 tGene.g2021 Mar. 10, v. 772 p.145373-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1453733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015600166300001800322520133500340592002801675650001501703650001601718650001801734650001401752650001201766650000901778650001401787650001701801650001201818650001101830650001401841651001001855700001601865700001301881700001801894700001901912773012501931856008102056852000902137655001202146IND60746294320221119123720.0210730e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074629432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-020-0224-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Pengcheng10aReproductive characteristics of Psilorhynchus homaloptera Hora and Mukerji, 1935 (Cyprinidae: Psilorhynchidae) in the lower Yarlung Zangbo River, Tibet  ap. 1513-1522.  aPsilorhynchus homaloptera mainly inhabits turbulent waters in the lower reach of the Yarlung Zangbo River, Tibet, China, and it is the only species of Psilorhynchus in China. However, many important aspects of its biology remain poorly documented, which hinders the conservation efforts. Therefore, we studied its reproduction using 801 specimens from the Motuo sector of the lower Yarlung Zangbo River from December 2015 to November 2016. The sex ratio was 0.68:1 (male:female) for the overall population. Females reached a larger total length and weight (134 mm and 18.6 g) than males did (113 mm and 12.2 g). Lengths at maturity were estimated 80.0 mm for males and 93.1 mm for females. Our analyses of gonad development and the size distribution of oocytes suggest that P. homaloptera is a single spawner with the peak spawning period between September and October. Furthermore, the estimated mean absolute fecundity was 557±204 eggs per fish, and mean relative fecundity was 50.9±10.9 eggs per g of female weight. The fecundity of P. homaloptera increased linearly with increasing total length, total weight, ovary weight, and age. This study on the reproductive biology of P. homaloptera demonstrates that the fish was in a vulnerable state due to the increasing anthropogenic activities in the lower Yarlung Zangbo River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinidae 3aHomaloptera 3aPsilorhynchus 3afecundity 3afemales 3afish 3alimnology 3aoceanography 3aoocytes 3arivers 3asex ratio 3aChina1 aHu, Huaming1 aLiu, Fei1 aLi, Mingzheng1 aLiu, Huanzhang0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2021 July, v. 39, no. 4 p.1513-1522dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-020-0224-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013500162300001800297520136500315592002801680650002401708650001101732650001501743650001701758650002101775650001401796650001701810650001901827650000901846650001101855650001301866651001001879651001901889651001601908651001501924700002001939700001601959700001501975773012501990856008102115852000902196655001202205IND60746294520221119123343.0210730e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074629452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-020-0237-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Miao10aHeavy metals in sediments of Yellow Sea and East China Sea: Chemical speciation, distribution, influence factor, and contamination  ap. 1277-1292.  aMetal species and the degree of environmental pollution are related to the hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), an important product of early diagenesis that can react with metals to form stable compounds. To investigate the effects of H₂S to metals and evaluate metal environment effect in the sediments of the East China Sea (ECS) and Yellow Sea (YS), geochemical characteristic and spatial distribution of nine heavy metals and H₂S profile were studied. Higher H₂S content and lower metal content was observed in the sediments 10 cm in depth in the North Yellow Sea and the west coast of South Korea. The pollution load index (Iₚₗ) indicates that the southern coast of Shandong Peninsula underwent moderate pollution (Iₚₗ=1) of heavy metals and no heavy metal pollution appeared in other areas (Iₚₗ<1). To some extents, the ecological risk of Cd and As enrichment was moderately severe in all stations. The chance of heavy metal combination to be toxic in ECS and YS during summer was 21%. In addition, correlation between H₂S content and metals in both solid and porewater phases was obvious, corroborating important effect of H₂S on metal distribution. Moreover, H₂S could affect the spatial distributions of heavy metals in porewater directly and be indicative of potential biological effects of combined toxicant groups in the study region.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical speciation 3acoasts 3adiagenesis 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alimnology 3aoceanography 3apollution load 3arisk 3asummer 3atoxicity 3aChina 3aEast China Sea 3aSouth Korea 3aYellow Sea1 aZhang, Shenghui1 aHan, Haitao1 aPan, Dawei0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2021 July, v. 39, no. 4 p.1277-1292dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-020-0237-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245019200167500001900359520200800378592002802386650001202414650002002426650001902446650002802465650001302493650001202506650001602518650001502534650001602549650001602565650001102581650001402592650001002606651001002616653002302626653001102649653002302660653000702683653000802690653000802698653000802706653000802714653000802722653000702730653000802737653000802745653000802753653001202761653000802773653001002781700001602791700001302807700001702820700001702837700001402854700001602868700001702884700001702901700001902918700001602937773010702953856008503060852000903145655001203154IND60698555620221120133905.0200809e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069855562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1149682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiang10aInteractions of arsenic metabolism with arsenic exposure and individual factors on diabetes occurrence: Baseline findings from Arsenic and Non-Communicable disease cohort (AsNCD) in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe interaction between arsenic metabolism and potential modifiers on the risk of diabetes is unclear. This research aimed to investigate arsenic metabolism and diabetes prevalence and to identify the interactive effects of arsenic metabolism with some risk factors on diabetes in a Chinese population. A baseline cross-sectional survey was performed in two areas with groundwater arsenic contamination in China. Arsenic levels in water and arsenic metabolites in urine were analyzed. The proportions of each arsenic metabolite (inorganic arsenic [iAs%], monomethylarsonic acid [MMA%], and dimethylarsinic acid [DMA%]) were computed to evaluate arsenic metabolism. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association between arsenic and diabetes. Interaction on the additive scale between arsenic methylation index and effect modifier was evaluated by calculating the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Compared with participants in the lower tertile of MMA%, participants in the middle and upper tertiles of MMA% were less prone to diabetes (OR: 0.47 and 0.31, respectively). However, participants in the upper tertiles of urinary DMA% (OR: 3.18) were more likely to have diabetes than those participants in the lower tertiles. The stratified analyses revealed that a one-unit increase in DMA% was associated with higher odds of diabetes in females (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.11), older people (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.10), and subjects with body mass index (BMI) under 25 kg/m² (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.14). The additive interactions between DMA% and female gender (RERI: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.01, 11.88), DMA% and age (RERI: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01, 8.85), as well as DMA% and BMI (RERI: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.01, 9.62), were statistically significant. In conclusion, efficient arsenic metabolism is associated with higher odds of diabetes. Urinary DMA% and individual factors interact to synergistically influence diabetes occurrence in the Chinese population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abody mass index 3acacodylic acid 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes 3afemales 3agroundwater 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethylation 3apeople 3apollution 3aurine 3aChina 0aArsenic metabolism 0agender 0aSynergistic effect 0aAs 0awAs 0aiAs 0aMMA 0aDMA 0atAs 0aCr 0aFPG 0aBMI 0aORs 0a95% CIs 0aWHO 0aATSDR1 aHou, Yaxing1 aWang, Da1 aXu, Yuanyuan1 aWang, Huihui1 aLiu, Juan1 aXia, Liting1 aLi, Yongfang1 aTang, Naijun1 aZheng, Quanmei1 aSun, Guifan0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Oct., v. 265 p.114968-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1149683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245014000199500001900339500002000358520206200378592002802440596010102468596005002569650001202619650002202631650001202653650001802665650001502683650001302698650001502711650000902726650001502735700002402750773012902774856007302903852000902976655001202985IND60729536720221118183132.0210228e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072953672DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.128462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergès, Laurent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0408-790010aHistorical ecology and ancient forests: Progress, conservation issues and scientific prospects, with some examples from the French case  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aForest area has dramatically increased since the beginning or middle of the 19th century in European countries. At least half of the forests present today have grown on formerly cultivated lands, pastures or heathlands. However, net forest expansion largely masks a slow but irretrievable erosion of ancient forests. Meanwhile, forest resource harvesting (biomass, litter) has fundamentally changed during the last two centuries, moving from intensive biomass removal to increased growing stocks in different European countries. This article reviews the current knowledge on the long‐term legacies of past land use and forest management practices and their effects on the functions, diversity and composition of understory vegetation of current forest ecosystems. First, we define the concepts of forest continuity and ancient forest. Then, based on the French case, we present the advances in historical sources, which make it possible to better reconstruct the change in land use and forest management practices over the last two hundred years. We review how understory plant communities and their traits respond to forest continuity and to different types of former agricultural uses, both at local and landscape scales. We then address three important issues for conservation and management: the conservation value of ancient forests, the impact of forest management on the ecological integrity of ancient forests, and the under‐explored legacies of former forest management practices on soil and understory vegetation. Lastly, we propose five main fronts for future research efforts: (a) explore all types of cartographic, written sources and environmental markers; (b) develop modelling approaches to understand how past land use shapes plant communities; (c) better define the conservation value of ancient forests in conservation and management policies; (d) investigate how drivers of global change interact with forest management and land use legacies and (e) explore land use legacies in mountain and Mediterranean socio‐ecological systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cInstitut National de Recherche en Sciences et Technologies pour l'Environnement et l'Agriculture  cInstitut National de la Recherche Agronomique 3abiomass 3aforest management 3aforests 3aglobal change 3aheathlands 3aland use 3alandscapes 3asoil 3aunderstory1 aDupouey, Jean‐Luc0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2021 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.e12846-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.128463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245013200213300001800345506007600363520130900439592002801748506003701776650001901813650001201832650002801844650001501872650001801887650001301905650002001918650002101938650001501959650003701974650001202011650002802023650001502051650001802066650001402084650001202098650001402110650003302124700002602157700003102183700001902214700002302233700003002256700002502286700001702311773010502328856008202433852000902515655001202524IND60091494020221207052435.0141103e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009149402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.01.0262doi7 aPMC30659492pmcid7 a213341882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoorahong, Sujittra10aDevelopment of amperometric α-ketoglutarate biosensor based on ruthenium–rhodium modified carbon fiber enzyme microelectrode  ap. 3670-3673.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA rapid and highly sensitive miniaturized amperometric biosensor for the detection of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) based on a carbon fiber electrode (CFE) is presented. The biosensor is constructed by immobilizing the enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD) on the surface of single carbon fiber modified by co-deposition of ruthenium (Ru) and rhodium (Rh) nanoparticles. SEM and EDX shed useful insights into the morphology and composition of the modified microelectrode. The mixed Ru/Rh coating offers a greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the detection of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), with a substantial decrease in overpotential of ∼400mV compared to the unmodified CFE. It also imparts higher stability with minimal surface fouling, common to NADH oxidation. Further modification with the enzyme, GLUD leads to effective amperometric biosensing of α-KG through monitoring of the NADH consumption. A very rapid response to dynamic changes in the α-KG concentrations is observed with a response time of 6s. The current response is linear between 100 and 600μM with a sensitivity of 42μAM⁻¹ and a detection limit of 20μM. This proof of concept study indicates that the GLUD-Ru/Rh-CFE biosensor holds great promise for real-time electrochemical measurements of α-KG.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aadenine 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3abiosensors 3acarbon fibers 3acoatings 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afouling 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3arhodium 3aruthenium 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aSanthosh, Padmanabhan1 aRamírez, Gabriela Valdés1 aTseng, Ta-Feng1 aWong, Joseph Isaac1 aKanatharana, Proespichaya1 aThavarungkul, Panote1 aWang, Joseph0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 26, no. 8 p.3670-3673dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01528naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245003600157300001400193500002000207520060900227592002800836650002700864650002100891650002300912650002000935650001500955650001200970650001100982773014100993856007101134852000901205655001201214IND60680343420221119135416.0200105e198802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068034342DNAL7 a10.2307/12419732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, V.

The models are distinguished by their treatment of selection effects that arise with on‐site surveys. The comparison considers adjusting for selection effects in a variety of ways, including single and double selection rule models. Both parameter and consumer surplus estimates were evaluated. The findings indicate that the treatment of selection effects alone was not important for this case. However, the choice of an estimator did lead to large variations in per trip consumer surplus estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aconsumer surplus 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic demand 3arecreation 3asurveys 3atravel0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1988 Feb., v. 70, no. 1 p.29-36dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12419733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245007700163300001400240520167200254592002801926650002701954650002101981650002602002650000902028650003102037650001702068650002302085650001402108650001902122650001002141650001402151650001702165650001302182650001402195700001902209700001802228700001602246700002002262773012502282856007702407852000902484655001202493IND60792021720221120104321.0220904e20110208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079202172DNAL7 a10.17221/1572-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabinaitiene, A.10aMycoplasma bovis and bacterial pathogens in the bovine respiratory tract  ap. 29-35.  aBovine respiratory disease caused by Mycoplasma bovis is a major health problem of cattle worldwide. It inflicts considerable financial losses on beef herds and is the most common cause of mortality in dairy cattle. Bacteriological examination of 35 nasal cavity samples from calves younger than three months of age identified Mycoplasma bovis in eight (22.9%) samples. These cattle were followed until 17 months of age, and repeated examination of nasal cavity samples before necropsy identified Mycoplasma bovis in four (11.4%) samples. At necropsy and lung samples for bacteriological and histological examination were collected. To identify microorganisms from the Mollicutes class isolated from the nasal cavities of cattle we used the PCR method. Furthermore, Mycoplasma bovis was identified on the grounds of biochemical characteristics and by the disk growth inhibition test. The organism was found in 5.7% of calves younger than three months of age in combination with Pasteurella spp. Mycoplasma bovis in combination with Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica was isolated from 5.7% and 2.9% of cattle at 17 months. However, Pasteurella multocida was common in cattle at 17 months and Mannheimia haemolytica was isolated from both age groups of cattle. Histopathological examination of lung samples revealed broncho-interstitial pneumonia in 14.3% of samples. Mycoplasma bovis was isolated from 60.0% of broncho-insterstitial pneumonia cases. The organism was isolated more frequently from the group of calves rather than from the cattle group (P &lt; 0.05). The most common bacterial agents were Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMannheimia haemolytica 3aMycoplasma bovis 3aPasteurella multocida 3abeef 3abovine respiratory disease 3adairy cattle 3agrowth retardation 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3alungs 3amortality 3anasal cavity 3anecropsy 3apneumonia1 aSiugzdaite, J.1 aZilinskas, H.1 aSiugzda, R.1 aPetkevicius, S.0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 56, no. 1 p.29-35dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/1572-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245005100171520183600222592002802058650001302086650001302099650001402112650001502126650000902141650002602150650002002176653001002196653002102206653000902227653001202236653003002248653002402278700002402302700002302326700002202349700001902371700001902390700002202409700002302431773010602454856008402560852000902644655001202653IND60698643320221122051817.0200907e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069864332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2020.1038762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeeg, Cornelia A.10aCD11d is a novel antigen on chicken leukocytes  aIn life sciences, antibodies are among the most commonly used tools for identifying, tracking, quantifying and isolating molecules, mainly proteins. However, it has recently become clear that antibodies often fall short with respect to specificity and selectivity and in many cases target proteins are not even known. When commercial availability of antibodies is scarce, e.g. for targeting proteins from farm animals, researchers face additional challenges: they often have to rely on cross-reactive antibodies, which are poorly characterized for their exact target, their actual cross-reactivity and the desired application.In this study, we aimed at identifying the true target of mouse monoclonal antibody 8F2, which was generated against chicken PBMC and used for decades in research, while it's actual target molecule remained unknown. We used 8F2 antibody for immunoprecipitation in chicken PBMC and subsequently identified its true target as CD11d, which was never described in chicken lymphocytes before, by quantitative LC-MSMS. The most abundant interactor of CD11d was identified as integrin beta 2.The existence of this alpha integrin was therefore clearly proven on protein level and provides a first basis to further assess the role of CD11d in chickens in future studies.Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD017248.Our studies determined CD11d as the true target of a previously uncharacterized mouse monoclonal antibody 8F2, generated against chicken peripheral blood derived mononuclear cells (PBMC). This is therefore now first member of alpha integrins in chickens, that existence was now clearly identified on protein level. The additional identification of CD11d interactors provides information on integrin-dependent regulation of signaling networks, allowing further functional studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3achickens 3aintegrins 3aleukocytes 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aprotein content 0aCD11d 0aIntegrin alpha D 0aCD18 0aChicken 0aIdentifying target of mAb 0aImmunoprecipitation1 aDegroote, Roxane L.1 aGiese, Isabella M.1 aHirmer, Sieglinde1 aAmann, Barbara1 aWeigand, Maria1 aWiedemann, Carmen1 aHauck, Stefanie M.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 225 p.103876-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.1038763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009200168500001900260520099100279592002801270650003001298650001001328650001601338650001801354650001801372650001801390650001401408650001301422650001401435650001201449653001201461653000901473653001601482653002501498653001401523700001401537700001801551700001501569700001801584773009801602856008701700852000901787655001201796IND60727568820221122080723.0210312e20210402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072756882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1983202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Yinjie10aBiological characteristic and cytokines response of passages duck plague virus in ducks  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo better understand the pathogenicity of duck plague virus (DPV). The DPV Chinese standard challenge strain (DPV CSC) was continuously passaged 20 times in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs). DPV F1 was lethal for 2-week-ducks, but DPV F10 and F20 were not lethal for 2-week ducks, the 528 bp in UL2 region of DPV F1-F20 was deleted, which suggested that the deletion in UL2 region was not related with the virulence of DPV. Compared with DPV F20 infected ducks, IL-8 in DPV F1 infected ducks was significantly upregulated, but IL-1, IL-2,IFNγ and MHC-II were significantly downregulated. ISKNV copies in DPV F10 and F20 infected ducks were lower than the DPV F1 infected ducks. These results showed that massive viruses replication, upregulation of IL-8 expresssion, repression of IL-1, IL-2, IFNγ and MHC-II expression resulted in serious lesions and high mortality. This study provided a in-depth understanding of the immune-related genes expression in the different virulence of DPV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnatid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aducks 3afibroblasts 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-8 3amortality 3aresearch 3avirulence 3aviruses 0aDPV CSC 0aDuck 0aAttenuation 0aImmune-related genes 0aPassaging1 aSu, Shibo1 aChen, Xiaohan1 aZhao, Lili1 aChen, Hongyan0 tVirus research.g2021 Apr. 02, v. 295 p.198320-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1983203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015900163300001800322500002000340520111000360592002801470596005901498596005901557596008301616650001501699650001501714650002601729650001501755650001501770650001901785650002701804650004301831650002101874650001201895650001401907650000701921650002701928650001301955650001701968650002901985650000902014700002002023700001302043700001602056700001602072700005502088773013302143856007802276852000902354655001202363IND60637185320221119105936.0190416e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063718532DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2018011692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guangyang10aFacile synthesis of magnetic zinc metal‐organic framework for extraction of nitrogen‐containing heterocyclic fungicides from lettuce vegetable samples  ap. 1451-1458.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe present a simple method for the fabrication of a magnetic amino‐functionalized zinc metal‐organic framework based on a magnetic graphene oxide composite. The resultant framework exhibited a porous 3D structure, high surface area and good adsorption properties for nitrogen‐containing heterocyclic fungicides. The adsorption process and capacity indicated that the primary adsorption mechanism might be hydrogen bonding and π‐π conjugation. In addition, an optimized protocol for magnetic solid phase extraction was developed (such as adsorbent content, pH, and desorption solvent), and utilized for the extraction of nitrogen‐containing heterocyclic fungicides from vegetable samples. Quantitation by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry offered a detection limit of 0.21–1.0 μg/L (S/N = 3) with correlation coefficients larger than 0.9975.

However, the distribution of hazardous elements, including N/S/Cl and heavy metals, in pyrolytic products possibly causes secondary pollution. This study conducted a systematic research on hazardous elements flow during OS pyrolysis under variant temperature. Results showed that N/S/Cl in OS were distributed 44.77–15.51 wt%, 83.29–80.22 wt%, and 78.59–73.41 wt% into the solid residues after pyrolysis, respectively. Elevating pyrolysis temperature facilitated more N/S/Cl flowing into pyrolytic oil and gas. The macromolecular N-/S-/Cl-containing compounds, including amides, amines, nitriles, sulfonates, chloroalkanes, etc., were widely distributed in pyrolytic oil and gas products. The micromolecular N-/S-/Cl-containing pollutants released between 200 and 400 °C included HCN, NH₃, NOₓ, H₂S, CH₄S, CS₂, SO₂, and HCl, which originated from the decomposition of the amine N, organic sulfide and sulfone-S, and inorganic Cl, respectively. The main pollutants released at above 400 °C included NH₃, HCN, NOₓ, CS₂, and SO₂, which were derived from the decomposition of heterocyclic N and inorganic pyritic-S and sulfate-S. Moreover, the solid residues intercepted more than 60.0 wt% of total heavy metals, which should be concerned in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3aenergy recovery 3ahazardous waste 3aheterocyclic compounds 3anitriles 3aoils 3apollution 3apyrolysis 3asludge 3asulfonates 3atemperature 0aOily sludge 0aHazardous elements flow 0aN-/S-/Cl-containing pollutants 0aHeavy metals1 aLin, Fawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5461-82771 aXiang, Li1 aZheng, Fa1 aChe, Lei1 aTian, Wangyang1 aGuo, Xiang1 aYan, Beibei1 aSong, Yingjin1 aChen, Guanyi0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.124986-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1249863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245015500155300001800310500001900328500002000347520174900367592002802116596007202144596005902216596005902275596006702334596010702401650001302508650001702521650002502538650001002563650001502573650002102588650001502609650000902624650001702633650001902650650002402669650001102693650002802704700005702732700001802789700001602807700001702823700002302840700001702863773013602880856007203016852000903088655001203097IND60733798420221118112036.0210412e20210430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073379842DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.39182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jingmei10aEffects of residue mulching amounts on metabolic footprints based on production and respiration of soil nematodes in a long‐term no‐tillage system  ap. 2383-2392.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResidue mulching has been adopted to improve soil organic carbon and to prevent soil erosion and degradation, which in turn promote the sustainable development of soil ecosystems. Nematode metabolic footprints provide information about the responses of nematodes to resources and also help in quantifying the contributions of nematodes to ecosystem functions and services. However, how production and respiration components of nematode metabolic footprints vary in different mulching amounts is less clear. Therefore, to explore the impact of different mulching amounts on the production and respiration of nematode trophic groups, soil samples were collected from four mulching treatments (without mulching, with 33%, 67%, and 100% mulching of the stover remaining at harvest) at the depths of 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm in a 12‐year long no‐tillage system. Our results proved that the mulching effect on the production and respiration of fungivores was significant, and the production was 71.8%, 62.7%, 71.5% higher and respiration was 67.7%, 61.9%, 70% higher in 100% mulching treatment than without mulching, 33% and 67% mulching, respectively. More basal C flowed into the fungal decomposition pathways and fungivores contributed more to soil carbon sequestration through the decomposition of recalcitrant nutrients from residue at the end of crop growth. There was higher production than respiration in bacterivores and an opposite trend was observed in fungivores. Residue mulching increased the metabolic footprints of nematode communities and carbon use efficiency of fungivores and omnivores and predators and then enhanced the potential of soil carbon sequestration through the metabolic process of different nematode trophic groups.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0300204cNational Key Research and Development Plan of China  a41977054cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41771280cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0200602cthe National Key research and Development Plan  a2018FY100304cthe National Science and Technology Fundamental Resources Investigation Program of China 3aNematoda 3abacterivores 3acarbon sequestration 3afungi 3afungivores 3aland degradation 3ano-tillage 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asoil nematodes 3asoil organic carbon 3astover 3asustainable development1 aZhang, Xiaoke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5277-23151 aKou, Xinchang1 aXie, Hongtu1 aBao, Xuelian1 aMahamood, Mohammad1 aLiang, Wenju0 tLand degradation & development.g2021 Apr. 30, v. 32, no. 7 p.2383-2392dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.39183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245010600173300001600279500001500295520170600310592002802016650002802044650001102072650001102083650001002094650001702104650002502121650002302146650001402169650002102183650001502204650001802219650001702237650002002254650001702274650001502291653002402306700003102330700003202361700002402393700002202417700003402439773012502473856005502598852000902653655001202662IND4473481320221122161456.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447348132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2011.01181.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshton, Mark S.,13aTheeffect of shade on leaf structure and physiology of tree seedlings from a mixed dipterocarp forest  ap. 332-343.  a2019-12-06  aThis study builds upon past work investigating seedling leaf physiology and structure among tropical trees. We seek to explain how related and unrelated species and genera coâoccur in relation to varying amounts of shade. Seedlings of eight Sri Lankan rain forest tree species in three genera (Dipterocarpus, Mesua, Shorea section Doona) were grown for 2 years in four treatments that simulated a variety of shade environments across the understorey of a rain forest. All three genera comprise major canopy tree species of mixed dipterocarp forest, a widespread and important Asian tropical forest type. Compared with the other genera, Dipterocarpus spp. had the largest leaves, the thinnest leaf blades and relatively high rates of stomatal conductivity across all shade treatments, making them waterâloving species sensitive to droughty soils. Mesua spp. had intermediate sized leaves, with the thickest leaf blades and palisade mesophyll layers, the highest stomatal densities, the smallest aperture sizes and the lowest rates of stomatal conductance, making them the most water conservative. Shorea spp. were generally intermediate in blade and palisade mesophyll dimensions between Dipterocarpus spp. and Mesua spp., but they had the smallest leaves. Greater differences among genera than among species within genera were apparent, but species differences within genera were also apparent. Differences among genera and species conform to their known successional status and topographical affinities and provide a more comprehensive understanding of species site adaptation.âÂ© 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 167, 332â343.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3aShorea 3acanopy 3aMesua 3aforest trees 3astomatal conductance 3awater conservation 3aseedlings 3atropical forests 3aleaf blade 3aDipterocarpus 3arain forests 3atree physiology 3aforest types 3aunderstory 0aspecies differences1 aGUNATILLEKE, C.

This study explores the synergistic impact of Chlorella sorokiniana on biomass generation and wastewater remediation in high rate algae pond (HRAP). Biomass produced was applied for hydrothermal carbonization-co-liquefaction (HTCL). The structural and morphological characteristics of HTCL products (i.e. bio-chars and bio-oils) have been systematically studied by XRD, Raman, FTIR, elemental analyzer, SEM, BET, and ¹H NMR spectroscopy. The crystallite size of the graphite 2H indexing planes was to be 4.65 nm and 14.07 nm in the bio-chars of oiled biomass (MB-OB) and de-oiled biomass (MB-DOB), respectively. The increase in the ID/IG ratio of MB-DOB indicated the highly disordered graphitic structure due to the appearance of carbonyl, hydroxyl, and epoxy functionalities in the line of high C/N and low C/H ratio. Also, the multiple heavy metals remediation of MB-DOB revealed better efficiency as ~100% in 720 min. The kinetics analysis shows the correlation coefficient of pseudo-second-order is well fitted compared to the pseudo-first-order. The Langmuir adsorption model signifies the adsorption of heavy metal ions in a monolayer adsorption manner. The study proposes the microalgae bio-char potential for multiple heavy metals remediation alongside bio-oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella sorokiniana 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acrystallites 3aepoxides 3agraphene 3aheavy metals 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aremediation 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 0aMicroalgae oiled and de-oiled biomass 0aHRAP 0aHydrothermal carbonization-co-liquefaction (HTCL) 0aBio-char and bio-oil 0aMultiple heavy metals remediation1 aKumar, Vinod1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1808-19801 aVerma, Ravikant1 aVerma, Monu1 aKumar, Arvind1 aVlaskin, Mikhail S.1 aNanda, Manisha1 aKim, Hyunook0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.124987-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1249873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245008800168300002000256520156200276592002801838650001601866650002201882650003701904650001501941650001201956650001401968650002801982650000902010650001302019650000902032650001602041650001102057650001802068650001102086650001402097650003702111650001102148653002102159653001002180653001402190653002102204653001502225653002002240700001502260700001902275773012702294856008002421852000902501655001202510IND60550880920221118021821.0161011e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055088092DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b035832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkateswarlu, Sada10aBioinspired 2D-Carbon Flakes and Fe3O4 Nanoparticles Composite for Arsenite Removal  ap. 23876-23885.  aDevelopment of carbon-based materials has received tremendous attention owing to their multifunctional properties. Biomaterials often serve as an inspiration for the preparation of new carbon materials. Herein, we present a facile synthesis of a new bioinspired graphene oxide-like 2D-carbon flake (CF) using a natural resource, waste onion sheathing (Allium cepa). The 2D-CF was further decorated with crystalline Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles for applications. Superparamagnetic Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles (7 nm) were well-dispersed on the surface of the 2D-CF, which was characterized by X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Batch As(III) adsorption experiments showed that aqueous arsenic ions strongly adsorbed to the Fe₃O₄@2D-CF composite. The adsorption capacity of the Fe₃O₄@2D-CF composite for As(III) was 57.47 mg g–¹. The synergetic effect of both graphene oxide-like 2D-CF and Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles aided in excellent As(III) adsorption. An As(III) ion adsorption kinetics study showed that adsorption was very fast at the initial stage, and equilibrium was reached within 60 min following a pseudo-second-order rate model. Owing to the excellent superparamagnetic properties (52.6 emu g–¹), the Fe₃O₄@2D-CF composite exhibited superb reusability with the shortest recovery time (28 s) among reported materials. This study indicated that Fe₃O₄@2D-CF composites can be used for practical applications as a global economic material for future generations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abiocompatible materials 3aemus 3agraphene 3aions 3airon oxides 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aonions 3asynergism 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastes 0a2D carbon flakes 0aFe3O4 0acomposite 0aarsenite removal 0aadsorption 0awater treatment1 aLee, Daeho1 aYoon, Minyoung0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Sept. 14, v. 8, no. 36 p.23876-23885dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b035833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002600174245014300200300001800343520115200361592002801513650002301541650001701564650001401581650001501595650001101610650001501621650001601636650001101652650000901663650000901672650005501681650002801736650001101764650004101775651001201816651001201828653002301840653002701863653001901890653002401909700002001933700002101953700001901974700001801993773007802011856008902089852000902178655001202187IND60112241620221122061033.0160901e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011224162DNAL7 a238999252pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMăicăneanu, Andrada10aHaneş and Valea Vinului (Romania) closed mines Acid Mine Drainages (AMDs) – Actual condition and passive treatment remediation proposal  ap. 1400-1405.  aAcid Mine Drainages (AMDs) from Haneş and Valea Vinului (Romania) closed mines were considered for characterization and treatment using a local zeolitic volcanic tuff, ZVT, (Măcicaş, Cluj County, Romania). Water samples were collected from two locations, before and after discharging point in case of Haneş mine, and on three horizons in case of Valea Vinului mine. Physico-chemical (pH, total solid, heavy metal ions concentration) analyses showed that the environment is strongly affected by these AMD discharges even if the mines were closed years ago. Iron, manganese and zinc were the main pollutants identified in Haneş mine AMD, while zinc is the one mainly present in case of Valea Vinului AMD. A batch technique (no stirring) in which the ZVT was put in contact with the AMD sample was proposed as a passive remediation technique. ZVT successfully remove heavy metal ion from AMD. According to heavy metal ion concentrations, removal efficiencies are reaching 100%, varying as follows, Fe2+>Zn2+>Mn2+. When the ZVT was compared with two cationic resins (strong, SAR and weak acid, WAR) the following series was depicted, SAR>ZVT>WAR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aheavy metals 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3amixing 3apollutants 3aremediation 3aresins 3atuff 3azinc 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxmethods 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aMining 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aRomania 0aRomania 0aAcid mine drainage 0aZeolites volcanic tuff 0aClinoptilolite 0aHeavy metal removal1 aBedelean, Horea1 aArdelean, Marius1 aBurcă, Silvia1 aStanca, Maria0 tChemosphere.g2013 Oct., v. 93 p.1400-1405dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245006600176300001400242520099700256592002801253650001901281650002001300650001401320650003301334650002101367650001801388650002901406650001601435700002201451700006201473700002701535700003701562700002001599700005501619700005701674700007801731773012501809856008501934852000902019655001202028IND60698643720221122051728.0210619e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069864372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2020.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorich, Christopher D10aImproving N2O emission estimates with the global N2O database  ap. 13-20.  aClimate change will have dire consequences and collaborative efforts are required to quickly develop and assess mitigation solutions. Agriculture is the primary source of the powerful greenhouse gas (GHG) nitrous oxide (N₂O) and an important source of GHG emissions. Due to sampling limitations, N₂O measurements have traditionally been sparse; approximately 75% of sites we reviewed sampled for fewer than 50 days within a year. Nitrous oxide emissions are highly variable and short-lived peak emission periods may contribute more than 50% to annual emissions. Gap filling around these peaks, if measured at all, can result in poor estimations under the standard practice using area under the curve. Improved gap filling methods that reflect covariate data will likely reduce uncertainty and improve annual N₂O estimates. The Global N₂O Database was created to serve as a repository for these datasets as well as become a resource for publicly available data and analytical advances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenvironmental sustainability 3agreenhouse gases 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3auncertainty1 aConant, Richard T1 aAlbanito, Fabrizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2655-59821 aButterbach-Bahl, Klaus1 aGrace, J.

Convergence rates of the estimated factor space and loading space and asymptotic normality of the estimated factors and loadings are established under mild conditions that allow for linear, Logit, Probit, Tobit, Poisson and some other single-index nonlinear models. The probability density/mass function is allowed to vary across subjects and time, thus mixed models are also allowed for. For factor-augmented regressions, this paper establishes the limit distributions of the parameter estimates, the conditional mean, and the forecast when factors estimated from nonlinear/mixed data are used as proxies for the true factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometrics 3aestimation 3amass 3anonlinear models 3apaper 3aprobability distribution 3astatistical models 0aC13 0aC35 0aFactor model 0aMixed measurement 0aMaximum likelihood 0aHigh dimension 0aFactor-augmented regression 0aForecasting0 tJournal of econometrics.g2022 July, v. 229, no. 1 p.180-200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245006500183300001600248520161300264592002801877650000801905650001601913650002301929650001901952650001101971650002401982650001002006650002002016650003002036650001802066650001202084650002402096650001102120650004602131650002602177650003002203650001602233650004502249650002602294650003902320650002902359650003402388650005102422650004302473650003302516651000902549651000902558700002602567700001902593700002102612773009702633856004802730852000902778655001202787IND4469601220221122161416.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446960122DNAL7 a217554082pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2517-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhaemi, Peyman10aDetection of Theileria orientalis in Iran by semi-nested PCR  ap. 527-531.  aIn order to identify and differentiate Theileria orientalis in cattle which may be infected with Theileria annulata simultaneously, a semi-nested PCR was performed. Thus, 160 blood samples were collected from apparently healthy native cattle in Golestan province of northern Iran, during 2009 to 2011. The Tbs-S/Tbs-A primer set derived from the 18S rRNA encoding gene was used for first PCR amplification, and the amplified sequence weight by this primer set for Theileria sp. was 426–430 bp. Then, DNA solution from purified PCR product was used for the semi-nested PCR analysis. The first PCR product amplified using T. orientalis primer set (To-S/Tbs-A) derived from the 18SrRNA encoding gene, and this specific primer weight was 235 bp. Also, the first PCR product amplified using T. annulata primer set (Ta-S/Tbs-A) derived from the 18SrRNA encoding gene and this specific primer weight was 193 bp. Having extracted DNA of each sample, using Tbs-S/Tbs-A primer set for PCR and analyzing the PCR products on the 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, 13 out of 160 blood samples (8.12%) were positive for Theileria sp. Meanwhile, performing semi-nested PCR with T. orientalis-specific primers, 9 out of 13 blood samples (5.62%) were positive and performing semi-nested PCR with T. annulata-specific primers, 12 out of 13 blood samples (7.5%) were also positive. This molecular assay approves the presence of T. orientalis in the native cattle of northern parts of Iran for the first time. In addition, this procedure will detect the concurrent infection of T. orientalis and T. annulata in the cattle too.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aTheileria annulata 3ablood sampling 3acattle 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3amixed infection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 2aAnimals 2aBloodxparasitology 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxparasitology. 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Agar Gel 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMolecular Diagnostic Techniquesxmethods 2aParasitologyxmethods 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aTheileriaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aTheileriasisxdiagnosisxparasitology. 2aVeterinary Medicinexmethods 3aIran 0aIran1 aHoghooghi-Rad, Nasser1 aShayan, Parviz1 aEckert, Brigitte0 tParasitology research.g2012 Feb., v. 110, no. 2 p.527-531dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2517-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245008800196500001100284520107300295592002801368596003401396650002001430650001001450650000901460650001701469650001701486650002301503650002301526650002001549650001401569650001901583650001701602650002201619650001501641650002001656650001001676700001701686700005801703700002301761700002901784700005601813773012201869856007401991852000902065655001202074IND60637185720221119105933.0190416e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063718572DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.126152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagge, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8938-668010aReconciling pest control, nature conservation, and recreation in coniferous forests  aLETTER  aProtected areas are not only crucial for biodiversity and natural processes but also for recreation. Although a benign neglect strategy of dealing with natural disturbances in protected areas is beneficial for nature, public debate on avoiding increased pest population growth has intensified. We evaluated the effect of mechanical pest control measures in decreasing populations of insect pests, maintaining nontarget biodiversity, retaining high recreational value, and keeping economic costs low. Debarking and bark scratching or gouging effectively prevented infestation of felled trees by European spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus) and controlled the beetles in recently infested trees. Bark scratching or gouging retained biodiversity at natural levels, whereas debarking decreased biodiversity by 54% with higher economic costs. The public rated bark‐gouged trees more positively than debarked trees. We thus urge authorities to promote bark scratching or gouging in the control of bark beetles in protected areas instead of salvage logging and debarking.  aPublisher supplied data  cBavarian Forest National Park 3aIps typographus 3aPicea 3abark 3abark beetles 3abiodiversity 3aconiferous forests 3aconservation areas 3acontrol methods 3adebarking 3aeconomic costs 3apest control 3apopulation growth 3arecreation 3asalvage logging 3atrees1 aLeibl, Franz1 aMüller, Jörg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1409-15861 aPlechinger, Martin1 aSoutinho, João Gonçalo1 aThorn, Simon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3062-30600 tConservation letters.g2019 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.e12615-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.126153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245008200178300001800260520104600278592002801324650002701352650001301379650001201392650001301404650002701417650002201444650001501466650001701481650001101498650001101509650001701520650003401537650002701571650001701598650002901615650001301644700001801657700001701675773012801692856004801820852000901868655001201877IND4479737520221122161404.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447973752DNAL7 a211041042pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-010-0901-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchal, V.10aEffect of calcifying bacteria on permeation properties of concrete structures  ap. 1229-1234.  aMicrobially enhanced calcite precipitation on concrete or mortar has become an important area of research regarding construction materials. This study examined the effect of calcite precipitation induced by Sporosarcina pasteurii (Bp M-3) on parameters affecting the durability of concrete or mortar. An inexpensive industrial waste, corn steep liquor (CSL), from starch industry was used as nutrient source for the growth of bacteria and calcite production, and the results obtained with CSL were compared with those of the standard commercial medium. Bacterial deposition of a layer of calcite on the surface of the specimens resulted in substantial decrease of water uptake, permeability, and chloride penetration compared with control specimens without bacteria. The results obtained with CSL medium were comparable to those obtained with standard medium, indicating the economization of the biocalcification process. The results suggest that calcifying bacteria play an important role in enhancing the durability of concrete structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSporosarcina pasteurii 3abacteria 3acalcite 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3acorn steep liquor 3adurability 3apermeability 3astarch 3awastes 3awater uptake 2aCalcium Carbonatexmetabolism 2aConstruction Materials 2aPermeability 2aSporosarcinaxmetabolism 2aZea mays1 aMukherjee, A.1 aReddy, M.

Equations which explain the relative allocation of calories within households were estimated for husbands, wives, and children with data for the rural Philippines. The estimating equation is derivable from both a joint household utility function and a bargaining model. Because the same households were included in the four survey rounds, the various observations for a given individual were averaged for each variable in the estimation procedure. Wages were estimated using the Heckman approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3achildren 3adeveloping countries 3aequations 3ahouseholds 3amodels 3aopportunity costs 3asurveys 3autility functions 3aPhilippines1 aGarcia, Marito1 aJacinto, Elizabeth0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1988 Feb., v. 70, no. 1 p.170-180dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12419873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245009800163300001400261520139900275592002801674650001601702650002201718650001701740650001701757650001101774650002401785650001901809650001901828650001701847650001601864653002801880653002701908653003901935653003001974653001902004700001802023700001602041700002602057773010602083856008402189852000902273655001202282IND60525420820221118063427.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052542082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2015.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yong12aA comprehensive support vector machine-based classification model for soil quality assessment  ap. 19-26.  aSoil quality is defined here as the capacity of soil to have biological function, to sustain plant and animal production, to maintain or enhance water and air quality and to support human health and habitation. There are different soil quality assessment models based on diverse methods and data, but none of the models can fully meet all purposes. The selection of an appropriate soil classification model therefore becomes an important aspect in soil quality assessment. This paper presents a new comprehensive support vector machine-based classification model for classification of urban soil quality and then uses that model to assess the soil quality of Taiyuan relative to Chinese environmental quality standards and regional background values. The results indicated that the support vector machine-based soil quality model combined soil heavy metal contamination and soil fertility data satisfactorily, with an accuracy of 98.3333%. The soil quality of Taiyuan was subsequently divided into five classes (IA, IB, IC, IIA and IIB). Fifty percent of all samples were classified as class IB, indicating that soil quality within the study area was good. This paper shows that a comprehensive support vector machine-based classification model is feasible and reliable for soil quality assessment. Furthermore, the assessment presented could provide references for related ecological problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aanimal production 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3amodels 3asoil classification 3asoil fertility 3asoil pollution 3asoil quality 3aurban soils 0aSoil quality assessment 0aSupport vector machine 0aComprehensive classification model 0aHeavy metal contamination 0aSoil fertility1 aWang, Huifeng1 aZhang, Hong1 aLiber, K.q(Karsten),0 tSoil & tillage research.g2016 Jan., v. 155 p.19-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2015.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013000171500001900301520173400320592002802054650002202082650001302104650003402117650002902151650001902180650002602199650001202225650002402237650001402261650001702275650002202292650002102314650001702335650003302352653003102385653001002416653000802426653002602434653002202460653000802482700002202490700001902512773011902531856008502650852000902735655001202744IND60722115320221119015700.0210212e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072211532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.1298322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkawa, Masamichi10aMolecular imaging for mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative disorders  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncreasing evidence from pathological and biochemical investigations suggests that mitochondrial metabolic impairment and oxidative stress play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases, such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, and various neurodegenerative disorders. Recent advances in molecular imaging technology with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have accomplished a direct and non-invasive evaluation of the pathophysiological changes in living patients.In this review, we focus on the latest achievements of molecular imaging for mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.Molecular imaging with PET and MRI exhibited mitochondrial metabolic changes, such as enhanced glucose utilization with lactic acid fermentation, suppressed fatty acid metabolism, decreased TCA-cycle metabolism, impaired respiratory chain activity, and increased oxidative stress, in patients with MELAS syndrome. In addition, PET imaging clearly demonstrated enhanced cerebral oxidative stress in patients with Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The magnitude of oxidative stress correlated well with clinical severity in patients, indicating that oxidative stress based on mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with the neurodegenerative changes in these diseases.Molecular imaging is a promising tool to improve our knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, and this would facilitate the development of potential antioxidants and mitochondrial therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aacidosis 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3aelectron transport chain 3aencephalopathy 3afatty acid metabolism 3aglucose 3alactic fermentation 3amagnetism 3amitochondria 3amuscular diseases 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3apositron-emission tomography 0aNeurodegenerative disorder 0aMELAS 0aMRI 0aMitochondrial disease 0aMolecular imaging 0aPET1 aOkazawa, Hidehiko1 aYoneda, Makoto0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 Mar., v. 1865, no. 3 p.129832-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.1298323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245014700164300002000311520182700331592002802158650001502186650001702201650001102218650000902229650001502238650001802253650002302271650001302294650001802307650001902325650002702344650001302371650002202384653002702406653003402433653001902467653002202486653003402508653001602542700001902558700001902577700001802596773012702614856008002741852000902821655001202830IND60550881220221118021653.0161011e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055088122DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b048182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Joonmyung10aMolecular Dynamics Study on the Photothermal Actuation of a Glassy Photoresponsive Polymer Reinforced with Gold Nanoparticles with Size Effect  ap. 24008-24024.  aWe investigated the optical and thermal actuation behavior of densely cross-linked photoresponsive polymer (PRP) and polymer nanocomposites containing gold nanoparticles (PRP/Au) using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The modeled molecular structures contain a large number of photoreactive mesogens with linear orientation. Flexible side chains are interconnected through covalent bonds under periodic boundary conditions. A switchable dihedral potential was applied on a diazene moiety to describe the photochemical trans-to-cis isomerization. To quantify the photoinduced molecular reorientation and its effect on the macroscopic actuation of the neat PRP and PRP/Au materials, we characterized the photostrain and other material properties including elastic stiffness and thermal stability according to the photoisomerization ratio of the reactive groups. We particularly examined the effect of nanoparticle size on the photothermal actuation by varying the diameter of the nanofiller (10–20 Å) under the same volume fraction of 1.62%. The results indicated that the insertion of the gold nanoparticles enlarges the photostrain of the material while enhancing its mechanical stiffness and thermal stability. When the diameter of the nanoparticle reaches a size similar to or smaller than the length of the mesogen, the interfacial energy between the nanofiller and the surrounding polymer matrix does not significantly affect the alignment of the mesogens, but rather the adsorption energy at the interface generates a stable interphase layer. Hence, these improvements were more effective as the size of the gold nanoparticle decreased. The present findings suggest a wider analysis of the nanofiller-reinforced PRP composites and could be a guide for the mechanical design of the PRP actuator system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acrosslinking 3aenergy 3agold 3ainterphase 3aisomerization 3amolecular dynamics 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aphotochemistry 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymers 3athermal stability 0aphotothermal actuation 0aphotoresponsive polymer (PRP) 0ananocomposites 0agold nanoparticle 0amolecular dynamics simulation 0asize effect1 aChung, Hayoung1 aYun, Jung-Hoon1 aCho, Maenghyo0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Sept. 14, v. 8, no. 36 p.24008-24024dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b048183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245011600159300001800275520146900293592002801762650002601790650001801816650001301834650002301847700001901870700002201889700002401911700002001935700001801955700002401973700001701997700001802014700001902032700002102051773013102072856007802203852000902281655001202290IND60563336920170628000000.0170215e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056333692DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b119342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRöder, Ruth10aMultifunctional Nanoparticles by Coordinative Self-Assembly of His-Tagged Units with Metal–Organic Frameworks  ap. 2359-2368.  aSelf-assembly of individual units into multicomponent complexes is a powerful approach for the generation of functional superstructures. We present the coordinative interaction of oligohistidine-tags (His-tags) with metal–organic framework nanoparticles (MOF NPs). By this novel concept, different molecular units can be anchored on the outer surface of MOF NPs in a self-assembly process generating multifunctional nanosystems. The article focuses on two main objectives: first, the detailed investigation of the assembly process and fundamental establishment of the novel functionalization concept; and second, its subsequent use for the development of biomacromolecule (e.g., peptides and proteins) delivery vehicles. Three exemplary MOF structures, MIL-88A, HKUST-1, and Zr-fum, based on different metal components, were selected for the external binding of various His-tagged synthetic peptides and recombinant or chemically H₆-modified proteins. Evidence for simultaneous assembly of different functional units with Zr-fum MOF NPs as well as their successful transport into living cells illustrate the promising potential of the self-assembly approach for the generation of multifunctional NPs and future biological applications. Taking the high number of possible MOF NPs and different functional units into account, the reported functionalization approach opens great flexibility for the targeted synthesis of multifunctional NPs for specific purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3ananoparticles 3aproteins 3asynthetic peptides1 aPreiß, Tobias1 aHirschle, Patrick1 aSteinborn, Benjamin1 aZimpel, Andreas1 aHöhn, Miriam1 aRädler, Joachim O.1 aBein, Thomas1 aWagner, Ernst1 aWuttke, Stefan1 aLächelt, Ulrich0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 139, no. 6 p.2359-2368dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b119343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04128naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001600181245023000197300001800427506007600445520196500521592002802486506003702514650001702551650004002568650003802608650003602646650002802682650001502710650002102725650000902746650002602755650001402781650002202795650001302817650001202830650003102842650002502873650004102898650004302939650002102982650002103003650004003024650002703064650002603091650002803117650002103145650003303166650005203199650002703251651001103278651001103289700001603300773013403316856004303450852000903493655001203502IND4469226420221207113347.0120419e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446922642DNAL7 a223893642pmid7 aPMC33464702pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.06655-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGironde, S.10aHousekeeping Gene Sequencing and Multilocus Variable-Number Tandem-Repeat Analysis To Identify Subpopulations within Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato That Correlate with Host Specificity  ap. 3266-3279.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola causes bacterial spot on Brassicaceae worldwide, and for the last 10 years severe outbreaks have been reported in the Loire Valley, France. P. syringae pv. maculicola resembles P. syringae pv. tomato in that it is also pathogenic for tomato and causes the same types of symptoms. We used a collection of 106 strains of P. syringae to characterize the relationships between P. syringae pv. maculicola and related pathovars, paying special attention to P. syringae pv. tomato. Phylogenetic analysis of gyrB and rpoD gene sequences showed that P. syringae pv. maculicola, which causes diseases in Brassicaceae, forms six genetic lineages within genomospecies 3 of P. syringae strains as defined by L. Gardan et al. (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 49[Pt 2]:469–478, 1999), whereas P. syringae pv. tomato forms two distinct genetic lineages. A multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) conducted with eight minisatellite loci confirmed the genetic structure obtained with rpoD and gyrB sequence analyses. These results provide promising tools for fine-scale epidemiological studies on diseases caused by P. syringae pv. maculicola and P. syringae pv. tomato. The two pathovars had distinct host ranges; only P. syringae pv. maculicola strains were pathogenic for BRASSICACEAE: A subpopulation of P. syringae pv. maculicola strains that are pathogenic for Pto-expressing tomato plants were shown to lack avrPto1 and avrPtoB or to contain a disrupted avrPtoB homolog. Taking phylogenetic and pathological features into account, our data suggest that the DC3000 strain belongs to P. syringae pv. maculicola. This study shows that P. syringae pv. maculicola and P. syringae pv. tomato appear multiclonal, as they did not diverge from a single common ancestral group within the ancestral P. syringae genomospecies 3, and suggests that pathovar specificity within P. syringae may be due to independent genetic events.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassicaceae 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3aepidemiological studies 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3aloci 3aminisatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3atomatoes 3avalleys 2aBrassicaceaexmicrobiology 2aDNA Gyrasexgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerasesxgenetics 2aGenes, Essential 2aHost Specificity 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmicrobiology. 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMinisatellite Repeats 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Typing 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonas syringaexclassificationxgenetics. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aFrance 0aFrance1 aManceau, C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2012 May 1, v. 78, no. 9 p.3266-3279dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.06655-11  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245011700185300001600302520146500318592002801783650002501811650002701836650002801863650002501891650002801916650001301944650001701957650000901974650002501983650001802008650001502026650002202041650000702063650001802070650001102088650003702099650006202136650006202198650002802260650003902288650001802327650002402345650002302369700001802392700001402410700001402424700002202438700002202460700001502482773014302497852000902640856008202649655001202731IND4426221620221119093740.0200312e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442622162DNAL7 a194887502pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-009-2032-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSintubin, Liesje10aLactic acid bacteria as reducing and capping agent for the fast and efficient production of silver nanoparticles  ap. 741-749.  aThere is a growing demand for silver-based biocides, including both ionic silver forms and metallic nanosilver. The use of metallic nanosilver, typically chemically produced, faces challenges including particle agglomeration, high costs, and upscaling difficulties . Additionally, there exists a need for the development of a more eco-friendly production of nanosilver. In this study, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were utilized in the non-enzymatic production of silver nanoparticles via the interaction of silver ions and organic compounds present on the bacterial cell. Only lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium, and Lactococcus garvieae, were able to reduce silver. The nanoparticles of the five best producing Lactobacillus spp. were examined more into detail with transmission electron microscopy. Particle localization inside the cell, the mean particle size, and size distribution were species dependent, with Lactobacillus fermentum having the smallest mean particle size of 11.2 nm, the most narrow size distribution, and most nanoparticles associated with the outside of the cells. Furthermore, influence of pH on the reduction process was investigated. With increasing pH, silver recovery increased as well as the reduction rate as indicated by UV–VIS analyses. This study demonstrated that Lactobacillus spp. can be used for a rapid and efficient production of silver nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aPediococcus pentosaceus 3abiocides 3abiogeography 3aions 3alactic acid bacteria 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3aparticle size 3asilver 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLactic Acidxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aNanoparticles 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSilverxmetabolism1 aDe Windt, Wim1 aDick, Jan1 aMast, Jan1 avan der Ha, David1 aVerstraete, Willy1 aBoon, Nico0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 84, no. 4 p.741-749dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-2032-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02793naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009700161300001800258520135500276592002801631650001501659650002001674650003801694650002101732650001001753650000901763650001801772650002601790650001301816650001501829650001401844700001901858700001701877700002001894700002101914700001901935700001301954700001801967700001801985700001702003700001702020700001702037700001902054700001802073773010502091856008202196852000902278655001202287IND60091494820221116215922.0141103e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009149482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yu13aAn enhanced ELISA based on modified colloidal gold nanoparticles for the detection of Pb(II)  ap. 3700-3704.  aA novel probe based on colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified with goat anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was synthesized and an enhanced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the probe was developed. In the assay, the synthesized probe is bound with a monoclonal antibody (McAb) which is competitively bound by coated BSA–ITCBE–Pb(II) on plate and Pb(II) in samples. The HRP, used here for signal amplification catalytically oxidize the substrate and generate optical signals that is related to the concentration of Pb(II) and can be measured spectrophotometrically. For the monodisperse AuNPs having high surface areas, it can be conjugated with more amount of HRP than that of IgG. Therefore, compared with traditional ELISA, the signal amplification of catalytically oxidized substrate was enhanced. The detection limit for this novel modified AuNPs probe-based assay was 9pgmL⁻¹. The recoveries obtained by standard Pb(II) addition to real samples, including a commercial mineral water, tap water, and lake water were all from 94.9% to 102.9%. And the coefficient of variation (CV) value of all samples was less than 10%. The results indicated that the enhanced assay gave higher sensitivity and reliable reproducibility. It could provide a general detection format for low-molecular weight contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alakes 3alead 3amineral water 3amonoclonal antibodies 3ananogold 3aperoxidase 3atap water1 aTian, Xiang-Li1 aLi, Yan-Song1 aPan, Feng-Guang1 aZhang, Yuan-Yuan1 aZhang, Jun-Hui1 aYang, Li1 aWang, Xin-Rui1 aRen, Hong-Lin1 aLu, Shi-Ying1 aLi, Zhao-Hui1 aChen, Qi-Jun1 aLiu, Zeng-Shan1 aLiu, Jing-Qiu0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 26, no. 8 p.3700-3704dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01920naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002600137245005800163300001600221500002000237520070800257592002800965650002700993650002401020650001101044650002201055650001201077650002501089650001101114650001101125650000901136650000901145650001001154650001101164650002501175650001801200650001401218651001301232700001801245773014301263856007101406852000901477655001201486IND60680344120221119141106.0200105e198802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068034412DNAL7 a10.2307/12419822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, Abelardo,10aStochastic Modeling of Short‐Term Cattle Operations  ap. 121-132.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA risk‐neutral stochastic dynamic programming model was used to test the certainty equivalence (CE) property in sequential decisions over a single season in a northeastern Colorado yearling operation.

Using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), we monitored 119,775 individual trees in two floristically distinct savanna river catchments (2400ha) over a 2-year period in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Tree height was unchanged in 77% of monitored trees, but 5% increased and 18% decreased in height by 1m or more. We identified 12,703 trees (10.6%) that were completely toppled during the study period. The average rate of treefall was 2.6 trees ha−1yr−1, and was higher in a river catchment dominated by Acacia species (3.8 trees ha−1yr−1) than in another comprised primarily of Combretum species (2.1 trees ha−1yr−1). The majority of observed treefalls were in the 4–6m height classes where proportions of treefall reached 20%. Spatial patterns of treefall were significantly clustered across the landscapes, with proportional rates of loss exceeding 30% in some hillslope patches. These high rates of tree loss present a challenge to biodiversity conservation and management, as tall tree populations may struggle to persist if these rates are maintained over longer time scales. Field-based measures of species-specific population dynamics need to be coupled with large-scale airborne measurements to provide conservation managers with an integrated view upon which to base decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aCombretum 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aecological function 3alandscapes 3alidar 3anational parks 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers 3asavannas 3atrees 3awatersheds 3aSouth Africa 0aBiodiversity 0aDynamics 0aElephant 0aKruger National Park 0aLiDAR 0aSouth Africa 0aSpatial 0aTreefall1 aAsner, Gregory P.0 tBiological conservation.g2013 Jan., v. 157 p.121-127dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01779naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245011800159300001600277500002000293520074800313592002801061650002901089650002701118650002501145650002301170650001101193650002601204651001301230773014201243856007101385852000901456655001201465IND60680344220221119141151.0200105e198805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068034422DNAL7 a10.2307/12420672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuevas, Carlos E.10aIntermediation Costs in an Agricultural Development Bank: A Cost‐Function Approach to Measuring Scale Economies  ap. 273-280.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe cost‐output relationships and production technology in the Agricultural Development Bank of Honduras are analyzed using a translog model.

Product‐specific economies of scale are substantially different. Returns to scale of lending activities approach unity, whereas there are important unexploited economies to the expansion of deposit mobilization. Cost complementarities between lending and deposit mobilization indicate advantages of joint provision of financial services over the traditional specialization in lending of agricultural development banks in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural economics 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomies of scale 3amodels 3aproduction technology 3aHonduras0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1988 May, v. 70, no. 2 p.273-280dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12420673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245008700165300001800252500001500270520160000285592002801885650001301913650000901926650002401935650002201959650002301981650001802004650002502022650001802047650001302065650000902078650001502087650001602102650002402118650000902142650001402151650001402165653002702179653001702206700001802223700001602241700001702257773009802274856008402372852000902456655001202465IND4458789720221119121444.0150808e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445878972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2011.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrager, K.C.10aVaccination strategies to conserve the endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus)  ap. 1940-1948.  a2019-12-06  aPathogens such as rabies virus and canine distemper virus present a significant risk to the long-term survival of some endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) populations. Vaccination of wild dogs is one approach that might reduce population extinction risks; however clear guidelines for how best to do this are lacking. Hence, we developed a mathematical model of wild dog population dynamics that integrates a pathogen transmission model and a vaccination process. Simulations indicated that the most effective vaccination strategy includes all age classes (when pups are 2-months old), prioritizes the breeding pair, and vaccinates at least 4 animals per pack included in the vaccination effort. In addition, populations for which an Allee effect, high rates of pathogen introduction, or low rates of recovery and immunity were simulated, required greater vaccination coverage (dogs/pack), to protect an equivalent number of packs compared to populations for which no Allee effect, low rates of pathogen introduction, or high rates of recovery and immunity were simulated. For populations in which some packs (high-risk) have a greater risk of pathogen exposure than others (low-risk), vaccinating both high- and low-risk packs, or only low-risk packs, is more effective than vaccinating only high-risk packs when pathogen introduction rates are high. Finally, model results suggest that vaccination of wild dog populations against pathogens, such as canine distemper virus, that do not cause 100% mortality and against which some wild dogs develop acquired immunity, may be unnecessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunity 3arisk 3amathematical models 3aRabies lyssavirus 3aat-risk population 3aage structure 3aCanine morbillivirus 3aLycaon pictus 3abreeding 3adogs 3aguidelines 3avaccination 3apopulation dynamics 3apups 3amortality 3apathogens 0aCanine distemper virus 0aRabies virus1 aWoodroffe, R.1 aCameron, A.1 aHaydon, D.T.0 tBiological conservation.g2011 July, v. 144, no. 7 p.1940-1948dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007600171300001100247520115400258592002801412596004801440650000801488650002301496650001401519650001801533650001401551650001101565650002001576650001301596650001201609650002201621650002501643700006101668700001901729700002201748700002001770700003001790700002101820700002401841773010301865856008301968852000902051655001202060IND60792022620221120082645.0220922e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079202262DNAL7 a10.1186/s12863-022-01083-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlood, Pádraic J.10aDraft genome of the aardaker (Lathyrus tuberosus L.), a tuberous legume  ap. 70.  aOBJECTIVES: Lathyrus tuberosus is a nitrogen-fixing member of the Fabaceae which forms protein-rich tubers. To aid future domestication programs for this legume plant and facilitate evolutionary studies of tuber formation, we have generated a draft genome assembly based on Pacific Biosciences sequence reads. DATA DESCRIPTION: Genomic DNA from L. tuberosus was sequenced with PacBio’s HiFi sequencing chemistry generating 12.8 million sequence reads with an average read length of 14 kb (approximately 180 Gb of sequence data). The reads were assembled to give a draft genome of 6.8 Gb in 1353 contigs with an N50 contig length of 11.1 Mb. The GC content of the genome assembly was 38.3%. BUSCO analysis of the genome assembly indicated a genome completeness of at least 96%. The genome sequence will be a valuable resource, for example, in assessing genomic consequences of domestication efforts and developing marker sets for breeding programs. The L. tuberosus genome will also aid in the analysis of the evolutionary history of plants within the nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae family and in understanding the molecular basis of tuber evolution.  aPublisher supplied data  aNO 407/7-2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aDNA 3aLathyrus tuberosus 3achemistry 3adomestication 3aevolution 3agenome 3agenome assembly 3agenomics 3alegumes 3anitrogen fixation 3anucleotide sequences1 aNowrousian, Minou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0075-66951 aHuettel, Bruno1 aWoehle, Christian1 aBecker, Kerstin1 aWollenweber, Tassilo Erik1 aBegerow, Dominik1 aGrefen, Christopher0 tBMC genomic data.g2022 Dec., v. 23, no. 1 p.70-70dBioMed CentralwJournal:27685x2730-68447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-022-01083-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008300161300001600244520120200260592002801462650001801490650001601508650001101524650001301535650001501548650001501563650001701578650001101595650001101606650002301617650001601640650001701656650001901673650001101692651001001703651001801713700001701731700001201748700001301760700001601773700001501789773010101804856008101905852000901986655001201995IND60580078720221120140330.0170908e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058007872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-017-0900-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Tan10aCharacterization of air pollution in urban areas of Yangtze River Delta, China  ap. 836-846.  aThe hallmark of development in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) of East China has been sprawling urbanization. However, air pollution is a significant problem in these urban areas. In this paper, we investigated and analyzed the air pollution index (API) in four cities (Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Ningbo) in the YRD from 2001 to 2012. We attempted to empirically examine the relationship between meteorological factors and air quality in the urban areas of the YRD. According to the monitoring data, the API in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou slightly declined and that in Ningbo increased over the study period. We analyzed the inter-annual, seasonal, and monthly variations of API, from which we found that the air quality had different temporal changes in the four cities. It was indicated that air quality was poor in winter and spring and best in summer. Furthermore, different weather conditions affected air quality level. The wind direction was considered as an important and influential factor to air pollution, which has an impact on the accumulating or cleaning processes of pollutants. The air quality was influenced by the different wind directions that varied with seasons and cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acities 3acleaning 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3ariver deltas 3aspring 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awind direction 3awinter 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aDeng, Shulin1 aGao, Yu1 aQu, Lean1 aLi, Manchun1 aChen, Dong0 tChinese geographical science.g2017 Oct., v. 27, no. 5 p.836-846dScience Pressx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-017-0900-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245006100202500002000263520147300283592002801756596004901784596004901833650001901882650001201901650002001913650002301933650002501956650001301981650001501994650002102009650002202030650001402052650000902066650002002075651001802095700006602113700002202179700002002201773012202221856007402343852000902417655001202426IND60637186220221119105906.0190416e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063718622DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.126052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimler, Allison B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1358-191910aAmplifying plant disease risk through assisted migration  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTranslocation of species, populations, or genotypes beyond their historic ranges (i.e., assisted migration [AM]) is an oft‐debated climate adaptation strategy. Well‐intentioned AM actions could alter disease dynamics for target species and recipient sites, resulting in unanticipated detrimental economic and ecological impacts. Although disease risks are occasionally mentioned in AM debates, current regulations or best practices that reduce or mitigate these complex risks are generally lacking in North America. We use the “Disease Triangle”, a foundational framework in pathology, to illustrate pathways through which AM may impact disease emergence, to identify knowledge gaps, and to suggest best practices to reduce disease risks. We highlight empirical examples in which altering pathogen distributions, host communities, and environment have historically resulted in costly and ecologically damaging diseases in plants. Although guidelines to reduce disease risks in AM are generally lacking, policies governing endangered species, invasive species, and disease management can provide starting points for a more comprehensive policy. We use examples from the United States to identify key strengths and weaknesses that can inform regulations to reduce disease risks associated with AM. We argue that consideration of disease motivates policy development that incorporates improved risk assessments, agency coordination, and accountability mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data  a1148897cDirectorate for Biological Sciences  a1650042cDirectorate for Biological Sciences 3aaccountability 3aclimate 3adisease control 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental impact 3agenotype 3aguidelines 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3apathogens 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aUnited States1 aWilliamson, Matthew A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2550-58281 aSchwartz, Mark W.1 aRizzo, David M.0 tConservation letters.g2019 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.e12605-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.126053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100001500191245008900206520134200295592002801637596000901665596002601674650001301700650001101713650001501724650001901739650002001758650002201778650001401800650001401814650001401828653001901842653001801861653001101879653001501890653002101905700001801926700001901944700001501963700001701978700001801995700001602013700001702029773012602046856008502172852000902257655001202266IND60772430420221118011659.0220515e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077243042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2022.1104172chorus7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2022.1104172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasaro, S.10aFlow cytometry panels for immunophenotyping dairy cattle peripheral blood leukocytes  aMany aspects of the bovine immune system remain poorly characterized, which poses an obstacle to improving dairy cow health. Herein, we describe two flow cytometry panels that included antibodies against CD8α, CD4, TCR-δ, CD172α, CD14, MHCII, CD21, CD62L, and CD11b. These panels were used to characterize the phenotype of leukocyte subpopulations from the peripheral blood of 30-day old Holstein calves and Holstein cows at 260 d of gestation and calving. No leukocyte subset differences were found between the pre- and post-partum cows. However, calf leukocytes presented a higher proportion of CD3⁺ lymphocytes, γδ T-cells, CD8⁺ γδ T-cells, and monocytes when compared with mature cows. Conversely, cow lymphocytes had a higher proportion of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cells, and B-cells than calf lymphocytes. The proportion of CD4⁺ T-cells and B-cells expressing CD62L was greater in calves than in cows, while cow B-cells expressed greater levels of CD11b than calf B-cells. In contrast, calf polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and monocytes expressed greater levels of CD11b compared to cows. Moreover, calf monocytes expressed higher levels of MHCII compared with those of cows. Collectively, our data provides a resource to better understand the bovine immune system as well as immune-related diseases that affect dairy cattle.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA  cUniversity of Florida 3aHolstein 3acalves 3adairy cows 3aflow cytometry 3aimmunopathology 3aimmunophenotyping 3amonocytes 3aphenotype 3apregnancy 0aFlow cytometry 0aHolstein cows 0aCalves 0aPeripartum 0aPeripheral blood1 aMarrero, M.G.1 aMadrid, D.M.C.1 aPrim, J.G.1 aNelson, C.D.1 aGalvão, K.N.1 aLaporta, J.1 aDriver, J.P.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2022 June, v. 248 p.110417-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2022.1104173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245010800197300001600305500002000321520141900341592002801760596007301788596005901861596005901920650002201979650001502001650001702016650001002033650002802043650001702071650001402088650002502102650001802127650001402145650001602159700006102175700001602236700001202252700001602264700005802280700005202338773011402390856007402504852000902578655001202587IND60795299120221121065625.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079529912DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.159422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Guanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0230-041310aInterspecific variation in the temperature response of mesophyll conductance is related to leaf anatomy  ap. 221-234.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough mesophyll conductance (gₘ) is known to be sensitive to temperature (T), the mechanisms underlying the temperature response of gₘ are not fully understood. In particular, it has yet to be established whether interspecific variation in gₘ–T relationships is associated with mesophyll anatomy and vein traits. In the present study, we measured the short‐term response of gₘ in eight crop species, and leaf water potential (Ψₗₑₐf) in five crop species over a temperature range of 15–35°C. The considered structural parameters are surface areas of mesophyll cells and chloroplasts facing intercellular airspaces per unit leaf area (Sₘ and Sc), cell wall thickness (Tcw), and vein length per area (VLA). We detected large interspecific variations in the temperature responses of gₘ and Ψₗₑₐf. The activation energy for gₘ (Eₐ,gₘ) was found to be positively correlated with Sc, although it showed no correlation with Tcw. In contrast, VLA was positively correlated with the slope of the linear model of Ψₗₑₐf–T (a), whereas Eₐ,gₘ was marginally correlated with VLA and a. A two‐component model was subsequently used to model gₘ–T relationships, and the mechanisms underlying the temperature response of gₘ are discussed. The data presented here indicate that leaf anatomy is a major determinant of the interspecific variation in gₘ–T relationships.  aPublisher supplied data  a2021ZKPY017cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a31871532cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a32172103cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aactivation energy 3acell walls 3achloroplasts 3acrops 3ainterspecific variation 3aleaf anatomy 3aleaf area 3aleaf water potential 3alinear models 3amesophyll 3atemperature1 aZhang, Qiangqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2384-77791 aYang, Yuhan1 aShu, Yu1 aRen, Xifeng1 aPeng, Shaobing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1696-94091 aLi, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3595-66730 tplant journal.g2022 Oct., v. 112, no. 1 p.221-234dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.159423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024003500126040001800161100002600179245009200205300001800297506007600315506003100391520137000422592002801792596003501820596003501855596000801890596000901898506003701907650001201944650001701956650001801973650001701991650001302008650001102021650002102032650001702053650001402070650002002084650001402104650000702118650001602125700001902141700002102160700002202181700002202203773012002225856007802345852000902423655001202432IND60733799520221207080955.0220901e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073379952DNAL7 a10.1021/acsabm.0c004462doi7 a10.1021/acsabm.0c004462chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassantino, Joshua M.10aPhotosystem I Enhances the Efficiency of a Natural, Gel-Based Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell  ap. 4465-4473.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe photosystem I (PSI) protein complex is known to enhance bioelectrode performance for many liquid-based photoelectrochemical cells. A hydrogel as electrolyte media allows for simpler fabrication of more robust and practical solar cells in comparison to liquid-based devices. This paper reports a natural, gel-based dye-sensitized solar cell that integrates PSI to improve device efficiency. TiO2-coated FTO slides, dyed by blackberry anthocyanin, act as a photoanode, while a film of PSI deposited onto copper comprises the photocathode. Ascorbic acid (AscH) and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) are the redox mediator couple inside an agarose hydrogel, enabling PSI to produce excess oxidized species near the cathode to improve device performance. A comparison of performance at low pH and neutral pH was performed to test the pH-dependent properties of the AscH/DCPIP couple. Devices at neutral pH performed better than those at lower pH. The PSI film enhanced photovoltage by 75 mV to a total photovoltage of 0.45 V per device and provided a mediator concentration-dependent photocurrent enhancement over non-PSI devices, reaching an instantaneous power conversion efficiency of 0.30% compared to 0.18% without PSI, a 1.67-fold increase. At steady state, power conversion efficiencies for devices with and without PSI were 0.042 and 0.028%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  cDivision of Graduate Education  cDivision of Materials Research  cNSF  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagarose 3aanthocyanins 3aascorbic acid 3ablackberries 3acathodes 3acopper 3aelectric current 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogels 3amicroelectrodes 3aoxidation 3apH 3asolar cells1 aWolfe, Kody D.1 aSimon, Keiann T.1 aCliffel, David E.1 aJennings, G.

In this research, a new additive - the ZELIAC – was investigated for treating a Malaysian dispersive clay soil where an appreciable decrease in dispersivity was achieved due to treatment with 8% ZELIAC. The curing time was found to be significant that after 28days, the initially dispersive samples became non-dispersive. Furthermore, due to the treatment, the samples had increased unconfined compressive strength (UCS), permeability, and optimum moisture content; and decreased fines content, plasticity index, maximum dry density, and compressibility index. The UCS increased nearly 7.3 times for sample treated with 8% ZELIAC and cured for 90days. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) results showed a cementitious structure with calcium content 10.8 times more in the treated sample than in the untreated one, reflecting the constructive cation exchange reaction taking place during the curing process. The sodium ion was noticeably replaced by calcium ion which resulted in a decreased thickness of the diffused double layer and the subsequent reduction in the dispersivity of the sample. These results were also reflected by the lower peak intensity as measured by the X-ray diffraction test (XRD) for the treated sample, as compared to the higher peak intensity for the un-treated sample. Finally, the SEM images indicate that the flocculated structures of the treated dispersive clay were surrounded by the ZELIAC particles. Thus, the ZELIAC was proven to be effective in improving the studied Malaysian dispersive clay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acompressibility 3afluorescence 3apermeability 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3awater content 0aSoil stabilization 0aDispersive clay 0aGeotechnical properties 0aZELIAC 0aCuring time1 aSelamat, Mohamad Razip bin1 aAziz, Hamidi Bin Abdul1 aMojiri, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0624-16921 aAhmad, Zakiah1 aSafarzadeh, Marjan0 tGeoderma.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 285 p.270-279dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04174naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007600172520266800248592002802916650001502944650002102959650002102980650002303001650001303024650001903037650002303056650001403079650003203093650001303125650001703138650002503155650002203180650001303202653003003215653001403245653001703259653001503276653002303291653002303314653001303337653002603350700001903376700001903395700002003414700001803434773011203452856008303564852000903647655001203656IND60772430620221118011624.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077243062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2022.1166062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagheri, Ahmad Reza10aTwo-dimensional materials as a platform in extraction methods: A review  aSample preparation is a critical step in analytical chemistry, particularly in the consideration of analytes of interest from complex matrices. Due to this complexity, the presence of interferences and low concentrations of the analytes, direct analysis of matrices is not possible in most cases. So, to address this, sample preparation is necessary for removing possible interferences, and pre-concentrating the target analytes. Sorbent-based sorptive extraction/microextraction (SBSEME) is a versatile sample preparation method that has been widely applied for the processing of various samples. With a judicious choice of sorbents, SBSEME can provide benefits like simplicity, ease of operation, cost-effectiveness, high accessibility, moderate extraction time, and low-to-moderate consumption of solvents, and compatibility with different detection techniques. Among the many different materials that have been used in SBSEME as sorbents, two-dimensional materials (TDMs) like graphene and its derivatives (graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide) have been attracting a lot of attention in recent years by those involved in the sample preparation field. TDMs have amenable characteristics like porous structures, high surface area, high adsorption capacity, ease of modification to further improve their properties, generally low toxicity, excellent biocompatibility, high physical, chemical and thermal stability, high elasticity and flexibility, and high resistance and thermal conductivity. To better investigate and understand the applicability of TDMs in sample preparation methods, it is important to survey recent progress and development of TDMs with reference to their synthesis and applications. To this end, in this review article, (a) TDMs, their features, synthesis and modification approaches are investigated; (b) different TDM composites are studied and evaluated; (c) the applications of TDMs and their composites in different extraction methods such as solid-phase extraction (SPE), dispersive SPE, magnetic SPE, micro-SPE, solid-phase microextraction, pipette-tip solid-phase extraction, stir bar sorptive extraction, and headspace sorptive extraction are described; (d) possible mechanisms of sorbent-analyte interactions as a vital aspect of extraction are also evaluated; and (e) current trends and future prospects in relation to synthesis and application of TDMs and their composites in extraction methods are assessed. The general conclusion that can be drawn from the review is that these versatile materials represent a fertile area of sample preparation research that will continue to be advanced further by analytical chemists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiocompatibility 3achemical species 3acost effectiveness 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aheadspace analysis 3amagnetism 3asolid phase microextraction 3asorbents 3asurface area 3athermal conductivity 3athermal stability 3atoxicity 0aTwo-dimensional materials 0aSynthesis 0aModification 0aComposites 0aSample preparation 0aExtraction methods 0aSorbents 0aExtraction mechanisms1 aAramesh, Nahal1 aGong, Zhengjun1 aCerdá, Victor,1 aLee, Hian Kee0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2022 July, v. 152 p.116606-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2022.1166063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01679naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245011200159300001600271520055500287592002800842650001900870650001200889650001300901650002200914650001900936650002100955650000900976650002700985650001601012650002501028700002101053700001801074700002101092700001801113773010501131856004801236852000901284655001201293IND4474949820221119121345.0121003e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447494982DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-011-9501-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, Avik10aIsolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite loci from the invasive plant Lantana camara L.  ap. 171-173.  aLantana camara is a highly invasive plant that has established itself in at least 60 different countries across the world.

In a semicontinuous culture, the N:P weight ratios consumed were 14:1 and 18:1 for the sewage influent and effluent, respectively. The total cell number and green algae ratio of microalgae cultivated by semicontinuous culture exceeded those of batch culture. No cyanobacterial cells were observed in the semicontinuous culture using the sewage effluent. The organic components in the cultured microalgae using sewage effluent, eluted by n-hexane, were determined. The ratio of unsaturated fatty acid exceeded that of saturated fatty acid, which was possibly attributable to the fluidity of the cell membrane. The squalene was also obtained by the culture using sewage alone, free of any external stock or nutrient salt. The higher heating value of the microalgae of semicontinuous culture using the sewage influent was 25MJkg−1, corresponding to the heating value of lignite and showing the potential of the sewage culture microalgae as a means of power generation and combustion aid.  aPublisher supplied data 3asewage 3aheat 3aChlorophyta 3apower generation 3asqualene 3acombustion 3acell membranes 3asaturated fatty acids 3alignite 3asewage effluent 3amicroalgae 2aBiofuels 2aBioreactors 2aChlorophytaxgrowth & development 2aMicroalgaexgrowth & development 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aSewagexchemistry 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 0aFuel 0aChlorophycota 0aMicroalgae 0aSewage 0aOrganic components1 aUchida, Tsutomu0 tChemosphere.g2013 Oct., v. 93 p.1442-1445dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.07.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245007800210300001800288506007600306520126300382592002801645506003701673650000801710650001801718650001501736650001401751650001501765650001801780650002001798650001701818650001801835650001901853650002401872650001601896650001101912650001201923700002301935700002101958700001901979700002401998700002402022700002202046700002502068700002002093700002202113773010502135856008202240852000902322655001202331IND60091495420221207052337.0141103e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009149542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.01.0192doi7 aPMC30655452pmcid7 a213427612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez, Carlos A.10aLabel-free multiplexed virus detection using spectral reflectance imaging  ap. 3432-3437.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe demonstrate detection of whole viruses and viral proteins with a new label-free platform based on spectral reflectance imaging. The Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor (IRIS) has been shown to be capable of sensitive protein and DNA detection in a real time and high-throughput format. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was used as the target for detection as it is well-characterized for protein composition and can be modified to express viral coat proteins from other dangerous, highly pathogenic agents for surrogate detection while remaining a biosafety level 2 agent. We demonstrate specific detection of intact VSV virions achieved with surface-immobilized antibodies acting as capture probes which is confirmed using fluorescence imaging. The limit of detection is confirmed down to 3.5×10⁵plaque-forming units/mL (PFUs/mL). To increase specificity in a clinical scenario, both the external glycoprotein and internal viral proteins were simultaneously detected with the same antibody arrays with detergent-disrupted purified VSV and infected cell lysate solutions. Our results show sensitive and specific virus detection with a simple surface chemistry and minimal sample preparation on a quantitative label-free interferometric platform.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aVesiculovirus 3aantibodies 3abiosafety 3abiosensors 3acoat proteins 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aglycoproteins 3aimage analysis 3aprotein composition 3areflectance 3avirion 3aviruses1 aDaaboul, George G.1 aVedula, Rahul S.1 aÖzkumur, Emre1 aBergstein, David A.1 aGeisbert, Thomas W.1 aFawcett, Helen E.1 aGoldberg, Bennett B.1 aConnor, John H.1 aÜnlü, M.

Two hundred and ten Chinese local strain hens aged 37 weeks were randomly allocated to three groups, each group included five replicates, with 14 hens per replicate. The hens in the control group were fed with the basal diet, whereas those in the test groups were fed with a basal diet supplemented with 2.5% moringa leaf powder and 2.5% mulberry leaf powder (MOLP2.5+MLP2.5), 5% MOLP and 2.5% MLP (MOLP5+MLP2.5). The clutch traits (clutches, clutch length, delay days) were recorded during the trial. At the end of the experiment, the effect of the dietary supplementation with MOLP and MLP on the reproductive organs and tissues was estimated, and the gene expressions of ESR1, ESR2, CYP19A1 and STAR were analysed. Compared with the control group, the clutch performed worse in the treatment groups, however, the laying rate, reproductive organs and tissues in the MOLP2.5+MLP2.5 group showed no significant difference. Though the oestrogen levels did not significantly increase, they were elevated in the MOLP2.5+MLP2.5 group. Furthermore, it was identified that the expression levels of the ESR1 and CYP19A1 mRNA were significantly upregulated in the MOLP2.5+MLP2.5 group compared with those in the control group. In conclusion, a low addition level of MOLP and MLP can be used in laying hens to improve the steroid hormones synthesis-related gene expression which might improve the reproductive performance over the long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aMorus nigra 3achickens 3adietary supplements 3aestrogens 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3amulberries 3areproductive performance1 aLi, Tao1 aLu, Jian1 aWang, Kehua1 aZhu, Liang,1 aHou, Qirui1 aZhao, Weiguo1 aWu, Ping0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 67, no. 8 p.339-347dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/166/2021-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001800183245013200201300001800333506007600351520144800427592002801875506003701903650002101940650001401961650001701975650002201992650001102014650002202025650001802047650000902065650001202074650001902086700002302105773013102128856007802259852000902337655001202346IND60563337520221207074358.0170215e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056333752DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b119952doi7 aPMC53109882pmcid7 a280956952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrnec, Martin10aFrontier Molecular Orbital Contributions to Chlorination versus Hydroxylation Selectivity in the Non-Heme Iron Halogenase SyrB2  ap. 2396-2407.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe ability of an FeᴵⱽO intermediate in SyrB2 to perform chlorination versus hydroxylation was computationally evaluated for different substrates that had been studied experimentally. The π-trajectory for H atom abstraction (FeᴵⱽO oriented perpendicular to the C–H bond of substrate) was found to lead to the S = 2 five-coordinate HO–Feᴵᴵᴵ–Cl complex with the C• of the substrate, π-oriented relative to both the Cl– and the OH– ligands. From this ferric intermediate, hydroxylation is thermodynamically favored, but chlorination is intrinsically more reactive due to the energy splitting between two key redox-active dπ* frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). The splitting is determined by the differential ligand field effect of Cl– versus OH– on the Fe center. This makes chlorination effectively competitive with hydroxylation. Chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity is then determined by the orientation of the substrate with respect to the HO–Fe–Cl plane that controls either the Cl– or the OH– to rebound depending on the relative π-overlap with the substrate C radical. The differential contribution of the two FMOs to chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity in SyrB2 is related to a reaction mechanism that involves two asynchronous transfers: electron transfer from the substrate radical to the iron center followed by late ligand (Cl– or OH–) transfer to the substrate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical bonding 3achlorides 3achlorination 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydroxylation 3airon 3aligands 3athermodynamics1 aSolomon, Edward I.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 139, no. 6 p.2396-2407dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b119953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011700166300002000283500001500303520157500318592002801893650002501921650001301946650003701959650002201996650002402018650001102042650001802053650002102071650001402092650001902106650001802125650002102143650001102164650001302175650001302188650001402201650002302215650001802238650002302256650001602279653002102295653002602316653001402342653003202356700001902388700002302407700002102430700002602451700001902477700002002496700001502516700002702531773013002558856007802688852000902766655001202775IND60550881920170818000000.0161011e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055088192DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b056302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin, Mohammed A.10aAluminum Titania Nanoparticle Composites as Nonprecious Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Generation of H2  ap. 23655-23667.  a2019-12-06  aIn this paper, we demonstrated, for the first time, aluminum titania nanoparticle (Al-TiO₂ NP) composites with variable amounts of TiO₂ NPs as nonprecious active catalysts for the electrochemical generation of H₂. These materials were synthesized by mixing desired amounts of hydrogen titanate nanotubes (TNTs), fabricated here by a cost-effective approach at moderate hydrothermal conditions, with aluminum powder (purity 99.7%; size 35 μm). The mixture was compacted under an applied uniaxial stress of 300 MPa followed by sintering at 500 °C for 1 h. After sintering had been completed, all TNTs were found to convert to TiO₂ NPs (average particle size 15 nm). Finally, Al-xTiO₂ NP nanocomposites (x = 1, 3, 5, and 10) were obtained and characterized by scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of these materials was studied in 0.5 M H₂SO₄ at 298 K using polarization and impedance measurements. The nanocomposite of chemical composition Al-5% TiO₂ NPs showed the best catalytic performance for the HER, with an onset potential (EHER), a Tafel slope (βc), and an exchange current density (j₀) of −100 mV (RHE), 59.8 mV decade–¹, and 0.14 mA cm–², respectively. This HER activity is not far from that of the commercial platinum/carbon catalyst (EHER = 0.0 mV, βc = 31 mV dec–¹, and j₀ = 0.78 mA cm–²). The best catalyst also exhibited good stability after 10000 repetitive cycles with negligible loss in current.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aplatinum 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3ahydrogen production 3amixing 3asulfuric acid 3atitanium dioxide 3acatalysts 3ananocomposites 3aparticle size 3aelectrochemistry 3acarbon 3aaluminum 3ahydrogen 3ananotubes 3acost effectiveness 3ananoparticles 3acatalytic activity 3aX-radiation 0aelectrocatalysis 0atitania nanoparticles 0aimpedance 0ahydrogen evolution reaction1 aAhmed, Emad M.1 aMostafa, Nasser Y.1 aAlotibi, Mona M.1 aDarabdhara, Gitashree1 aDas, Manash R.1 aWysocka, Joanna1 aRyl, Jacek1 aAbd El-Rehim, Sayed

This is because post-depositional processes move clasts in particular ways, causing non-random patterning in clast orientation arrangements. On the other hand, when assemblages exhibit a randomly distributed bearing orientation and minimal tilt, it is commonly assumed that the remains are of a primary depositional context with limited influence from taphonomic mechanisms. Yet, this null expectation about in situ artifact orientation is seldom demonstrated empirically. In this study, we develop a GIS simulation approach to model artifact discard on real-world surfaces of distinct terrain and slope morphologies. Our findings demonstrate that an uneven ground surface relief can cause in situ discards to have a more variable plunge orientation arrangement. Using the Upper Paleolithic site of Shuidonggou Locality 2 as a case study, we show that the horizontally distributed artifact ‘layers’ at the site exhibit orientation profiles that are consistent with the simulated outcome. This finding suggests the possibility of using archaeological orientation patterning as a proxy for past ground surface relief and morphologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3acase studies 3afauna 3alandscapes 0aOrientation 0aFormation processes 0aSimulation 0aGIS 0aShuidonggou1 aLin, Sam C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6834-26461 aPeng, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9838-90151 aPatania, Ilaria1 aGuo, Jialong1 aWang, Huimin1 aGao, Xing0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2021 Feb., v. 126 p.105310-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.1053103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012300168300001400291520144000305592002801745650002501773650001701798650002101815650001101836650001401847650003001861650002101891650001601912650002201928650002001950653000901970653001401979653002301993653003102016653002402047653002502071700002302096700002102119700001902140700002002159700002002179700001802199700001902217700001902236773010802255856008502363852000902448655001202457IND60527053520221121033911.0190411e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052705352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2016.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLudvig, Alice14aThe practice of entrepreneurship in the non-wood forest products sector: Support for innovation on private forest land  ap. 31-37.  aThe paper sets out to examine the characteristics of support for innovation processes in Non-Wood Forest Products (NWFP). The typical enterprises and start-ups which emerge in this sector tend to be small-scale and family owned. We claim that there is a large unused potential for NWFP to support rural development and increase incomes of land owners and rural enterprises. In this article, we study what makes selected and so far successful product innovations in NWFPs special and subsequently what were the factors that supported their development and marketing? These questions we study at hand of four empirical innovative case studies in four European rural areas. We come to the conclusion that the entrepreneurs show some common features in the ways they started their business. However, they have applied individual strategies for the realisation of their own ideas. In line with recommendations from recent literature on creating innovations, all of them have used some “external” support, but at very different levels: They range from monetary support and consultation of effective support organisations to personal non-monetary exchange-relationships in social networks within a communal area. Our results contribute to an understanding of entrepreneurial behaviour as a very individual and context-specific undertaking on the one hand and as a “universal” activity with common features and attributes on the other.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aentrepreneurship 3aincome 3amarketing 3anontimber forest products 3aprivate forestry 3arural areas 3arural development 3asocial networks 0aSMEs 0aStart-Ups 0aLocal institutions 0aNon-timber-forest-products 0aPractical knowledge 0aPro-active behaviour1 aTahvanainen, Veera1 aDickson, Antonia1 aEvard, Camille1 aKurttila, Mikko1 aCosovic, Marija1 aChapman, Emma1 aWilding, Maria1 aWeiss, Gerhard0 tForest policy and economics.g2016 May, v. 66 p.31-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2016.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245009800152300001600250500002000266520147300286592002801759596005801787596007001845596007001915596006701985650001602052650001302068650001502081650000902096650001402105650002002119650002102139650001002160650001302170650000902183650002102192700001202213700005802225700005402283700001702337700005202354700005202406773011402458856007402572852000902646655001202655IND60795299620221121110740.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079529962DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.159432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Juan10aParallel analysis of RNA ends reveals global microRNA‐mediated target RNA cleavage in maize  ap. 268-283.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 20–24‐nucleotide non‐coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in many biological processes in eukaryotes. miRNAs modulate the expression of target genes at the post‐transcriptional level by transcript cleavage or translational inhibition. The identification of miRNA target genes has been extensively investigated in Arabidopsis and rice, but an in‐depth global analysis of miRNA‐mediated target regulation is still lacking in maize. Here, we report a transcriptome‐wide identification of miRNA targets by analyzing parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) datasets derived from nine different tissues at five developmental stages of the maize (Zea mays L.) B73 cultivar. In total, 246 targets corresponding to 60 miRNAs from 25 families were identified, including transcription factors and other genes. In addition, PARE analysis revealed that miRNAs guide specific target transcript cleavage in a tissue‐preferential manner. Primary transcripts of MIR159c and MIR169e were found to be cleaved by mature miR159 and miR169, respectively, indicating a negative‐feedback regulatory mechanism in miRNA biogenesis. Moreover, several miRNA‐target gene pairs involved in seed germination were identified and experimentally validated. Our PARE analyses generated a wide and detailed miRNA‐target interaction atlas, which provides a valuable resource for investigating the roles of miRNAs and their targets in maize.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014ZT05S078cGuangdong Innovation Research Team Fund  a2019A1515011222cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province  a2021A1515010482cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province  aJCYJ20190808112207542cShenzhen Basic Research General Project 3aArabidopsis 3aZea mays 3abiogenesis 3acorn 3acultivars 3adata collection 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3amicroRNA 3arice 3aseed germination1 aXu, Chi1 aYou, Chenjiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9935-18921 aMo, Beixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7279-97881 aChen, Xuemei1 aGao, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6488-02921 aLiu, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0023-79750 tplant journal.g2022 Oct., v. 112, no. 1 p.268-283dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.159433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245005700162300001600219500002000235520052200255592002800777650002500805650002700830650002300857650001200880650002600892650001900918650002000937650002500957651001100982651001800993773014201011856007101153852000901224655001201233IND60680344920221119141411.0200105e198805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068034492DNAL7 a10.2307/12420772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorgaard, Richard B.14aThe Biological Control of Cassava Mealybug in Africa  ap. 366-371.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCassava, brought from South America 300 years ago free of its pests, became a major subsistence crop in Africa.

Therefore, understanding the genotype-to-phenotype axis requires a comprehensive catalog of functional non-coding genomic elements, most of which are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Genome-wide maps of open chromatin regions can facilitate functional analysis of cis- and trans-regulatory elements via their connections with trait-associated sequence variants. Currently, Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is considered the most accessible and cost-effective strategy for genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) technology has also been developed to study cell type-specific chromatin accessibility in tissue samples containing a heterogeneous cellular population. However, due to the intrinsic nature of scATAC-seq data, which are highly noisy and sparse, accurate extraction of biological signals and devising effective biological hypothesis are difficult. To overcome such limitations in scATAC-seq data analysis, new methods and software tools have been developed over the past few years. Nevertheless, there is no consensus for the best practice of scATAC-seq data analysis yet. In this review, we discuss scATAC-seq technology and data analysis methods, ranging from preprocessing to downstream analysis, along with an up-to-date list of published studies that involved the application of this method. We expect this review will provide a guideline for successful data generation and analysis methods using appropriate software tools and databases for the study of chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3achromatin 3acomputer software 3acost effectiveness 3aepigenetics 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3atransposases 0aATAC sequencing 0aChromatin accessibility 0aSingle-cell biology 0aSingle-cell ATAC sequencing 0aSingle-cell RNA sequencing1 aLee, Insuk0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.1429-1439dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245014000166300001800306520131200324592002801636650001101664650001801675650001201693650000901705650001401714650001001728650001101738650001401749650002701763651002201790651001101812700001801823700001901841700001401860700001701874700001901891773011601910856005502026852000902081655001202090IND4465364820221116143343.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446536482DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01784.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSieli, G.10aBiology of red mullet, Mullus barbatus (L. 1758), in the Gulf of Castellammare (NW Sicily, Mediterranean Sea) subject to a trawling ban  ap. 1218-1225.  aUnder‐or non‐exploited areas are useful to aid in evaluating the potential productivity of fish stocks for sustainable fisheries. The Gulf of Castellammare (NW Sicily), where trawling has been banned since 1990, is a good site to study the biology and dynamics of low impacted fish populations. A total of 661 (595 female and 66 male) specimens of red mullet Mullus barbatus (95–245 mm total length, TL) obtained by monthly sampling from trammel net artisanal fishery, was collected in the Gulf of Castellammare from April 2006 to June 2007. Mature females occurred from April to September, with a peak in May. The mean Gonado‐somatic index (GSI) also showed a May peak for both sexes. From Sagittae (642) readings the age structure ranged from age class I to VII in females and I to V in males.

The enzyme has been thought to act as a dehydrogenase for xenobiotic alcohols and some hydroxysteroids, but its physiological function remains unknown. We have purified rabbit 3HBD, isolated its cDNA, and examined its specificity for coenzymes and substrates, reaction directionality and tissue distribution. 3HBD is a member (AKR1C29) of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, and exhibited high preference for NADP(H) over NAD(H) at a physiological pH of 7.4. In the NADPH-linked reduction, 3HBD showed broad substrate specificity for a variety of quinones, ketones and aldehydes, including 3-, 17- and 20-ketosteroids and prostaglandin D₂, which were converted to 3α-, 17β- and 20α-hydroxysteroids and 9α,11β-prostaglandin F₂, respectively. Especially, α-diketones (such as isatin and diacetyl) and lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes (such as 4-oxo- and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenals) were excellent substrates showing low Kₘ values (0.1–5.9μM). In 3HBD-overexpressed cells, 3-oxohexobarbital and 5β-androstan-3α-ol-17-one were metabolized into 3-hydroxyhexobarbital and 5β-androstane-3α,17β-diol, respectively, but the reverse reactions did not proceed. The overexpression of the enzyme in the cells decreased the cytotoxicity of 4-oxo-2-nonenal. The mRNA for 3HBD was ubiquitously expressed in rabbit tissues. The results suggest that 3HBD is an NADPH-preferring reductase, and plays roles in the metabolisms of steroids, prostaglandin D₂, carbohydrates and xenobiotics, as well as a defense system, protecting against reactive carbonyl compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3acarbohydrates 3acarbonyl compounds 3acoenzymes 3acytotoxicity 3adiacetyl 3aketosteroids 3aoxidation 3apH 3aprostaglandins 3aquinones 3arabbits 3asubstrate specificity 3atissue distribution 3axenobiotics 2a17-Ketosteroidsxmetabolism 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAldehydesxmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aHexobarbitalxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIsatinxmetabolism 2aKetonesxmetabolism 2aKetosteroidsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNADPxmetabolism 2aPhenolphthaleinxpharmacology 2aProstaglandin D2xmetabolism 2aRabbits 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aXenobioticsxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aMatsunaga, Toshiyuki1 aMatsumoto, Atsuko1 aArai, Yuki1 aOhno, Satoshi1 aEl-Kabbani, Ossama1 aTajima, Kazuo1 aBunai, Yasuo1 aYamano, Shigeru1 aHara, Akira1 aKitade, Yukio0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 86, no. 9 p.1366-1375dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.08.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245005400167300002000221520091800241592002801159650001601187650001501203650002301218650001501241650001301256650001401269650001101283650001701294700006401311700002301375700002401398700006301422773013801485856008001623852000901703655001201712IND60744721920221121012256.0210716e20210702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074472192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c043682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurano, Marie E.10aStructural Inhibition of Silver Surface Oxidation  ap. 14702-14708.  aSurface structure and oxidation are key to silver-based heterogeneous catalysis. Prevention of surface reconstruction may favor electrophilic oxygen, which is believed to be the active species in silver-catalyzed oxidation. To determine whether terrace width or step geometry enables control of oxidation and concomitant reconstruction, we investigated oxidation of the topmost layer of a curved Ag(111) crystal. This crystal contains a range of terrace widths having either A- or B-type step geometries. Atomic oxygen was used to facilitate oxidation, temperature-programmed desorption quantified the extent of oxygen adsorption, and scanning tunneling microscopy characterized the formation of reconstructed areas. While A-type steps prove to have little influence, B-type steps hinder reconstruction. We attribute the difference to geometric-dependent growth mechanisms of silver oxide surface reconstructions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aadsorption 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3ageometry 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asilver oxide1 aJuurlink, Ludo B.

S.10aEffect of burning and mowing on grass and forb diversity in a long-term grassland experiment  ap. 1-10.  aDisturbance may be an important determinant of plant community composition and diversity owing to its effects on competitive interactions, resources, dominance and vigour. The effect of type, timing and frequency of disturbance on grass and forb species richness was examined using data from a long-term (> 50 yr) grassland burning and mowing experiment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.Grass species richness declined considerably (> 50%%) in the absence of disturbance, whereas forb species richness was unaffected. Annual burning in sites not mown in summer tended to increase grass species richness relative to triennial burning (22%% increase) with the reverse being true in sites mown twice in summer (37%% decline). Forb species richness declined by 25%% in sites mown twice in summer relative to sites mown in early summer only. Disturbance was necessary to achieve maximum grass species richness presumably by removing litter and increasing the availability of light. The interaction of time of mowing in summer (early versus late) and time of burning during the dormant period (spring versus winter) had the most dramatic effect on species richness. Time of burning had no effect on richness in sites mown in early summer, but winter burning resulted in a dramatic decline (27––42%%) in richness in sites mown in late summer. This effect may be related to possible greater soil desiccation with this combination of disturbances.Nomenclature: Arnold & De Wet (1993).Abbreviation: AGP == Above-ground phytomass production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3abotanical composition 3aburning 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3amowing 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3avigor 3awinter 3aSouth Africa 0aCompetition 0aFire 0aLight 0aLitter 0aSoil desiccation1 aMorris, Craig D.1 aEdwards, Trevor J.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2004 Feb., v. 7, no. 1 p.1-10dOpulus Pressx1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1402-2001%282004%29007%5B0001%3AEOBAMO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04369naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245020300189300001800392520182300410592002802233650001502261650002802276650001502304650002702319650001202346650002102358650001002379650001102389650001302400650001402413650001602427650001702443650002202460650001402482650002002496650001002516650001202526650004402538650001202582650005102594650001802645650002102663650004102684650002902725650003902754650005302793650003702846650004102883650005902924650000902983650003302992650002303025650001303048650006903061650004003130650003603170650005903206700001803265700002203283700002203305700002603327700002303353700002103376773010103397856008103498990002303579852000903602655001203611IND60089940420150305000000.0141102e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008994042DNAL7 a239735242pmid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2013.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMladenović, Milan10aCombining molecular docking and 3-D pharmacophore generation to enclose the in vivo antigenotoxic activity of naturally occurring aromatic compounds: Myricetin, quercetin, rutin, and rosmarinic acid  ap. 1376-1396.  aConsidering the controversial results concerning the antimutagenicity of some phenolic compounds recorded in the literature, the antigenotoxic effects of four selected phenolic compounds, myricetin, quercetin, rutin, and rosmarinic acid, against DNA damage induced by alkylation with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), were evaluated in Drosophila melanogaster males using the sex-linked recessive lethal (SLRL) test. To assess the protective effects against DNA damage, D. melanogaster males were exposed to a monofunctional alkylating agent EMS in concentration of 0.75ppm, 24h prior to one of the selected phenolic compounds in the concentration of 100ppm. The possible differences in mechanisms of protection by selected compounds were determined by molecular docking, after which structure-based 3-D pharmacophore models were generated. EMS induced considerable DNA damage as shown by significant increase in the frequency of germinative mutations. The frequency decreased with high significance (p<0.001***) after post-treatments with all selected phenolic compounds. Further, docking analysis revealed EMS pre-bond conformations against guanine and thymine as a necessary condition for alkylation, after which resulting O⁶-ethylguanine and O⁴-ethylthimine were docked into the active site of O⁶-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase to confirm that particular lesions are going to be repaired. Finally, myricetin and quercetin protected dealkylated nucleotides from further EMS alkylation by forming the strong hydrogen bonds with O⁶-guanine and O⁴-thymine via B ring hydroxyl group (bond lengths lower than 2.5Å). On the other side, rutin and rosmarinic acid encircled nucleotides and by fulfilling the EMS binding space they made an impermeable barrier for the EMS molecule and prevented further alkylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aalkylation 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3aguanine 3ahydrogen bonding 3amales 3amodels 3amutation 3amyricetin 3anucleotides 3apharmacology 3aprotective effect 3aquercetin 3arosmarinic acid 3arutin 3athymine 2aAlkylating Agentsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aAnimals 2aAntimutagenic Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBinding Sites 2aCatalytic Domain 2aCinnamatesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDNA Damagexdrug effects 2aDepsidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aEthyl Methanesulfonatextoxicity 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aGuaninexanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMolecular Docking Simulation 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aMutation 2aO(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aQuercetinxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aRutinxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aThyminexanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aMatić, Sanja1 aStanić, Snežana1 aSolujić, Slavica1 aMihailović, Vladimir1 aStanković, Nevena1 aKatanić, Jelena0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 86, no. 9 p.1376-1396dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.08.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002200136245007000158300001600228520095500244592002801199650002101227650002201248650001201270650002201282650001601304650001301320650001601333650001201349650001201361651002101373700002001394773011701414856007101531852000901602655001201611IND60594574820221122112944.0180625e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059457482DNAL7 a10.2984/71.4.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuden, Donald W.,10aButterflies (Lepidoptera) of the Republic of the Marshall Islands  ap. 511-522.  aFive butterfly species are reported from the Republic of the Marshall Islands: Badamia exclamationis, Danaus plexippus, Hypolimnas bolina, Junonia villida, and Lampides boeticus; the last requires corroboration.

It was recorded, often in large numbers, on all islands surveyed during the study reported here, and on all islands in the Marshalls where butterflies were previously recorded. Additional surveys of butterflies elsewhere in the Marshall Islands will doubtless result in many new locality records, but few additional species are likely to be added to the current list. Small island size together with limited habitat diversity, limited host-plant availability, and distance from potential source populations contribute to the paucity of species on these remote Pacific islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanaus plexippus 3aHypolimnas bolina 3aJunonia 3aLampides boeticus 3abutterflies 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3aislands 3asurveys 3aMarshall Islands1 aTennent , W.

However, only a few studies have investigated the characteristics of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 in Tibetan sheep and the effect of their polymorphism on litter size. In this study, we examined the expression of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 in 13 tissues of Tibetan sheep by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, cDNA of these genes was cloned, sequenced and subjected to bioinformatics analysis. DNA sequencing was also used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, iM-LDRᵀᴹ technology was used for SNP genotyping. Associations between polymorphisms and litter size were analyzed using data from genotyping of 433 Tibetan sheep. The results showed that the expression of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 genes was ubiquitous in the tissues of Tibetan sheep, such as the ovary, uterus and oviduct, hypothalamus, hypophysis, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, rumen, duodenum and longissimus dorsi. However, the expression was unbalanced and upregulated in the spleen, lung, ovary and uterus and downregulated in the longissimus dorsi. The bioinformatics analysis showed that SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 in Tibetan sheep encoded proteins of 533, 465 and 427 amino acids, respectively. Sequence homology analysis of the three proteins among other animals showed that the sequences of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 of Tibetan sheep were similar to those in sheep, yak, cattle, dog, human, pig, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey and house mouse. Two synonymous mutations, g.51537A>G and g.319C>T, were detected in SMAD5 and SMAD7, respectively. The associations of these SNPs and litter size were determined, and it was found that both g.51537A>G and g.319C>T have no significant effect on the litter size of Tibetan sheep. The results provided novel insights into the molecular characterization, expression profiles and polymorphisms of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 in Tibetan sheep, but our results do not support associations between these genes and the litter size of Tibetan sheep.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMacaca mulatta 3aMus musculus 3aPan troglodytes 3abioinformatics 3acattle 3adogs 3aduodenum 3afollicular development 3agenotyping 3aheart 3ahumans 3ahypothalamus 3akidneys 3alitter size 3aliver 3alongissimus muscle 3alungs 3aoocytes 3aorganogenesis 3aoviducts 3apituitary gland 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology 3asheep 3aspleen 3aswine 3auterus 3ayaks1 aLi, Mingming 1 aHe, Na 1 aWen, Xiaocheng 1 aZhang, Junxia 0 tAnimals.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 12, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121722323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01358naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006300172520033500235592002800570650002000598650001400618650002900632650001600661653000800677653000800685653000800693653000800701653000800709653001800717653004000735653001700775700002100792773008800813856008600901852000900987655001200996IND60659332120221117053918.0190822e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065933212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2019.1086162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerrone, Claudia10aDeciding on behalf of others does not mitigate selfishness  aWe test whether deciding on behalf of a passive third party makes participants less selfish in a subsequent decision on behalf of themselves.

The objective of this study is to explore the regulatory mechanism for starch biosynthesis and degradation in plant source organs. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed that during the day after anthesis, starch granules in mesophyll cells of wheat flag leaves accumulated in chloroplasts and the number of starch granules gradually decreased with wheat leaf growth. During the night, starch granules synthesized in chloroplasts during the day were completely or partially degraded. The transcript levels of 26 starch synthesis‐related genes and 16 starch breakdown‐related genes were further measured using quantitative real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expression profile analysis revealed that starch metabolism genes were clustered into two groups based on their temporal expression patterns. The genes in the first group were highly expressed and presumed to play crucial roles in starch metabolism. The genes in the other group were not highly expressed in flag leaves and may have minor functions in starch metabolism in leaf tissue. The functions of most of these genes in leaves were further discussed. The starch metabolism‐related genes that are predominantly expressed in wheat flag leaves differ from those expressed in wheat grain, indicating that two different pathways for starch metabolism operate in these tissues. This provides specific information on the molecular mechanisms of transitory starch metabolism in higher plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3achloroplasts 3afilling period 3aflowering 3agenes 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astarch granules 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awheat1 aPeng, Xiaoqi1 aWang, Lina1 aYang, Yingying1 aShao, Ruixin1 aXie, Yingxin1 aMa, Dongyun1 aWang, Chenyang1 aGuo, Tiancai1 aZhu, Yunji0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2015 Jan., v. 153, no. 1 p.12-29dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.122333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245006100171300002000232520101500252592002801267650001101295650001401306650002301320700002401343700002101367700002001388700002301408700001901431700001901450773013801469856008001607852000901687655001201696IND60744722320220217000000.0210716e20210629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074472232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c047912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjörnson, Kristofer10aIn Situ Pseudopotentials for Electronic Structure Theory  ap. 15103-15111.  aWe present a general method of constructing in situ pseodopotentials from first-principles, all-electron, and full-potential electronic structure calculations of a solid. The method is applied to bcc Na, at low-temperature equilibrium volume. The essential steps of the method involve (i) calculating an all-electron Kohn–Sham eigenstate, (ii) replacing the oscillating part of the wave function (inside the muffin-tin spheres) of this state, with a smooth function, (iii) representing the smooth wave function in a Fourier series, and (iv) inverting the Kohn–Sham equation, to extract the pseudopotential that produces the state generated in steps i–iii. It is shown that an in situ pseudopotential can reproduce an all-electron full-potential eigenvalue up to the sixth significant digit. A comparison of the all-electron theory, in situ pseudopotential theory, and the standard nonlocal pseudopotential theory demonstrates good agreement, e.g., in the energy dispersion of the 3s band state of bcc Na.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3aphysical chemistry1 aWills, John Michael1 aAlouani, Mebarek1 aGrånäs, Oscar1 aThunström, Patrik1 aOng, Chin Shen1 aEriksson, Olle0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 June 29, v. 125, no. 27 p.15103-15111dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c047913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001800188245007300206300001800279500001500297520148900312592002801801650002001829650001001849650001701859650002501876650001601901650001801917650001701935650001401952650001301966650001501979650001501994650002202009650002402031650002602055650002502081650002102106650003302127650003702160650001102197650001202208650005102220650005102271650002802322650004002350650005102390650004302441650004402484650003802528653001302566700001802579700002202597700002002619700001902639773010102658856008102759990002302840852000902863655001202872IND60089940720221119181733.0141102e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008994072DNAL7 a239735272pmid7 aPMC38191442pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2013.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhrlich, Anna10aAllosteric peptide regulators of chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7  ap. 1263-1271.  a2019-12-06  aThe chemokine CXCL12 and its shared seven-transmembrane receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 regulate diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, autoimmunity, and HIV infection, making these molecules promising drug targets. These molecules also control key processes in normal development and physiology, suggesting the need to selectively modulate CXCR4 and/or CXCR7 functions and signaling to reduce potential complications of long-term therapy. We previously identified two peptides that functioned as allosteric agonists driving CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis, providing key structural information to design a small number of additional peptides to investigate determinants of CXCL12 interactions and signaling through CXCR4 and CXCR7. In the current study, we show that the previously identified peptides only minimally activated CXCR4 signaling through the cytosolic adapter protein β-arrestin 2 and do not initiate signaling to ERK1/2. By comparison, peptides with diverse N-terminal amino acid sequences effectively activated CXCR7 signaling to β-arrestin 2. One peptide, designated as GSLW based on its N-terminal amino acids, activated CXCR7 signaling and potentiated CXCL12-CXCR7 signaling without blocking the scavenger function of CXCR7 to internalize CXCL12. These results advance our understanding of CXCR7 ligand recognition and signaling, and provide structural information to target allosteric binding sites on this receptor as chemical probes and potential therapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3adrugs 3atherapeutics 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abinding sites 3aautoimmunity 3areceptors 3aagonists 3achemokines 3achemotaxis 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArrestinsxmetabolism 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aChemokine CXCL12xmetabolism 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHumans 2aLigands 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1xmetabolism 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3xmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Targeted Therapyxmethods 2aPeptidesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aReceptors, CXCRxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, CXCR4xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 0apeptides1 aRay, Paramita1 aLuker, Kathryn E.1 aLolis, Elias J.1 aLuker, Gary D.0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 86, no. 9 p.1263-1271dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.08.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04304naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005300139245011800192500002000310520190600330592002802236596008302264596007402347596005502421596005502476596002002531650001202551650002002563650002402583650001402607650000902621650001502630650001902645650001502664650002702679650001102706650000902717650002402726650002202750650001902772700005902791700006302850700002502913700006102938700005902999700005803058700006503116700006403181700002303245700006103268700006103329700006203390700006203452773010603514856007303620852000903693655001203702IND60746291520221118233936.0210730e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074629152DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.36442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7146-718010aSpatial turnover of multiple ecosystem functions is more associated with plant than soil microbial β‐diversity  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiodiversity—both above‐ and belowground—influences multiple functions in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, it is unclear whether differences in above‐ and belowground species composition (β‐diversity) are associated with differences in multiple ecosystem functions (e.g., spatial turnover in ecosystem function). Here, we partitioned the contributions of above‐ and belowground β‐diversity and abiotic factors (geographic distance, differences in environments) on the spatial turnover of multiple grassland ecosystem functions. We compiled a dataset of plant and soil microbial communities and six indicators of grassland ecosystem functions (i.e., plant aboveground live biomass, plant nitrogen [N], plant phosphorus [P], root biomass, soil total N, and soil extractable P) from 18 grassland sites on four continents contributing to the Nutrient Network experiment. We used Mantel tests and structural equation models to disentangle the relationship between above‐ and belowground β‐diversity and spatial turnover in grassland ecosystem functions. We found that the effects of abiotic factors on the spatial turnover of ecosystem functions were largely indirect through their influences on above‐ and belowground β‐diversity, and that spatial turnover of ecosystem function was more strongly associated with plant β‐diversity than with soil microbial β‐diversity. These results indicate that changes in above‐ and belowground species composition are one mechanism that interacts with environmental change to determine variability in multiple ecosystem functions across spatial scales. As grasslands face global threats from shrub encroachment, conversion to agriculture, or are lost to development, the functions and services they provide will more strongly converge with increased aboveground community homogenization than with soil microbial community homogenization.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSF‐DEB‐1042132cNational Science Foundation Research Coordination Network  aDG‐0001‐13cInstitute on the Environment, University of Minnesota  aNSF‐DEB‐1234162cLong Term Ecological Research  aNSF‐DEB‐1831944cLong Term Ecological Research  cCarlsbergfondet 3abiomass 3adata collection 3aecological function 3aequations 3aface 3agrasslands 3ahomogenization 3aphosphorus 3aplant nitrogen content 3ashrubs 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3aspecies diversity 3atotal nitrogen1 aPrager, Case M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9198-55861 aBorer, Elizabeth T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2259-58531 aGotelli, Nicholas J.1 aGruner, Daniel S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3153-42971 aHe, Jin‐Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5081-35691 aKirkman, Kevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9580-51911 aMacDougall, Andrew S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1869-78681 aMcCulley, Rebecca L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2393-05991 aProber, Suzanne M.1 aSeabloom, Eric W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6780-92591 aStevens, Carly J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2390-17631 aClassen, Aimée T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6741-34701 aSanders, Nathan J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6220-67310 tEcosphere.g2021 July, v. 12, no. 7 p.e03644-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.36443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245005400201500001900255500002000274520226100294592002802555596005702583650001102640650001902651650002002670650001502690650001002705650002302715650001402738650002202752650002202774650002002796651001102816651002002827651001402847651001202861700005802873700005902931700006302990700006003053700005503113773012903168856007303297852000903370655001203379IND60729533920221118181936.0210228e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072953392DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.129422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLososová, Zdeňka1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9152-746210aMacroevolutionary patterns in European vegetation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQUESTION: Habitat‐specific species pools are shaped by ecological and evolutionary processes such as speciation, extinction, and migration. However, their role is poorly known because of the lack of robust data on species pools across a large number of plant community types and large areas. Here, we analyse a unique dataset of species pools of diagnostic species for all European vegetation types, asking: (a) what are the patterns of phylogenetic structure and phylogenetic beta‐diversity across European vegetation types and biomes; (b) what are the drivers of these patterns; and (c) is there a signal of niche conservatism at the level of biomes and broad categories of vegetation types? LOCATION: Europe, Canary Islands, Madeira, Azores, Cyprus, Caucasus, Iceland and Greenland. METHODS: We built a dataset comprising 10,804 vascular plant species (almost 85% of the European flora) assigned to 106 vegetation types representing all European vegetated habitats, grouped into 11 biomes. This dataset represented habitat‐specific species pools. We analysed the phylogenetic structure of the species pools and related it to distribution range sizes of individual vegetation types, their successional status, levels of disturbance and environmental stress. RESULTS: In European vegetation, phylogenetic overdispersion is associated with late‐successional habitats: several forest types, aquatic vegetation, and rock‐cliff vegetation serve as depositories of relict lineages. In contrast, phylogenetic clustering is typical of early successional and disturbed vegetation in anthropogenic, coastal and saline habitats, and in open‐canopy Mediterranean vegetation. The phylogenetic similarity of vegetation types is higher within than between broad categories of vegetation types and biomes. CONCLUSIONS: The variable phylogenetic structure of European vegetation types is a heritage of evolutionary processes in the Tertiary and Quaternary. Habitat‐specific species pools of different vegetation types and biomes have been formed by different evolutionary processes as indicated by the observation that certain clades are significantly associated with certain vegetation types or biomes, hence indicating the phylogenetic niche conservatism.  aPublisher supplied data  aGA 18‐02773ScGrantová Agentura České Republiky 3aCyprus 3aaquatic plants 3adata collection 3aextinction 3aflora 3aniche conservatism 3aphylogeny 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3avascular plants 3aAzores 3aCaucasus region 3aGreenland 3aIceland1 aDivíšek, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5127-51301 aChytrý, Milan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8122-30751 aGötzenberger, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3040-29001 aTěšitel, Jakub1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3793-37041 aMucina, L.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0317-88860 tJournal of vegetation science.g2021 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.e12942-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.129423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001900136245012100155300001300276520160000289592002801889650001801917650001301935650001501948650001401963650001201977650002001989650001602009650002002025651001102045653001502056653001802071653001702089653000902106653002502115700001602140773011402156856007102270852000902341655001202350IND60594575120221122112952.0180625e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059457512DNAL7 a10.2984/72.1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalinski , Kim10aLoss of Reservoir Capacity through Sedimentation in Hawai‘i: Management Implications for the Twenty-First Century1  ap. 1-19.  aHawai‘i's reservoirs face increasing scrutiny due to heightened dam safety and flood control concerns, growing water demands, and uncertain water pollution effects. To promote long-term reservoir sustainability, it is vital that we improve our understanding of reservoir capacity. Because many of Hawai‘i's reservoirs are privately owned and unmonitored, the state of Hawai‘i lacks data on actual reservoir capacity. To conduct a statewide survey of reservoir capacity, we (1) collected, organized, and analyzed existing physical data characterizing reservoir capacity in the five main Hawaiian Islands; (2) interviewed reservoir managers throughout the state to assess current knowledge of reservoir capacity and its loss due to sedimentation; and (3) analyzed images to estimate available capacity and sedimentation. Results show that sedimentation is a serious concern for managers and is rarely measured and poorly documented. Approximately 79% of the total capacity of Hawai‘i's reservoirs are currently in use, and 40% of reservoirs (representing 24% of total capacity) are affected by sedimentation. Of these reservoirs, 60% are less than 1.23 million m³ (1,000 ac-ft) in size. Lack of maintenance for sediment is especially common in privately owned reservoirs. In the face of changing land use, reservoirs could be adapted for more appropriate uses in Hawai‘i, including flood control, hydropower, and recreation. Reservoir maintenance, including assessment and removal of sediments, is a critical consideration for proper stewardship of Hawai‘i's abundant water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflood control 3amanagers 3arecreation 3asediments 3asurveys 3awater pollution 3awater power 3awater resources 3aHawaii 0areservoirs 0asedimentation 0awater supply 0adams 0areservoir management1 aPenn, David0 tPacific science.g2018 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.1-19dUniversity of Hawai'i PresswJournal:19251x1534-61887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2984/72.1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001700169245012700186300001400313520210600327592002802433650001302461650001902474650001702493650002002510650001802530650001802548650001502566650002202581650001602603650001402619650002002633650002002653650001102673650001702684650002302701650002502724650001502749650001302764650002602777653001602803653002502819653002002844700001902864700001902883773009502902852000902997856011703006930003303123946001103156655001203167IND60449366320221119072023.0151031e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044936632DNAL7 a10.1658/1402-2001(2004)007[0049:IROUVT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurdon, Mark10aInitial response of understorey vegetation to fire severity and salvage-logging in the southern boreal forest of Quéébec  ap. 49-60.  aIn this study we compared the effects of fire on understorey vegetation in the Quéébec southern boreal forest with effects of salvage-logging (clear-cutting after fire). All 61 400-m² sampling sites were controlled for overstorey composition (Deciduous, Mixed and Coniferous) and disturbance type, which consisted of three fire impact severity (FIS) classes (Light, Moderate and Extreme) and two harvesting techniques (Stem-only and Whole-tree Harvesting). Percent-cover data of vegetation and post-disturbance environmental characteristics were recorded in the field during the first two years after fire as well as soil texture. Ordination of fire alone demonstrated that, on Coniferous sites, fire initiates a succession whereby the understorey Coniferous sites approaches that of Deciduous-Mixed sites, due to the release of the understorey from Sphagnum spp. dominance, this pattern being a function of FIS. On Deciduous-Mixed stands, increased FIS resulted in a transition from herb to shrub dominance. Ordination of all five disturbance types showed that the impact of salvage-logging on understorey composition was within the range of fire, but marginalized to the extreme end of the FIS spectrum. Variance partitioning demonstrated that overstorey and soil texture were the most important explanatory variables of fire alone, while disturbance type explained the largest independent fraction of understorey variation when salvage-logging was introduced. Salvage-logging also results in significant reductions in understorey abundance, richness and diversity, while indicator species analysis suggests that it favours meso-xerophytic to xeric species. Results are interpreted in light of shade-tolerance dynamics, forest floor disturbance and soil moisture regimes. Implications for sustainable forest management are discussed.Nomenclature: Marie-Victorin (1995).Abbreviations: CON == Coniferous site; DEC == Deciduous site: FIS == Fire impact severity; FIS-1 == Light FIS; FIS-2 == Moderate FIS; FIS-3; Extreme FIS; MIX == Mixed site; STEM == stem-harvesting; WTH == whole-tree harvesting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3aboreal forests 3aclearcutting 3adisturbed soils 3afire severity 3aforest litter 3aharvesting 3aindicator species 3amethodology 3aoverstory 3asalvage logging 3ashade tolerance 3ashrubs 3asoil texture 3asoil water regimes 3asustainable forestry 3aunderstory 3avariance 3awhole tree harvesting 0aDisturbance 0aEcosystem management 0aShade tolerance1 aBrais, Suzanne1 aBergeron, Yves0 tApplied vegetation science.g2004 Feb., v. 7, no. 1 p.49-60dOpulus Pressx1402-20017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1402-2001%282004%29007%5B0049%3AIROUVT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  a20050509b20050604c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02682naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245010000210300001800310500001900328520132300347592002801670650001501698650001601713650001401729650001401743650001201757700001701769700002101786700006201807700005901869700001801928700002001946700006001966700005702026773012002083856008402203852000902287655001202296IND60699881520210903000000.0200623e20200612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069988152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c008782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaque, M.

Studying the molecular mechanism of tough and anisotropic hydrogel under deformation is beneficial to understand the load-deformation functions of soft bio-tissues. In this work, the deformation-induced structure transformation of a macroscopically anisotropic and tough hydrogel has been investigated to understand the role of structure evolution for enhanced toughness. At rest, the hydrogel possesses a well-defined hierarchical structure in which self-assembled nanometer thick lamellar bilayers are alternatively stacked in hundred nanometer thick hydrogel matrixes. Stretching along the lamellar direction induces structure transformation from lamellar bilayers to hierarchical fibrous structures aligned along the deformation axis. The generated hierarchical structures consist of micrometer thick fiber bundles made from nanometer thick fibrils analogous to tropo-collagen bundles or microfibrils of the tendon. The fibrous structure formed at large elongation is associated with damage and rupture of the bilayers, which underpins the molecular mechanism of the unique mechanical behaviors of the tough lamellar hydrogel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3adeformation 3aevolution 3ahydrogels 3aphotons1 aCui, Kunpeng1 aShauqī, Ilyās,1 aKurokawa, Takayuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6834-684X1 aMarcellan, Alba1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5098-48351 aBrulet, Annie1 aTakahashi, Riku1 aNakajima, Tasuku1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2235-34781 aGong, J.

The present research aimed to examine profiles of PGI2 synthase (PTGIS) and PGI2 receptor (PTGIR) expression and 6-keto PGF1α (a PGI2 metabolite) concentrations in the myometrium of gilts throughout the estrous cycle and during early pregnancy using qPCR, Western blot, and/or ELISA methods. Furthermore, myometrial explants were exposed to iloprost (a stable PGI2 analog) to investigate the effect of PGI2 on the mRNA expression of factors engaged in smooth muscle contraction, nutrient transport, prostaglandin synthesis and action, and inflammatory response. PTGIS mRNA expression was greater in cyclic than in pregnant gilts on days 11–12 after estrus and was accompanied by greater concentrations of 6-keto PGF1α detected in cyclic than in pregnant animals on days 11–20. Iloprost stimulated fatty acid transporters and contractility-related calponin 1 and caldesmon 1 mRNA expression and decreased interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor transcript abundance. The obtained results indicate a physiologically relevant role of PGI2 during the estrous cycle in the porcine myometrium with its importance for regulating the expression of contractility-, nutrient transport- and inflammatory response-related factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aestrus 3afatty acids 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3ainterleukins 3ametabolites 3amuscle contraction 3amyometrium 3anutrient transport 3apregnancy 3aprostacyclin 3aprostaglandin-I synthase 3asmooth muscle 3aswine 3atumor necrosis factors1 aLuba, Mateusz 1 aSzymańska, Magdalena,0 tAnimals.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 12, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121722373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01529naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245005400173520046600227592002800693650001100721650002000732650002200752650001500774651001900789653000800808653000800816653000800824653001900832653002200851653001800873653001700891653002100908700001300929700001800942773008800960856008601048852000901134655001201143IND60659332420221117054424.0190822e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065933242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2019.1086242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhamed, M.

The findings suggest that policymakers’ emphasis on achieving diversity on the corporate board may also help improve equality in pay.  aPublisher supplied data 3agender 3ahuman resources 3asocial inequality 3awage rates 3aUnited Kingdom 0aG30 0aJ31 0aJ33 0aGender pay gap 0aBoard nationality 0aBritish firms 0aPay equality 0aBoard governance1 aWen, Jie1 aGupta, Namita0 tEconomics letters.g2019 Nov., v. 184dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2019.1086243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03778naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245008800204500001900292500002000311520189600331592002802227650001402255650003002269650001302299650002102312650001502333651001002348700006202358700006102420700006102481700006102542700005602603700006002659700006002719700005802779700006402837700007402901700006002975700001603035700005803051773012903109856007303238852000903311655001203320IND60729534020221118182933.0210228e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072953402DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.129532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiarucci, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1160-235X10aHabitat type and island identity as drivers of community assembly in an archipelago  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Ecoinformatics offer new opportunity to test islands as biogeographic and ecological models. In this paper we predicted three hypotheses: (1) plot‐based data issuing from vegetation surveys can be used to predict Island Species‐Area Relationships (ISARs) or island similarity; (2) the habitat area is an independent predictor of species richness patterns within island; (3) species richness and composition are more dependent on habitat type than island identity in land‐bridge islands. AREA: Tuscan Archipelago, Italy. METHODS: We assembled a database of all the vegetation plots available for the archipelago. For the first hypothesis we calculated ISARs, using Arrhenius model, and Beta Diversity, using Jaccard dissimilarity, on both published floras and cumulative plot data. For the second hypothesis, we modelled Habitat Species‐Area Relationships (HSARs), using Arrhenius model. For the third hypothesis, we used additive partitioning of species richness, NMDS and PERMANOVA. RESULTS: Island Species‐Area Relationships based on plot data mirrored those on published floras, but absolute values of c and z parameters were different. Beta diversity based on plot data resembled those of published floras, but was higher. Species richness was significantly related to the habitat area. The total species richness of the archipelago was linked to large scale drivers, such as island identity, while plot species composition was driven by both habitat type and island identity. CONCLUSIONS: Data assembled issuing from vegetation surveys are useful to describe biogeographic patterns. Species richness in the archipelago is driven by spatial factors such as the amount of habitats and the differences among islands, while the species composition of local assemblages is largely driven by habitat filters rather than by island identity, as expected in land‐bridge islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3aspecies richness 3avegetation 3aItaly1 aBuldrini, Fabrizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0376-67601 aCervellini, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0853-23301 aGuarino, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0106-94161 aCaccianiga, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9715-18301 aFoggi, Bruno1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6451-40251 aViciani, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3422-59991 aLazzaro, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0514-07931 aCasella, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2550-30101 aAngelini, Pierangela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5321-97571 aCerabolini, Bruno Enrico Leone1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3793-07331 aPasta, Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3265-90721 aEnea, Mirko1 aZannini, Piero1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2466-44020 tJournal of vegetation science.g2021 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.e12953-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.129533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003700150245009500187500001900282520163700301592002801938650001201966650002001978650001401998650000902012650001702021650001502038650001402053650001602067650000902083651001302092651001102105653002002116653002802136653002902164653002602193653002602219700003902245700002002284700002602304700002702330700003102357700002402388700003302412700003502445773010702480856008502587852000902672655001202681IND60698553520221120150105.0200819e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069855352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1149692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza Neto, Hamilton Ferreira de10aEnvironmental and human health risks of arsenic in gold mining areas in the eastern Amazon  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKnowledge of arsenic (As) levels in gold (Au) mining areas in the Amazon is critical for determining environmental risks and the health of the local population, mainly because this region has the largest mineral potential in Brazil and one of the largest in the world. The objective of this study was to assess the environmental and human health risks of As in tailings from Au exploration in the eastern Amazon. Samples were collected from soils and tailings from different exploration forms from 25 points, and the total concentration, pollution indexes and human health risk were determined. Concentrations of As were very high in all exploration areas, especially in tailings, whose maximum value reached 10,000 mg kg⁻¹, far above the investigation value established by the Brazilian National Council of the Environment, characterizing a polluted area with high environmental risk. Exposure based on the daily intake of As demonstrated a high health risk for children and adults, whose non-carcinogenic risk indexes of 17.8, extremely above the acceptable limit (1.0) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. High levels of As in reactive fractions in underground, cyanidation, and colluvium mining areas, as well as extremely high gastric and intestinal bioaccessibility were found, suggesting that high levels may be absorbed by the local population. The results show that the study area is highly polluted through Au mining activities, putting the environment and population health at risk, and that there is an urgent need for intervention by the environmental control agencies for remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3acolluvium 3agold 3ahuman health 3aintestines 3apollution 3aremediation 3arisk 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aRisk assessment 0aEnvironmental pollution 0aArsenic bioaccessibility 0aArsenic fractionation 0aArsenic contamination1 aPereira, Wendel Valter da Silveira1 aDias, Yan Nunes1 aSouza, Edna Santos de1 aTeixeira, Renato Alves1 aLima, Mauricio Willians de1 aRamos, Silvio Junio1 aAmarante, Cristine Bastos do1 aFernandes, Antônio Rodrigues,0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Oct., v. 265 p.114969-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1149693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245011100176300001800287500001400305520105000319592002801369650002201397650000801419650002101427650002101448650001801469650002601487650001201513650000901525650003301534700005901567773011801626856008301744852000901827655001201836IND60718332820210317000000.0201124e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071833282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.0c006662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Rozières, Cyrus M.10aInfluenza A Virus NS1 Protein Binds as a Dimer to RNA-Free PABP1 but Not to the PABP1·Poly(A) RNA Complex  ap. 4439-4448.  aNAL-light  aInfluenza A virus (IAV) is a highly contagious human pathogen that is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a crucial protein expressed by IAV to evade the host immune system. Additionally, NS1 has been proposed to stimulate translation because of its ability to bind poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G. We analyzed the interaction of NS1 with PABP1 using quantitative techniques. Our studies show that NS1 binds as a homodimer to PABP1, and this interaction is conserved across different IAV strains. Unexpectedly, NS1 does not bind to PABP1 that is bound to poly(A) RNA. Instead, NS1 binds only to PABP1 free of RNA, suggesting that stimulation of translation does not occur by NS1 interacting with the PABP1 molecule attached to the mRNA 3′-poly(A) tail. These results suggest that the function of the NS1·PABP1 complex appears to be distinct from the classical role of PABP1 in translation initiation, when it is bound to the 3′-poly(A) tail of mRNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRNA 3aanimal pathogens 3abinding proteins 3aimmune system 3aquantitative analysis 3astrains 3atail 3aviral nonstructural proteins1 aJoseph, Simpson1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0552-82210 tBiochemistry.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 59, no. 46 p.4439-4448dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c006663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245009100180500002200271520067800293592002800971650002000999650001801019650001201037653000701049653000701056653001701063653001301080653001001093653001501103653002101118700002501139700002501164773008501189856008601274852000901360655001201369IND60659332620221117054652.0190822e20190819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065933262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2019.1086302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnagnostidis, Panagiotis10aMarket quality and dark trading in the post MiFID II era: What have we learned so far?  aPre-press version  aIn this letter, we use the implementation of the Dark Volume Cap (DVC) Rule on 12∕03∕2018 for the suspension of European securities from dark trading as a natural laboratory to investigate the effect of dark pools on lit market price quality. We empirically demonstrate that the DVC rule has led to an increase of lit price volatility for suspended securities, while it has induced significant lit price inefficiencies for non-suspended securities. Our results suggest that the adverse effects of the DVC rule on lit market price quality are likely to be driven by the migration of a considerable fraction of small and uniformed traders from the dark to the lit market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3amarket prices 3amarkets 0aG1 0aG2 0aDark trading 0aMiFID II 0aChi-X 0aVolatility 0aPrice efficiency1 aPapachristou, George1 aVarsakelis, Christos0 tEconomics letters.g2019 Aug. 19, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2019.1086303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016300170300001600333520176600349592002802115650001702143650001302160650001402173650001702187650001802204650001302222650000902235650001302244650001902257650000902276650002402285650004802309650002702357650002702384653003702411653001602448653002102464653001302485653001902498653001802517700001602535700001202551700001602563773011602579856008602695852000902781655001202790IND60112559920221121190532.0190410e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011255992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2013.01.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Chuan-He10aTransglutaminase-set soy globulin-stabilized emulsion gels: Influence of soy β-conglycinin/glycinin ratio on properties, microstructure and gelling mechanism  ap. 804-812.  aSoy protein-stabilized emulsions or emulsion gels have recently attracted increasing interests in the research of food science. However, the importance of protein composition on the properties and microstructure of the formed emulsion gels is little understood. This paper investigated the influence of varying glycinin/β-conglycinin ratio on the properties, microstructure and gelling mechanism of soy globulin-stabilized emulsion gels, at a constant total protein concentration and oil fraction (6%, w/v, and 0.3), induced by microbial transglutaminase (MTGase; 20U per gram of protein). The enzyme incubation resulted in the gelation of all soy globulin-stabilized emulsions, but the rheological properties, water holding capacity (WHC) and microstructure of the formed emulsion gels considerably varied with glycinin content in the globulin mixtures. Basically, increasing the glycinin content progressively increased the gel stiffness, but significantly decreased the WHC. Confocal laser scanning microscopic observations showed that increasing glycinin content led to the formation of emulsion gel network with a more inhomogenous and porous microstructure. The improvement of the gel stiffness by increasing glycinin content was largely associated with the enhanced flocculation of oil droplets, more proteins entrapped within the network, as well as more importance of covalent cross-links for the gel network at higher glycinin contents. The results confirmed that the properties of MTGase-set soy protein-stabilized emulsion gels can be well modulated by varying the protein composition. The findings are of important relevance for the development of cold-set soy protein-stabilized emulsion gels with targeted properties in the food or other fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aflocculation 3afood research 3agelation 3agels 3aglycinin 3amicrostructure 3aoils 3aprotein composition 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3arheological properties 3awater holding capacity 0aProtein-stabilized emulsion gels 0aSoy protein 0aTransglutaminase 0aGlycinin 0aβ-Conglycinin 0aCold gelation1 aLuo, Li-Jun1 aLiu, Fu1 aChen, Zhong0 tFood research international.g2013 May, v. 51, no. 2 p.804-812dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2013.01.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245012300165300001600288520094300304592002801247650002801275650001301303650001401316650001501330653003601345653004001381653002201421653006301443653002601506700001901532700002301551700001601574773013701590856007701727852000901804655001201813IND60521701420221122043352.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052170142DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1983-04052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaudler, Marianne10aBeiträge zur Chemie des Phosphors, 125/Synthese und Struktur der Triorganyl-nonaphosphane(3) P9(i-Pr)3 und P9 (t-Bu)3  ap. 428-433.  aThe triorganyl-nonaphosphanes(3) P₉(i-Pr)3 (1) and P₉(t-Bu)3 (2) have been obtained by reacting (i-PrP)₄ with PCl₃ and by dehalogenating a mixture of t-BuPCl₂ and PCl₃ with magnesium, respectively. In the case of P₉Et₃ (3) and P₉Me₃ (4) the latter reaction may be modified by using the organyl-cyclophosphanes (PR)ₙ instead of RPCl₂. P₇R₃ as well as other polycyclic organylphosphanes are formed as by-products. 1 could be isolated in pure form and 2 has been concentrated in the product mixture. According to their ³¹P{¹H}-NMR spectra 1-4 possess a P₉ skeleton analogous to that of the hydrocarbon deltacyclane. 1 and 2 are formed as mixtures of two configurational isomers, which differ in the spatial arrangements of the substituent on P⁵. The results clearly indicate, that the corresponding phosphorus hydride P₉H₃ has the same structure and is a tetracyclo[4.3.0.0²,⁴.0³,⁷]nonaphosphane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfigurational isomers 3ahydrides 3amagnesium 3aphosphorus 0aTriisopropyl -nonaphosphane (3) 0aTri -tert-butyl -nonapliosphane (3) 0aNonaphosphane (3) 0a5,8,9-Triorganyl-tetracyclo[4.3.0.02,4.03,7]nonaphosphanes 0aPolycyclic Phosphanes1 aAktalay, Yusuf1 aKazmierczak, Karin1 aHahn, Josef0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 38, no. 4 p.428-433dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1983-04053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245013000164300001600294520200700310592002802317650002002345650002502365650001102390650001702401650001902418650002402437650001502461650003002476650001002506650001902516650001102535650002302546650001402569650000902583650001802592650001002610651001702620653002402637700002002661700002302681700002602704700001802730700002002748700001902768773013902787856007802926852000903004655001203013IND60676819020221119023059.0200211e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067681902DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2019.24932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocco, Joseph M.10aHigher Prevalence of Babesia microti than Borrelia burgdorferi in Small Mammal Species in Central Pennsylvania, United States  ap. 151-154.  aBabesia microti can lead to severe babesiosis in immunosuppressed populations, but due to high numbers of asymptomatic cases, clinical reporting is unable to define its geographic distribution. Although Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is endemic throughout Pennsylvania (PA), human babesiosis is under recognized, despite sharing the same vector and primary reservoir host. Ixodes ticks are known to carry B. microti throughout PA, but information about pathogen prevalence in small mammal reservoirs remains limited. Characterizing B. microti prevalence in these small mammals can elucidate mechanisms of pathogen spread and define geographic areas where humans are at risk of infection. We tested 692 small mammals across eight contiguous counties in central PA for molecular evidence of B. microti and B. burgdorferi. In total, six different small mammal species were collected. The overall prevalence of B. microti was 32% with similar rates observed across all counties. Surprisingly, this was higher than the prevalence of B. burgdorferi at 21%. In fact, high rates of B. microti were found in all six species, and both pathogens were identified in 11% of mammals tested. The prevalence of B. microti was highest in Myodes gapperi (southern red-backed vole) at 39% despite Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) being considered the primary reservoir host for B. microti. In conclusion, B. microti has a high prevalence across multiple small mammal species throughout central PA. This prevalence is greater than B. burgdorferi despite a much higher incidence of Lyme disease compared to babesiosis in PA. Although it remains unknown how the prevalence of B. microti in small mammal hosts corresponds to human infection rates, the high pathogen prevalence of B. microti suggests that it is an emerging pathogen in this area. Currently, babesiosis is not a reportable disease in PA, and additional studies are warranted to evaluate its clinical significance in this geographic region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia microti 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aIxodes 3aLyme disease 3aMyodes gapperi 3aPeromyscus leucopus 3ababesiosis 3ageographical distribution 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3anotifiable disease 3apathogens 3arisk 3asmall mammals 3aticks 3aPennsylvania 0atick-borne diseases1 aRegan, Kevin M.1 aLarkin, Jeffery L.1 aEichelberger, Charlie1 aWisgo, Joseph1 aNealen, Paul M.1 aIrani, Vida R.0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 20, no. 2 p.151-154dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2019.24933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245014300171300001600314500001900330500002000349520132800369592002801697650001601725650001201741650001301753650001501766650005201781650000901833650001501842650001101857700001501868700001801883700001401901700001701915700001901932700001801951700001701969773011801986856008802104852000902192655001202201IND60734373120221119080656.0210417e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073437312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04227.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chuang10aFunctional characterization of the rice SPX‐MFS family reveals a key role of OsSPX‐MFS1 in controlling phosphate homeostasis in leaves  ap. 139-148.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Proteins possessing the SPX domain are found in several proteins involved in inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport and signalling in yeast and plants. Although the functions of several SPX‐domain protein subfamilies have recently been uncovered, the role of the SPX‐MFS subfamily is still unclear. • Using quantitative RT‐PCR analysis, we studied the regulation of SPX‐MFS gene expression by the central regulator, OsPHR2 and Pi starvation. The function of OsSPX‐MFS1 in Pi homeostasis was analysed using an OsSPX‐MFS1 mutant (mfs1) and osa‐miR827 overexpression line (miR827‐Oe). Finally, heterologous complementation of a yeast mutant impaired in Pi transporter was used to assess the capacity of OsSPX‐MFS1 to transport Pi. • Transcript analyses revealed that members of the SPX‐MFS family were mainly expressed in the shoots, with OsSPX‐MFS1 and OsSPX‐MFS3 being suppressed by Pi deficiency, while OsSPX‐MFS2 was induced. Mutation in OsSPX‐MFS1 (mfs1) and overexpression of the upstream miR827 (miR827‐Oe) plants impaired Pi homeostasis in the leaves. In addition, studies in yeast revealed that OsSPX‐MFS1 may be involved in Pi transport. • The results suggest that OsSPX‐MFS1 is a key player in maintaining Pi homeostasis in the leaves, potentially acting as a Pi transporter.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahomeostasis 3amutants 3amutation 3aphosphates 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3astarvation 3ayeasts1 aHuang, Wei1 aYing, Yinghui1 aLi, Shuai1 aSecco, David1 aTyerman, Steve1 aWhelan, James1 aShou, Huixia0 tnew phytologist.g2012 Oct., v. 196, no. 1 p.139-148dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04227.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245015700177300001600334520149300350592002801843650000901871650002401880650001701904650001701921650001601938650001901954653002401973653003401997653002702031653002802058653002502086700006202111773011302173856008602286852000902372655001202381IND60616250420221119093402.0210114e20190110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061625042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.2482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmudam, Yaswanthkumar10aInfluence of thermal energy storage system on flow and performance parameters of solar updraft tower power plant: A three dimensional numerical analysis  ap. 136-152.  aA 3D numerical model is developed for solar updraft tower to identify the effect of thermal energy storage system. Flow parameters such as temperature, velocity, pressure, and density are estimated, analyzed and compared for 2 different models, model - 1 (without thermal energy storage) and model −2 (with thermal storage). The collector diameter of 3.5 m, chimney height of 6 m, chimney diameter of 0.6 m, inlet gap of 0.15 m, slope of the collector 30° are the dimensions considered for model - 1. Model – 2 consists of the same dimensions of model – 1 with additional thermal energy storage system. Sand-rock mixture is considered as energy storage material and it has the thickness of 0.15 m and diameter of 3.5 m. Numerical simulations are performed under steady state condition for both the models at various times (10.00 a.m., noon, 1.00 p.m., 2.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.) in a day and for model – 2 up to 8.00 p.m. Results are compared with experimental and theoretical data from literature and found that the results are matching. Performance parameters such as power output, collector efficiency and overall efficiency of system were estimated and it was found that the values of model – 2 are lower because of heat stored by thermal storage device. Maximum power output for both models (79.92 W for model – 1 and 63.8 W for model – 2) was obtained at 1.00 p.m. The addition of thermal storage system enhanced the plant operation time till 8.00 p.m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat 3amathematical models 3apower plants 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3athermal energy 0aSolar updraft tower 0aThermal energy storage system 0aPerformance parameters 0aNumerical heat transfer 0aMaximum power output1 aChandramohan, V.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8680-83630 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 10, v. 207 p.136-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.2483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245009900153300001800252520103100270592002801301650001201329650001301341650001401354650002101368650001701389650001801406650001401424650001701438650001101455650001101466700002001477700001601497700001801513700002001531773010401551856007501655852000901730655001201739IND60534077620221116184025.0160802e20130418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053407762DNAL7 a10.1021/ef302166q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aHydrodeoxygenation of Dibenzofuran over Mesoporous Silica COK-12 Supported Palladium Catalysts  ap. 2209-2217.  aHydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of dibenzofuran (DBF) with only a hydrogenation (HYD) reaction route was conducted on Pd/COK-12 catalysts with different Pd loadings, which were prepared by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition of [Pd(C₃H₅)(C₅H₅)] onto mesoporous silica COK-12. Hydrogenated intermediates with partial or full hydrogenation of the benzene ring were studied in detail. The presence of cycloketones is due to the high selectivity of Pd-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of phenols derived from the C–O bond cleavage of hydrogenated intermediates. The reaction only goes through the HYD reaction route with hardly detected biphenyl, which is further confirmed by HDO of 2-phenylphenol. The increase of Pd loading on the catalysts largely promotes the deoxygenation of saturated oxygen-containing species from hydrogenation of DBF, followed by cleavage of the sp³ C–O bond. Finally, a detailed reaction network of HDO of DBF is proposed according to the detected hydrogenated species and cycloketones.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3abiphenyl 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3adibenzofuran 3ahydrogenation 3apalladium 3aporous media 3asilica 3avapors1 aZhang, Mingming1 aZhang, Miao1 aSha, Guangyan1 aLiang, Changhai0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Apr. 18, v. 27, no. 4 p.2209-2217dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef302166q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245006300179300001800242500000900260500001500269520138600284592002801670650001401698650001401712650001601726650001401742650002401756650001901780650002201799650003301821650002101854650002201875650001301897651002101910653001001931700001801941700004601959773012402005852000902129856009802138655001202236IND2048594320221121002251.0191122e199509  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204859432DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500050035x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, D.

Koch) improvement. Complete evaluation and utilization of the almost 7000 accessions will be protracted. In the interim, new accessions will be acquired. Previous studies showed that Turkish accessions of A. sterilis exhibited a broad array of isozyme phenotypes found in the wild collection and in over 400 cultivated accessions. The objectives of this research were (i) to determine if recent Turkish acquisitions of A. sterilis (Forsberg-Simons collections of 1986) have contributed additional isozyme variation to that already in storage and (ii) to illustrate relationships among Turkish A. sterilis and cultivated germplasm. Zymogram phenotypes of 341 A. sterilis and 405 cultivated samples were recorded for 13 enzyme systems. The ll5-plant sample from the Forsberg-Simons collection included six phenotypes not previously observed in Turkish accessions in the NSG collection. Cluster analysis suggested that approximately 40% of the Forsberg-Simons acquisitions differed from much of the existing NSG Turkish accessions. Both local and regional diversity occurred within A. sterilis germplasm. Isozyme patterns in cultivated germplasm were most similar to collections of A. sterilis with a wide geographical distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm 3acultivars 3awild plants 3aphenotype 3aenzyme polymorphism 3aAvena sterilis 3aplant collections 3aprincipal component analysis 3acluster analysis 3agenetic variation 3aisozymes 3aTurkey (country) 0alines1 aMurphy, J.

Here, we tested for higher-level effects of individual behaviour in the structuring of intertidal populations of two competing ecosystem engineering species. We used the partial habitat segregation exhibited by co-occurring indigenous (Perna perna) and invasive (Mytilus galloprovincialis) mussels in South Africa to test for possible attraction of different size classes of recruits to conspecific adults, using a combination of field and laboratory studies. Each of the two species dominates a particular height on the shore with overlap in the mid-mussel zone, but measurements of settlement and recruitment in the field partially refuted previous findings, generally showing no within-shore pattern of zonation of settlers and recruits. At smaller scales, recruits of both species were found more frequently on adults of Mytilus in natural beds where adults coexist in mixed-species populations. Finally, the results of laboratory choice experiments showed that recruits of all sizes responded to adult cues by movement, but that the smallest recruits showed only minimal movement and never reached adults; only large recruits of Perna responded positively to conspecific Perna adults. This study emphasises how observations made at different scales, from shore (among sites) to mussel bed (within shores), to the individual (field and laboratory), can produce different, or even contrasting, information, highlighting how behavioural traits, like attraction to conspecifics, can differ within the same group of organisms (congeneric species) and change ontogenetically within a species. Incorporating fine-scale responses makes predictions of population dynamics more complex, but identifying the relative strengths of mechanisms that lead to patterns of distribution is necessary for understanding higher-level interactions within a system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aPerna perna 3aadults 3aecosystem engineering 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3amussels 3aontogeny 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3aSouth Africa1 aMcQuaid, Christopher D.1 aErlandsson, Johan0 tMarine biology.g2016 July, v. 163, no. 7 p.157-157dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-016-2932-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002600192245008500218300001800303506007600321520076600397592002801163506003701191650001701228650001701245650001701262650001301279650002001292650001701312650001301329650002801342650002501370650001701395650002401412700001501436700002201451773009101473856008501564852000901649655001201658IND60098348020221207081536.0141104e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009834802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2011.03.0352doi7 aPMC31535572pmcid7 a214209622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Almeida, Denise E.10aNew insights into the functional role of the rheumatoid arthritis shared epitope  ap. 3619-3626.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe shared epitope (SE) – an HLA-DRB1-encoded 5-amino acid sequence motif carried by the vast majority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients – is a risk factor for severe disease. The mechanistic basis of RA-SE association is unknown. This group has previously demonstrated that the SE acts as a signal transduction ligand that activates nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production. SE-activated signaling depends on cell surface calreticulin, a known innate immunity receptor previously implicated in immune regulation, autoimmunity and angiogenesis. Recent evidence that the SE enhances the polarization of Th17 cells, which is a key mechanism in autoimmunity, is discussed highlighting one of several potential functional effects of the SE in RA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3aautoimmunity 3acalreticulin 3aepitopes 3ainnate immunity 3anitric oxide 3apatients 3areactive oxygen species 3arheumatoid arthritis 3arisk factors 3asignal transduction1 aLing, Song1 aHoloshitz, Joseph0 tFEBS letters.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 585, no. 23 p.3619-3626dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245010100211300001400312520113900326592002801465650002201493650001301515650001201528650001101540650001701551650001401568650001101582650001901593650001101612653001201623653001101635653001401646653001401660653001701674700001501691773011201706856008601818852000901904655001201913IND60628432720221123041114.0190425e20190405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062843272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.12.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCumbul Altay, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3739-751812aA novel way of using pyrolytic gas derived from waste rubber: Pyrometallurgical reduction of NiO  ap. 77-82.  aIn the present study, a novel way of using pyrolytic gas generated by the pyrolysis of waste rubber was introduced. The method involves reduction of metal oxides by pyrolytic gas. The pyrometallurgical reduction behavior of NiO was studied to demonstrate the feasibility of the process. The rubber pyrolysis and the NiO reduction experiments were carried out in a horizontal tube at 1000 K using Ar as carrier gas. It was determined that the waste rubber was completely pyrolyzed in Ar flow. The extent of NiO reduction was investigated as a function of mass ratio of rubber to NiO (0–7.345). X-ray diffraction and mass measurements revealed that single-phase Ni was obtained at the ratio of 0.734. Complete reduction of NiO to Ni was predicted at the lower mass ratios by thermodynamics. The quantitative discrepancy between the thermodynamics and the experiments was discussed. Thermodynamic analysis of the Ni-O-C-H-Ar system indicated that NiO was reduced to Ni by the gaseous species (essentially H2, CH4, C6H6) at 1000 K. The novel route presented here may be extended to the reduction of other materials using waste rubber.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3apyrolysis 3arubber 3athermodynamics 3awastes 0aRecycle 0aRubber 0aPyrolysis 0aReduction 0aNickel oxide1 aEroglu, S.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Apr. 05, v. 367 p.77-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.12.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007700165300001600242520196300258592002802221650002402249650002302273650001602296650001102312650001402323650001302337650001802350650001102368650001502379650000902394650001902403650003002422650003102452650002002483650001402503650002302517650002302540650001702563650001702580650001202597650001502609653001702624653003202641653002302673653002902696653001702725700003802742773011602780856008602896852000902982655001202991IND60112560120221119051703.0190410e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011256012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2013.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lan10aTexture measurement approaches in fresh and processed foods — A review  ap. 823-835.  aKnowledge of textural properties is important for stakeholders in the food value chain including producers, postharvest handlers, processors, marketers and consumers. For fresh foods such as fruit and vegetable, textural properties such as firmness are widely used as indices of readiness to harvest (maturity) to meet requirements for long term handling, storage and acceptability by the consumer. For processed foods, understanding texture properties is important for the control of processing operations such as heating, frying and drying to attain desired quality attributes of the end product. Texture measurement is therefore one of the most common techniques and procedures in food and postharvest research and industrial practice. Various approaches have been used to evaluate the sensory attributes of texture in foods. However, the high cost and time consumption of organizing panelists and preparing food limit their use, and often, sensory texture evaluation is applied in combination with instrumental measurement. Objective tests using a wide range of instruments are the most widely adopted approaches to texture measurement. Texture measurement instruments range from simple hand-held devices to the Instron machine and texture analyzer which provide time-series data of product deformation thereby allowing a wide range of texture attributes to be calculated from force–time or force–displacement data. In recent times, the application of novel and emerging non-invasive technologies such as near-infrared spectroscopy and hyper-spectral imaging to measure texture attributes has increased in both fresh and processed foods. Increasing demand for rapid, cost-effective and non-invasive measurement of texture remains a challenge in the food industry. The relationships between sensory evaluation and instrumental measurement of food texture are also discussed, which shows the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer acceptance 3acost effectiveness 3adeformation 3adrying 3aequipment 3afirmness 3afood industry 3afrying 3aharvesting 3aheat 3aimage analysis 3aminimally processed foods 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anutritive value 3araw foods 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3atexture 3avegetables 0aFood texture 0aNon-destructive measurement 0aSensory evaluation 0aTexture profile analysis 0aFood quality1 aOpara, U.

Dark Fenton reduces 61% of sludge in 90 min under the optimized Fe (II) and H₂O₂ dosage of 0.008 g/g suspended solids (SS) and 0.032 g/g SS respectively at pH 3. Combination of dark Fenton with disperser (DFD) reduces time required for the treatment from 90 to 30 min with the disperser specific energy input of 835.536 kJ/kg total solids (TS). At 30 min reaction time, mixed liquor suspended solids and total chemical oxygen demand reduction were found to be 65% and 60%, respectively for DFD. The efficiency of DFD treatment revealed best fit with R² value of 0.989 during pseudo first order kinetic analysis. The synergistic effect of DFD resulted in 29% higher MLSS reduction and 31% higher TCOD reduction than dark Fenton (DF) in 30 min treatment as the obtained MLSS and TCOD reduction at 30 min treatment time was observed to be 65% and 60% in DFD and 36% and 29% in DF, respectively. Although, DFD demands higher energy input (233.69 kWh), it had potency to reduce higher solids concentration in a short duration and this results in a net profit of 12.852 USD/ton of sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3akinetics 3apH 3asludge 3aspecific energy 3atotal solids 0aWaste activated sludge 0aDark fenton 0aDisperser 0aSludge reduction 0aCost analysis1 aGodvin Sharmila, V.1 aGayathri devi, M.1 aAdish Kumar, S.1 aKumar, Gopalakrishnan1 aNguyen, Dinh Duc1 aDattatraya Saratale, Ganesh0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 10, v. 207 p.261-270dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.2523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013600164300001600300520127100316592002801587650001101615650001501626650002601641650001101667650001201678650001001690650001201700650001101712650001901723653002201742653003201764653001101796653001701807653002701824700001801851700001201869700001701881773009001898856008501988852000902073655001202082IND60629129620221119114533.0190913e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062912962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Zihe13aAn experimental study on combustion performance and flame spread characteristics over liquid diesel and ethanol-diesel blended fuel  ap. 349-355.  aEthanol has gradually become a commonly used additive in diesel to reduce the carbon foot print of the combustion products. In the process of production, transportation and storage, once the accidental leaked ethanol-diesel blend fuel is ignited, the flame will spread very fast and cause great threaten to people's lives and properties, the combustion properties of ethanol-diesel blends is thus a matter of great concern to us. A set of experiments was conducted to study the effects of fuel depth and ullage height on liquid flame spread of diesel and 5% ethanol-diesel. Results showed that as the fuel depth increases under ullage effect, the flame spread rate increases first and then maintain constant. For 5% ethanol-diesel, the flame spread rate decreases monotonously and then tends to be unchanged with ullage height due to the higher combustion efficiency and oxygen content of ethanol-diesel. For deep pools, the surface velocity increases with fuel depth. Moreover, the flash flame pulsation frequency is weakly affected by the fuel depth and presents a negative relationship with ullage height. The study on these issues may have the potential to benefit the current safety production, utilization and management of the energy of ethanol-diesel blends.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acombustion 3acombustion efficiency 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afuels 3aliquids 3aoxygen 3atransportation 0aEnergy management 0aEthanol-diesel blended fuel 0aDiesel 0aFlame spread 0aCombustion performance1 aLin, Shenghui1 aJi, Jie1 aLi, Mengyuan0 tEnergy.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 170 p.349-355dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245009900173300001600272500001500288520138900303592002801692650000901720650001701729650002601746650001601772650001401788650002201802650001001824650001301834650001601847650001001863653001501873653001701888653001301905700002301918700002201941700002001963700002001983700002002003773009602023856004802119852000902167655001202176IND4475644820221118142315.0120328e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447564482DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293120300392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobrovol’skaya, T.

Distinct differences in these characteristics were revealed. The microbial biomass in the high-moor peat exceeded that in the low-moor peat by 2–9 times. Fungi predominated in the high-moor peat, whereas bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in the low-moor peat. The micromycetal complexes of the high-moor peat were characterized by a high portion of dark-colored representatives; the complexes of the low-moor peat were dominated by fast-growing fungi. The species of the Penicillum genus were dominant in the high-moor peat; the species of Trichoderma were abundant in the low-moor peat. In the former, the bacteria were distinguished as minor components; in the latter, they predominated in the saprotrophic bacterial complex. In the high-moor peat, the microorganisms were represented by bacilli, while, in the low-moor peat, by cytophages, myxobacteria, and actinobacteria. The different physiological states of the bacteria in the studied objects reflecting the duration of the lag phase and the readiness of the metabolic system to consume different substrates were demonstrated for the first time. The relationships between the trophic characteristics of bacterial habitats and the capacity of the bacteria to consume substrates were established.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeat 3amyxobacteria 3amicrobial communities 3aTrichoderma 3apeatlands 3amicrobial biomass 3acolor 3ahabitats 3aPenicillium 3afungi 0aPenicillum 0aMyxobacteria 0abacteria1 aGolovchenko, A.

The extraction of peat for horticultural purposes or for biofuel however, may lead to a shift in the carbon dynamics. Additionally, the change in environmental conditions after extraction could allow for invasive species to establish and spread across the peatland. While the benefits and advantages of various restoration management practices have been identified, there has been less attention paid to the carbon exchange from unrestored peatlands at the ecosystem level. This study analyzed the carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from a post-extraction, unrestored peatland in Eastern Québec at both the plant community level, using chamber methods, and at the ecosystem level, using eddy covariance techniques for two successive years. Methane flux at the plant community level was also measured. The site is an overall source of CO2, releasing a cumulative annual total of 173 and 259 g C m−2 for 2014 and 2015, respectively and a small source of methane, releasing an average annual cumulative total of 1 g C m−2. Results from this study will help managers assess the importance of post-extraction peatland restoration, by comparing the differences in CO2 exchange between restored and unrestored peatlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aenvironmental factors 3ahorticulture 3ainvasive species 3amethane 3amethane production 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aplant communities 3aQuebec 0aCarbon dioxide 0aMethane 0aPeatlands 0aRestoration 0aPeat extraction 0aEddy covariance1 aStrachan, I.B.1 aStrack, M.0 tEcological engineering.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 122 p.241-251dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245012800182300001600310500001900326500002000345520136800365592002801733650001301761650001601774650001701790650001601807650001701823650001401840650001301854650001201867650001401879650002401893650001401917650001201931700002101943700002201964700001901986700001502005773011602020856008802136852000902224655001202233IND60734373320221119080716.0210417e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073437332DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04274.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkinson, Rebecca R.

Previously, we showed that the slower‐growing monocarpic plants had lower mortality rates and higher bolting probabilities after two defoliation events. Here, we consider a mechanistic explanation, that the slower‐growing species invested relatively more resources to storage. We compared the relative levels of root storage compounds between eight monocarpic species using metabolomic profiling, and characterized plant growth using a size‐corrected estimate of relative growth rate (RGR). Growth rate was negatively correlated with the proportional allocation of root metabolites identified as sucrose, raffinose and stachyose and with amino acids known for their roles in nitrogen storage, particularly proline and arginine. The total amount and concentration of energy‐corrected carbohydrates were also negatively correlated with RGR. Our results show for the first time that slower‐growing species invest proportionally more of their total root metabolites in carbon‐ and nitrogen‐storage compounds. We conclude that the increased investment in these reserves is an important resource allocation strategy underlying the growth–survival trade‐off in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3adefoliation 3alife history 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amortality 3anitrogen 3aproline 3araffinose 3aresource allocation 3astachyose 3asucrose1 aBurrell, Mike M.1 aOsborne, Colin P.1 aRose, Karen E.1 aRees, Mark0 tnew phytologist.g2012 Oct., v. 196, no. 1 p.200-211dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04274.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245015200182300001600334520157400350592002801924650002001952650001801972650001301990650001402003650002602017650002002043653002302063653002602086653001402112653002302126653001802149700003102167700003502198700003102233700003102264773010902295856008602404852000902490655001202499IND60585419220221120065931.0190319e20180209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058541922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.10.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenao Ramírez, Ana María10aEvaluation of the potential of regeneration of different Colombian and commercial genotypes of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) via somatic embryogenesis  ap. 148-156.  aThis paper aims to establish efficient protocols for the in vitro propagation of different cocoa genotypes (T.cacao), the potential of regeneration via somatic embryogenesis in the Colombian genotypes SYS12, SYS13, SYS16, SYS24, SYS4 and commercial/universal genotypes CCN51, TSH565, EET8, ICS1, ICS39, ICS60, ICS95 was evaluated. The effects of a different culture media, kind of explant and culture time on the induction of embryogenic structures (PE), somatic globular embryos (GE) and cotyledonary somatic embryos (CE) were studied in addition to the effect of the culture time on the average number of secondary somatic embryos (SSE) and the culture medium over the SSE conversion. Finally, different substrates on the hardening of the stage of seedlings was evaluated. In this study a regeneration protocol via a high frequency SSE for para CCN51, TSH565, SYS4 y SYS13 is described in addition to the development induction up to a cotyledonary stage of the genotype SYS24 and the induction of proembryogenic masses and globular embryos for SYS12 y SYS16. For the commercial genotypes ICS60 reached the development up to cotyledonary stage but it was not possible to reach a successful conversion and for ICS1, EET8, ICS95, ICS39 we reached the induction of globular embryos that quickly experienced a dedifferentiation process. It is expected that the high frequency found in the embryos formation allows a contribution to the reduction of production costs and thus promote the massive utilization of superior cocoa genotypes propagated via somatic embryogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3aculture media 3agenotype 3aseedlings 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos 0aTheobroma cacao L. 0aSomatic embryogenesis 0aGenotypes 0aPlant regeneration 0aRecalcitrance1 ade la Hoz Vasquez, Tatiana1 aOspina Osorio, Tatiana Marcela1 aGarcés, Lucía Atehortúa1 aUrrea Trujillo, Aura Inés0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 Feb. 09, v. 229 p.148-156dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2017.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011500172300001300287520182300300592002802123650001502151650001502166650000802181650001802189650001302207650001202220650001202232650002302244650001502267650001302282650001902295650001202314650002502326650001402351650001602365653002902381653002202410653003002432653002902462653003202491700001902523700002002542700005202562773010502614856008502719852000902804655001202813IND60560474220221118030651.0180830e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056047422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarroza, Archi C.10aCharacterising pulverised fuel ignition in a visual drop tube furnace by use of a high-speed imaging technique  ap. 1-11.  aThis study investigates the ignition characteristics of pulverised coal, biomass and co-firing by use of a visual drop tube furnace (VDTF) and a high speed imaging technique. Three coals (anthracite, a bituminous coal and a lignite), four biomasses (Pine, Eucalyptus, Olive Residue and Miscanthus) and various biomass-coal mixtures were tested. With each coal, biomass or their mixture, a distinct flame was established within the VDTF through the continuous feeding of the fuel under the environment of air and at a furnace temperature of 800°C. To observe the ignition point, a Phantom v12.1 high-speed camera was used to capture the videos of fuel combustion at 500 frames per second (FPS). A technique was developed using MATLAB's image analysis tool to automate the ignition point detection. The results of the image processing were used to statistically analyse and determine the changes to the ignition behaviour with different fuels and co-firing ratios.The results obtained with the tested coals have shown that the distance to ignition increases as the coal volatile matter content decreases, whereas the opposite trend was found for the biomass fuels. Further, the addition of biomass to the anthracite significantly reduces the distance to ignition but a much less pronounced effect on the ignition was found when biomass was co-fired with the bituminous coal or lignite. The synergistic effect on the ignition of biomass-anthracite mixture is mainly attributed to the high volatile content and the potential effects of catalysis from the alkali metals present in the biomass. The results of this study have shown that the VDTF testing coupled with the image analysis technique allows for an effective and simple method of characterising ignition behaviours of pulverised coal, biomass and their mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aMiscanthus 3aair 3aalkali metals 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acameras 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3afurnaces 3aimage analysis 3alignite 3astatistical analysis 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aPulverised fuel particle 0aIgnition distance 0aCombustion image analysis 0aVisual drop tube furnace 0aBiomass co-firing with coal1 aBennet, Tom D.1 aEastwick, Carol1 aLiu, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0658-44250 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Mar., v. 157 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245015100173520155600324592002801880650002301908650002401931650001801955650002101973650001101994650001802005650002002023650001802043650002802061650001802089650002902107650001102136650002102147650002202168653001502190653001002205653002002215653002202235653002102257700006402278700002902342700002002371773009202391856009002483852000902573655001202582IND60733979120221120114602.0211227e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073397912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1305542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalia, Shweta10aUtilization of starch effluent from a textile industry as a fungal growth supplement for enhanced α-amylase production for industrial application  aDesizing process in textile industry produces large volume of starch effluent. This carbon-rich waste can be used for resource recovery, such as the production of industrially useful enzymes. The present work assesses the usability of starch effluent from textile industry as an additional carbon source for enhanced production of α-amylase during solid-state fermentation (SSF) of agro-wastes by Trichoderma reesei. A significant increase (p ≤ 0.05) in α-amylase activity (25.48 ± 1.12 U mL⁻¹) was observed with supplementation of starch effluent in SSF. Partial purification of α-amylase by 80% ammonium sulphate precipitation produced a yield of 58.39% enzyme with purification fold of 1.89. The enzyme was thermally stable at 40 °C with 90% residual activity after 5 h and 70% residual activity at 50 °C after 3 h. Using Michaelis–Menten kinetics analysis, the estimated Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ values for the partially purified α-amylase were found to be 2.55 mg mL⁻¹ and 53.47 U mg⁻¹, respectively. For the rapid assessment of the industrial application, desizing of the fabric was attempted. The cotton fabric was efficiently desized using α-amylase (at a concentration of 1% on the weight of fabric basis) at 80 °C. The present work demonstrates starch effluent from desizing process as a resource for the production of amylase. The amylase can further be used in the desizing process. With in-depth research, the work may lead to the development of a closed-loop, waste-recycling process for the textile industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aagricultural wastes 3aalpha-amylase 3aammonium sulfate 3acarbon 3acotton fabric 3aenzyme kinetics 3afungal growth 3aindustrial applications 3arapid methods 3asolid state fermentation 3astarch 3atextile industry 3athermal stability 0aα-Amylase 0aFungi 0aStarch effluent 0aResource recovery 0aTextile industry1 aBhattacharya, Arghya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9574-52371 aPrajapati, Sanjeev Kumar1 aMalik, Anushree0 tChemosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 279 p.130554-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1305543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014100164300001600305520107900321592002801400650002201428650002801450650002001478650002601498650002001524650001301544650001101557650001401568650001001582650002401592650001701616650003001633650001501663650002201678650001701700650001201717700001901729700001701748700001901765700001901784700001801803700001601821700001801837773010101855856008101956852000902037655001202046IND60579527420221120044749.0170821e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057952742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11816-017-0445-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Ji-Nam10aResistance of transgenic zoysiagrass overexpressing the zoysiagrass class II chitinase gene Zjchi2 against Rhizoctonia solani AG2-2 (IV)  ap. 229-238.  aZoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) is an important turfgrass species used in golf courses and athletic fields. However, zoysiagrass is susceptible to large patch disease caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG2-2 (IV). Chitinases are pathogen-related (PR) proteins induced by viruses, bacteria, and fungi that hydrolyze chitin. Recently, we isolated a class II chitinase gene (Zjchi2) from zoysiagrass. The purified recombinant Zjchi2 showed broad-spectrum activity against various fungi, including R. solani AG2-2 (IV). In the current study, we generated transgenic zoysiagrass overexpressing Zjchi2 and then verified the resistance of transgenic plants to R. solani AG2-2 (IV). Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization showed the integration of transgenes in zoysiagrass genomes and constitutive expression of Zjchi2, respectively. Antifungal activity was enhanced significantly in the transgenic zoysiagrass compared with wild-type plants. To our knowledge, this report is the first on the antifungal activity of a class II chitinase in transgenic zoysiagrass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSouthern blotting 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aZoysia japonica 3aantifungal properties 3aathletic fields 3abacteria 3achitin 3achitinase 3afungi 3agene overexpression 3agolf courses 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3aturf grasses 3aviruses1 aPark, Mi-Young1 aKim, Woo-Nam1 aKang, Hong-Gyu1 aSun, Hyeon-Jin1 aYang, Dae-Hwa1 aKo, Suk-Min1 aLee, Hyo-Yeon0 tPlant biotechnology reports.g2017 Aug., v. 11, no. 4 p.229-238dSpringer Japanx1863-54667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-017-0445-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04013naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245015100182300001800333520220500351592002802556650002002584650002902604650001402633650001902647650001602666650001702682650001502699650001402714650001702728650001702745650001302762650002302775650001402798650001102812650002102823650002502844650002702869650001802896650001502914650002702929650002202956650004102978650005903019650002903078651001003107651001003117700001803127700002303145700001703168700002103185700003103206773011703237856004803354852000903402655001203411IND4466772420221118142343.0120705e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446677242DNAL7 a219319472pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-2333-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, N.

The area of the Varaha River Basin is chosen for the present study, where the Precambrian Eastern Ghats underlain the Recent sediments. Groundwater quality is of mostly brackish and very hard, caused by the sources of geogenic, anthropogenic, and marine origin. The resulting groundwater is characterized by Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ : [Formula: see text] > Cl− > [Formula: see text], Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ : [Formula: see text] > Cl− > [Formula: see text] > [Formula: see text], Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ : [Formula: see text] > Cl−, and Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ : Cl− > [Formula: see text] > [Formula: see text] facies, following the topographical and water flow-path conditions. The genetic geochemical evolution of groundwater ([Formula: see text] and Cl−–[Formula: see text] types under major group of [Formula: see text]) and the hydrogeochemical signatures (Na+/Cl−, >1 and [Formula: see text]/Cl−, <1) indicate that the groundwater is of originally fresh quality, but is subsequently modified to brackish by the influences of anthropogenic and marine sources, which also supported by the statistical analysis. The concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS), TH, Mg2+, Na+, K+, [Formula: see text], Cl−, [Formula: see text], and F− are above the recommended limits prescribed for drinking water in many locations. The quality of groundwater is of mostly moderate in comparison with the salinity hazard versus sodium hazard, the total salt concentration versus percent sodium, the residual sodium carbonate, and the magnesium hazard, but is of mostly suitable with respect to the permeability index for irrigation. The higher concentrations of TDS, TH, [Formula: see text], Cl−, and [Formula: see text] in the groundwater cause the undesirable effects of incrustation and corrosion in many locations. Appropriate management measures are, therefore, suggested to improve the groundwater quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanthropogenic activities 3acorrosion 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3airrigation 3amagnesium 3apermeability 3aplant growth 3asalinity 3asalt concentration 3asediments 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3astatistical analysis 3atotal dissolved solids 3awater quality 3awatersheds 2aGroundwaterxchemistry 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 2aWater Qualityxstandards 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aRao, P.

The expansion of magur aquaculture is hindered because of low reproductive and survival rates. Furthermore, males need to be sacrificed to collect milt for artificial fertilization. At present, magur seed production mainly depends on the wild-caught juveniles and to a smaller extent, from broodfish whose genetic potential is unknown. The availability of high-quality seeds in a sustainable way can be ensured through the selective breeding program for magur. The knowledge of factors influencing growth traits and their genetic parameters is a pre-requisite for implementing a genetic selection program. The present study aimed to quantify the performance of C.magur reared in a two-year class and estimate their heritabilities at stocking and harvest and also to estimate the genetic and phenotypic correlations among them. The growth traits such as Body Weight (BW), Total Length (TL), Body Depth (BD), Head Width (HW), and Average Daily Gain (ADG) were recorded from 1413 animals belonging to 78 fullsib families produced by adopting single pair mating design, after one year of pond culture (traits at harvest). Genetic parameters were also estimated for body weight (BW0) and total length (TL0) measured from 2328 fish from 78 fullsib families at the time of stocking. Magur attained an average BW of 135 g and 24.5 cm TL after one year culture period. The heritabilities of BW, TL, and ADG were 0.44 ± 0.07, 0.32 ± 0.06, and 0.42 ± 0.07, respectively and may be biased upwardly due to the single pair mating design. Genetic correlations between harvest traits were all positive and varied in magnitude between traits (0.74 to 0.99). The results obtained from the current study indicate the presence of genetic variation in magur population for growth traits and selection based on genetic merit can produce improvement in these traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClarias 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3abreeding programs 3acatfish 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic merit 3agenetic variation 3agrowth traits 3aheritability 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amilt 3anatural selection 3aphenotypic correlation 3apond culture 3arearing 3aselective breeding 3asurvival rate 0aNon-genetic factors 0aMagur1 aJahageerdar, Shrinivas1 aChanu, Thongam Ibemcha1 aJayaraman, Jayashankar1 aBangera, Rama0 tAquaculture reports.g2020 Nov., v. 18 p.100411-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1004113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245021900175300001600394520189500410592002802305650005802333650001102391650001702402650001102419650001202430650001902442650002902461650002102490650002202511650001402533651001602547653001902563653001902582653002102601653003002622653002602652653001802678700001802696700001602714700001902730773011302749856008602862852000902948655001202957IND60616250920221119093308.0210114e20190110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061625092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.2642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoehnke, Richard F.10aGood practices in local climate mitigation action by small and medium-sized cities; exploring meaning, implementation and linkage to actual lowering of carbon emissions in thirteen municipalities in The Netherlands  ap. 630-644.  aCities around the world are gearing up to play a major role in climate change mitigation. However, concrete results – significant emissions reductions, expected from cities committed to mitigating climate change, are currently conspicuously absent. While there are several good practice guides available for large/mega cities there are little available for small and medium-sized ones (SMCs). In this paper the main research questions are, “When exploring local climate mitigation action among multiple small- and medium-sized cities, what actions are perceived as good practices?”, and “Are there any demonstrable effects linking them to achieving climate mitigation targets, and is this monitored?” A multiple case study research approach, using quali-quantitative mixed methods with multiple types of data sources, was used to analyze thirteen SMCs in the Netherlands. Results revealed twenty six good practices, with the majority exhibiting the characteristics of governing by enabling. However, no evidence was found that these good practices had been embedded in indicators or protocols, nor that they led to actual GHG emission reduction. In addition, action plans were found to be incomplete, in particular regarding implementation, and municipalities were found to work in isolation, with little inter-municipal collaboration. Moreover, whereas a monitor of local climate mitigation performance exists – using output and outcome indicators - it was found to be hardly known nor used among local policy makers. The results reveal a need to learn from good practices, to develop indicators that mirror these practices, and integrate them into local climate mitigation performance measurement tools. Currently, this is not the case, making it difficult to monitor local climate mitigation performance and progress vis-à-vis commitments made regarding the Paris Agreement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acities 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3aprotocols 3aNetherlands 0aClimate policy 0aClimate action 0aLocal government 0aClimate change mitigation 0aGoverning by enabling 0aGood practice1 aHoppe, Thomas1 aBrezet, Han1 aBlok, Kornelis0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 10, v. 207 p.630-644dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.2643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013200169300001400301520067800315592002800993650001501021650001901036650001601055650001501071650002501086653001601111653003001127653001801157653002901175653002201204700001801226700001701244773010601261856008501367852000901452655001201461IND60560474520221118030750.0180830e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056047452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHairul, N.A.H.10aProcess behaviour in a packed absorption column for high pressure CO2 absorption from natural gas using PZ+AMP blended solution  ap. 20-28.  aThis paper reports the use of piperazine promoted 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (PZ+AMP) blended solution for the removal of high concentration CO2 in natural gas (NG).

N.14aThe hydrolysis and recrystallisation of lyocell and comparative cellulosic fibres in solutions of mineral acid  ap. 241-254.  aRegenerated cellulosic fibres undergo a process described as scission-reordering during hydrolysis in solutions of mineral acid. This occurs within disordered polymer regions at lateral crystal interfaces, which are accessible to aqueous agents through the pore spaces and polymer free volume. This process is distinct from that of oligomer-solubilsation, which occurs within disordered polymer regions in series between crystal domains, where no effective template exists for recrystallisation. The degradation of series disorder will have the greatest influence on fibre tensile properties, which fall dramatically even at low levels of hydrolysis. The mechanics of fibrillation are most sensitive to the degradation of lateral disorder, which occurs at a higher rate constant. Soft-touch fabric processing may therefore be possible under conditions where there is a reduced influence on tensile performance. A kinetic model has been proposed to describe the hydrolysis and recrystallisation pathways, which shows that lyocell has longer but thinner crystal domains than viscose or modal fibres, and also a tighter distribution of lateral crystal sizes. Lyocell also has a lower proportion of series disorder and also thinner regions of lateral disorder. This is consistent with the overall greater crystallinity of the original lyocell fibre and the also of the final microscrystalline product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3acellulosic fibers 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3afabrics 3ahydrolysis 3amechanics 3amodels 3apolymers 3aviscose1 aDomvoglou, D.1 aPhillips, D.

Results indicated the removal efficiency of NH₄ ⁺ and NO₃ ⁻ were significantly correlated with both urease and protease activity, and the removal of total phosphorus was significantly correlated with phosphatase activity. Chemical oxygen demand removal was not correlated with enzyme activity in constructed wetlands. Plant root enzyme (urease, phosphatase, protease and cellulose) activity correlation was apparent with all contaminant removal in the two vertical flow constructed wetlands. However, the correlation between the plant root enzyme activity and contaminant removal was poor in horizontal flow constructed wetlands. Results indicated that plant roots clearly played a role in the removal of contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium compounds 3acellulose 3achemical oxygen demand 3aconstructed wetlands 3aenzyme activity 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrates 3aphosphorus 3aproteinases 3aroots 3asoil enzymes 3aurease1 aXu, Jiajun1 aChu, Xianglin1 aLi, Shiyin1 aWang, Peifang1 aLi, Yiping1 aLi, Yong1 aZhu, Liang1 aWang, Chao0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 July, v. 97, no. 1 p.131-137dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-016-1844-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007300166300001800239520099600257592002801253650003101281650001801312650002501330650002701355650001701382650001901399650001701418650001401435700002301449700001501472700001701487773009101504856008501595852000901680655001201689IND60098346820221120041057.0141104e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009834682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2011.08.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaxena, A.10aRole of CD8 T cell subsets in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis  ap. 3758-3763.  aMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system leading to demyelination and axonal/neuronal loss. Cumulating evidence points to a key role for CD8 T cells in this disabling disease. Oligoclonal CD8 T cells reside in demyelinating plaques where they are likely to contribute to tissue destruction. Histopathological analyses and compelling observations from animal models indicate that cytotoxic CD8 T cells target neural cell populations with the potential of causing lesions reminiscent of MS. However, CD8 T cell differentiation results in several subsets of effector CD8 T cells that could be differentially implicated in the mechanisms contributing to tissue damage. Moreover CD8 regulatory T cells arise as important populations involved in restoring immune homoeostasis and in maintaining immune privileged sites. Here we examine the current literature pertaining to the role of CD8 effector and regulatory T cell subsets in the pathogenesis of MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3acell differentiation 3acentral nervous system 3acytotoxicity 3ahistopathology 3apathogenesis 3asclerosis1 aMartin-Blondel, G.1 aMars, L.T.1 aLiblau, R.S.0 tFEBS letters.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 585, no. 23 p.3758-3763dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.08.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245009000172300001600262500002000278520119700298592002801495650001201523650001101535650001501546650002301561650001001584650001601594650002301610650000901633650002101642650001901663650004501682650001401727700002201741700002701763773009301790856008801883852000901971655001201980IND60572167820221118043127.0170712e199306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057216782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.1993.00857.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGörg, Regina10aFunctional analysis and RFLP‐mediated mapping of the Mlg resistance locus in barley  ap. 857-866.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe semi‐dominantly acting allele of the Mlg locus in barley confers a race‐specific resistance to the causal agent of powdery mildew, Erysiphe graminis f.sp. hordei. High resolution genetic mapping via RFLP analysis enabled us to identify a set of markers on chromosome 4 which are either tightly linked or co‐segregate with the resistance function. Comparison of marker distances in segregating F₂ populations originating from different genotypes revealed an unex‐pected variation of recombination frequencies in the vicinity of the locus. Based on near‐isogenic lines carrying either resistance gene Mlg or Mla12 and a cell‐type specific analysis it was demonstrated that Mlg acts at an earlier stage of fungal development than Mla12. A time‐course analysis of the early infection process combined with gene dosage experiments provided strong evidence that attacked cells retain viability after the defence response and that hypersensitive cell death (HR) is a secondary consequence, but not causally required for Mlg‐mediated arrest of fungal growth. It is speculated that gene dosage experiments may provide a means to separate primary from secondary defence reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abarley 3acell death 3achromosome mapping 3afungi 3agene dosage 3agenetic resistance 3aloci 3amicrobial growth 3apowdery mildew 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aviability1 aHollricher, Karin1 aSchulze‐Lefert, Paul0 tplant journal.g1993 June, v. 3, no. 6 p.857-866dBlackwell Science Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.1993.00857.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015100165300001400316520132200330592002801652650001201680650001101692650001901703650001501722650001901737650000901756650001301765650002901778650001501807650001801822650002401840650001101864650001701875650002101892650002501913650001301938650001001951653002101961653002901982653002002011653002302031700001802054700001502072773008802087856008502175852000902260655001202269IND60629128520221119113943.0190913e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062912852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ning12aA flexible CO2 capture operation scheme design and evaluation of a coal-fired power plant integrated with a novel DCP and retrofitted solar system  ap. 73-84.  aCarbon capture for coal-fired power plant draws an increasing attention because CO2 emissions may have an impact on global climate change. Using the dry carbonate process (DCP) for CO2 capture in low-temperature flue gas has many potential advantages with respect to the Ca-Looping (CaL) for CO2 capture, and the solar thermal energy is used to provide the entire or part heat required for sorbent regeneration, thus replacing the steam extraction from turbine circuit. However, no significant improvement of the DCP operations was made in all studies. The conventional heat transfer arrangement not only increases the heat losses, but also increases the capital cost. The present paper suggested a novel scheme removing the regenerator and reboiler from DCP, directly heating the sorbent in solar collector. This scheme was applied to the exhaust gas of a typical 600 MW coal-fired power plant, and eliminates the dependence of DCP on steam cycle in power plant, thus increasing further flexibility for DCP operation. The economic and technical advantages of this integrated system are highlighted and the influences of meteorological data on flexible operation of DCP in this system are determined using model built by Aspen Plus. The results would give some guidelines regarding the application of the novel DCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3aclimate change 3acoal 3aflue gas 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aguidelines 3aheat transfer 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 3asolar thermal energy 3asorbents 3asteam 0aNovel DCP scheme 0aRetrofitted solar system 0aSorbent storage 0aFlexible operation1 aZhou, Yunlong1 aGe, Xinzhe0 tEnergy.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 170 p.73-84dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245013400174300001300308500001500321520168400336592002802020650001502048650002202063650000902085650001802094650001602112650001602128650001702144650002202161650000902183650001402192650001802206650003302224650001302257650003302270650001102303650001402314650002302328650002302351650001602374653001702390700002902407700002202436700002802458700003302486773010802519856008102627852000902708655001202717IND60121657720221120133508.0150427e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012165772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2362-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Celyna K.

Diatomite was modified by impregnating it with a mixture of ferrous (Fe²⁺) and ferric (Fe³⁺) ions in the form of precipitated iron oxides and hydroxides. The raw and synthesized materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), particle size by laser diffraction, chemical microanalysis of the elements by energy-dispersive X-ray, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Batch experiments were performed to compare the new activator material (modified diatomite) with traditional methods of activation for these oxidants and to statistically study the optimum ratio between the amount of this material and the concentration of one oxidant to the degradation of the contaminants phenanthrene and anthracene. The characterization results showed that the materials are amorphous and that the Fe ion concentration was 4.78 and 17.65 % for the raw and modified diatomites, respectively. This result shows a significant increase in the amount of iron ions after synthesis. Comparing the traditional activation method with the modified diatomite, the results of batch experiments showed that the synthesized material presents significant catalytic activity for the oxidation of these contaminants, using sodium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide as oxidants. The analysis of the variables results showed that the concentration of the oxidant has higher significance than the amount of the catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydroxides 3aX-ray diffraction 3aions 3aphenanthrenes 3airon oxides 3aanthracenes 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3acatalysts 3aparticle size 3aresponse surface methodology 3aoxidants 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3aoxidation 3adiatomaceous earth 3acatalytic activity 3aX-radiation 0aphenanthrene1 aVianna, Marilda M.

The frequent need to sample vast expanses of potential habitat increases the cost of planned surveys and rewards accumulation of opportunistic observations. In this paper, we integrate planned‐survey data from roost counts with opportunistic samples from eBird, WikiAves and Xeno‐canto citizen‐science platforms to map the geographic range of the endangered Vinaceous‐breasted Parrot. We demonstrate the estimation and mapping of species occurrence based on data integration while accounting for specifics of each dataset, including observation technique and uncertainty about the observations. LOCATION: Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. METHODS: Our analysis illustrates (a) the incorporation of sampling effort, spatial autocorrelation and site covariates in a joint‐likelihood, hierarchical, data integration model; (b) the evaluation of the contribution of each dataset, as well as the contribution of effort covariates, spatial autocorrelation and site covariates to the predictive ability of fitted models using a cross‐validation approach; and (c) how spatial representation of the latent occupancy state (i.e. realized occupancy) helps identify areas with high uncertainty that should be prioritized in future fieldwork. RESULTS: We estimate a Vinaceous‐breasted Parrot geographic range of 434,670 km², which is three times larger than the “Extant” area previously reported in the IUCN Red List. The exclusion of one dataset at a time from the analyses always resulted in worse predictions by the models of truncated data than by the Full Model, which included all datasets. Likewise, exclusion of spatial autocorrelation, site covariates or sampling effort resulted in worse predictions. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The integration of different datasets into one joint‐likelihood model produced a more reliable representation of the species range than any individual dataset taken on its own, improving the use of citizen‐science data in combination with planned‐survey results.  aPublisher supplied data  cInstituto Humanize  cPrograma de Internacionalização (PrInt/CAPES)  cFundo Brasileiro para a Biodiversidade (FUNBIO)  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  aPP 312606/2013‐3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a19835‐1cThe Rufford Foundation  a23709‐2cThe Rufford Foundation 3aautocorrelation 3acitizen science 3adata collection 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3amodels 3auncertainty 3awildlife management 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aParaguay1 aMiller, David A.

Population and vegetation structure of ramin (Gonystylus bancanus) in secondary forests of Ketapang District, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 19: 528-534. In the tropical peatland, ramin (Gonystylus bancanus Miq. Kurz) was one of many prominent species that present in peatland forest. The species distribution is mostly in Southeast Asia peatland. The beautiful wood color, pale yellow sometimes grayish with no differentiated sapwood and heartwood with straight interlocked grain, made it become the most wanted tree species from tropical peatland.The exploitation of Ramin wood since the 1970s caused the decrease of its population in the peatland forest, led to this species being listed as an endangered species. This study aimed to search information on the Ramin population and vegetation structure left in its habitat in secondary peatland forest of Pematang Gadung and Sungai Sirih villages area of Ketapang District. The study employed a survey method, and data collection was carried out using line plots system. Data assessed were natural regeneration condition-seedling, sapling and pole growth levels-, and tree growth levels. A 20 m x 20 m size plots were continually established to form a line with the length of 550-680 m. Results showed that relatively a few Ramin was found in the forests in Sungai Sirih with a mean seedling density of only 9.9 tree ha-1, height ranges of 131 cm to 150 cm, and counted sapling level of 183 trees ha-1 with diameter ranges from 0.38 to 6.37 cm. At Pematang Gadung village, more Ramin was found, especially with a bigger diameter. Tree level (diameter >20cm) was recorded at 74.1 tree ha-1 with a contradictory far less seedling (2.8 tree ha-1), sapling level (only 1 tree ha-1) and pole level (7.4 tree ha-1) established. Based on the tree population condition and the variation of their growth level, the vegetation structure of Ramin did not describe a normal curve form in the natural forest both in the villages of Pematang Gadung and Sungai Sirih.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aGonystylus bancanus 3acolor 3adata collection 3aendangered species 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3aheartwood 3anatural regeneration 3apeatlands 3asapwood 3aseedlings 3asurveys 3atree growth 3atrees 3avegetation structure 3avillages 3awood 3aIndonesia 0agrowth level 0aramin population 0aramin structure 0asecondary forest 0atropical peatland1 aAstiani, Dwi,0 tBiodiversitas.g2018 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.478-484dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d1902223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015500173300001800328520087100346592002801217650003801245650000801283650001801291650001601309650001001325650001201335650005201347650006501399650002901464650001201493773011601505856008201621852000901703655001201712IND60579526120221120044637.0211117e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057952612DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-017-3404-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmasi, Mohammad Amin10aDevelopment of a colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus  ap. 2775-2780.  aAn RT-LAMP assay was developed to detect Mirafiori lettuce big vein virus (MiLBVV) and was compared with DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR. All primers were designed on the basis of the coat protein gene of the virus. In addition, a novel immunocapture (IC) RT-LAMP assay for rapid and easy detection of MiLBVV was developed, and factors such as safety, simplicity, cost, user-friendliness and safety were compared with those of DAS-ELISA, RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. Compared with DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR, RT-LAMP and IC-RT-LAMP had higher sensitivity (100-fold) but similar specificity, with the advantage of a shorter assay time and no need for RNA extraction (in IC-RT-LAMP). As RT-LAMP requires only very basic instruments and the results can be obtained by visual inspection (using GeneFinder™ dye), this technique provides a simple and reliable tool for laboratory research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLettuce big-vein associated virus 3aRNA 3acoat proteins 3acolorimetry 3agenes 3alettuce 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviruses0 tArchives of virology.g2017 Sept., v. 162, no. 9 p.2775-2780dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3404-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245021800164300001600382520042700398592002800825650002000853650001300873650001300886650001500899653000600914653001900920653001300939653000600952653002500958653001100983653001500994653001301009653002401022653001101046653001501057653001301072700001901085700001701104773015001121856007701271852000901348655001201357IND60521700620221122043519.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052170062DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1983-03212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDallacker, Franz10aDerivate des 1.3-BenzdioxoIs, 48 [1].

The patients' survival status, change in percentage of ideal body weight, need for ongoing nutritional intervention, pulmonary function test changes, IV antibiotic use, and complication rates were assessed. Patients gained significant weight while receiving PN, but they lost weight when PN was discontinued. PN did not clearly improve pulmonary status. IV antibiotic therapy nearly doubled during PN. Central venous catheter sepsis rates rose from 1.29 to 3.45 per 1000 catheter days during PN therapy. In conclusion, prolonged PN promotes weight gain in cystic fibrosis patients with severe disease; however, the effect is transient and involves a significantly increased risk of sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3acatheters 3acystic fibrosis 3adisease severity 3aideal body weight 3alung function 3anutritional intervention 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 3asepsis (infection)1 aMick, Anne B.1 aNicol, Jennie1 aMccoy, Karen S.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g1995 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.73-79dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0115426595010002733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003900139245019500178300001600373520056900389592002800958650001300986650001300999650001201012650001301024650001901037651001101056700003301067700002601100773010601126856007301232852000901305655001201314IND60730591320221119101832.0210311e20210303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073059132DNAL7 a10.15560/17.2.3532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Anderson Felipe Teixeira da10aFirst records of Buff-fronted Owl, Aegolius harrisii (Cassin, 1849) (Aves, Strigiformes), from the state of Maranhão, northeastern Brazil, and the northernmost record for the Cerrado domain  ap. 353-358.  aWe present the first record of Aegolius harrisii (Cassin, 1849) from the state of Maranhão, extending the known distribution of the species 283 km to the west in the Brazilian Northeast.

In the present study, tree-ring analysis was used to assess the effects of 16 years (1991–2007) of chronic nitrogen (N) deposition, and 10 years (1991–2001) of reduced nitrogen input, on the radial growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in the experimental area of Lake Gårdsjön, southwest Sweden. In addition to the ambient input of c. 15 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, dissolved NH₄NO₃ was experimentally added to a 0.52-ha watershed at a rate of c. 40 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. Atmospheric N depositions were reduced by means of a below-canopy plastic roof, which covered a 0.63-ha catchment adjacent to the fertilized site. The paired design of the experiment allowed tree growth in the N-treated sites to be compared with the growth at a reference plot receiving ambient N deposition. Nitrogen fertilization had a negative impact on pine growth, while no changes were observed in spruce. Similarly, the reduction in N and other acidifying compounds resulted in a tendency towards improved radial growth of pine, but it did not significantly affect the spruce growth. These results suggest that spruce is less susceptible to changes in the acidification and N status of the forest ecosystem than pine, at least in the Gårdsjön area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aacidification 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric deposition 3adendrochronology 3aenvironmental indicators 3aexperimental design 3aforest ecosystems 3agrowth rings 3alakes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3atree growth 3awatersheds 3aSweden1 aMoldan, Filip1 aLinderholm, Hans W.0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2013 Jan., v. 132, no. 1 p.83-92dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-012-0657-y  aDNAL 7aarticle01681naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011900163300001800282520051900300592002800819650001600847650001100863650001900874650001600893650002400909650002200933650001900955650001200974700001700986700001201003700001601015700002001031700001401051773011601065856008201181961002301263852000901286655001201295IND60579526220221120044642.0211117e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057952622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-017-3396-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Mengji10aGenome characterization of sweet potato symptomless virus 1: a mastrevirus with an unusual nonanucleotide sequence  ap. 2881-2884.  aComplete genomic sequences of nine isolates of sweet potato symptomless virus 1 (SPSMV-1), a virus of the genus Mastrevirus in the family Geminiviridae, were determined from sweet potato accessions from different countries and found to be 2,559-2,602 nucleotides in length.

A previous study has shown that there are different endogenous forms of DNlg3 in Drosophila, indicating it may undergo proteolytic processing. However, the molecular mechanism underlying DNlg3 proteolytic processing is unknown. Here, we report a novel proteolytic mechanism that is essential for DNlg3 maturation and function in the nervous system.Molecular cloning, cell culture, immunohistochemistry, western blotting and genetic studies were employed to map the DNlg3 cleavage region, identify the protease and characterize the cleavage manner. Behavior analysis, immunohistochemistry and genetic manipulations were employed to study the functions of different DNlg3 forms in nervous system and neuromuscular junction (NMJs).Tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (TACE) cleaved DNlg3 exclusively at its extracellular acetylcholinesterase-like domain to generate the N-terminal fragment and the short membrane-anchored fragment (sDNlg3). DNlg3 was constitutively processed in an activity-independent manner. Interestingly, DNlg3 was cleaved intracellularly in the Golgi apparatus before it arrived at the cell surface, a unique cleavage mechanism that is distinct from ‘conventional’ ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins, including rodent Nlg1. Genetic studies showed that sDNlg3 was essential for maintaining proper locomotor activity in Drosophila.Our results revealed a unique cleavage mechanism of DNlg3 and a neuron-specific role for DNlg3 maturation which is important in locomotor activity.General significance.Our study provides a new insight into a cleavage mechanism of Nlgs maturation in nervous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aGolgi apparatus 3aWestern blotting 3acell culture 3agenetic engineering 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alocomotion 3amembrane proteins 3anecrosis 3apost-translational modification 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3arodents 3asynapse 3atumor necrosis factors 0aLocomotion 0aNeuroligin 0aProtein maturation 0aProteolytic cleavage 0aTACE protease1 aTao, Nana1 aTian, Yao1 aXing, Guanglin1 aLv, Huihui1 aHan, Junhai1 aLin, Chengqi1 aXie, Wei0 tBBA - General Subjects.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245010200159500002000261520089600281592002801177650001301205650002101218650002301239650002101262650000901283650001601292650001701308650001701325650002401342650000701366650000901373650001601382650001501398700001701413700005201430700001701482773011301499856007801612852000901690655001201699IND60743145020220418000000.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074314502DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2021000472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jia10aPreparation and Flocculation Property of Cationic Chitosan‐DADMAC‐β‐Cyclodextrin Copolymer  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDye wastewater, especially anionic dye wastewater, poses a serious risk to the environment and human health. To solve this problem, it is necessary to develop new flocculants with high efficiency and biodegradability. Herein, a copolymer of chitosan‐diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride‐β‐cyclodextrin (CDC) with multiple functional groups is synthesized by microwave‐assisted copolymerization and used as flocculation to remove anionic dyes from wastewater. The experimental data show that the best removal ratios of the prepared CDC can reach 99.8% and 98.9% for acid black 172 and reactive orange C‐3R, respectively. In addition, the CDC can maintain good removal ability at different pH, temperature, and dye concentration. The excellent flocculation ability and wide application range endow the CDC flocculant with the potential application of anionic dye wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abiodegradability 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3adyes 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3ahuman health 3amicrowave treatment 3apH 3arisk 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aGuan, Guohao1 aLou, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0958-18551 aWang, Xuejun0 tStärke =.g2021 July, v. 73, no. 7-8 p.e2100047-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2021000473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245015300173506002800326520137100354592002801725506003701753650002301790650002201813650001201835650000901847650001801856650002001874650001001894650002501904650000901929650000701938650001501945650001401960650001301974650001601987650002202003650002202025650002002047650001602067650001302083650001102096651001402107700001202121700002302133700001902156773009202175856008002267852000902347655001202356IND60764495620221207100414.0170329e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076449562DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1801022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHAILU, HAILU WELDEKIROS10aSpecies diversity and utilization of bamboo to support lifeâ€™s the community of Karangwangi Village, Cidaun Sub-District of Cianjur, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aHailu HW, Sajidan, Pangastuti A, GreinerR. 2017. Isolation, characterization and 18S rDNA sequence analysis of phytase producing fungi from Indonesia, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: 10-14. Phytase breaks down the phytate portion of grains and oil seeds; thereby, releasing phosphorus and minerals for animals. The objectives of this research were to screen phytase-producing novel species of fungi; to conduct cultural and phylogenetic characterization; to perform 18S rDNA sequencing and BLAST analysis. Samples of fungi were collected from different sources, cultured on potato dextrose agar and potato dextrose broth. Phytase assay was conducted based on Vanadate-molybdate method. Three isolates with highest enzyme activity were selected for pH and temperature optimization. DNA was extracted by modifying plant DNA extraction and yeast genomic DNA extraction kits. The 18S rDNA gene was amplified and sequenced. The result indicated that optimum temperatures ranged from 60-75oC and the optimum pH for isolates from papaya (Angr), palm bark (Abark) and sugarcane soil field (Asoil) were 4.5, 3.0 and 4.5, respectively. Based on 18S rDNA sequence analysis the phytase producing fungal isolates Angr, Abark and Asoil were identical to Aspergillus niger, Beauveria felina and Nigrosabulum globosum, respectively.

Herein, metabolites, such as free sugars, and organic acids and antioxidant activity were determined in 10 new and 14 traditional apple cultivars. Additionally, the phenolic profiles of the apple pulp and peel were characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Major phenolic compounds in apples varied depending on the cultivar and tissue (i.e., peel or pulp). Among the new apple cultivars, Decobell and Tinkerbell, showed high antioxidant activity and contained higher phenolic compound content than other cultivars in the peel and pulp, respectively. Honggeum showed high phenolic content with similar sugar to acid ratio compared to popular traditional cultivars. In addition to antioxidant phenolic contents, metabolite profile information can be used to select apple cultivars for various purposes. For example, Indo can be selected for sweet apple taste because of its higher sugar to acid ratio. This information can be used to select apple cultivars for various purposes. For example, Decobell peel could be used as sources of food supplements and food additives, and Tinkerbell pulp can be utilized for apple juice making according to its metabolite profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapple juice 3aapple pulp 3aapples 3acultivars 3adietary supplements 3afood additives 3aglobal warming 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aorganic acids and salts 3aphenolic compounds 3asugars 3ataste1 aKu, Kyung-Hyung 1 aJeong, Moon-Cheol 1 aKwon, Soon-Il 1 aLee, Jihyun 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 May 20, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90504433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245013800174300001600312500002000328520127700348592002801625650000801653650001401661650002001675650002101695650001901716650001401735650001201749650002901761650002201790700002301812700002101835773009301856856008801949852000902037655001202046IND60572168020221118043045.0170712e199306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057216802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.1993.00867.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSloan, James S.10aPromoter analysis of a light‐regulated gene encoding hydroxypyruvate reductase, an enzyme of the photorespiratory glycolate pathway  ap. 867-874.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR) is a peroxisomal enzyme that catalyzes the NADH‐dependent reduction of hydroxypyruvate to glycerate in the photorespiratory glycolate pathway. HPR gene expression in cucumber seedlings is organ‐specific and light‐regulated. A 5.7 kb fragment of cucumber genomic DNA containing the entire HPR‐encoding gene, hpr‐A, plus 1069 bp OF 5′ flanking sequence was introduced into tobacco, as was a construct consisting of the upstream region (positions ‐ 1069 to +43) of the hpr‐A gene fused to the ß‐glucoronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Both constructs were expressed in the transgenic plants in an organspecific and light‐dependent manner. A deletion analysis of the 5’flanking sequence of the hpr‐A gene was conducted in transgenic tobacco. A construct in which the 5′‐flanking region had been deleted to within 299 bases of the transcription start site was sufficient to confer a high level of light‐regulated expression on the hpr‐A gene in the transgenic plants. However, deletion to position ‐218 resulted in a substantial reduction in expression. The region between positions ‐299 and ‐218 contains sequences resembling the 1 box and G box elements that are associated with other light‐regulated genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acucumbers 3agene expression 3aphotorespiration 3areporter genes 3aseedlings 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants1 aSchwartz, Brian W.1 aBecker, Wayne M.0 tplant journal.g1993 June, v. 3, no. 6 p.867-874dBlackwell Science Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.1993.00867.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01328naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245009000159300001600249520036900265592002800634650002300662650002300685650001600708650002600724650000900750650001300759700001600772700001800788773012600806856007300932852000901005655001201014IND60658356520221120221133.0190817e20090121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065835652DNAL7 a10.1039/b816920a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiberski, Albert10aInkjet fabrication of polymer microarrays and grids—solving the evaporation problem  ap. 334-336.  aPolymer microarrays, consisting of either discrete features or a matrix of inter-crossed lines were directly fabricated in situ by inkjet printing individual monomers and initiator solutions in organic solvents through a film of oil, thereby allowing the rapid generation of a broad range of co-polymers, while solving the problem of selective monomer evaporation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acomposite polymers 3aevaporation 3amicroarray technology 3aoils 3asolvents1 aZhang, Rong1 aBradley, Mark0 tChemical communications.g2009 Jan. 21, , no. 3 p.334-336dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b816920a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245008100179300001800260500000900278520161700287592002801904650004001932650001901972650001101991650001102002650001002013650001702023650001702040700001702057700002002074773012402094852000902218856009802227655001202325IND2048591620221121022016.0191122e199509  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204859162DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500050027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalaiz, T.

This practice can increase turfgrass susceptibility to heat and drought stress. Other cultural practices might be used to improve putting green quality and speed without additional stress. In this study, vertical mowing was used as a grooming technique to potentially improve putting green quality and speed. A ‘Penncross’ creeping bentgrass turf, established in 1986, was mowed daily at 3.2, 4.0, and 4.8 mm in combination with vertical mowing frequency treatments of 1 and 2 times per month, and a check of no vertical mowing. Mowing height and vertical mowing frequency effects on ball roll distance, turfgrass color and quality, and root production were evaluated in this study during 1989 and 1990. Vertical mowing treatments did not affect ball roll distance, turfgrass color and quality, or root production. Ball roll distance decreased by 0.2 m in 1989 and 0.4 m in 1990 as mowing height increased from 3.2 to 4.8 mm. Relative putting green speeds were rated as fast (i.e., > 2.6 m) across mowing height in 1989, and medium-fast to fast (i.e. 2.3–2.6 m) in 1990. Turfgrass color, quality, and root production increased with mowing height in 1989 and 1.0 unit in 1990. Turfgrass quality increased by 0.4 rating unit per mm increase in mowing height in 1989 and 1.0 unit in 1990. Root production at two soil depths of 75 to 150 mm and 150 to 225 mm increased with mowing height in 1990. Journal series no. 10770, Agric. Res.

The inherent unpredictability in determining and predicting Cuphea’s oil yield is attributed, in part, to the indeterminate growth habit and the persistence of the domestication syndrome of this semi-domesticated potential oilseed crop. Meta-analysis using multivariate statistical modeling, computer simulations, and custom profiling was carried out on a database collated from several studies carried out in growth chamber, greenhouse and field experiments. Meta-analyses identified the importance of, and quantified direct and indirect relationships and tradeoffs between and within functional traits classified within five interrelated plant modules. Several multivariate statistical analyses procedures were employed in predicting oil content and oil yield, as performance measures of Cuphea at the plant and population levels of integration. The most parsimonious partial least squares regression model identified plant-, capsule-, and seed-based traits that can be used in reconstructing the best configuration needed for high agronomic performance at the individual plant and population levels. Variance-based structural equation modeling suggested that the variation in relative growth rate was strongly linked to differences in specific leaf area and leaf mass ratio; both traits expressed large positive direct and indirect effects on oil yield, but not oil content. Results of custom profiling suggested that seed yield, oil% and oil yield can be optimized by trait adjustments within the phenotypic and metabolic modules. Adjustments to thousand-seed weight and protein content would influence seed yield, oil yield and oil%, in a decreasing order. Improvements in eco-physiological traits, nutrient ratios and structural traits would lead to a slightly higher oil% and eventually higher oil yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3araw materials 3astructural equation modeling 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aeconomic valuation 3aindeterminate growth 3aphenotype 3acomputer simulation 3aCuphea 3adatabases 3aleaves 3astatistical models 3aleaf area 3aoils 3aoilseed crops 3aseed yield 3adomestication 3aprediction 3alipid content 3ameta-analysis 3aecophysiology 3aregression analysis 3aagronomic traits 3aprotein content 3agrowth chambers 0aplant breeding0 tEuphytica.g2017 Sept., v. 213, no. 9 p.210-210dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/57952633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-017-1993-23Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/1749.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013900160300001800299520100400317592002801321650004401349650001301393650001401406650002301420650002301443650001301466650001701479650001701496650001101513650001401524650001701538650002401555650001001579650001301589650000901602700002301611700001901634700002501653773010401678856007501782852000901857655001201866IND60534077120170629000000.0160802e20130418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053407712DNAL7 a10.1021/ef302099e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLerici, Laura C.10aTertiary Recycling of Low-Density Polyethylene by Catalytic Cracking over ZSM-11 and BETA Zeolites Modified with Zn2+: Stability Study  ap. 2202-2208.  aThe behavior of Zn-ZSM-11 and Zn-BETA zeolites during the decomposition of low-density polyethylene has been studied in a batch, fixed-bed quartz reactor during successive reaction cycles without catalyst regeneration. The study of the reaction products evolved in the catalytic cracking showed that Zn-ZSM-11 zeolite maintained an essentially stable behavior during all the reaction cycles. On the other hand, Zn-BETA zeolite showed a decrease in the gaseous hydrocarbon fraction. The liquid hydrocarbons disappear after 100 min, and the waxes appear in the last three cycles of polymer cracking, which indicates a behavior similar to thermal degradation. The characterization results (TG, FTIR, and BET surface area) are consistent with the catalytic activity exhibited by both zeolites. The yields of accumulated coke increased steadily throughout the cycles up to maximum values of ∼6.5 and ∼21 wt % for Zn-ZSM-11 and Zn-BETA, respectively. These results were confirmed by TG under air flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aair flow 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acatalytic cracking 3acracking 3ahydrocarbons 3apolyethylene 3aquartz 3arecycling 3asurface area 3athermal degradation 3awaxes 3azeolites 3azinc1 aRenzini, María S.1 aSedran, Ulises1 aPierella, Liliana B.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Apr. 18, v. 27, no. 4 p.2202-2208dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef302099e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002600137245007500163300001600238520148100254592002801735650001201763650001401775650001501789650001601804650001201820650001101832650002201843650002001865650001501885650001601900650001701916651001201933773009601945856007102041852000902112655001202121IND60518504020221121161110.0160417e196903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051850402DNAL7 a10.2307/19348572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimberloff, Daniel S.10aExperimental Zoogeography of Islands: A Model for Insular Colonization  ap. 296-314.  aA distinction is made between immigration rate (in spp./time) for an island, and invasion rate (in propagules/time) for a species and an island. An analogous distinction is drawn between an island extinction rate and a species extinction rate (or intrinsic probability of extinction in a given time interval). It is claimed that the most objective definition for "propagule" is any animal of group capable of population increase under any conceivable circumstances. Immigration and island extinction curves are unique only if plotted against time, not against number of species. A model for non—interactive colonization is discussed, and its equilibrium number of species, ° derived. It is shown that data from the defaunated Florida Keys can be interpreted as arising from non—interactive colonization to an ° near the non—interactive ° (and to a point above a more enduring interactive °), followed by a slow decline in ° (as population sizes and interaction increase) to an enduring ° near that obtaining before defaunation. The effect on this scheme of increasing distance from source area is shown, and a simulation of the non—interactive part of the scheme was performed with corroborates that part of the model. Explicit equations for the "expected" colonization, immigration, and island extinction curves are given for non—interactive colonization, and predictions are given about the general changes in these curves as interaction becomes significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aequations 3aextinction 3aimmigration 3aislands 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3aprobability 3azoogeography 3aFlorida0 tEcology.g1969 Mar., v. 50, no. 2 p.296-314dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19348573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245011200177520161700289592002801906650004401934650001201978650002001990650001502010650001802025650001802043650001502061650001202076650001702088650001902105650001702124650000902141650001402150650002002164651001902184651001902203651001202222653002702234653002002261653002802281653001402309653001302323700002502336700002202361773011502383856008302498852000902581655001202590IND60702729320221120080907.0200831e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070272932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2020.1013652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFred-Ahmadu, Omowunmi H.10aMicroplastics distribution and characterization in epipsammic sediments of tropical Atlantic Ocean, Nigeria  aRecent reports indicate that microplastics (MPs) show both temporal and spatial variations therefore, regional data collection and environmental dynamics are vital aspects of understanding the underlying sources and factors that influence the abundance and dispersion of the plastic particles. This paper presents a baseline report on the abundance of microplastics across three tidal waterlines (high, drift and current) of the tropical Atlantic ecosystem. Microplastics (1 – 5 mm) occurrence and distribution in epipsammic sediments of five beaches in Lagos, Nigeria (Gulf of Guinea) were assessed. The microplastics were extracted by density flotation using saturated solution of NaCl and the identification of polymer types was done by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, ATR-FTIR. Results showed significant variations in the population of MPs in the three tidal waterlines with the high and drift waterlines accounting for 58.83% and 41.16% of the total MPs, respectively while no MPs were detected in the current waterline sediment. Polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene were the most abundant polymers recorded. Fragments were predominantly detected and pre-production pellets formed only 5.27% of total microplastics. Polymer risk index calculations showed low to medium risk of the microplastics found and local hydrodynamic conditions such as Ocean surges and current intensity were observed to influence the distribution and dispersion of microplastics. Continuous monitoring of MPs abundance is necessary to minimize the polymers’ risk to the ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeaches 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3ahydrodynamics 3amicroplastics 3amonitoring 3apellets 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3arisk 3asediments 3asodium chloride 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aGulf of Guinea 3aNigeria 0aMicroplastic pollution 0aTidal waterline 0aHydrodynamic conditions 0aFragments 0aATR-FTIR1 aAyejuyo, Olusegun O.1 aBenson, Nsikak U.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2020 July, v. 38 p.101365-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2020.1013653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245022200172300001600394520130700410592002801717650004301745650001801788650002001806650001701826650001601843650001901859650001901878650001201897650001701909650002001926650002201946650001101968650002901979650001102008650002402019650001402043650001202057650001402069650001302083650001702096653000802113653000802121653000702129653000802136653000702144653000702151653000902158653000802167653000802175653000802183653000802191653000802199653000802207653000802215653001802223653001602241653002402257653001402281653002202295700002202317773010902339856008602448852000902534655001202543IND60585418720221120081014.0190319e20180209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058541872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhanbari, Fardin10aControlled drought stress affects the chilling-hardening capacity of tomato seedlings as indicated by changes in phenol metabolisms, antioxidant enzymes activity, osmolytes concentration and abscisic acid accumulation  ap. 167-174.  aTo elucidate the physiological, biochemical and hormonal mechanisms of chilling stress mitigated by drought pretreatment, tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. C.H Falat) were pretreated by 0, 10 and 20% Polyethylene glycol (PEG) for 7days followed by subjecting to chilling stress at 3°C for 6days and 6h per day. Results showed that PEG-induced drought improved growth rate of tomato seedling subjected to chilling stress and enhanced their antioxidant enzyme activity, abscisic acid (ABA), anthocyanin accumulation, potassium (K+) and proline content compared with the control (0% PEG) at the end of chilling stress period. PEG pretreatment provided significant protection against chilling stress and reduced poly phenol oxidase (PPO) activity, electrolyte leakage (EL) and H2O2 content in root and leaf of chilled seedlings. Moreover, when PEG pretreatment was applied with chilling stress, we observed an alleviation in the growth impeding and a decrease in chilling symptoms as compared to control seedlings. The highest chilling tolerance was induced by application 20% of PEG. In general, the results indicate that PEG-induced drought, by altering in some tolerant responses, could be effectively used to protect tomato’s seedling from the adverse effects of low temperatures stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aabscisic acid 3aadverse effects 3aanthocyanins 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3acold treatment 3adrought 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aphenol 3apolyethylene glycol 3apotassium 3aproline 3aseedlings 3atomatoes 3awater stress 0aABA 0aCAT 0aCI 0aChl 0aEC 0aEL 0aH2O2 0aPOD 0aPEG 0aPPO 0aROS 0aRDW 0aSDW 0aSOD 0aAbscisic acid 0aAnthocyanin 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aHardening 0aHydrogen peroxide1 aSayyari, Mohammad0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 Feb. 09, v. 229 p.167-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2017.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013700170300002000307520161000327592002801937650001201965650001401977650001701991650001702008650001102025650000902036650001202045650001502057650001102072650001702083650001102100650001302111650001102124650002302135650001702158650001302175650001602188650002502204650001102229650001002240650001102250653002302261653002702284653001702311653001502328653001502343700001902358700002002377700002102397700002702418700003202445773014302477856008602620852000902706655001202715IND60722373920221120075909.0210422e20200921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072237392DNAL7 a10.1080/15538362.2020.17859872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZevallos, Lady10aMixing Design for Optimizing Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction of Phenolic Components and Anthocyanins from Blue Berries and Grape Marc  ap. S1313-S1327.  aWaste from fruit processing can be used for obtaining additives as colorants and antioxidant compounds by extraction processes. Despite there are many works optimizing parameters as temperature and solvent concentration during this process, the mixture of solvents has not been optimized yet. Therefore, the present work aimed to find the optimum solvent mixture among water, ethanol, and acetone to obtain the maximum yields of phenolic compounds and monomeric anthocyanins from blue berry and grape marc by ultrasound-assisted extraction. For that, the Reticular Simplex Mixtures Design was used to obtain the models that can predict the optimum values of extraction yields. As a result, the quadratic model successfully fit the experimental data, demonstrating the best mixture solvents were the ones that presented a high percentage of water. This result was obtained not only for phenolic compound, but also for monomeric anthocyanin extraction from blue berry and grape marc. Further, using the optimum mixture, values of 502.2 GAE/100 g of phenolic compound and 1349.1 mg/100 g of monomeric anthocyanins from blue berry and 2642.4 GAE/100 g of phenolic compounds and 31.5 mg/100 of monomeric anthocyanins from grape marc were obtained. In conclusion, the optimum solvent demonstrated to be efficient extracting both components increasing the extraction yields and reducing the cost of extraction. Finally, by overlapping the optimization plot, a unique solvent mixture for obtaining a high yield of phenolic compound and anthocyanins at the same time from blue berry and grape marc was obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aadditives 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidants 3adesign 3adyes 3aethanol 3aextraction 3afruits 3agrape pomace 3amixing 3amixtures 3amodels 3aphenolic compounds 3asmall fruits 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3awastes 3awater 3ayields 0aPhenolic compounds 0amonomeric anthocyanins 0aoptimization 0ablue berry 0agrape marc1 aCaldas, César1 aFlores, Alberto1 aObregón, Jesús1 aMiano, Alberto Claudio1 aBarraza-Jáuregui, Gabriela0 tInternational journal of fruit science.g2020 Sept. 21, v. 20, no.

In many developing countries, they constitute the most widely used treatment process, and incorporate the important function of pathogen removal. Because of this wide utilisation, ponds have been extensively studied, resulting in new insights on the disinfection mechanisms, thus leading to more efficient systems and lower land and volume requirements. The previous “black-box” approach for pond design is being substituted by a more conceptual view resulting from a better understanding of pathogen removal mechanisms. This review manuscript aims at gathering previous and current research done on this matter, concentrating on coliforms, and evaluating the following mechanisms and influencing factors: temperature; sedimentation and attachment; dissolved oxygen and pH levels; sunlight-mediated disinfection (in combination with DO and pH) and dark inactivation/repair; biological disinfection (predation, starvation and competition); algal toxins; depth and hydraulic retention time; physical design and hydrodynamic behaviour. Gaps that still need to be filled are identified, which could still lead to further optimisation of waste stabilisation ponds performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoliform bacteria 3adisinfection 3adissolved oxygen 3ahydrodynamics 3apH 3apathogens 3aphycotoxins 3aponds 3apredation 3astarvation 3atemperature 3awaste lagoons 3awastes 3awastewater treatment1 aPassos, R.

The islands are covered by a tent and fumigated with methyl bromide at concentrations that are lethal to arthropods but not to the plants. Seven islands in Florida Bay, of varying distance and direction from immigrant sources, were censused exhaustively. The small size (diameter 11—18 m) and ecological simplicity of these islands, which consist solely of red mangrove trees (Rhizophora mangle) with no supratidal ground, allowed the location and identification of all resident species. The terrestrial fauna of these islands is composed almost exclusively of arboreal arthropods, with 20—50 species usually present at any given moment. Surveys of these taxa throughout the Florida Keys, with emphasis on the inhabitants of mangrove forests, were made during 1967 in order to estimate the size and composition of the "species pool." The seven experimental islands were defaunated in late 1966 and early 1967, and the colonists were monitored for 17—20 man—hours every 18 days. Precautions were taken to avoid artificial introductions during the monitoring periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizophora mangle 3aarthropods 3afauna 3aislands 3amangrove forests 3amethyl bromide 3amonitoring 3asurveys 3atrees 3azoogeography 3aFlorida1 aSimberloff, Daniel S.0 tEcology.g1969 Mar., v. 50, no. 2 p.267-278dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19348553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007200160300001800232520161500250592002801865650001301893650001401906650001301920650001201933650001401945650002001959650001101979650001901990650001202009650001402021650001602035700002402051700002402075773010402099856007502203852000902278655001202287IND60534077220221116184047.0160802e20130418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053407722DNAL7 a10.1021/ef302117j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulsen, Alex D.14aThe Role of Sample Dimension and Temperature in Cellulose Pyrolysis  ap. 2126-2134.  aFast pyrolysis of biomass is a next-generation biofuels production process that is capable of converting solid lignocellulosic materials (in their raw form) to a transportable liquid (bio-oil) which can be catalytically hydrogenated to fuels and chemicals. While biomass fast pyrolysis has enormous potential to produce renewable fuels, an understanding of the fundamental chemistry that converts biomass components, such as cellulose, to bio-oil is not available in the literature. In this work, we use thin-film pyrolysis to reveal the effect of temperature under transport-free reaction conditions and then evaluate the effect of sample dimension (i.e., characteristic length scale) by comparing product distributions of conventional powders and thin films. In the first part of the work, we show that the yield of total furan rings (i.e., all products containing a five-membered furan ring) does not change significantly with increased reaction temperature compared to other pyrolysis products, such as light oxygenates and anhydrosugars. However, we find that the functional groups bound to the furan ring (e.g., alcohols and aldehydes) are easily cleaved to produce smaller furans. In the second part of the work, we show that sample dimension is a key descriptor for product yields. For example, levoglucosan (the most abundant product of cellulose pyrolysis) yield differs significantly between conventional powder (millimeter-sized samples which are transport-limited) pyrolysis and thin-film (micrometer-scale thin-films which are isothermal) pyrolysis (49% for powder; 27% for thin-film at 500 °C).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acellulose 3afuel production 3afurans 3alignocellulose 3apowders 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aMettler, Matthew

To evaluate the ecological and economic impacts of this massive mortality event, researchers and land managers need to efficiently track its progression, spread, and severity across large spatial extents. In this study, mortality severity (0–100% dead) was successfully mapped at the Landsat pixel scale (30 × 30 m) across a large (5000 km2), persistently cloud-covered study area using multi-sensor (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)) harmonized tasseled cap image composites as spectral predictors of gray stage spruce beetle mortality. Our maps display the distribution and severity of this landscape-scale mortality event in 2011 (R2 = 0.48, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 7.7) and 2015 (R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 11.6). Potential applications of this study include efficient landscape-scale forest health monitoring, targeted forest and timber management, and assessment of ecological impacts of bark beetle outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data  cNASAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000104  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDendroctonus rufipennis 3aLandsat 3aPicea engelmannii 3abark beetles 3adeath 3aeconomic impact 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest health 3aforests 3amonitoring 3amortality 3athematic maps 3atimber management 3aColorado1 aEvangelista, Paul Harrison1 aVorster, Anthony Grant0 tForests.g2018 June 07, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90603363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01373naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245019900162300001600361520018300377592002800560650002000588650001300608650000900621650001600630650001700646650001100663653002800674653001000702653003000712700002600742700001900768773015000787856007700937852000901014655001201023IND60521701020221122054234.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052170102DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1983-04012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoll, Matthias10aÜber Darstellung und Eigenschaften von Na[η3 -C3H5Fe(NO)(CO)CN] und η3 -C3H5Fe(NO)(CO)CNMe/Synthesis and Properties of Na[η3-C3H5Fe(NO)(CO)CN] and η3 -C3H5Fe(NO)(CO)CNMe (η3 -C3H5 = Allyl)  ap. 409-410.  aThe allyl iron complexes η³ -C₃H₅Fe(NO)(CO)L (L = CN-, CNMe) can be obtained by the reaction of η³ -C₃H₅Fe(NO)(CO)₂ with NaN(SiMe₃)₂ and subsequent methylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acyanides 3airon 3amethylation 3anitric oxide 3asodium 0aAllyl Nitrosyl Carbonyl 0aCyano 0aIsonitrile Iron Complexes1 aSeibold, Hans-Jürgen1 aMerbach, Peter0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 38, no. 4 p.409-410dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1983-04013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009200162300001300254520121800267592002801485650002101513650001501534650001301549650001801562650001401580650001401594650001701608650001601625650001201641700001101653700001701664700001501681700001301696700001201709773010801721856004801829852000901877655001201886IND50062178620221119231916.0130321e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006217862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-012-1387-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xupei10aCO₂ Capture with Activated Carbons Prepared by Petroleum Coke and KOH at Low Pressure  ap. 1387.  aIn this study, high surface area porous carbons were synthesized by chemical activation using petroleum coke as the precursor and KOH as the activation agent. The pore structure of the as-synthesized activated carbons was characterized by nitrogen adsorption, and their CO₂ sorption capacities were measured by a magnetic suspension balance at 1 and 10 bar, respectively. The effects of activated carbon preparation parameters (preheating temperature, preheating time, activation time, heating rate during the pyrolysis, and particle size of the precursor) on porous texture, CO₂ adsorption capacity, and CO₂/N₂ selectivity of the activated products were investigated. It has been found that at 1 bar, the CO₂ adsorption capacity is determined by the micropore contribution, i.e., the ratio between micropore surface area and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the sorbents, while at 10 bar, CO₂ adsorption capacity is related to the BET surface area of the activated products. The maximum CO₂ adsorption uptake of 15.1 wt% together with CO₂/N₂ selectivity of 9.4 at 1 bar were obtained for a sample activated at 700 °C indicating its high potential in the capture of CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3apetroleum 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atexture1 aFu, Yi1 aHu, Gengshen1 aShen, Yang1 aDai, Wei1 aHu, Xin0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2013 Jan., v. 224, no. 1 p.1387-1387dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-012-1387-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008200168300001600250520138500266592002801651650001501679650001101694650001801705650001601723653003101739653004901770653001701819653003001836653002401866700001501890700001401905700001701919700001401936700001501950773009001965856008502055852000902140655001202149IND60629129020221119114047.0190320e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062912902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Lingfeng10aDynamic tests of CO2-Based waste heat recovery system with preheating process  ap. 270-283.  aFor engine waste heat recovery, CO2-based Transcritical Rankine Cycle (CTRC) system with preheating process has a strong capability of combining exhaust gas and engine coolant, thereby leading to improvement of output, efficiency improvement and the reduction in cooling load reduction. In previous researches, all the benefits were achieved and investigated mainly under ideal and stable engine conditions in previous researches. But in this study, various engine conditions were considered for a preheated CTRC test bench, namely starting and ‘warm up’ condition, stopping and idling condition, restarting condition and random condition. After system parameters (e.g. pressure, temperature) were measured, heat absorption quantity was calculated, and meanwhile net power output and thermal efficiency were estimated. The results show that the preheating process can improve the dynamic performance of the CTRC at various engine conditions. Firstly, the preheating process is beneficial for continuous output capacity and safe operation of CTRC. Besides, the preheating process also can avoid the sudden rise in the expansion inlet pressure under the stopping condition of engine, and meanwhile it plays an important energy supplement role in the random conditions of the engine, resulting in the cross change in the waste heat absorption from engine coolant and exhaust gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3aheat recovery 3atemperature 0aEngine waste heat recovery 0aCO2-based transcritical Rankine cycle (CTRC) 0aDynamic test 0aVarious engine conditions 0aPreheating benefits1 aShu, Gequn1 aTian, Hua1 aChen, Tianyu1 aLiu, Peng1 aLi, Ligeng0 tEnergy.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 171 p.270-283dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012300162300002000285520115800305592002801463650003501491650001201526650001301538650001101551650002801562650001501590650002201605650001101627650001401638650001601652700002001668700001601688700002101704700002201725700001701747700001901764773014401783856007401927852000902001655001202010IND60671195120221118173447.0191002e20151110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067119512DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta05279c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRupp, Ghislain M.10aSurface chemistry of La₀.₆Sr₀.₄CoO₃₋δ thin films and its impact on the oxygen surface exchange resistance  ap. 22759-22769.  aThe surface composition of dense La₀.₆Sr₀.₄CoO₃₋δ (LSC) thin film model electrodes, deposited by pulsed laser deposition at 600 °C on yttria-stabilized zirconia (100) electrolytes, was investigated by low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) and time resolved inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results obtained by both methods agree qualitatively and quantitatively and provide a comprehensive picture of the surface composition and cation diffusion kinetics of LSC. The measurements revealed that freshly prepared LSC thin films already show a Sr-rich and Co-poor termination layer (80% Sr surface coverage). This Sr-rich surface layer was proven to be an equilibrium property of LSC as it forms again at elevated temperatures after removal. The kinetics of this surface reconstruction is surprisingly fast (<1 h at 550 °C) and indicates high Sr mobility in LSC. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements at 400 °C revealed the detrimental effect of this surface layer on the oxygen surface exchange and suggest that higher Co concentrations in the termination layer facilitate the oxygen exchange reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acations 3aceramics 3acobalt 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3afilms (materials) 3aoxygen 3astrontium 3atemperature1 aTéllez, Helena1 aDruce, John1 aLimbeck, Andreas1 aIshihara, Tatsumi1 aKilner, John1 aFleig, Jürgen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Nov. 10, v. 3, no. 45 p.22759-22769dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta05279c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03625naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245008600201300001800287500002000305520139200325592002801717596007101745596007101816596005401887596005901941596004202000596004702042596004402089596004402133596009202177596006502269596003202334596005002366596003202416650001702448650001702465650001002482650003002492650001402522650002302536650001702559650001602576650001402592650001202606650002102618651001102639700002002650700005602670700002302726700002002749700002102769700002002790773013002810856007402940852000903014655001203023IND60758250220221118061911.0211127e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075825022DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.134352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrásová, Jarmila1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5825-486110aBiogeography of Angolan rodents: The first glimpse based on phylogenetic evidence  ap. 2571-2583.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Assessment of phylogenetic diversity and biogeographical affinities of the rodent fauna from one of the most neglected areas in Africa. LOCATION: Angola (with biogeographical implications in adjacent areas). METHODS: Inference of mitochondrial phylogenies for rodent genera occurring in Angola, delimitation of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs), assessment and comparative analysis of their geographical distribution. RESULTS: We provide the first genetic evidence for the presence of 44 rodent taxa from 19 genera and 5 families in Angola, including twelve MOTUs endemic to Angola, and 12 candidate new species, pending integrative taxonomic revisions. The endemic MOTUs were found almost exclusively in the Angolan Miombo Woodlands and in Angolan montane forest−grassland mosaic. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The highly diverse Angolan rodent fauna is mostly composed of and shows affinities with taxa originating from three major biogeographical regions of sub‐Saharan Africa (Zambezian, South African and Congolian). It is also composed of a unique fauna comprising palaeoendemics from the Angolan Highlands. The species richness and the endemism detected in the Angolan montane forest−grassland mosaic and in the Angolan escarpment forests suggest that these are relevant for conservation, but more studies including other biological groups are needed to fundament this.  aPublisher supplied data  aGAJU 018/2017/PcJihočeská Univerzita v Českých Budějovicích  aGAJU 048/2019/PcJihočeská Univerzita v Českých Budějovicích  a20‐10222ScGrantová Agentura České Republiky  a41‐20‐07091JcGrantová Agentura České Republiky  a20‐10222ScCzech Science Foundation  a41‐20‐07091JcCzech Science Foundation  a048/2019/PcUniversity of South Bohemia  a018/2017/PcUniversity of South Bohemia  cSouthern African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adaptive Land Management  a01LG1201McGerman Federal Ministry of Education and Research  aSFRH/PD/BD/140810/2018cFCT  aEuropeAid/156423/DD/ACT/MulticEuropean Union  cNational Geographic Society 3aBrachystegia 3abiogeography 3afauna 3ageographical distribution 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3amitochondria 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3arodents 3aspecies richness 3aAngola1 aMikula, Ondřej1 aBryja, Josef1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0516-77421 aBaptista, Ninda L.1 aAntónio, Telmo1 aAghová, Tatiana1 aŠumbera, Radim0 tDiversity & distributions.g2021 Dec., v. 27, no. 12 p.2571-2583dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.134353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004200151245011900193300001600312520100300328592002801331650001201359650001901371650002001390650001101410650001201421650001301433650001101446650001601457650002301473650001001496653002501506653002301531653001201554653002201566653002001588700002501608700003001633700002901663700002301692773011601715856008601831852000901917655001201926IND60112559720221121190602.0190410e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011255972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2013.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez de Lerma, María de las Nieves10aFeasibility of an electronic nose to differentiate commercial Spanish wines elaborated from the same grape variety  ap. 790-796.  aFive wines obtained from the same grape variety and viticultural zone were analyzed by gas chromatographic (GC), chemical (CA) and electronic nose (E-Nose) techniques. The principal component (PC) analysis based on the concentration of 11 volatile compounds, volatile acidity, ethanol, glycerol and 2,3-butanediol provides 2 PCs allowing 5 different groups to be established. Nevertheless 4 different groups of wines were obtained by means of the first 2 PCs from E-Nose data. Wines with an ethanol content of 18% (v/v) and different concentration in ethyl esters were not discriminated by the E-Nose, showing that new sensors will be required for its differentiation. A good linear correlation (R=0.909) was obtained between a combination of the PCs from the E-Nose data and those from GC-CA. The E-Nose is revealed as a rapid tool to differentiate among wines obtained by different elaboration techniques, helping to protect the quality of wines produced in the Protected Denominations of Origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3achromatography 3aelectronic nose 3aesters 3aethanol 3aglycerol 3agrapes 3aviticulture 3avolatile compounds 3awines 0aWine differentiation 0aVolatile compounds 0aPolyols 0aChemical analysis 0aElectronic nose1 aBellincontro, Andrea1 aGarcía-Martínez, Teresa1 aMencarelli, F.q(Fabio),1 aMoreno, Juan José0 tFood research international.g2013 May, v. 51, no. 2 p.790-796dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2013.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245011300181300001900294520087400313592002801187650002001215650000901235650002101244650001301265650002601278650001301304650002201317650001301339650001201352650001401364650002301378650001401401650001701415650001001432651001201442653001001454653001601464653002401480653002101504653001301525700002701538773014201565856008601707852000901793655001201802IND60722374120221120101030.0210422e20200921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072237412DNAL7 a10.1080/15538362.2020.17864872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdenuga, Omotayo Olalekan10aDiversity Analysis of Cacao (Theobroma Cacao) Genotypes in Nigeria Based on Juvenile Phenotypic Plant Traits  ap.

The field trials were conducted in Ibadan (7° 13ʹN, 3° 51ʹE), and Owena (7° 11ʹN, 5° 1ʹE), Nigeria. Juvenile performance data were subjected to ANOVA, Principal Component and Cluster analyses. The first three principal axes accounted for 34.41%, 16.71%, and 14.09% of variation among the plant characters, respectively. Numerical taxonomy showed P₂ x P₁₁ as the most distinct. The FASTCLUS technique grouped the genotypes into four clusters, P₂ x P₁₁ being the only member of its group. There is significant genetic diversity among the genotypes, while plant height, stem diameter, Cherelle wilt, fruiting, and tree size among others are important discriminatory traits among cacao genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3aaxes 3acluster analysis 3adiameter 3afield experimentation 3afruiting 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3ajuveniles 3anumerical taxonomy 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3atrees 3aNigeria 0aCacao 0avariability 0aprincipal component 0acluster analysis 0aFASTCLUS1 aAriyo, Omolayo Johnson0 tInternational journal of fruit science.g2020 Sept. 21, v. 20, no.

The flow field in the rotor, static and dynamic characteristics of normal blades and four abnormal blades combinations under rotating stall are compared. The results show that the abnormal blades have no effect on the number of stall cells. Compared with the normal blades, in the case of non-stall or stall conditions, the positive deflection blades will increase the surface stress of the blade, and the negative deflection blades can reduce it; deformation distribution also has the same law. The deformation distribution of blades is affected by both aerodynamic and centrifugal loading. However, the stress distribution of the blades is mainly affected by centrifugal loading. By modal analysis, the total deformation distribution of the first to fourth-order vibration modes are obtained. The first to third-order vibration modes show the coupling vibration between the blades and hub, and the fourth order is the blade vibration alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablades 3adeformation 3aequations 3amodels 3aturbulent flow 3avibration 0aAxial fan 0aMoving blade angle 0aNumerical simulation 0aFluid-solid coupling 0aRotating stall1 aHe, Ruiyang1 aWang, Xin1 aZhang, Qian1 aWang, Songling0 tEnergy.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 170 p.305-325dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010400169300001600273500001500289520154600304592002801850650001401878650002301892650001001915650001301925650002301938650001201961650001701973650001501990650001602005650001702021650001102038650001702049650000902066650001202075650001202087650001802099650001102117650001002128650001202138650000702150650001002157653001002167700002102177700002102198700002202219700002202241773012802263856008102391852000902472655001202481IND4469500820221118033339.0141112e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446950082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedoski, Helenia D.10aSensory evaluation and quality indicators of nutritionally-enhanced egg product with ω-3 rich oils  ap. 459-464.  a2019-12-06  aNutritionally-enhanced low-cholesterol egg sticks were fortified with ω-3 rich oils (algae, menhaden, flaxseed, canola oil and a blend of these with krill oil); quality indicators were measured and sensory evaluations were conducted. Store-bought eggs were separated and egg whites were mixed with oil, spray dried egg whites, annatto (color) and salt. Experimental egg batters and mixed liquid whole egg (control) were cooked in the shape of a cheese stick, vacuum-packed, and stored at 4 °C. Quality indicators (color (L*, a*, b*), texture, pH and lipid oxidation) of egg sticks were measured over a 14-d storage period. There were differences in color, texture and pH between samples (P < 0.05); but these differences were independent of time (P > 0.05). No trend in lipid oxidation was seen over storage time (P > 0.05). Egg sticks were evaluated by a consumer panel of 56 participants for color, odor, flavor, texture between fingers, mouth feel and overall acceptability with a 9-point scale (1 = dislike extremely; 9 = like extremely). Panelists also ranked samples for preference. Differences were reported in attributes between samples (P < 0.05) but all samples were positively perceived, with a combined average overall acceptability score of 5.9. Ranking results support this conclusion with no significant differences in preference (P > 0.05). The results indicate that the experimental eggs were accepted by consumers on the same level as mixed whole eggs and suggest market potential for this type of product.  aPublisher supplied data 3amouthfeel 3alipid peroxidation 3aodors 3amenhaden 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3aspray drying 3acanola oil 3aegg albumen 3astorage time 3aflavor 3aegg products 3aeggs 3amarkets 3abatters 3aBixa orellana 3amixing 3asalts 3acheeses 3apH 3acolor 0aAlgae1 aBeamer, Sarah K.1 aJaczynski, Jacek1 aPartington, Susan1 aMatak, Kristen E.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2012 July, v. 47, no. 2 p.459-464dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006400157300001600221520145200237592002801689650002101717650001301738650001201751650001101763650002901774650001401803650001101817650001001828650002601838650002501864650001301889650001601902650001001918650002201928650001901950650002501969650001301994700002002007700002302027700002002050773012202070856007502192852000902267655001202276IND60535809920221120123325.0160805e20150106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053580992DNAL7 a10.1021/es504424v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, David
T.10aEstrone Degradation: Does Organic Matter (Quality), Matter?  ap. 498-503.  aUnderstanding the parameters that drive E1 degradation is necessary to improve existing wastewater treatment systems and evaluate potential treatment options. Organic matter quality could be an important parameter. Microbial communities grown from activated sludge seeds using different dissolved organic matter sources were tested for E1 degradation rates. Synthetic wastewater was aged, filter-sterilized, and used as a carbon and energy source to determine if recalcitrant organic carbon enhances E1 degradation. Higher E1 degradation was observed by biomass grown on 8 d old synthetic wastewater compared to biomass grown on fresh synthetic wastewater (P = 0.033) despite much lower concentrations of bacteria. Minimal or no E1 degradation was observed in biomass grown on 2 d old synthetic wastewater. Organic carbon analyses suggest that products of cell lysis or microbial products released under starvation stress stimulate E1 degradation. Additional water sources were also tested: lake water, river water, and effluents from a municipal wastewater treatement plant and a treatment wetland. E1 degradation was only observed in biomass grown in treatment effluent. Nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and trace element concentrations were not causative factors for E1 degradation. In both experiments, spectrophotometric analyses reveal degradation of E1 is associated with microbially derived organic carbon but not general recalcitrance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abacteria 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adissolved organic matter 3aeffluents 3aenergy 3alakes 3amicrobial communities 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3ariver water 3aseeds 3aspectral analysis 3atrace elements 3awastewater treatment 3awetlands1 aTemme, Hanna R.1 aArnold, William A.1 aNovak, Paige J.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Jan. 06, v. 49, no. 1 p.498-503dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes504424v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245010400178300002000282520090500302592002801207650001501235650001101250650002301261650001701284650001101301650001101312650000901323650001101332650003101343650001001374650001301384650002201397650002301419650001401442650001101456651001001467653002301477653001801500653003701518653002401555700001901579700003001598700002301628773014301651856008601794852000901880655001201889IND60722372820221120182106.0210422e20200921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072237282DNAL7 a10.1080/15538362.2020.17751612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbhuiya, Rahul Islam10aMass Modeling of Indian Coffee Plum (Flacourtia Jangomas) Fruit with Its Physicochemical Properties  ap.

It has good medicinal, nutritional and economic value. The research was conducted to investigate the physical, mechanical, biochemical and thermal properties of the fruit and to determine the mass modeling of the fruit depending on its various dimensional attributes. Models like S-curve, Power and Quadratic models were used to predict the mass of the fruit. It was found that mass could be predicted best when models were based on length, thickness and volume. The quadratic and power models showed the best relation between the mass and dimensional parameters of the fruit. The physicochemical characterization and mass modeling of the Indian coffee plum fruit would help in the design and development of various processing, handling, and storage equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlacourtia 3adesign 3aeconomic valuation 3afruit weight 3afruits 3alength 3amass 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplums 3aresearch 3astorage equipment 3athermal properties 3athickness 3avolume 3aIndia 0aIndian coffee plum 0amass modeling 0aphysicochemical characterization 0aflacourtia jangomas1 aNath, Debarshi1 aSiṃha, Suśīlakumāra,1 aDwivedi, Madhuresh0 tInternational journal of fruit science.g2020 Sept. 21, v. 20, no.

In Brazil, VL control involves culling of seropositive dogs, among other actions. However, the most employed serological tests lack accuracy, and are not able to detect canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) during the early stages of infection. Early detection of CVL is highly desirable in order to shorten the contact time between the infected reservoirs and the vectors. In this study, we investigated the ability of two multiepitope proteins, PQ10 and PQ20, to detect CVL at earlier stages than currently employed methods, including ITS-1 conventional PCR. Using serum samples from naturally infected dogs, we observed that ELISA-PQ10 and ELISA-PQ20 were able to detect Leishmania infection at earlier time points as compared with kDNA PCR-RFLP in anti-IgG and anti-IgM assays. Using sera from experimentally infected dogs, we monitored seroconversion using multiepitope proteins, ELISA-crude antigen, as well as ITS-1 conventional and real-time PCR. While seroconversion was detected by ELISA-crude antigen in 16.6% of the dogs, multiepitope proteins were able to detect seroconversion in more than 80% of them. Moreover, the ability of ELISA-PQ10 and ELISA-PQ20 to detect Leishmania infection at earlier time points as compared with conventional PCR was also confirmed in experimental infection dogs’ sera. Immunofluorescence to Babesia canis and Ehrlichia canis did not show cross-reactions with ELISA-PQ10/PQ20 positive samples. Results of real-time PCR and ELISA with multiepitope proteins were very similar, with concordances between 80 and 100%. Furthermore, our findings indicated that PQ10 and PQ20 immunoassays can be related to parasite load. ELISA-PQ10 and ELISA-PQ20 are more sensitive diagnostic tools for early CVL detection as compared with other methods They could potentially be used in screening tests due to easy execution and low costs facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia canis 3aEhrlichia canis 3aLeishmania infantum 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3adiagnostic techniques 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aetiological agents 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3akinetoplast DNA 3aparasite load 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ascreening 3aseroconversion 3aseroprevalence 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aBrazil 0aCT 0aCVL 0aELISA 0aIFAT 0aITS-1 0akDNA 0aPCR 0aRFLP 0aVL 0aW 0aVisceral leishmaniasis 0aSerology 0aCanine diagnosis 0aELISA 0aMultiepitope proteins 0aLeishmania infantum1 aPires, Simone da Fonseca1 aReis, Alexandre Barbosa1 aCoura-Vital, Wendel1 aSilveira, Júlia Angélica Gonçalves da1 aSousa, Gabriela Matos de1 aBueno, Melissa Luíza Couto1 aGazzinelli, Ricardo Tostes1 aAndrade, Hélida Monteiro de0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 248 p.62-67dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2017.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245010500184300001600289520093600305592002801241650001501269650002001284650001801304650002001322650001501342650001701357650002501374650002101399653001801420653002901438653002001467653002501487653001501512653001501527700003201542700002501574700003001599700002701629773011301656856008601769852000901855655001201864IND60616248620221119202235.0181127e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061624862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.2042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagalhães, Antonio Irineudo10aTechno-economic analysis of downstream processes in itaconic acid production from fermentation broth  ap. 336-348.  aItaconic acid is a biomolecule with potential application in various products, substituting feedstocks within the petrochemical industry. Simulations of different downstream trains were done to compare the method currently used in industry for recovery of itaconic acid with a) adsorption, b) reactive extraction and c) electrodialysis, to evaluate the most advantageous process considering production costs. In these simulations, adsorption is the method with greater potential to substitute the crystallization as the main downstream method, followed by reactive extraction, which showed values close to those of crystallization. The only non-competitive method was electrodialysis. The processing costs of itaconic acid were estimated at 1.13 US$ kg−1 for the upstream and fermentation, and extra 0.89, 0.63, 0.88, 1.50 US$ kg−1 for crystallization, adsorption, extraction, and electrodialysis-based processes, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acrystallization 3aculture media 3aelectrodialysis 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3aoil and gas industry 3aproduction costs 0aItaconic acid 0aTechno-economic analysis 0aProduction cost 0aDownstream processes 0aAdsorption 0aExtraction1 aCarvalho, Júlio César de,1 aThoms, Juliano Feliz1 aMedina, Jesus David Coral1 aSoccol, Carlos Ricardo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 206 p.336-348dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.2043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012000166300001800286520050200304592002800806650001500834650002300849650002300872650001500895650001900910650002100929653001600950653003400966653002001000653002601020653001901046700001901065700001701084700002001101700002101121700001901142700002301161773008101184856008101265852000901346655001201355IND60551379920221120235550.0161018e20140722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055137992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.04.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakano, Hikaru10aDevelopment of the 8-aza-3-bromo-7-hydroxycoumarin-4-ylmethyl group as a new entry of photolabile protecting groups  ap. 4400-4404.  aA significant substitution effect of the position of the bromo group on the photosensitivity of the 8-azacoumarin chromophore leads to the development of a highly photosensitive 8-aza-3-bromo-7-hydroxycoumarin-4-ylmethyl (aza-3-Bhc) group that shows excellent photolytic efficiency and hydrophilicity with long-wavelength absorption maxima.

S1134-S1155.  aThe present study deals with the extraction and characterization of Jackfruit seed polyphenol (JSP) and its application in the stabilization of peanut oil. The optimized extract was obtained at condition of 95% ethanol for 30 min by using conventional solvent extraction method. The extract exhibited a total phenolic content of 120.5 µg GAE/mL, flavonoid content of 0.43 mg CE/ml, condensed tannin content of 0.34 mg CE/ml and DPPH scavenging EC50 value of 14.22 µg/ml. The characterization of extract by LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS revealed the presence of phenolic acid, flavonoids, and stilbenes. The JSP extract in the presence of synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and α-Tocopherol-acetate (vitamin-E acetate) were tested for the stabilization of cold-pressed peanut oil. Furthermore, natural antioxidant mediated stabilization of cold-pressed peanut oil was also investigated using α-Tocopherol (vitamin E) and curcumin. The JSP extract and curcumin significantly retarded lipid oxidation in peanut oil under Schaal oven test conditions of 60°C for a week, as compared to BHT, α-Tocopherol, and α-Tocopherol acetate. Also, the JSP extract and curcumin showed better antioxidant effects on the oxidative stability of oil at frying temperature of 150–180°C for 2 hr and thus can prove potential in ensuring the retardation of oil oxidation process. Hence, JSP extract and curcumin can have industrial application of serving as a natural preservative in oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtocarpus heterophyllus 3aacetates 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acurcumin 3aethanol 3aextraction 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3afrying 3aindustrial applications 3ajackfruits 3alipid peroxidation 3amedian effective concentration 3aovens 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apeanut oil 3aphenolic acids 3apolyphenols 3asolvents 3astilbenes 3atemperature 0aPolyphenols 0aLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS 0alipid oxidation 0agroundnut oil1 aTungare, Kanchanlata1 aSunariwal, Shilpa1 aSonawane, Sachin0 tInternational journal of fruit science.g2020 Sept. 21, v. 20, no.

This work focuses on the performance comparison of adhesives containing different nanoparticles (nano‐TiO₂, TK (TiO₂‐KH570), TKB (TiO₂‐KH570‐Butyl acrylate)) to improve both the bonding strength and storage stability. The structure and morphology of these nanoparticles are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that the surface modification improves the dispersion of nano‐TiO₂. After adding in adhesive, the results of shear strength, viscosity, and rheological properties signify that the structural strength within adhesive is related to the surface hydrophobicity and the thickness of the surface hydrophobic layer of functionalized nanoparticles. TKB exhibits excellent improvement on the storage stability of adhesive due to its wide surface hydrophobic layer weakening the intermolecular interaction. TK shows limited improvement on both bonding strength and storage stability as the hanging hydrogen groups from KH570 form cross‐linking structure with other components in adhesive. Therefore, selecting the appropriate functional nanoparticles is an important parameter for designing high‐performance wood adhesive for the veneer industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemical interactions 3acrosslinking 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustry 3ananocomposites 3ashear strength 3astorage quality 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviscosity 3awood1 aLi, Jing1 aDin, Zia‐ud1 aHu, Jun,1 aXiong, Hanguo0 tStärke =.g2021 July, v. 73, no. 7-8 p.e2100042-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2021000423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04055naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100002500185245006900210300001200279506007600291520226700367592002802634506003702662650000902699650001402708650001302722650001602735650001802751650001202769650001102781650001002792650001802802650001202820650003102832650002202863650002402885650002402909650001002933650001002943650001902953650001302972650001102985650002002996650001103016650000903027650001603036650003603052650001203088650002203100650002403122650002403146700002303170700002103193773016103214856004503375852000903420655001203429IND50058744620221207060834.0201006e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005874462DNAL7 a213854552pmid7 aPMC30625782pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-8-172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuemmeler, Bernard F10aParent-child relationship of directly measured physical activity  ap. 413.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Studies on parent-child correlations of physical activity have been mixed. Few studies have examined concurrent temporal patterns of physical activity and sedentary behaviors in parents and children using direct measures. The purpose of this study was to examine parent-child activity correlations by gender, day of week, and time of day, using accelerometers - a method for direct assessment of physical activity. METHODS: Accelerometers were used to assess physical activity and sedentary time in 45 fathers, 45 mothers and their children (23 boys, 22 girls, mean age 9.9 years) over the course of 4 days (Thursday - Sunday). Participants were instructed to wear accelerometers for 24 hours per day. Data from accelerometers were aggregated into waking hours on weekdays and weekends (6:00 am to midnight) and weekday after-school hours (3:00 - 7:00 pm). RESULTS: Across the 4 days, the mean minutes per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for fathers was 30.0 (s.d. = 17.3), for mothers was 30.1 (s.d. = 20.1) and for children was 145.47 (s.d. = 51.64). Mothers' and fathers' minutes of MVPA and minutes of sedentary time were positively correlated with child physical activity and sedentary time (all ps <.05, with the exception of mothers' and children's sedentary time on weekdays from 6 am to 12 am). Multivariate linear regression analyses resulted in significant effects between parents and children for MVPA across all time segments. For sedentary activity, significant associations were observed only between father and child on the weekend. Sedentary activity of parents and children were not related for other time segments. Models examining the associations of one or two parents with high levels of MVPA or sedentary time indicated a dose response increase in child activity relative to parent. CONCLUSIONS: Greater parental MVPA was associated with increased child MVPA. In addition, having two parents with higher levels of MVPA was associated with greater levels of activity in children. Sedentary time in children was not as strongly correlated with that of their parents. Findings lend support to the notion that to increase childhood activity levels it may be fruitful to improve physical activity among parents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aboys 3achildhood 3achildren 3acorrelation 3adose response 3afathers 3agender 3agirls 3alinear models 3amothers 3aparent-child relationships 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 2aActigraphyxmethods 2aAdult 2aChild 2aChild Behavior 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMonitoring, Ambulatoryxmethods 2aParents 2aPhysical Exertion 2aRegression Analysis 2aSedentary Behavior.1 aAnderson, Cheryl B1 aMâsse, Louise C0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2011 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.413-413dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-8-17  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245018700164300001800351520153500369592002801904596006301932596006201995650001702057650001002074650001302084650001002097650001702107650002202124650002402146650001102170650001002181650001902191650001402210650001402224650001602238650001802254650001402272650001202286650002102298650000902319650001602328650001502344650001902359650001202378651001002390700002002400700001502420700001402435700001902449700001302468700001802481700001802499700001702517700001802534700001302552700001902565700001702584773011602601856008202717852000902799655001202808IND60579525420221120044758.0211117e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057952542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-017-3422-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Shanhui10aPhylogenetic and pathogenic characterization of a pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 isolate reveals cross-species transmission and potential outbreak risks in the northwest region of China  ap. 2755-2767.  aPigeon paramyxovirus type-1 (PPMV-1) is enzootic in pigeons, causing severe economic loss in the poultry industry in many countries. However, the exact epidemic process of PPMV-1 transmission is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the complete genome of the PPMV-1/SX-01/15 isolate. Sequence results show that the virus genome contains 15,192 nucleotides, with the gene order 3’-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5’. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this genome belongs to subgenotype VIc in class II. The mean death time (MDT) and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) were 62.4 h and 1.13, respectively, indicating that this isolate is a mesogenic PPMV-1 strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a subgenotype VIc mesogenic PPMV-1 strain circulating in commercial pigeon flocks in the northwest region of China. In a comparative infection experiment, the morbidity and mortality rates were 100% and 80%, respectively, in 4-week-old pigeons, whereas they were 50% and 30%, respectively, in 5-week-old chickens. Furthermore, this virus caused severe neurological symptoms in a 4-week-old pigeon and mild neurological symptoms in a 5-week-old chicken. A histopathological examination of the brain showed a classical nonsuppurative encephalitis lesion. The pattern of viral shedding, and viral load, and virus distribution differed between infected chickens and pigeons. Genomic characteristics suggest that there was cross-species transmission of PPMV-1 subgenotype VIc in this region at least from the years 2006 to 2015.  aPublisher supplied data  a312772578cNational Natural Scientific Foundation of China  a31572538cNational Natural Scientific Foundation of China 3aRespirovirus 3abrain 3achickens 3adeath 3aencephalitis 3aenzootic diseases 3afinancial economics 3aflocks 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anucleotides 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3apigeons 3apoultry industry 3arisk 3asubgenotype 3aviral load 3aviral shedding 3aviruses 3aChina1 aWang, Chongyang1 aZhang, Xue1 aZhao, Lei1 aWang, Xiangwei1 aYao, Wei1 aHan, Qingsong1 aWang, Yanhong1 aFan, Mengfei1 aGao, Xiaolong1 aXiao, Sa1 aWang, Xinglong1 aYang, Zengqi0 tArchives of virology.g2017 Sept., v. 162, no. 9 p.2755-2767dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3422-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001900161245006300180300001800243500000900261520190200270592002802172650001302200650001302213650002502226650001102251650002202262650001702284650002402301650001302325650001302338650002302351700001402374700001402388700001902402773012402421852000902545856009802554655001202652IND2048581620221121002215.0191122e199509  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204858162DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500050011x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrascaroli, E.10aEffect of Pollen Selection for Alachlor Tolerance in Maize  ap. 1322-1326.  aepub  aPollen selection can lead to correlated responses in the subsequent sporophytes because many genes are expressed in both haploid and diploid phases. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of pollen selection for tolerance to the herbicide alachlor [2-chloro-N-(2,6- diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl) acetamide] in maize (Zea mays L.). Tassels of the single cross hybrid K55 (tolerant) ✕ Ky226 (susceptible) were grown in absence (control) and in presence (selected) of alachlor (I g L⁻¹). Mature pollen from this process was used to make backcrosses to Ky226 (susceptibility being recessive). The selected population outperformed the control population (88 vs. 81%; P ≤ 0.01) for percentage of normal seedlings (i.e., not injured by alachlor) when compared in a field trial treated with the herbicide (5 kg a.i. ha⁻¹). Pollen of plants grown without alachlor was analyzed in vitro; in presence of the herbicide in the medium (50 mg L⁻¹) the selected population exceeded the control population for pollen tube length (334 vs. 308 μm; P ≤ 0.01). Two cycles of pollen selection were also conducted in the single cross hybrid KS5 ✕ H99 (susceptible) following the backcross procedure to the susceptible parent. Seeds of control and selected populations were exposed to alachlor (I g L⁻¹), and seedlings were grown in the greenhouse. For percentage of normal seedlings, we obtained a gain (16%) in the first cycle and an additional gain (10%) in the second cycle. The results indicate that genes controlling alachlor tolerance in maize are expressed in both haploid and diploid phases and that pollen selection can be effectively applied to improve the trait.

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aboronic acids 3acatalytic activity 3acoumarin 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3aperoxiredoxin 3aproteins 3athiols 3ayeasts1 aGomes, Fernando 1 aOliveira, Marcos Antonio de,1 aSoares Netto, Luís  Eduardo1 aToledo Junior, José  Carlos0 tAntioxidants.g2020 May 16, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90504343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245005500158300002000213520108900233592002801322650001501350650001201365650001501377650003801392650001301430650000901443650001201452650001301464650002101477700001801498700001701516700001601533700001701549700001801566700002201584700001501606700001501621773014401636856007401780852000901854655001201863IND60671193720221118174556.0191002e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067119372DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta05226b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPontiroli, D.10aAmmonia-storage in lithium intercalated fullerides  ap. 21099-21105.  aAmmonia has been proposed as an indirect hydrogen carrier, as solid-state ammonia-storage could be easier than directly absorbing hydrogen in materials. Here we investigate the structural evolution of hyper-ammoniated lithium fullerides (ND₃)yLi₆C₆₀ during ammonia desorption, using in-situ high intensity neutron powder diffraction. In (ND₃)yLi₆C₆₀, ammonia molecules are stored in their neutral state inside the inter-fullerene interstices and are coordinated to the intercalated Li ions, forming Li–ND₃ clusters. Li₆C₆₀ is found to absorb up to 36.8 wt% ND₃, which corresponds to approximately 14 ammonia molecules per C₆₀. The ammonia release, studied either in-situ or ex-situ by means of manometric analyses and differential scanning calorimetry, takes place in two main steps, at 350–410 K and 500–540 K, respectively. This corresponds to two clear 1ˢᵗ order structural phase transitions and the absorption process is partially reversible. These findings suggest that the system could be a good candidate for ammonia-storage applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3adesorption 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3ahydrogen 3aions 3alithium 3aneutrons 3aphase transition1 aD'Alessio, D.1 aGaboardi, M.1 aMagnani, G.1 aMilanese, C.1 aDuyker, S.

Empirical studies collect data with increasing resolution and provide greater opportunities for its testing. However, several different density-dependent habitat selection models exist in the literature incorporating many different scenarios. We attempt to unify some of these models in a single framework, to increase our predictive power, and assist researchers in making predictions from combinations of these models. To achieve this, we created the generalized ideal free distribution, an expansion of the ideal free distribution model. With this model, we synthesize many of the previous theoretical developments in habitat selection to better incorporate temporal dynamics. By using community matrices to represent the interaction between individuals, we demonstrated that thirteen scenarios represented in other studies can be combined into a single model. In addition, for four of these scenarios, our predictions are similar to the original studies that developed these scenarios. Additionally, we derived four novel predictions that take advantage of using community matrices to represent distribution. We discuss how this model creates a connection between community interactions and the distribution of individuals, and its uses in other subjects in ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3ahabitat preferences 3amodels 3aprediction 3aresearchers 3atemporal variation 0aHabitat selection 0aIsodars 0aDensity-dependence 0aGame-theory 0aESS1 aKotler, Burt P.0 tEcological modelling.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 397 p.47-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010600175300002000281520123400301536010401535592002801639596000701667650002701674650003001701650001601731650001601747650002401763650001101787650001301798650001401811650001301825650001001838650001701848653001601865653001601881653002201897653001501919653001601934700002901950700002601979700002502005700002202030773014302052856008602195852000902281655001202290IND60722373020221120201424.0210422e20200921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072237302DNAL7 a10.1080/15538362.2020.17786022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlyaie Torshiz, Ali14aThe Influence of Fertilization on Pomegranate Susceptibility to Infestation by Ectomyelois ceratoniae  ap.

A two-year study was conducted to investigate the effects of the utilization of different fertilizers on the carob moth infestation of pomegranate cv. ‘Bajestani’. Fertilizer programs significantly affected fruit infestation. The highest infestation rate was recorded in unfertilized plants (38.07%, 31.44% in the first and the second years, respectively). Among different treatments, chemical and humic fulvic-containing fertilizers proved to be the most efficient treatments for controlling carob moth. A Significant correlation was observed between carob moth infestation and various fruit and tree-related attributes. The peel hardness and its hardness-associated nutrients (Ca, K and Si), as well as total phenolic content of fruit juice, were among the factors that showed a high negative correlation with carob moth infestation. According to our results, a combination of organic and Si, Ca, and K-containing fertilizers has great practical potential in the management of pomegranate orchards to reduce the carob moth damages.  aThis work was supported by the College of Agriculture Natural Resources, University of Tehran [NA].  aPublisher supplied data  aNA 3aEctomyelois ceratoniae 3aadministrative management 3acorrelation 3afertilizers 3afinancial economics 3afruits 3ahardness 3anutrients 3aorchards 3apests 3apomegranates 0aPomegranate 0afertilizers 0afruit infestation 0acarob moth 0acorrelation1 aGoldansaz, Seyed Hossein1 aMotesharezadeh, Babak1 aAskari, Mohammad Ali1 aZarei, Abdolkarim0 tInternational journal of fruit science.g2020 Sept. 21, v. 20, no.

Due to the resistance of lignin compounds to biological degradation and the important heat requirements for distillation, conventional process designs for the combined production of ethanol and power are yet limited to a modest total energy efficiency of 50% to 55%. This paper investigates how to overcome this limitation by thermochemically converting the residues in order to increase the total energy yield by a combined generation of several fuels and power. Comparing a conventional design with different technological alternatives for thermochemical processing and heat and power recovery, the paper shows that the fuel yield can be more than doubled to reach total energy and exergy efficiencies of up 72% and 78%, respectively. From a methodological point of view, the paper demonstrates that the combination of process integration and exergy recovery techniques in a site-scale approach is key for tapping the full potential of the limited biogenic resources in future biorefineries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3adistillation 3aethanol 3aethanol fuels 3aethanol production 3aexergy 3aheat 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3arenewable resources1 aMaréchal, François0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Apr. 18, v. 27, no. 4 p.2107-2115dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef301952u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002200161245010000183300001800283500000900301520146300310592002801773650002001801650002301821650002301844650002201867650001801889650001401907650001401921650001001935650002001945650000801965650002201973650001601995650001602011700002102027700002102048700001702069773012402086852000902210856009802219655001202317IND2048593320221121002222.0191122e199509  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204859332DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500050031x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorvath, David P.12aA Co-Dominant PCR-Based Marker for Assisted Selection of Durable Stem Rust Resistance in Barley  ap. 1445-1450.  aepub  aScreening individual barley plants for resistance to stem rust is difficult and time consuming. The objective of this work was to develop PCR-based markers for assisted selection of stem rust resistance in barley. Near isogenic barley lines (backcrossed 29 times) differing at the Rpg1 locus (where the gene that confers resistance to the stem rust pathogen Puccinia graminis t. sp. tritici is located) were screened for random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) with 10 base primers. A total of 540 different primers were screened, and one was identified which amplified a DNA fragment closely linked to Rpg1. The DNA fragment was cloned, mapped, and sequenced. Specifically amplifying primers (SAPs) were designed to amplify related polymorphic DNA in other barley cultivars. The SAPs act as a co-dominant marker suitable for marker assisted selection of the Rpg1 gene. Three different amplification patterns were observed in the various cultivars tested. Surprisingly, no specific banding pattern is diagnostic for the presence or absence of Rpg1, despite the demonstrated linkage. Of the three amplification patterns, only one (the 500-bp banding pattern) was present in recently developed resistant cultivars. A similar amplification pattern is also found in many of the susceptible lines that have the cultivar Betzes in their pedigree. RFLP analysis can be used to differentiate the resistant and susceptible cultivars with this amplification pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aPuccinia graminis 3arust diseases 3ascreening 3agermplasm 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aDNA 3aselection methods 3acodominance 3aDNA primers1 aDahleen, Lynn S.1 aStebbing, Jo-Ann1 aPenner, Greg0 tCrop science.g1995 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.1445-1450dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500050031x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01940naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001300188245010000201300001800301506007600319520054300395592002800938596006600966506003701032650001501069650002101084650002501105650001701130650001301147650002201160700001501182700001601197700001401213700001701227700001801244700001801262700001901280773011601299856008201415852000901497655001201506IND60579525520221207054518.0211117e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057952552DNAL7 a285970882pmid7 aPMC55635142pmcid7 a10.1007/s00705-017-3436-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Lei10aViral polymerase inhibitors T-705 and T-1105 are potential inhibitors of Zika virus replication  ap. 2847-2853.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSince 2015, 69 countries and territories have reported evidence of vector-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission.

To assuage this concern, scientists and engineers have the tasks to demonstrate fool-proof and comprehensive techniques that can monitor the movement, or otherwise, concentration of the injected CO₂ in the subsurface. In this work, well-defined laboratory experiments were used to demonstrate the key physico-chemical characteristics and dielectric parameters that are useful in monitoring carbon sequestration sites. The porous materials used were basalt and silica sand samples to demonstrate the possibility of CO₂ injection into different media. To simulate the resident fluids, distilled and brine water samples were used in separate experimentations. Also, the pressures and temperatures were chosen to correspond to different geological depths which are relevant for CO₂ injection. The pH, bulk electrical conductivity (σb) and bulk dielectric permittivity (εb) of the system were measured for the two different media. On one hand, the decrease in pH was clearly observed in both the basalt and silica sand after the exposure to CO₂. On the other hand, σb and εb increased as CO₂ was injected. Our results further revealed a higher ion mobilisation​ potential in basalt medium than that in silica sand. This results in lower pH and higher electrical conductivity in the basalt medium than the silica medium. Thus, a simultaneous measurement of pH, σb and εb are proposed as a multiparameter approach to monitor CO₂ leakage from the storage reservoir. As far as we are aware, this is the first work in the open literature that reports simultaneous dielectric and electrical behaviours of CO₂ –water–porous media system for basalt porous medium in connection with carbon sequestration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3adielectric permittivity 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental technology 3apH 3aporous media 3aquartz 0aSilica 0aShallow aquifer 0aDistilled water 0aBrine 0aBulk electrical conductivity (σb) 0aBulk dielectric permittivity (εb)1 aAbidoye, L.K.1 aDas, D.B.0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2020 Nov., v. 20 p.101052-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2020.1010523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012000168300001600288520157100304592002801875650002201903650003701925650001301962650001501975650002101990650001902011650002202030650001902052650000902071650001602080650001002096650001702106650001602123650002202139650001902161650001702180650002302197650002002220650001702240653002802257653002102285653002002306653002502326653003402351700001902385700002002404700002002424700001902444773012202463856008302585852000902668655001202677IND60745961520221116163435.0211129e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074596152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.07.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGetachew, Girum10aBrightly luminescent (NH4)xCs1-xPbBr3 quantum dots for in vitro imaging and efficient photothermal ablation therapy  ap. 500-512.  aHerein, we report for the first time a facile strategy for the highly efficient (NH₄)ₓCs₁₋ₓPbBr₃ quantum dots (QDs). By modulating the amount of ammonium, (NH₄)ₓCs₁₋ₓPbBr₃ QDs with different photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QY) were synthesized. The results of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the crystal structure of (NH₄)ₓCs₁₋ₓPbBr₃ was altered by incorporation of NH₄⁺ cations into the CsPbBr₃ lattice. The (NH₄)ₓCs₁₋ₓPbBr₃ QDs showed enhanced PL QY, higher photostability, and long-term storage stability compared to CsPbBr₃ QDs. Furthermore, (NH₄)ₓCs₁₋ₓPbBr₃ QDs could be conjugated with a photothermal dye (IR780) via a one-pot reaction using poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) and IR780-MPTS. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first attempt integrating perovskite QDs and phototherapeutic molecules into one system (abbreviated as PQD-IR780), demonstrating good water dispersibility and high photothermal conversion efficiency of 57.85%. In vitro experiments performed to examine subcellular uptake showed high fluorescence brightness was observed in HeLa, B16F1, and HepG2 cancer cells cultured with PQD-IR780. The results indicate that the internalization mechanism for uptaking of PQD-IR780 inside HeLa cells is energy-dependent and caveolin-mediated endocytosis. The in vitro cell viability assays and photothermal therapy revealed that PQD-IR780 showed good biocompatibility and can induce hyperthermia upon laser irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aammonium 3aanhydrides 3abiocompatibility 3acell viability 3acrystal structure 3adispersibility 3adyes 3aendocytosis 3afever 3afluorescence 3airradiation 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotostability 3aphototherapy 3aphotothermotherapy 3astorage quality 3astorage time 0aPerovskite quantum dots 0a(NH4)xCs1-xPbBr3 0aOptical imaging 0aPhotothermal therapy 0aCaveolin-mediated endocytosis1 aHuang, Wan-Wen1 aChou, Tzung-Han1 aRasal, Akash S.1 aChang, Jia-Yaw0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Jan., v. 605 p.500-512dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.07.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245005800159300001800217520098300235592002801218650001101246650001701257650002201274650001401296650002201310650003401332650002101366651001201387700002001399700001901419700001401438700003001452700002501482700001601507700002101523700001801544700002101562700002001583700002501603700002101628773010401649856007501753852000901828655001201837IND60534076320170629000000.0160802e20130418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053407632DNAL7 a10.1021/ef301956x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuyal, Priyanka10aJoint Industrial Case Study for Asphaltene Deposition  ap. 1899-1908.  aHere, we present a case study on a Wyoming well with known asphaltene deposition issues as a result of natural depletion.

An enrichment of highly condensed aromatic molecules for the field deposit is detected with both ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and thermal cracking experiments and could predict asphaltene deposition.

Molecular phylogenetics of Malesian Diospyros (Ebenaceae) based trnL-F spacer sequences. Biodiversitas 22: 4106-4114. Diospyros is a genus composed of potential species as an economic commodity with high diversity. However, there is limited information on the phylogenetic relationship of this genus in the Malesian region. This study aimed to provide information on the species diversity through a DNA barcoding approach and revealing the phylogenetic information of Diospyros spp. in the Malesian region. This study used 20 Diospyros accessions from Bogor Botanical Garden collections, 40 Diospyros accessions, and four outgroup accessions obtained from the NCBI database. The DNA barcoding primer utilized comes from plastids, trnL-F intergenic spacer. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Maximum-Parsimony method. A total of 20 accessions of Diospyros were validated with sequence data on the genebank. The result showed that all accessions had relationships with 44 other Diospyros species globally. Here, we reported 10 new trnL-F intergenic spacer sequences of Malesian Diospyros species. A phylogenetic tree grouped 64 monophyletic Diospyros species into seven clades. The phylogenetic results supports the biogeographic hypothesis: the Malesian region, the Malesian-Caledonian Region, and Cosmopolite species in almost all bioregions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA barcoding 3aDiospyros 3abotanical gardens 3adatabases 3agene banks 3ageographical distribution 3aintergenic DNA 3amonophyly 3aplastids 3aspecies diversity 0aebony 0aphylogenetics 0amalesia 0atrnl-f markers1 aDjuita, Nina Ratna1 aCHIKMAWATI, TATIK 0 tBiodiversitas.g2021 Sept., v. 22, no. 9dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2209593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008400167300001600251520159400267592002801861650000801889650001901897650001401916650001001930650001601940650002501956650002201981650002402003650001102027650001402038650001402052650002102066650001502087700002002102773010002122856008102222852000902303655001202312IND60121657320221120133259.0150317e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012165732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3804-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgio, Ernesto10aTowards a systemic paradigm in carcinogenesis: linking epigenetics and genetics  ap. 777-790.  aFor at least 30 years cancer has been defined as a genetic disease and explained by the so-called somatic mutation theory (SMT), which has dominated the carcinogenesis field. Criticism of the SMT has recently greatly increased, although still not enough to force all SMT supporters to recognize its limits. Various researchers point out that cancer appears to be a complex process concerning a whole tissue; and that genomic mutations, although variably deleterious and unpredictably important in determining the establishment of the neoplastic phenotype, are not the primary origin for a malignant neoplasia. We attempt to describe the inadequacies of the SMT and demonstrate that epigenetics is a more logical cause of carcinogenesis. Many previous models of carcinogenesis fall into two classes: (i) in which some biological changes inside cells alone lead to malignancy; and (ii) requiring changes in stroma/extracellular matrix. We try to make clear that in the (ii) model genomic instability is induced by persistent signals coming from the microenvironment, provoking epigenetic and genetic modifications in tissue stem cells that can lead to cancer. In this perspective, stochastic mutations of DNA are a critical by-product rather then the primary cause of cancer. Indirect support for such model of carcinogenesis comes from the in vitro and vivo experiments showing apparent ‘reversion’ of cancer phenotypes obtained via physiological factors of cellular differentiation (cytokines and other signaling molecules) or drugs, even if the key mutations are not ‘reversed’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acarcinogenesis 3acytokines 3adrugs 3aepigenetics 3aextracellular matrix 3agenetic disorders 3agenetic engineering 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 3asomatic mutation 3astem cells1 aMigliore, Lucia0 tMolecular biology reports.g2015 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.777-790dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3804-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007500170300001400245520105000259592002801309650001201337650001901349650001901368650001101387650002001398650001501418650001401433650002401447650001901471650000901490650001601499651001301515653002101528653003601549653002301585653002201608773009101630856008201721852000901803655001201812IND60547612520221122150452.0161027e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054761252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wace.2015.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThoeun, Heng Chan10aObserved and projected changes in temperature and rainfall in Cambodia  ap. 61-71.  aTemperature and rainfall patterns in Cambodia are governed by monsoons and characterized by two major wet and dry seasons.

This paper presents the climate change scenarios using MAGICC–SCENGEN program, which links emissions scenarios with global and regional climate change and has adopted the regional climate model (PRECIS) in combination with a number of GCM models with resolution of 50×50km, using observation data and two historical and future climate data sets generated by RCM model downscaling under the two emission scenarios SRES A2 and SRES B2. Projections of maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall patterns from 2008 to 2099 are described.

Such information is essential to better manage the agricultural water by improving the global water application uniformity under moving irrigation machines. Three parallel, long, impermeable water collection strips were constructed underneath a stationary linear move irrigation system to address this issue. The sprinkler discharge efficiency (SDE≈1- WDEL) was monitored over 5-min intervals (SDE5min) during Apr-Aug of 2014-on a bare experimental plot. Experiments were conducted on a discrete basis for about 1040h total in order to collect more than 11,600 SDE5min data points. It was found that the SDE5min is very dynamic and can experience abrupt changes up to 16.5% as a result of sudden changes in wind speed and direction. The maximum and minimum observed SDE5min during the study period were 97.5 and 73.6%, respectively. The difference between maximum and minimum SDE5min during a day/night cycle was controlled by solar radiation and maximum wind speed. The average hourly SDE (SDEhr) for data collected at predawn, morning, afternoon, and evening were 89.5, 87.7, 86.9 and 88.8%, respectively. Overall, the daily SDE was mainly controlled by air temperature and varied between 81.8 and 91.8%, indicating that ∼8–18% of the daily applied water was lost on average. A multiple linear regression model was developed to help predict the SDEhr as a function of weather parameters. The model indicated wind speed, temperature and relative humidity as the best explanatory variables and predicted the SDEhr with an absolute error just over 4%. Because the difference between maximum and minimum SDEhr over a full experimental day could be as high as 22%, this magnitude of error was considered to be acceptable for wind drift and evaporation loss estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3adata collection 3aequipment 3aevaporation 3alateral move irrigation 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3awind speed 0aWind drift 0aEvaporation loss 0aSprinkler irrigation 0aDischarge efficiency 0aWeather parameters1 aPeters, Thies,1 aShafii, B.1 aAmini, M.Z.1 aStöckle, C.0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 182 p.39-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010000162300001800262520261000280592002802890650002402918650001502942650002002957650001102977650001102988650002202999650001903021700002403040700002103064700002403085700002103109700002303130773010403153856007503257852000903332655001203341IND60534076420170629000000.0160802e20130418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053407642DNAL7 a10.1021/ef301961x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaac, Benjamin J.12aA Novel Methodology for Chemical Time Scale Evaluation with Detailed Chemical Reaction Kinetics  ap. 2255-2265.  aInteraction between turbulent mixing and chemical kinetics is the key parameter which determines the combustion regime: only understanding such interaction may provide insight into the physics of the flame and support the choice and/or development of modeling tools. Turbulence-chemistry interaction may be evaluated through the analysis of the Damköhler number distribution, which represents the flow to chemical time-scale ratio. Large Damköhler values indicate mixing controlled flames. On the other hand, low Damköhler values corresponds to slow chemical reactions: reactants and products are quickly mixed by turbulence, so the system behaves like a perfect stirred reactor. The calculation of the Damköhler number requires the definition of proper flow and chemical time-scales. For turbulent conditions, various flow time-scales can be used, such as the integral and Kolmogorov time-scales. Chemical time-scale calculation poses some issues. In the literature, several examples of Damköhler calculation are reported, but in most cases a global chemical reaction rate is used to estimate the chemical time scale. A method for considering more complex kinetic schemes is proposed by Fox [Computational Models for Turbulent Reacting Flows; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, U. K., 2003], who defines the chemical time-scale in terms of the inverse of the eigenvalues from the decomposition of the chemical source term Jacobian matrix. The present work aims at developing a procedure for the calculation of the chemical time-scale (and thus of the Damköhler number) with complex kinetics starting from the analysis of the Jacobian matrix of the chemical species source terms. Emphasis is given on the dimension of the Jacobian matrix, as it is not fully understood how the species for the time-scale calculation should be chosen. In other words, one can refer to the full set of species (thus all species will have the same “weight”) but also to a subset of them. The main concept is to perform a preliminary analysis, based on Principal Variables (PV), to determine the relative importance of the chemical species, in order to select an optimal subset for the chemical time-scale calculation. The procedure is illustrated and applied for the Moderate and Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion, as this kind of regime shows a strong coupling between turbulence and chemistry, mainly because of slower reaction rates (due to the dilution of reactants) in comparison with conventional combustion. The methodology is further validated on a DNS data set modeling a CO/H₂ jet flame.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical speciation 3acombustion 3adata collection 3amixing 3amodels 3areaction kinetics 3aturbulent flow1 aParente, Alessandro1 aGalletti, Chiara1 aThornock, Jeremy N.1 aSmith, Philip J.1 aTognotti, Leonardo0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Apr. 18, v. 27, no. 4 p.2255-2265dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef301961x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245015300165520152200318592002801840650001201868650001201880650001401892650001001906650001201916650001201928650001001940650002201950650001601972650001901988650001302007650001202020650002502032700001802057700001602075773011902091856007202210852000902282655001202291IND60648848020221116164254.0190701e20180605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064884802DNAL7 a10.3390/f90603282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Kazuhiko  W.10aCharacteristics of Students Who Frequently Conduct Plant Observations: Toward Fostering Leaders and Supporters of Fixed-Point Observation of Forests  aIn order to foster leaders and supporters of fixed-point observation for sustainable forest management, it is considered effective to focus on students who have demonstrated potential for fixed-point observations of forests in the universal education stage. This study aims to identify the characteristics of students who frequently conduct plant observations, which is the basis for the fixed-point observation of forests, including methods involving photography. We conducted a questionnaire survey, which consisted of 19 questions that provided insight into junior high school students&rsquo; experiences, opportunities, and interests related to plant observation. We compared students who have conducted plant observations with those who have not, using Fisher&rsquo;s exact test and multiple comparisons using the Benjamini and Hochberg method. The ratio of students who frequently conducted plant observations was significantly higher among female students than male students, and their characteristics differed by gender. The significant characteristics of male students included farm work experience and niche hobbies such as camping and lighting a bonfire, as well as using digital single-lens reflex cameras for photography; female students had relatively niche hobbies such as enjoying science. Students who increased the frequency of plant observations after the lecture about fixed-point observations of forests had an inclination toward social studies and tended not to use a smartphone for photography.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acamping 3aeducation 3afarms 3afemales 3aforests 3amales 3amobile telephones 3aphotography 3aquestionnaires 3astudents 3asurveys 3asustainable forestry1 aFukumoto, Rui1 aHorie, Yuta0 tForests.g2018 June 05, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90603283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04230naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003100166245016100197300001800358500001500376520185100391592002802242650001302270650000902283650001302292650001002305650001902315650002402334650001402358650001502372650001102387650001402398650002002412650002502432650001402457650001102471650001702482650001302499650002302512650001102535650001702546650002002563650002402583650002802607650003802635650003102673650005102704650002602755650005802781650003102839650003402870650002302904650003102927650003002958650001902988650006303007650004203070650003303112650003503145650002603180650002303206653002203229653001503251700001703266700001603283700002003299773008403319856004803403852000903451655001203460IND50060860620221119005113.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006086062DNAL7 a228786422pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-012-1724-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuanafina, Marcia M. de O.10aExpression of a Trichoderma reesei β-1,4 endo-xylanase in tall fescue modifies cell wall structure and digestibility and elicits pathogen defence responses  ap. 1757-1774.  a2019-12-06  aAn endo-xylanase from Trichoderma reesei (xyn2) has been expressed in tall fescue targeted to the vacuole, apoplast or Golgi, constitutively under the control of the rice actin promoter, and to the apoplast under the control of a senescence enhanced gene promoter. Constitutive xylanase expression in the vacuole, apoplast, and golgi, resulted in only a small number of plants with low enzyme activities and in reduced plant growth in apoplast, and golgi targeted plants. Constitutive expression in the apoplast also resulted in increased levels of cell wall bound hydroxycinnamic acid monomers and dimers, but no significant effect on cell wall xylose or arabinose content. In situ constitutive xylanase expression in the Golgi also resulted in increased ferulate dimers. However, senescence induced xylanase expression in the apoplast was considerably higher and did not affect plant growth or the level of monomeric hydroxycinnamic acids or lignin in the cell walls. These plants also showed increased levels of ferulate dimers, and decreased levels of xylose with increased levels of arabinose in their cell walls. While the release of cell wall hydroxycinnamic acids on self digestion was enhanced in these plants in the presence of exogenously applied ferulic acid esterase, changes in cell wall composition resulted in decreases in both tissue digestibility and cellulase mediated sugar release. In situ detection of H₂O₂ production mediated by ethylene release in leaves of plants expressing apoplast xylanase could be leading to increased dimerisation. High-level xylanase expression in the apoplast also resulted in necrotic lesions on the leaves. Together these results indicate that xylanase expression in tall fescue may be triggering plant defence responses analogous to foliar pathogen attack mediated by ethylene and H₂O₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3arice 3avacuoles 3agenes 3aplant response 3aFestuca arundinacea 3axylanases 3acell walls 3axylose 3aarabinose 3agene expression 3acell wall components 3apathogens 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3aapoplast 3aTrichoderma reesei 3alignin 3aferulic acid 3aenzyme activity 3aethylene production 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 2aCell Wallxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCoumaric Acidsxmetabolism 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aFestucaxchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aLigninxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesximmunology 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aPlant Immunity 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrichodermaxgenetics 2aXylansxmetabolism 0aHypocrea jecorina 0asenescence1 aLangdon, Tim1 aDalton, Sue1 aMorris, Phillip0 tPlanta.g2012 Dec., v. 236, no. 6 p.1757-1774dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-012-1724-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011700165300001600282500001900298520097800317536022301295592002801518596001601546596001701562650002001579650001501599650002301614650001901637650001101656653003801667653002101705653002601726700001701752700001701769700001301786700001501799700001401814700001401828700001401842773011601856856008501972852000902057655001202066IND60730590920221119102109.0210311e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073059092DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2021.18849162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuhe12aA Remote Sensing Image Registration Algorithm Based on Multiple Constraints and a Variational Bayesian Framework  ap. 296-305.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAiming at complicated remote sensing image registration problem, we proposed a multi-constraint registration algorithm based on variational inference. Gaussian mixture model is used to construct the entire Bayesian network, which facilitates the estimation of heteroscedasticity noise in mapping function regression, and distribution of outliers in scene point density estimation. We use a variational parameter proxy to approximate complex posterior distribution. In addition, while maintaining the stability of global structure, similarity of local structure is restricted. In order to limit the cost of image conversion, we added constraints on spatial curvature for image. Accuracy and smoothness of the spatial transformation can be maintained by minimizing the curvature in horizontal and vertical directions. Experimental results show that compared with other point set matching algorithms, this method can achieve better results in robustness and matching accuracy.  aThis work was supported by: (i) Science and Technology Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [20194001724]; (ii) National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program [201910681004].  aPublisher supplied data  a20194001724  a201910681004 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3aheteroskedasticity 3aimage analysis 3amodels 0aremote sensing image registration 0amulti-constraint 0avariational inference1 aCao, Hualong1 aZhao, Yiyang1 aHe, Qiqi1 aYang, Yang1 aWang, Lei1 aLin, Gang1 aZhou, Jie0 tRemote sensing letters.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 12, no. 3 p.296-305dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2021.18849163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007300168300001600241520152300257592002801780650001701808650002301825650001901848650001901867650001201886650001501898650001201913650001701925650001201942650001901954650001101973650003401984650002402018700002002042700001602062700002402078700002902102700002402131773010002155856008102255852000902336655001202345IND60121657520221120123141.0150317e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012165752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-015-3858-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCourtnay, Rupert10aCancer metabolism and the Warburg effect: the role of HIF-1 and PI3K  ap. 841-851.  aCancer cells have been shown to have altered metabolism when compared to normal non-malignant cells. The Warburg effect describes a phenomenon in which cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose by glycolysis, producing lactate as an end product, despite being the presence of oxygen. The phenomenon was first described by Otto Warburg in the 1920s, and has resurfaced as a controversial theory, with both supportive and opposing arguments. The biochemical aspects of the Warburg effect outline a strong explanation for the cause of cancer cell proliferation, by providing the biological requirements for a cell to grow. Studies have shown that pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) as well as hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) are central regulators of glycolysis, cancer metabolism and cancer cell proliferation. Studies have shown that PI3K signaling pathways have a role in many cellular processes such as metabolism, inflammation, cell survival, motility and cancer progression. Herein, the cellular aspects of the PI3K pathway are described, as well as the influence HIF has on cancer cell metabolism. HIF-1 activation has been related to angiogenesis, erythropoiesis and modulation of key enzymes involved in aerobic glycolysis, thereby modulating key processes required for the Warburg effect. In this review we discuss the molecular aspects of the Warburg effect with a particular emphasis on the role of the HIF-1 and the PI3K pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3aerythropoiesis 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahypoxia 3ainflammation 3amammals 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxygen 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3asignal transduction1 aNgo, Darleen C.1 aMalik, Neha1 aVerveris, Katherine1 aTortorella, Stephanie M.1 aKaragiannis, Tom C.0 tMolecular biology reports.g2015 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.841-851dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-015-3858-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01577naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245008600134300001600220300002400236520054200260650000900802650001800811650002400829650002000853650001000873650001500883653002900898653002500927653002200952700002000974700001600994700001501010700001901025773008401044852000901128939003301137945000801170946001301178655001201191991611041060742620221121095034.0800724e197903  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800016512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeideman, S.C.10aPhysical and sensory characteristics of beef packaged in modified gas atmospheres  ap. 233-239.  ap. 233-239. charts.  aExtract: One hundred and ninety-six boneless beef roasts were vacuum packaged.

Both adults and nymphs were maintained in petri dishes containing a transparent piece of soda straw filled with moistened cotton and the corresponding food for the biossays. The following treatments were tested: eggs of Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), Diatraea saccharalis Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and Anagasta kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae); insect pupae meal (FPI); Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) commercial pollen (PC); FPI + PC, and FPI + cattail pollen [Typha angustifolia L. (Thyphaceae)]. Each treatment had 50 replicates, and food was offered in excess. Treatments consisting of insect pupae meal (FPI), FPI + commercial pollen (PC), and FPI + cattail pollen resulted in nymphal development of 32, 29, and 29 days, with 83, 90 and 100% survival, respectively, and were superior to the PC treatment, with values of 37 days and 67% survival observed for insects reared on commercial pollen. Treatments that included insect pupae flour, either alone or mixed with pollens, were similar to control (S. frugiperda eggs). We conclude that the artificial diets tested and rearing technique are suitable for the artificial rearing of D. luteipes in laboratory conditions. 3aForficulidae 3apredatory insects 3abiological control agents 3anatural enemies 3aartificial diets 3ainsect rearing 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3amoths 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3aDiatraea saccharalis 3aEphestia kuehniella 3aApis mellifera 0aDoru leuteipes1 aParra, J.R.P.1 aLopes, J.M.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2007 , v. 36, no. 2 p.308-311x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL  a20070921b20071002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/09/21  aNon-US 7aarticle01595naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245007100136300001600207300003000223520071000253650001100963650001600974650001400990650001201004650002201016653001401038653002501052700001501077700001801092773008401110852000901194939003301203945000801236946001301244655001201257991611040860742620221121095007.0800724e197903  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800016442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClydesdale, F.M.10aCranberry pigments as colorants for beverages and gelatin desserts  ap. 196-201.  ap. 196-201. ill., charts.  aExtract: A dry-powdered pigment extract was prepared from dried cranberry pomace by methanol extraction, concentration and spray drying.

  1 aGyasi-Agyei, Y.10aField-scale assessment of uncertainties in drip irrigation lateral parameters  ap. 512-519.  aGrass establishment on railway embankment steep slopes for erosion control in Central Queensland, Australia, is aided by drip lateral irrigation systems. The effective field values of the lateral parameters may be different from the manufacturer supplied ones due to manufacturing variations of the emitters, environmental factors, and water quality. This paper has provided a methodology for estimating drip lateral effective parameter values under field conditions. The hydraulic model takes into account the velocity head change and a proper selection of the friction coefficient formula based on the Reynolds number. Fittings and emitter insertion head losses were incorporated into the hydraulic model. Pressure measurements at some locations within the irrigation system, and the inlet discharges, were used to calibrate the lateral parameters in a statistical framework that allows estimation of parameter uncertainties using the Metropolis algorithm. It is observed that the manufacturer's supplied parameters were significantly different from the calibrated ones, underestimating pressures within the irrigation system for a given inlet discharge, stressing the need for field testing. The parameter posterior distributions were found to be unimodal and nearly normally distributed. The emitter head loss coefficient distribution being very significant suggests the need to incorporate it into the hydraulic modeling. Although the example given in this paper relates to steep slopes, the methodologies are general and can be applied to any use of drip laterals. 3amicroirrigation 3arailroads 3afield experimentation 3ahydraulic systems 3aemitters (equipment) 3aequipment design 3aequations 3aalgorithms 3asemiarid zones 3aQueensland 0aembankments0 tJournal of irrigation and drainage engineering.g2007 , v. 133, no. 6 p.512-519x0733-94377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2007)133:6(512)3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://ascelibrary.aip.org/iro/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080828b20080905c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/01/29  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02472naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008400125300001600209500001500225520134100240650001601581650001401597650001801611650002701629650002001656650001701676650001601693650001801709650002101727650001301748651001401761651001801775651001001793651001001803651001101813651000901824653001501833700001801848773009401866852000901960930003301969945001302002946001102015655001202026IND2321601420221121073149.0010618e200105  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232160142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyerza, R.10aThermal adaptability of olive (Olea europaea L.) to the Arid Chaco of Argentina  ap. 277-285.  a2019-12-05  aIn Argentina, the proposed expansion of olive growing into areas ecologically different from areas where commercial plantations now exist, carries a high probability of failure. Temperatures in the Chaco ecosystem may not be conducive to olive production. Thus, the effects of temperatures on flowering and fruiting on olive trees were investigated using a model of thermal adaptability. The model evaluated vernalization periods for 19 sites of Argentina, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Spain and USA, using maximum mean temperatures of <21.1 and >12.5 degrees C and minimum mean temperatures of <12.5 and >0.0 degrees C. The probability of obtaining temperatures included within limits for each 10-day period during the vernalization interval was calculated. Daily probability and the number of days within each period were taken as binomial parameters and outlined as binomial modes. To determine the probability of high temperature damage during flowering within each region, temperatures equal to or higher than 37.8 degrees C were considered. To determine damage produced by late frost, temperature equal to or below 0 degrees C that occurred during flowering within each region was considered. Analysis of thermal information for olive sites proposed for the Arid Chaco indicates important differences from traditional olive growing sites. 3aplantations 3aflowering 3avernalization 3ageographical variation 3aair temperature 3afrost injury 3aheat injury 3aOlea europaea 3aclimatic factors 3afruiting 3aArgentina 3aUnited States 3aItaly 3aSpain 3aMexico 3aPeru 0aadaptation1 aSibbett, G.S.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2001 May, v. 84, no. 3 p.277-285x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01665naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245013200144300001400276520059900290650002700889650002300916650001800939650003200957650006400989650003201053650002401085651001101109653001501120700001601135773009801151852000901249930003301258945001301291946001101304655001201315IND2041473020221121073206.0940816e199404  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204147302DNAL7 a80607962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacquet, C.10aDifferences in the sensitivity to eight disinfectants of Listeria monocytogenes strains as related to their origin (short note)  ap. 79-83.  aThe efficacy of eight commercialized disinfectants proposed by several manufacturers was evaluated using the French standard in the presence of organic matter and against Listeria monocytogenes and L. innocua strains isolated in a dairy plant, against other Listeria strains of various origin and reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium.

In this study, polymer microdevices with monolithic columns and electrophoretic channels were used for biological separations. Glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate monolithic columns were formed within poly(methyl methacrylate) microchannels by in situ photopolymerization. Flow experiments in these columns demonstrated retention and then elution of amino acids under conditions optimized for sample preconcentration. To enhance analyte selectivity, antibodies were immobilized on monoliths, and subsequent lysozyme treatment blocked nonspecific adsorption. The enrichment capability and selectivity of these affinity monoliths were evaluated by purifying fluorescently tagged amino acids from a mixture containing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Twenty-fold enrichment and 91% recovery were achieved for the labeled amino acids, with a >25 000-fold reduction in GFP concentration, as indicated by microchip electrophoresis analysis. These devices should provide a simple, inexpensive, and effective platform for trace analysis in complex biological samples.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadsorption 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3acapillary electrophoresis 3agreen fluorescent protein 3alysozyme 3apolymers1 aSun, Xiuhua1 aPan, Tao1 aWoolley, Adam T.0 tElectrophoresis.g2008 Aug., v. 29, no. 16 p.3429-3435dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2007007043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02821naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245012100142300001600263520130600279650001801585650002201603650001701625650002001642650002101662650002201683650001501705650001501720650001301735650001501748650001301763650002201776650002701798650003701825650001201862650003801874650003601912650002701948650004501975650002202020650002702042650002602069653001602095653001702111700001502128773008202143852000902225930003302234945001302267946001102280655001202291IND2062238920221121055539.0980304e199507  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206223892DNAL7 a85372992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyama, M.10aActivation of adenylate cyclase by divalent cations and polyamines in saponin-treated Dictyostelium discoideum cells  ap. 117-121.  aBinding of an intrinsic agonist (cyclic AMP) to specific receptors on the cell surface induces transmembrane signals for the activation of adenylate cyclase in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. We found that stimulation by CaCl2, MgSO4 or polyamines having two to four positive charges induced the activation of adenylate cyclase in cells treated with saponin. The activation was roughly identical to the stimulation of the intrinsic agonist both in amount and in time course. The intact cells (saponin-untreated cells) responded to neither divalent cations nor polyamines. While saponin is known to have a detergent-like effect and to make the plasma membrane permeable, low molecular weight dyes did not penetrate the plasma membrane under our conditions for the saponin-treatment. Caffeine is known to inhibit the cAMP-induced activation of adenylate cyclase by blocking signal transduction, but not by acting directly on the enzyme [Brenner, M. and Thoms, S.D. (1984) Dev. Biol. 101, 136-146]. We found that caffeine inhibited the cation-induced activation. These results suggest that these divalent and polyvalent cations do not act directly on adenylate cyclase but that they mimic or induce the transmembrane activation signal for adenylate cyclase in the saponin-treated cells. 3aDictyostelium 3aadenylate cyclase 3aAdenoviridae 3aenzyme activity 3acalcium chloride 3amagnesium sulfate 3aputrescine 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3acyclic AMP 3asaponins 3aguanylate cyclase 3aadenosine triphosphate 2aAdenylyl Cyclasesxdrug effects. 2aAnimals 2aBiogenic Polyaminesxpharmacology 2aCations, Divalentxpharmacology 2aCyclic AMPxmetabolism 2aDictyosteliumxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aEnzyme Activation 2aSaponinsxpharmacology 2aStimulation, Chemical 0astimulation 0adisodium atp1 aKubota, K.0 tJournal of biochemistry.g1995 July, v. 118, no. 1 p.117-121x0021-924X7nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01394naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010800127300001400235500001500249520050800264650002700772650003800799650001700837650002200854653002300876653002700899773010000926852000901026930003301035945001301068946001101081655001201092IND2040026020221121055538.0940603e199401  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204002602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrow, P.A.10aSerological diagnosis of Salmonella serotype enteritidis infections in poultry by ELISA and other tests  ap. 55-68.  a2019-12-05  aSerological methods have increasingly been used for the detection of invasive Salmonella serotypes including enteritidis in poultry.

Design: Cross-sectional dietary survey. Intake estimates were based on 24-hour recall interviews. Subject: Community-based samples of 946 men and women (455 American Samoans, 491 Western Samoans) aged 25 to 55 years. Statistical analyses: Tests of differences in means (t tests) and proportions (X(2) tests). Correlation and multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to describe correlates of energy and nutrient intakes. Results: Few differences were noted between the energy and nutrient intakes of men and women, but substantial differences were found between residents of American Samoa and those of the less modernized country of Western Samoa. American Samoans consumed significantly more energy as carbohydrate (47% vs 44%) and protein (18% vs 13%) and less as fat (36% vs 46%) and saturated fat (16% vs 30%). Energy-adjusted intakes of cholesterol and sodium were higher among American Samoans. These differences persisted after adjustment for age, gender, years of education, occupation, and categories of a 10-point material lifestyle score. Samoans in the lowest category of material lifestyle had significantly lower energy-adjusted intakes of protein, cholesterol, and sodium and higher intakes of saturated fat than those in the upper 2 categories. Additional analyses described the contribution of specific foods to the intakes of energy and macronutrients. Conclusions/applications: The observed energy and nutrient intake patterns are consistent with previously reported levels of obesity and risk factors for cardiovascular disease among Samoans and suggest dietary modification for those at highest risk. Dietetics practitioners who counsel Samoan and other Pacific Islander clients should be aware of these intake patterns, which seem particularly malleable to levels of personal income. More generally, results from this study illustrate that the food choices of certain ethnic groups may be profoundly affected by the process of modernization within a country or by migration to a more economically developed locale. 3amodernization 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3adietary carbohydrate 3aobesity 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aadults 3anutrient intake 3aheart diseases 3arisk assessment 3asodium 3asaturated fatty acids 3aemployment 3alifestyle 3aeducation 3afood intake 3adietary protein 3aincome 3agender differences 3acholesterol 3asocioeconomic status 3afood choices 3aSamoa 0adiet1 aMcGarvey, S.T.1 aQuested, C.1 aSio, B.1 aAfele-Fa'amuli, S.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1999 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.184-190x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03691naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141072001700159072001700176100001900193245011200212300001600324500001500340520237400355650001902729650002402748650002502772650002002797650002102817650001302838653002002851700001502871700001902886773010102905852000903006856009903015856007303114930003303187945002503220946001303245990002303258655001203281IND4400140420221121044941.0080117e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440014042DNAL7 a10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2007)133:6(520)2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aProvenzano, G.10aNew computational fluid dynamic procedure to estimate friction and local losses in coextruded drip laterals  ap. 520-527.  a2019-12-04  aThe design of trickle irrigation systems is crucial to optimize profitability and to warrant high values for the emission uniformity (EU) coefficient. EU depends on variation of the pressure head due to head losses along the lines and elevation changes, as well as the water temperature, and other parameters related to the emitters (manufacturer's coefficient of variation, number of emitters per plants, emitter spacing). Trickle irrigation plants are usually designed using small diameter plastic pipes (polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride). The design problem, therefore, needs to consider head losses along the lines as well as emitter discharge variations due to the manufacturer's variability. Variations in the hydraulic head are a consequence of both friction losses along the pipe and local losses due to the emitters' connections, whose importance has been recently emphasized. Since each local loss depends on the emitter type (in-line or on-line) as well as on its shape and dimensions, the morphological variability of the commercially available emitter requires experimental investigations to determine local losses in drip laterals. On the other hand, local losses can be estimated by the mean of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, allowing analysis of velocity profiles and the turbulence caused by the emitters' connections. FLUENT software can be considered a powerful tool to evaluate friction and local losses in drip irrigation laterals, after the necessary validation has been carried out by means of experimental data. The main objective of this study was to assess a CFD technique to evaluate friction and local losses in laterals with in-line coextruded emitters. The model was initially used to choose the turbulence model allowing the most accurate estimation of friction losses in small diameter polyethylene pipes, characterized by low Reynolds number. Second, the possibility of using CFD to predict local losses in drip irrigation laterals with a commercially available coextruded emitter was investigated. Simulated local losses were obtained as difference of the total and friction losses along a trunk of pipe, where one single emitter was installed, not considering the emitter outflow. The proposed procedure allows to evaluate local losses for other different emitter models, avoiding tedious and time-consuming experiments. 3aturbulent flow 3amathematical models 3aemitters (equipment) 3amicroirrigation 3aequipment design 3afriction 0afluid mechanics1 aDi Dio, P.1 aSalvador, G.P.0 tJournal of irrigation and drainage engineering.g2007 , v. 133, no. 6 p.520-527x0733-94377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2007)133:6(520)3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://ascelibrary.aip.org/iro/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080828b20080905c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/01/29  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03510naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245015600126300001600282500001500298520190400313650001502217650001402232650002602246650002102272650001302293650001902306650001902325650001602344650002402360650002102384650001102405650001302416650001202429650001702441650001802458650001302476650002602489650002302515650002502538650001302563651001102576653001602587653001902603653002202622653002702644700002002671700001502691700001902706700001902725700001302744773009702757852000902854930003302863945001302896946001102909655001202920IND2205835820221121045002.0000718e199907  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220583582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchroth, G.10aSubsoil accumulation of mineral nitrogen under polyculture and monoculture plantations, fallow and primary forest in a ferralitic Amazonian upland soil  ap. 109-120.  a2019-12-05  aCentral Amazonia is characterized by high and intensive rainfall and permeable soils. When rainforests are cleared for agricultural use, the efficient nutrient recycling mechanisms of the forests are disrupted and the nutrient availability in the topsoil is increased by fertilization, thereby increasing the potential for nutrient leaching. In this study, the distribution of mineral N in the upper two meters of a ferralitic upland soil was evaluated as an indicator for nutrient leaching and for the potential contribution of the subsoil to crop nutrition. A perennial polyculture system with four tree crops and a leguminous cover crop at two fertilization levels was compared with a monoculture plantation of peach palm (Bactris gasipaes), spontaneous fallow and primary rainforest. Mineral N accumulated principally as nitrate in the subsoil under all agricultural crops and also under the primary forest, although to a lesser extent. Within the polyculture system, there were significant differences in N accumulation between the tree crop species, and for one of the species (Theobroma grandiflorum) also between fertilization levels. The principal sources of subsoil N were mineral fertilizer and presumably N from the mineralization of leguminous biomass and soil organic matter. The N losses from the agricultural systems and the absence of yield responses of the tree crops to N fertilization indicated that agricultural production was not limited by N at this site, or that N was too rapidly leached to be taken up efficiently by the crops. None of the tree crop species seemed to be efficient in capturing leached N. Strategies are discussed for reducing N losses from agricultural systems with perennial crops, including the development of site- and species-specific fertilizer recommendations, closer tree spacing, and the encouragement of lateral and vertical tree root development. 3asoil depth 3aTheobroma 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aBactris gasipaes 3aFabaceae 3asoil fertility 3amineralization 3aEschweilera 3asoil organic matter 3atropical forests 3afallow 3aleaching 3abiomass 3aupland soils 3aBixa orellana 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aforest plantations 3aBertholletia excelsa 3anitrates 3aBrazil 0aplantations 0asoil chemistry 0aoenocarpus bacaba 0atheobroma grandiflorum1 aSilva, L.F. da.1 aSeixas, R.1 aTeixeira, W.G.1 aMacedo, J.L.V.1 aZech, W.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g1999 July, v. 75, no. 1/2 p.109-120x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03411naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245016300145300001600308500001500324520165500339650001801994650002302012650001202035650002502047650001702072650001002089650001602099650003502115650001802150650002302168650001602191650003302207650001002240650001802250650001902268650001202287650002702299650002802326650003202354650002602386650003902412650003602451650001602487653001602503653001902519653002802538653001002566653002502576700001502601700001502616700001802631773008202649852000902731930003302740945001302773946001102786655001202797IND2053972820221121045145.0961112e199504  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205397282DNAL7 a75925552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, H.10aNucleotide sequence and characterization of the large mitochondrial rRNA gene of Penicillium urticae, and its comparison with those of other filamentous fungi  ap. 888-896.  a2019-12-05  aThe nucleotide sequence of a large rRNA gene and its flanking regions in cloned fragments of mitochondrial DNA from a patulin producer, Penicillium urticae NRRL2159A, was determined by dideoxy sequencing, and the 5' end and intron-exon border of the l-rRNA gene were determined by primer extension analysis and RNA sequencing, respectively. In addition to the extensive sequence homology of the 3' end of the P. urticae mt l-rRNA gene with those of Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa, the P. urticae gene had a 1,685 bp intron which separates a 3,307 bp 5' exon and a 583 bp 3' exon. In spite of being closely related Penicillium species, the size of the 5' exon of the P. urticae mt l-rRNA is 472 bp larger than that of P. chrysogenum, whereas the sizes of the 3' exon and intron of P. urticae are very similar to those of P. chrysogenum (581 bp for the 3' exon and 1,678 bp for the intron). The intron of P. urticae contains a structure similar to the consensus one of the self splicing group IA intron and a large open reading frame suggested to be a gene for ribosomal protein S5. A sequence similar to the I-SceI recognition sequence was found at the exon-intron border. Extensive sequence homology was observed between P. urticae and P. chrysogenum, exceptions being in four regions in the 5' exon. These non-homologous regions were located in the hairpin and variable regions outside of the core structures. Comparison of the mt l-rRNA sequences of several filamentous fungi revealed that the above four non-homologous regions are greatly expanded, and two other non-homologous regions appear at the 3' ends of the 5' exon and 3' exon. 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence alignment 3aintrons 3aamino acid sequences 3amitochondria 3aexons 3aPenicillium 2aAspergillus nidulansxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aExons 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenome, Fungal 2aIntrons 2aMitochondriaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeurospora crassaxgenetics 2aPenicilliumxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2arRNA Operon 0acomparisons 0agenbank/d14567 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences1 aNaruse, A.1 aOhsaki, T.1 aSekiguchi, J.0 tJournal of biochemistry.g1995 Apr., v. 117, no. 4 p.888-896x0021-924X7nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03095naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245019900144300001600343500001500359520127400374650001901648650002001667650001301687650002001700650003001720650002001750650001701770650001801787650004001805650003601845650002101881650004401902650002001946650002401966650002501990650002802015650003102043650001302074650006802087650002302155650002602178650001602204650006602220653002402286700001402310700001402324700001502338700001502353773008302368852000902451930003302460945001302493946001102506655001202517IND2057427320221121035813.0970602e199509  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205742732DNAL7 a86907182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshigi, N.10aConstruction of a plasmid used for the expression of a sevenfold-mutant barley beta-amylase with increased thermostability in Escherichia coli and properties of the sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase  ap. 562-567.  a2019-12-05  aTo increase the thermostability of beta-amylase, seven kinds of single-mutant plasmids were constructed with an expression vector of barley beta-amylase by mutagenesis. The remaining activity versus temperature curves were used to determine the temperatures (T50) at which 50% of the initial activity was lost during a 30-min heating period. These mutations increased the T50 values by amounts ranging from 0.8 to 3.2 degrees C. To express the sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase in Escherichia coli, plasmid pB927 was constructed. E. coli harboring plasmid pB927 produced sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase. The T50 value of purified sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase (69.0 degrees C) was higher than that of not only the original recombinant beta-amylase (57.4 degrees C) by 11.6 C but also soybean beta-amylase (63.2 C) by 5.8 C. The intragenic amino acid replacements were found to have simple additive effects on the thermos/ability of beta-amylase. The sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase was found to be stable at pHs up to 12.5, while the original recombinant beta-amylase was unstable at pHs above 9.5. The data obtained from kinetics studies suggested that the sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase acquired enhanced thermostability, but its function as a beta-amylase remained unchanged. 3aheat stability 3aHordeum vulgare 3aplasmids 3agene expression 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aenzyme activity 3abeta-amylase 2aBase Sequence 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aEnzyme Stability 2aEscherichia colixenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGenetic Vectors 2aHordeumxenzymology 2aMetalsxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aMutation 2aPlant Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 2abeta-Amylasexantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenetic engineering1 aOkada, Y.1 aMaeba, H.1 aSahara, H.1 aTamaki, T.0 tJournal of biochemistry.g1995 Sept., v. 118, no. 3 p.562-567x0021-924X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03666naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245014600123300001300269520239400282650001302676650002202689650002602711650001602737650001502753650001202768650001502780650001302795650001302808650002602821650002202847650002002869650001802889650001502907650001402922650002102936651002802957653002302985653002103008700002103029773009203050852000903142930003303151945001303184946001103197655001203208IND2322881320221121035706.0010905e200107  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232288132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaag, D.10aLandscape fate of nitrate fluxes and emissions in Central Europe. A critical review of concepts, data, and models for transport and retention  ap. 1-21.  aAgroecosystems are leaky systems emitting nutrients like nitrate, which affect ecosystems on a range of scales. This paper examines the fate of nitrate on the landscape level focussing on how landscape components either facilitate or impede N translocation from the field to the stream (headwater). According to their role in landscape metabolism, two categories of landscape components are distinguished, ecotones/retention compartments and conduits/corridors. Conduits such as macropores, preferential interflow-paths, drainage tiles and streams rapidly relocate nitrate to headwaters. Retention compartments like the capillary fringe/saturated zone and riparian vegetation eliminate N through denitrification. The differential role of compartments is illustrated with quantitative examples from the literature. On the landscape level retention potential for N is spatially variable and quantitatively limited, while its realisation is uncertain. Notwithstanding, the literature indicates that on a watershed basis the bulk of total N input is retained; thus the potential is discussed for the retention of nitrate on different scales, i.e. the field, landscape, regional and global scale. The transitory retention of excess nitrate in soil and subsoil solution, soil organic matter, groundwater and riparian vegetation may delay nitrate discharge to the aquatic system for decades, contributing to the low emission factors on basin scale. The adverse effects arising from denitrification are discussed, presenting data on the emission of nitrous oxide from the entirety of the different landscape compartments. It is concluded that reliance on landscape metabolism and self-purification postpones the problem of global N overload and partially transfers it to the atmosphere. An assessment scheme is presented which in the face of the unpredictability of ecosystem and landscape behaviour is risk oriented (instead of impact oriented). The scheme uses a budget approach, which accounts for the critical role of corridors and considers the scale and scope of N emissions. A conceptual framework for the remediation of N overload is presented which rests on the realisation of cycling principles and zero-emission approaches on all scales of agricultural production and which pleads for regional approaches that transcend sectoral boundaries and take account of overall regional N fluxes. 3anitrates 3asimulation models 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aagriculture 3aecosystems 3astreams 3ametabolism 3aecotones 3adrainage 3aquantitative analysis 3aspatial variation 3adenitrification 3anitrous oxide 3alandscapes 3aemissions 3ariparian buffers 3aCentral European region 0aliterature reviews 0amovement in soil1 aKaupenjohann, M.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2001 July, v. 86, no. 1 p.1-21x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03222naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002400128245007900152300001600231520182600247650001602073650002302089650002302112650002102135650002102156650002402177650001502201650001502216650001602231650001102247650001602258650001502274650003602289650001802325650002102343650002602364650001002390650002202400650001102422650001102433650000902444653001502453700001902468700001802487700001702505773010202522852000902624930003302633945001302666946001302679655001202692IND2202270020221121035740.0000121e199902  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220227002DNAL7 a99721872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopp-Hoolihan, L.E.10aElevated resting energy expenditure in adolescents with sickle cell anemia  ap. 195-199.  aObjective: To assess the reliabillty of standard prediction equations in estimating resting energy expenditure (REE) values in adolescents with sickle cell anemia. Subjects/design: Body composition and metabolic measurements were performed in 8 adolescents, aged 11 to 18 years, with homozygous sickle cell anemia. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry under standard conditions, and measurements were compared with 4 prediction formulas (Harris-Benedict, Schofield, Mayo Clinic, and Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University). Fat-free mass was measured to assess REE per unit of actively metabolizing tissue. Fat-free mass was expressed as a mean of values obtained by densitometry, deuterium dilution, (40)K-counting, and total body electrical conductivity. Statistical analyses: Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to determine whether measured REE values and predicted values differed. The Fischer test was used to identify which predicted values differed significantly from the measured REE. Results: All 4 prediction formulas significantly underestimated REE. Group mean values for the prediction formulas ranged from 83% to 89% of the measured value. REE averaged 47.7 +/- 10.0 kcal/kg fat-free mass per day which is 30% to 50% higher than reported values in healthy adolescent populations. Conclusions: These data suggest that REE is elevated in adolescents with sickle cell anemia. Standard equations used to predict REE are unreliable in these patients. Applications REE in patients with sickle cell anemia is best determined by indirect or direct measurement of energy expenditure. Clinically useful formulas to estimate REE should be developed for patients with conditions, including sickle cell anemia, where the metabolic rate may be altered. 3aadolescents 3asickle cell anemia 3aenergy expenditure 3abasal metabolism 3abody composition 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3aestimation 3ameasurement 3aheight 3abody weight 2aAdolescent 2aAnemia, Sickle Cellxmetabolism 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Composition 2aCalorimetry, Indirect 2aChild 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 0aevaluation1 aVan Loan, M.D.1 aMentzer, W.C.1 aHeyman, M.B.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1999 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.195-199x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02771naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245013200142300001400274520144000288650002101728650001301749650001501762650003001777650001101807650002601818650002601844650004401870650003501914650004601949650001901995650001402014650003702028650005202065653001702117653001402134653001702148700001402165773008002179852000902259930003302268945001302301946001102314655001202325IND2050522220221121035702.0960326e199501  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205052222DNAL7 a77753992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, E.O.10aPalmitoyl lysozyme-induced stabilization of PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) liposomes and their interaction with Candida albicans  ap. 54-58.  aThe interaction with fungal cells of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine liposomes coated with palmitoyl lysozyme was investigated using lysozyme as a stabilizer for an unstable bilayer as well as a recognizer for a specific target cell. Lysozyme, which interacts with chitin in the fungal cell wall, lyses chitin and kills the cells, was acylated with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of palmitic acid (NHSP) and incorporated into the lipid bilayer. Lysozyme was optimally modified when the ratio of NHSP to lysozyme was 15 at pH 8.0. Modification of lysozyme was detected by SDS-PAGE, and its molecular weight was about 1,500 greater than that of the intact lysozyme at the optimal ratio of NHSP to lysozyme. The activity of palmitoyl lysozyme toward glycolchitin was reduced to 35% of that of intact lysozyme. Both lysozyme and palmitoyl lysozyme had antifungal activities, but palmitoyl lysozyme was more effective than intact lysozyme against Candida albicans. The minimal molar ratio of palmitoyl lysozyme to phosphatidylethanolamine required to form stable liposomes was 2.4 X 10(-4), and the optimal ratio was about 2.4 X 10(-3). The percentage survival of cells treated with the inserted palmitoyl lysozyme was lower than that of cells treated with free palmitoyl lysozyme. These findings suggest that palmitoyl lysozyme-incorporated liposomal membrane is more effectively adsorbed by Candida albicans than free palimitoyl lysozyme is. 3aCandida albicans 3alysozyme 3apalmitates 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3achitin 3adrug delivery systems 3aantifungal properties 2aAntifungal Agentsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aCandida albicansxdrug effects 2aChitinxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aDrug Stability 2aLiposomes 2aMuramidasexchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPhosphatidylethanolaminesxchemistryxtoxicity. 0ainteractions 0aliposomes 0aglycolchitin1 aKim, J.D.0 tJournal of biochemistry.g1995 Jan., v. 117, no. 1 p.54-58x0021-924X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03560naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010200128300001600230500009200246500001500338520221100353650001302564650002202577650001502599650002602614650001502640650001002655650001702665650001602682650002202698650001702720650001302737650001502750650001002765653001302775653001702788653001802805653001802823653001502841653001302856653001702869700001702886773009702903852000903000930003303009945001303042946001103055655001203066IND2322370120221121035757.0010802e200106  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232237012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoorl, J.M.10aLinking land use and landscape process modelling: a case study for the Alora region (south Spain)  ap. 281-292.  aIn the special issue: Predicting land-use change / edited by A. Veldkamp and E. Lambin.  a2019-12-05  aChanging land use is increasingly known to affect on-site landscape properties, nevertheless off-site effects are often neglected. A single process landscape evolution model (LandscApe ProcesS modelling at mUlti dimensions and scaleS (LAPSUS)) is used to explore the impacts of land use changes on landscape and soil properties. Examples are shown for both on-site as well as off-site effects of land use change and the influence of different pathways of change. A case study area near Alora, in the province of Malaga, south Spain is selected. In this area the main land use consists of citrus, olive/almond, wheat, semi-natural vegetation and a rest group (bare, river beds, urban). For a period of 10 years LAPSUS calculates soil redistribution (erosion and sedimentation) for different scenarios of input parameters. These inputs are a digital elevation model (e.g. slope lengths and angles), precipitation, soil erodibility, and land use related infiltration. For each scenario, different assumptions are made on direction and rate of land use change. As an example, effects of abandonment of olive orchards are demonstrated, simulating both a fast and gradual change for a period of 10 years. Each scenario produces different spatial and temporal patterns of total amounts of erosion and sedimentation throughout the landscape. As a result, potential land use related parameters like soil depth, infiltration and flooding risk change significantly too. The scenario of an abrupt change produces the highest erosion rates compared to the gradual change scenario and the baseline scenario. However, because of the multi-dimensional characteristics of the landscape, not only the area suffering from land use changes is affected. Increasing erosion and run-off rates from upstream-located olive orchards have an impact on down slope local run-on, erosion and sedimentation rates. In this case, the citrus orchards situated in the valley bottom locally suffer damages from re-sedimentation events but benefit from the increase in run-on water and nutrients. Concluding, off-site effects from an exogenous driven change in land use (EC subsidies) can trigger endogenous land use changes in adjacent areas. 3aorchards 3asimulation models 3alandscapes 3anutrient availability 3asoil depth 3awater 3asoil erosion 3aerodibility 3aspatial variation 3acase studies 3aland use 3avegetation 3acrops 0aflooding 0asloping land 0aprecipitation 0asedimentation 0aincentives 0apatterns 0ainfiltration1 aVeldkamp, A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2001 June, v. 85, no. 1/3 p.281-292x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02222naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245011100149300001600260520087100276650001601147650002601163650001601189650000701205650002001212650001201232650002501244650001801269650002201287650003101309650002301340650002301363650003401386650006301420650001601483650001701499653002301516653001101539700001801550700001801568773010001586852000901686930003301695945001301728946001101741655001201752IND2041043620221121035616.0940725e199402  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204104362DNAL7 a80249742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutherland, J.P.10aPredictive modelling of growth of Staphylococcus aureus: theeffects of temperature, pH and sodium chloride  ap. 217-236.  aThe growth responses of Staphylococcus aureus as affected by NaCl concentration, pH value and storage temperature were studied in laboratory medium.

All predictions were consistently 'fail-safe'. 3afood safety 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3atemperature 3apH 3asodium chloride 2aAnimals 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aCulture Media 2aFood Microbiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aModels, Biological 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 0aliterature reviews 0agrowth1 aBayliss, A.J.1 aRoberts, T.A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1994 Feb., v. 21, no. 3 p.217-236x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02834naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001200128245013200140300001600272520146300288650002001751650001101771650001301782650002501795650001401820650002001834650000701854650001401861650002401875650001201899650002501911650001301936650002701949650001101976650002201987650002802009650005402037650003402091653002102125653001602146700001502162700001402177773008302191852000902274930003302283945001302316946001102329655001202340IND2057427020221121023920.0970602e199509  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205742702DNAL7 a86907152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, Y.10aInsect lysozyme from house fly (Musca domestica) larvae: possible digestive function based on sequence and enzymatic properties  ap. 546-551.  aLysozyme was purified from the homogenate of the whole body of house fly (Musca domestica) larvae by standard chromatographic techniques. The purified lysozyme was sequenced and its enzymatic properties were examined. This lysozyme was a chicken-type lysozyme composed of 122 amino acids, showing about 75% identity with fruit fly lysozymes and 38% with human lysozyme. This enzyme was inactive towards Micrococcus luteus under the physiological conditions of pH 7.0 and ionic strength 0.1, but was as active towards glycol chitin as was hen lysozyme. The pH-dependent profile of lytic activity towards M. luteus showed that house fly lysozyme has an acidic pH optimum and shows no enzymatic activity above pH7. These features are analogous with those of ruminant stomach lysozymes which have evolved for the digestive function, suggesting that this lysozyme does not function as a self-defense protein, like hen and human lysozyme, but as a digestive enzyme, probably in the gut of the insect body. Although a similar functional conversion to digestive enzyme was reported in fruit fly, phylogenetic tree analysis indicates that the evolutionary change of lysozyme to a digestive enzyme occurred similarly in fruit fly and house fly, but the events are not related and occurred independently in each strain. This observation is in contrast with the case of ruminant stomach lysozymes, which were recruited before the divergence of each species of ruminants. 3aMusca domestica 3alarvae 3alysozyme 3aamino acid sequences 3aphylogeny 3aenzyme activity 3apH 3adigestion 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aChickens 2aHousefliesxenzymology 2aHumans 2aLarvaxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMuramidasexisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acharacterization 0acomparisons1 aHotani, T.1 aImoto, T.0 tJournal of biochemistry.g1995 Sept., v. 118, no. 3 p.546-551x0021-924X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02346naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008800127300001400215500001500229520133000244650001201574650002301586650001301609650001901622650002301641650002301664650001501687650001901702650001301721650001301734651001001747653002201757653002201779773009301801852000901894930003301903945001301936946001101949655001201960IND2206412720221120233904.0000814e199910  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220641272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImbernon, J.10aPattern and development of land-use changes in the Kenyan highlands since the 1950s  ap. 67-73.  a2019-12-05  aLand-use and land-cover change can play a pivotal role in environmental changes. Using aerial photos and spot satellite image on two nearby but different agroecological zones of the Kenyan highlands, an extensive semi-arid area in the lower zone and a humid area in the upper zone, significant land-use changes were identified between 1958, 1985 and 1995. These land-use changes were observed through a photo-interpretation of photos and image with a common classification scheme. The pattern and the development of land-use change differed markedly over the 40-year period between the upper and the lower zone. The introduction of cash-crops had a significant impact on the land-use in the upper zone. Tree plantations whose lines characterize the present landscape came with the switch to cash-crops. In contrast, although no significant land-use changes occurred between 1958 and 1985 in the lower zone, the changes over the last 10 years were significant, with a 75% increase in cultivated land area. Part of these land-use changes can be explained by strong links between the two zones, as the lower zone became an outlet for the very high population density of the upper zone. This study is a first step for an in-depth characterization of the various driving forces and for land-use planning in these Kenyan highlands. 3ahistory 3aforest plantations 3aplanning 3asemiarid zones 3aaerial photography 3apopulation density 3acash crops 3aremote sensing 3aaltitude 3aland use 3aKenya 0anatural resources 0asatellite imagery0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g1999 Oct., v. 76, no. 1 p.67-73x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03284naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100002400178245008200202300001600284520177800300650001102078650001502089650002502104650001702129650001202146650002702158650002002185650001802205650001102223650001602234650002002250650001602270650002302286650002902309650001402338650001402352650003002366650002702396650002602423650002502449650002102474650003002495653002302525653002802548773007602576852000902652930003302661945002502694946001102719655001202730IND4409708720221120233608.0080902s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440970872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSarkar, Shondeep L.10aEffect of probiotics on biotechnological characteristics of yoghurt: A review  ap. 717-740.  aPurpose -- Probiotics are known to extend health benefits and therefore may be included during yoghurt manufacture to enhance its prophylactic properties. Different probiotic strains may exhibit diverse biotechnological behaviour in association with yoghurt cultures, therefore interactive behaviour amongst probiotic and yoghurt cultures must be evaluated prior to their commercial application. This paper aims to assess the effect of inclusion of different probiotic cultures on various biotechnological (technological, dietetic and prophylactic) characteristics of yoghurt cultures. Design/methodology/approach -- Yoghurt was assessed for technological characteristics based on acidification and flavour production, dietetic characteristics based on proteolytic activity, vitamin synthesis and L (+) lactic acid production and prophylactic characteristics based on ss-galactosidase activity, antibacterial spectrum, viability in product as well as during gastro-intestinal transit, intestinal colonization, immunomodulation, anti-carcinogenicity and hypocholesterolemic effect. Findings -- Different probiotic cultures exhibited diverse technological, dietetic and prophylactic behaviour in association with yoghurt cultures. Functional properties of traditional yoghurt could be enhanced with the combined introduction of probiotic cultures such as Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus and the resultant product may be recommended for consumption as a dietary adjunct. Originality/value -- The paper shows that combined introduction of probiotic cultures such as B. bifidum, B. infantis and L. acidophilus, as microbial additives during the manufacture of yoghurt would result in a product with enhanced functional properties. 3ayogurt 3aprobiotics 3alactic acid bacteria 3ahealth foods 3astrains 3acultured milk starters 3adisease control 3aacidification 3aflavor 3aproteolysis 3avitamin content 3alactic acid 3abeta-galactosidase 3aantibacterial properties 3aviability 3adigestion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3abacterial colonization 3acompetitive exclusion 3acholesteremic effect 3aimmunostimulants 3aanticarcinogenic activity 0aliterature reviews 0aprophylactic properties0 tBritish food journal.g2008, v. 110, no. 6-7 p.717-740x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02781naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011300129300001600242520150500258650001301763650002601776650001901802650002701821650002501848650001901873650001901892650002301911650001301934650001301947650002301960650001701983650001802000650001502018651001302033653001502046653002702061653001102088700001702099700001702116700001702133773009502150852000902245930003302254945001302287946001102300655001202311IND2207625020221120222500.0001103e200002  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220762502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenalled, F.D.10aPost-dispersal weed seed predation in Michigan crop fields as a function of agricultural landscape structure  ap. 193-202.  aWeed seed predation by invertebrates and vertebrates was compared between a simple (large crop fields embedded in a matrix of widely scattered woodlots and hedgerows) and a complex (small crop fields embedded in a matrix of numerous hedgerows and woodlots) agricultural landscape in southern Michigan. The structural landscapes were evaluated by analysis of aerial photographs and digital land-use data. Seed predation experiments were conducted in four conventional tillage corn (Zea mays L.) fields within each landscape type. Trials included four common agricultural weed species, i.e., crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis), giant foxtail (Setaria faberii), pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti). Treatments to exclude vertebrates, invertebrates + invertebrates and no exclusion were established at 27 m from hedgerows. Fields in the complex landscape were 75% smaller, had 63% more wooded perimeter, and 81% more wide hedgerow perimeter than fields in the simple landscape. Fields in the simple landscape were surrounded mainly by herbaceous roadside and crops, whereas the complex landscape had fields surrounded primarily by wide hedgerows. In both the landscape types there was considerable post-dispersal weed seed removal with a tendency towards higher removal rates in the complex landscape. Although there were no differences in the rate of seed removal among the four weed species, seed predation showed a high degree of variability within and among fields. 3aZea mays 3aDigitaria sanguinalis 3aSetaria faberi 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3aAbutilon theophrasti 3aseed dispersal 3aseed predation 3aaerial photography 3aland use 3aecotones 3abiological control 3ainsect pests 3asmall mammals 3alandscapes 3aMichigan 0afield size 0aagricultural geography 0ahedges1 aMarino, P.C.1 aRenner, K.A.1 aLandis, D.A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2000 Feb., v. 77, no. 3 p.193-202x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01700naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010200125300001600227520071400243650001500957650002200972650002300994650002501017650001101042650001701053650002401070650001501094650002301109651001301132700001701145700001501162773009501177852000901272930003301281945001301314946001101327655001201338IND2207625820221122114506.0001103e200002  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220762582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoate, C.10aFactors affecting corn bunting Miliaria calandra abundance in a Portuguese agricultural landscape  ap. 219-226.  aBreeding and wintering abundance of corn buntings in an agricultural landscape of Alentejo (southern Portugal) was assessed in relation to agricultural intensification and other environmental variable during 1994-1997, using distance sampling and multivariate regression. Bird abundance was lowest in intensively managed farmland in both seasons, and was related positively to fallow area in winter and to the presence of game management and oats in spring. Fallows and oats were associated with extensively managed farmland, but the implementation of a managed hunting regime was unrelated to agricultural intensification. The importance of extensive arable systems to corn bunting conservation is discussed. 3awild birds 3aagricultural land 3apopulation density 3aspatial distribution 3afallow 3aAvena sativa 3awildlife management 3alandscapes 3aintensive forestry 3aPortugal1 aBorralho, R.1 aAraujo, M.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2000 Feb., v. 77, no. 3 p.219-226x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02222naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162100001800179245003600197300001600233500001500249520102100264650002401285650002101309650001901330650002101349650001801370650002201388650002101410650002001431650001801451650001201469653001301481653002301494653002701517773008101544852000901625856008501634930003301719945002501752946001101777655001201788IND4398419220221120201731.0071205e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439841922DNAL7 a10.1080/000716607016713362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Appropriate nutrition may aid in minimising the incidence of diseases by enhancing immunity. 3. An understanding of the pressures imposed by evolution that underlie poultry nutrition as well as those which underlie immunity provides focus to the field of nutritional immunology. Additional understanding is provided by knowing the specific cellular mechanisms by which diet affects immunity, and how these mechanisms pertain to specific nutrients and pathogens. 4. These approaches indicate that higher inclusion rates of all nutrients are not always better and that the traditional ideas of adding a surfeit of specific nutrients to improve immunity does not usually serve us well. 5. Understanding the nuances of nutrition and immunity is important for optimising bird health and productivity, and will be an important contributor towards fulfilling the consumer's conflicting demands for more natural production and better animal welfare. 3amechanism of action 3aanimal nutrition 3aanimal welfare 3apoultry diseases 3aanimal health 3adisease incidence 3anutrient balance 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3apoultry 0aimmunity 0aliterature reviews 0anutritional immunology0 tBritish poultry science.g2007 Oct., v. 48, no. 5 p.525-537x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716607016713363Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02795naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009500123300001600218500001500234520104000249650001601289650002301305650002701328650002201355650002201377650002901399650002701428650001001455650001601465650002801481650003001509650001501539650001101554650001501565650002201580650003201602650002001634650002901654650002501683650002801708650004201736650001501778650001701793653001601810653002501826653002701851653002501878653003901903653002301942653001901965700001601984700001402000700001702014773007202031852000902103930003302112945001302145946001102158655001202169IND2051173020221120190426.0960508e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205117302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoby, S.10aDetoxification of the phytoalexins maackiain and medicarpin by fungal pathogens of alfalfa  ap. 759-765.  a2019-12-05  aNine fungal pathogens of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) (lucerne) were assayed for their ability to metabolize the pterocarpanoid phytoalexins (-)maackiain and (-)medicarpin. All of the alfalfa fungal isolates were able to metabolize both (-)maackiain and (-)medicarpin. Six different initial reaction products were observed, and often a single isolate produced multiple metabolic products. All the products have been previously described, except for those produced by Cercospora medicaginis. This fungus hydroxylated the pterocarpans at the 1a carbon to form a 1a[R]OH-dienone, in which the hydroxyl group is trans to the bridgehead protons, and is the 1a epimer of the previously described cis form of the compound. (-)Maackiain and both of the 1a hydroxylated epimers were tested for toxicity on isolates of Nectria haematococca mating population I and Saccharomyces cerevisiae that do not degrade maackiain or its 1aOH-dienone products. Both epimers were less toxic than maackiain, and the trans epimer was less toxic than the cis form. 3aStemphylium 3achemical reactions 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aFusarium eumartii 3aspectral analysis 3aColletotrichum truncatum 3amolecular conformation 3aroots 3ametabolites 3aVerticillium albo-atrum 3aLeptosphaerulina trifolii 3amedicarpin 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3aPhoma medicaginis 3aColletotrichum destructivum 3aMedicago sativa 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiochemical pathways 3aColletotrichum trifolii 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. medicaginis 3aCercospora 3aphytoalexins 0apterocarpan 0aNectria haematococca 0acercospora medicaginis 0astemphylium alfalfae 0aphoma medicagenis var. medicaginis 0achemical structure 0adetoxification1 aCaldera, S.1 aBates, R.1 aVanEtten, H.0 tPhytochemistry.g1996 Feb., v. 41, no. 3 p.759-765x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02204naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015600129300001600285520133600301650002801637650000901665650001601674650000701690650001101697650001301708700001401721773010101735852000901836930003301845945001301878946001101891655001201902IND2041857120221120190601.0940908e199405  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204185712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindberg, C.W.10aPredicting the aerobic growth of Y. enterocolitica O:3 at different pH-values, temperatures and L-lactate concentrations using conductance measurements  ap. 141-153.  aThe effect of the inoculum level and growth conditions on conductance response was studied for Yersinia enterocolitica O:3. The Gompertz equation, y = A + C exp (- exp(- B(time --M))) was used in the fitting of conductance response curves. Inoculum levels between 3 and 7 log cfu/ml did not affect the B or C parameters. The M parameter was affected; the lower the inoculum level, the higher the M value. Conductance response was attained at 7.5 log cfu Y. enterocolitica/ml skim milk-SPYE medium used. Polynomial models for log B and log C were developed for Y enterocolitica 0:3 describing the effect of temperature 7-23 degrees C), pH (5.4-6.5) and L-lactate (0-1.2%), and combinations thereof, under aerobic conditions. Conductance response was attained in all combinations of L-lactate concentrations, pH levels and temperatures. The conductance rate (B . C/e) was of the same magnitude at 23 degrees C, pH 5.4 and 1.2% L-lactate as at 7 degrees C, pH 6.5 and 0% L-lactate. A high correlation was found between the conductance rates predicted from conductance polynomial models and rates predicted from an absorbance model taken from the literature. A large number of combinations of factors affecting the growth/activity of bacteria could be studied simultaneously, due to the large instrumental capacity of the Malthus 2000. 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3ameat 3atemperature 3apH 3amodels 3alactates1 aBorch, E.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1994 May, v. 22, no. 2/3 p.141-153x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01587naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009300127300001600220500001500236520047900251650002100730650002100751650001700772650001100789650002600800650001500826650001400841650002200855650003600877650002700913653001900940653001600959653002000975653002300995700002101018773007201039852000901111930003301120945001301153946001101166655001201177IND2051173620221120190428.0960508e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205117362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakulski, G.10aEllagic acid derivatives and naphthoquinones of Dionaea muscipula from in vitro cultures  ap. 775-778.  a2019-12-05  aFrom Dionaea muscipula, obtained by in vitro culture, the known compounds plumbagin, chloroplumbagin and 8,8'-biplumbagin as naphthoquinones, 1-O-beta-galloylglucose, ellagic acid, 3-O-methylellagic acid, 3,3'-di-O-methylellagic acid and its 4-O-glucoside, and a new compound, the 4,4'-di-O-glucoside of 3,3'-di-O-methylellagic acid, were isolated.

Head rice yield (HRY), protein, and SLC decreased with increasing milling, while the percent of bran removed and whiteness increased. Results showed that SLC significantly (P < 0.05) affected milled as well as cooked rice properties across cultivar, moisture content (MC) at harvest, and location (Stuttgart, AR, and Essex, MO). Cooked rice firmness ranged from 90.12 to 111.26 N after milling to various degrees (SLC). The decrease in cooked rice firmness with increasing milling was attributed to the lowering of total proteins and SLC. Cooked rice water uptake increased with increasing degree of milling. Water uptake by the kernel during cooking dictated the cooked rice firmness. The increase in cooked rice stickiness with increasing degree of milling was attributed to an increase in starch leaching during cooking because of the greater starch granule swelling associated with a greater water uptake. 3alipid content 3arice 3astarch granules 3atexture 3aabsorption 3ageographical variation 3arice bran 3aleaching 3amilling 3awater content 3acolor 3awater 3aprotein content 3acooking 0aphysicochemical properties 0adegree of milling1 aMeullenet, J.F.0 tCereal chemistry.g2007 , v. 84, no. 2 p.119-124x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM-84-2-01193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080201b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/06  aOther US 7aarticle02782naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072001700143072001700160100002300177245013200200300001600332520135900348650001801707650001701725650001901742650001201761650002401773650001101797650001801808650003301826650002401859650001601883650001601899650001601915650002601931650001401957650002301971700003101994700002402025700001802049773007002067852000902137856008302146930003302229945002502262946001302287655001202300IND4392171020221120182222.0070607e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439217102DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-84-2-01372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBastos-Cardoso, I.10aDevelopment and characterization of extruded pellets of whole potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) flour expanded by microwave heating  ap. 137-144.  aIn various Latin American countries, large volumes of potato are classified as unsuitable for use as food and destined for use as feed. This raw material has a high starch and fiber content that could be used in the production of different kinds of food. The objective of this research was the preparation and characterization of extruded whole potato pellets expanded by microwave heating. A 3(3) central composite routable experimental design and response surface methodology were used. The barrel temperature (BT, 93-127 degrees C), feed moisture (FM, 19-29%), and corn starch concentration (CS, 3-37%) in the blends were evaluated. CS was the most important variable affecting the functional properties of the expanded pellets. Adding CS to the blends increased the expansion index and viscosity and improved luminosity, decreasing the apparent density and breaking force of the products. Low BT and especially high FM increased the luminosity of the expanded pellets. Increasing FM content increased the viscosity of the expanded pellets. The best functional characteristics for the expanded pellets were obtained using a blend of 63% potato flour and 37% CS, extruded at 110 degrees C BT with 24% FM content. Nonfood-grade whole potato flour showed good potential for use in the production of expanded pellets with acceptable functional properties. 3awater content 3apotato flour 3aextruded foods 3apellets 3amicrowave treatment 3astarch 3afiber content 3aresponse surface methodology 3aexperimental design 3atemperature 3acorn starch 3aingredients 3afunctional properties 3aviscosity 3aoptical properties1 aZazueta-Morales,  J. de J.1 aMartinez-Bustos, F.1 aKil-Chang, Y.0 tCereal chemistry.g2007 , v. 84, no. 2 p.137-144x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM-84-2-01373Available from publisher's Web site  a20080201b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle03397naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010600143300001400249520217400263650002202437650000902459650001002468650001302478650001002491650002302501650003202524650002702556650003602583650002202619650002402641651001302665651001302678700001802691700002002709700002002729700001802749700001902767773009902786852000902885930003302894945001302927946001102940655001202951IND2042954820221120165156.0941031e199409  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204295482DNAL7 a78115712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitt, J.I.14aThe normal mycoflora of commodities from Thailand. 2. Beans, rice, small grains and other commodities  ap. 35-53.  aPart of a comprehensive study of fungi occurring in commodities in Thailand, this paper reports results from 276 samples of mung beans, rice, sorghum and soybeans as well as other minor crops. Samples for major commodities were taken from farmers' stocks, middlemen and retail outlets, while those for minor crops were mostly from retail. Each sample was divided into two portions, one being examined in Bangkok and the second at North Ryde. Mycological examinations were carried out by direct plating after surface disinfection in chlorine. Media used were dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol agar, dichloran 18% glycerol agar, Aspergillus flavus and parasiticus agar and dichloran chloramphenicol peptone agar. Fungi were identified to species level and percentage infection of samples calculated. The dominant fungus found in mung beans was Fusarium semitectum. which was present in 40% of samples and at a high level (18% of all seeds) overall. Aspergillus flavus was also found in 4O% of samples, but only in 2% of seeds overall. Lasiodiplodia rheobromae was the only other fungus exceeding 1% total infection. The major fungi found in soybeans were A. flavus (67% of samples; 6% overall) and Cladosporium cladosporioides (49% of samples; 9% overall). Storage fungi were more common in soybeans than the other commodities, indicating longer or adverse storage. Paddy rice contained high levels of a wide variety of field fungi, notably Fusarium semitectum, Bipolaris oryzae, and Curvularia, Phoma and Colletotrichum species. However, probably due to the heat generated by milling, milled rice contained very few fungi, which were mostly of storage origin. Only 3% of particles examined contained internal fungi. Infection in sorghum was typical of oilseeds, dominated by Aspergillus flavus, which was present in 86% of samples, with an overall infection rate of 12%. Beans other than soybeans were infected by a wide range of field fungi, but at low levels, with less than half of seeds examined being infected internally. With the exception of sorghum, the levels of mycotoxigenic fungi encountered were much lower than observed previously in nuts and oilseeds. 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3arice 3abeans 3asoybeans 3afungi 3afood contamination 2aEdible Grainxmicrobiology. 2aFabaceaexmicrobiology 2aFungixisolation & purification 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSeedsxmicrobiology 3aThailand 0aThailand1 aHocking, A.D.1 aBhudhasamai, K.1 aMiscamble, B.F.1 aWheeler, K.A.1 aTanboon-Ek, P.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1994 Sept., v. 23, no. 1 p.35-53x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01597naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011300125300001600238500001500254520033300269650001700602650002100619650001700640650002300657650001700680650001400697650002500711650002000736650002200756650003600778650002700814650001600841651001000857653001300867653001600880653001700896653002000913653002300933700001800956700001500974773007200989852000901061930003301070945001301103946001101116655001201127IND2051172320221120182310.0960508e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205117232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurata, K.10aCyclozonarone, a sesquiterpene-substituted benzoquinone derivative from the brown alga Dictyopteris undulata  ap. 749-752.  a2019-12-05  aA new sesquiterpene-substituted benzoquinone derivative, which we have named cyclozonarone, has been isolated from the brown alga Dictyopteris undulata collected in 'Isoyake areas'.

The effect of week of production was evaluated for hens in flocks 1 and 2, and the effect of week, gender and litter (fresh or used) was assessed for flock 3. 2. Gastrointestinal tracts, poult box liners, drinkers and faecal droppings were sampled. Conventional microbiological procedures were used to isolate and identify the presence of Campylobacter. Campylobacter latex agglutination tests were used for confirmation. 3. Peak colonisation occurred at approximately 3 weeks of production. Frequency of Campylobacter isolation from bird sources paralleled isolation from waterers. Frequency of detection from birds placed on used litter was lower than detection from birds placed on fresh litter (2% vs 58%). Gender did not affect frequency of detection. 4. Minimising peak colonisation at 3 weeks and managing litter are opportunities to reduce the occurrence of this organism in turkeys. 3atemporal variation 3alitter (bedding) 3adisease detection 3abacterial contamination 3acampylobacteriosis 3aturkeys 3amales 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3afrequency 3aanimal age 3apathogen identification 3agender differences 3afood pathogens 3apoultry manure 3afeces 3adigestive tract 3aCampylobacter 3afemales 3adisease surveillance 2aAnimals 2aCampylobacterxisolation & purification 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aCarrier Statexmicrobiology 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmicrobiology 2aHousing, Animal 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aTurkeysxmicrobiology 0adrinkers1 aKenney, P.B.1 aNayak, R.R.0 tBritish poultry science.g2007 Oct., v. 48, no. 5 p.567-572x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716607015730943Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02129naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072001700143072001700160100001300177245009100190300001600281500001500297520090700312650002401219650001601243650001401259650003101273650001801304650001401322650002001336650001601356653001601372700001701388700001701405700001701422700002301439773007001462852000901532856008301541930003301624945002501657946001301682655001201695IND4394824120221120165046.0070907e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439482412DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-84-4-03282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Because triticale is genetically close to wheat, commercially available wheat prediction models for Foss Infratec analyzers were applied in a year-by-year basis to triticale samples harvested in Iowa between 2002 and 2006. Wheat models were not applicable to moisture prediction (SEP(avg) = 0.37% pt; expected SEP on wheat samples 0.15% pt), but usable for screening for protein (SEP(avg) = 0.38% pt; expected SEP on wheat samples 0.25% pt). Dedicated triticale calibrations were developed from 2002 to 2005 data. Prediction results for 2006 samples only were compared. Triticale calibrations performed better than wheat calibrations for 2006 samples (moisture SEP(triticale) = 0.29% pt, SEP(wheat) = 0.50% pt; protein SEP(triticale) = 0.30% pt, SEP(wheat) = 0.68% pt). 3amathematical models 3acalibration 3aequations 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3awater content 3atriticale 3aprotein content 3ameasurement 0amethodology1 aGibson, L.R.1 aRippke, G.R.1 aSchwarte, A.1 aHurburgh, C.R.

Gordal  ap. 691-697.  a2019-12-05  aDuring the development of the olive two stages in chlorophyll evolution can be distinguished: one of synthesis when the fruit is in the growth phase, and a degradative stage which begins when the fruit is completely developed. Although the enzyme chlorophyllase is present in olives throughout their development cycle, its activity reaches a maximum at both the beginning and end of the vegetative growth phase. During these two periods chlorophyll synthesis prevails, so the two maxima in enzyme activity are associated with the involvement of chlorophyllase in chlorophyll synthesis. Small amounts of chlorophyllides a and b have been detected during the initial growth period of the fruit, which coincides with a phase of great chlorophyll synthesis. Later, synthetic and degradative mechanisms may overlap, making the detection of dephytylated compounds impossible. At the same time allomerized chlorophyllic derivatives--13(2)-hydroxychlorophyll a, 13(2)-methoxychlorophyll a, 13(2)-methoxychlorophyll b, 15(1)-methoxylactone-chlorophyll a and 15(1)-methoxylactone-chlorophyll b--can be detected, suggesting the presence of chlorophyll oxidase. 3abiosynthesis 3aquantitative analysis 3achlorophyllides 3adevelopmental stages 3ametabolites 3aseasonal variation 3awater content 3aripening 3aOlea europaea 3aenzyme activity 3achlorophyll 3achlorophyllase 0ametabolism 0afruits 0aderivatives1 aGallardo-Guerrero, L.0 tPhytochemistry.g1996 Feb., v. 41, no. 3 p.691-697x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01856naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245013300123300001600256520075200272650001801024650001001042650001201052650001801064650002801082650003701110650001301147650002001160650002701180650002701207650002101234650002001255653001201275653001501287700001801302773007201320852000901392930003301401945001301434946001101447655001201458IND2051164720221120144846.0960508e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205116472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasu, S.10aChemical modification of essential arginine residues associated with the red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase  ap. 685-689.  aTwo alpha-dicarbonyl reagents, phenylglyoxal and 2,3-butanedione, were used to demonstrate the presence of essential arginine residues in the mechanism of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase of red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) storage tissue. Both the ATP-dependent 45Ca2+ transport and ITP hydrolytic activities of the Ca2+-ATPase were inhibited by these reagents. Optimal inhibition was observed at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees. Inhibition of ATP dependent 45Ca2+ transport by phenylglyoxal and 2,3-butanedione was decreased by inclusion of ATP in the incubation medium. These results demonstrate that arginine residues are involved in the mechanism of the red beet plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and may reside at the ATP binding region of the enzyme active site. 3aBeta vulgaris 3abeets 3acalcium 3aion transport 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3astructure-activity relationships 3aarginine 3aenzyme activity 3aadenosine triphosphate 3apostharvest physiology 3afood composition 3aplasma membrane 0aligands 0aregulation1 aBriskin, D.P.0 tPhytochemistry.g1996 Feb., v. 41, no. 3 p.685-689x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03848naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001400146245017300160300001600333500001500349520163700364650002202001650001002023650001402033650002902047650001002076650001802086650001402104650001102118650002602129650003402155650000902189650002402198650002302222650000902245650004002254650000902294650002402303650003602327650001102363650003702374650001502411650004102426650001102467650001202478650002602490650001602516650001402532650003102546650003002577650002602607650002102633653000902654653004202663653001902705653001602724700001902740700001702759700001902776700001702795700001802812700001702830700002202847700001502869700001802884773008602902852000902988930003302997945002503030946001103055655001203066IND4400163220221120141342.0080118e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440016322DNAL7 a175214692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBolca, S.10aMicrobial and dietary factors associated with the 8-prenylnaringenin producer phenotype: a dietary intervention trial with fifty healthy post-menopausal Caucasian women  ap. 950-959.  a2019-12-04  aHop-derived food supplements and beers contain the prenylflavonoids xanthohumol (X), isoxanthohumol (IX) and the very potent phyto-oestrogen (plant-derived oestrogen mimic) 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN). The weakly oestrogenic IX can be bioactivated via O-demethylation to 8-PN. Since IX usually predominates over 8-PN, human subjects may be exposed to increased doses of 8-PN. A dietary intervention trial with fifty healthy post-menopausal Caucasian women was undertaken. After a 4 d washout period, participants delivered faeces, blank urine and breath samples. Next, they started a 5 d treatment with hop-based supplements that were administered three times per d and on the last day, a 24 h urine sample was collected. A semi-quantitative FFQ was used to estimate fat, fibre, alcohol, caffeine and theobromine intakes. The recoveries of IX, 8-PN and X in the urine were low and considerable inter-individual variations were observed. A five-fold increase in the dosage of IX without change in 8-PN concentration resulted in a significant lower IX recovery and a higher 8-PN recovery. Classification of the subjects into poor (60 %), moderate (25 %) and strong (15 %) 8-PN producers based on either urinary excretion or microbial bioactivation capacity gave comparable results. Recent antibiotic therapy seemed to affect the 8-PN production negatively. A positive trend between methane excretion and 8-PN production was observed. Strong 8-PN producers consumed less alcohol and had a higher theobromine intake. From this study we conclude that in vivo O-demethylation of IX increases the oestrogenic potency of hop-derived products. 3abiotransformation 3aurine 3aphenotype 3anutritional intervention 3awomen 3ahealth status 3amenopause 3aWhites 3aestrogenic properties 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahops 3adietary supplements 3amicrobial activity 2aAged 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aFecesxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aFemale 2aFlavanonesxbiosynthesisxurine. 2aFlavonoids 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aHumulus 2aMethanexbiosynthesis 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhenotype 2aPhytoestrogensxmetabolism 2aPostmenopausexphysiology 2aPropiophenonesxurine 2aXanthonesxurine 0adiet 0a8-prenylnaringenin producer phenotype 0aisoxanthohumol 0axanthohumol1 aPossemiers, S.1 aMaervoet, V.1 aHuybrechts, I.1 aHeyerick, A.1 aVervarcke, S.1 aDepypere, H.1 aKeukeleire, D. de1 aBracke, M.1 aHenauw, S. de0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2007 Nov., v. 98, no. 5 p.950-959x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080428b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/04/05  aNon-US 7aarticle04351naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162100001600179245013700195300001600332520305000348650002503398650001903423650001403442650001803456650002003474650001703494650001103511650001403522650001603536650002303552650003103575650002503606651001003631700001303641700001403654773007403668852000903742856008503751930003303836945002503869946001103894655001203905IND4397553520221120115440.0071106s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439755352DNAL7 a10.1108/000707007107807152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDunkwal, V.10aPhysico-chemical properties and sensory evaluation of Pleurotus sajor caju powder as influenced by pre-treatments and drying methods  ap. 749-759.  aPurpose - This article aims to focus on the food value of the mushroom. Because of its low calorific value and very high content of proteins, vitamins and minerals, mushrooms may contribute significantly in overcoming protein deficiency in developing countries like India. Design/methodology/approach - Oyster (Pleurotus sajor caju) mushroom cultivated on two substrates i.e. wheat straw and brassica straw were procured. Freshly harvested and washed mushrooms were cut into small pieces. Sliced mushrooms were divided into four portions. Two portions were left untreated and dried using sun and oven drying methods. The third portion was blanched in boiling water at 100 degrees C for two mins, cooled immediately and drained. The blanched samples were divided into two portions. One portion was sun dried and another was oven dried. The fourth portion was soaked in solution of citric acid (0.25 percent) for 30 mins and drained. The steeped samples were divided into two portions. One portion was sun dried and another was oven dried. Each sample was dried from initial moisture content of 91 percent on fresh weight basis of the final moisture content 10 percent on dry weight basis. All the samples were ground to make fine powder. The untreated and treated samples were analysed for physico-chemical properties and sensory evaluation by using standard methods. Findings - Treated and untreated powders prepared from oyster (Pleurotus sajor caju) mushrooms grown on two substrates i.e. wheat and brassica straw were analysed for physical and chemical characteristics. Among the powders, T6 (steeped in 0.25 percent citric acid and oven dried) powder exhibited highest yield followed by untreated and blanched powders. On the other hand, untreated samples T1 (sun dried) and T4 (oven dried) showed higher browning index as compared to pretreated powders. Steeped samples (T3 and T6) from both type of mushrooms, irrespective of drying methods exhibited higher values of water retention capacity and swelling index as well as sensory attributes (colour, aroma and texture) In terms of chemical analysis, steeped samples from both types of mushrooms, irrespective of drying methods, exhibited higher contents crude protein, crude fibre and ash as compared to blanched powders. Blanching in hot water may cause leaching out of nutrients. Practical implications - With regard to healthy benefits and medicinal value of mushroom, its production and consumption should be increased. However, mushroom production does not demand land, but helps in the bioconversion of potential pollutants like agro-wastes to useful and nutritive food for human consumption, which is essential to a developing country like India. Originality/value - The findings of this article may contribute significantly in overcoming protein deficiency in developing countries like India. Mushrooms have a low carbohydrate content, no cholesterol and are almost fat free.

  1 aMonk, D.10aService quality and training: a pilot study  ap. 627-636.  aIn the special issue: The food we eat: a range of perspectives / edited by C. Vignali and A.J. Kenyon.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose - This paper represents an initial investigation into the strategic implications of providing training to all employees of coffee shops in the UK, including baristas (coffee makers) on temporary or part-time job contracts. In particular, the paper aims to investigate whether service quality can be significantly improved by devoting substantial resources to staff training. Design/methodology/approach - Two focus groups were conducted to obtain a demand side picture of this market. One of these groups comprised customers under the age of 30 years and the other was made up of customers between 30-50 years of age. Managers of two coffee shops were interviewed to get a supply side view. Findings - The attitudes of the two focus groups were surprisingly similar. Generally, customers did not expect more than basic product knowledge from their baristas. On the supply side, it emerged that the coffee chains provided basic training to all of their employees. This training was firm specific and revolved around a workbook that employees completed in a matter of weeks. Research limitations/implications - This market is a highly volatile one and customer expectations may well change in the near future. Moreover, future research will compare the UK coffee market with other countries, to further contextualise the results. Practical implications - Current spending by firms on front line staff typically amounts to approximately pound 200/person per year. This research suggests that coffee shops are behaving rationally in providing limited training to their staff. There is no evidence, on the demand side, that perceptions of service quality would be enhanced by spending significantly more on training baristas. Originality/value - This paper adds insight to the discussion surrounding consumer perception of service quality in the context of a rapidly growing market. 3afood service workers 3aage 3afood service training 3arestaurants 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer satisfaction 3aUnited Kingdom 0acoffee shops 0aconsumers1 aRyding, D.0 tBritish food journal.g2007, v. 109, no. 8 p.627-636x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707007107724173Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/01/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02311naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001500196245007400211300001600285520110200301650001901403650001901422650001801441650001901459650001901478650002101497650002501518650001601543650001801559651002101577653003901598700001501637773007401652852000901726856008501735930003301820945002501853946001101878655001201889IND4397552820221120110452.0071106s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439755282DNAL7 a10.1108/000707007107806612doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In order to make an appropriate evaluation, the background of the privatization movement and the general structure of the dairy sector in Turkey are examined first. Design/methodology/approach - After a brief evaluation, the privatization process of TSEK and its effects on the sector are discussed in the light of the results of empirical data that obtain from the ANOVA model. Findings - It has been concluded that the liberalization process has been adopted without the setting up of market regulatory policies, thus, the price balance in the dairy sector has changed to the disadvantage of both producers and consumers, while market concentration has increased and regional differentials have become more apparent. Originality/value - This article may be relevant for other countries where privatization or liberalization movement in the agro-food sector is in process. 3aprivate sector 3adairy industry 3afood industry 3adairy products 3afood marketing 3amarket structure 3aanalysis of variance 3afood prices 3aprivatization 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkish Dairy Industry Enterprises1 aRehber, E.0 tBritish food journal.g2007, v. 109, no. 9 p.661-674x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707007107806613Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/01/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01009naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245003500129300001600164520027500180650001200455650001600467650003800483650002500521653001900546653002400565773006900589852000900658939003300667945000800700946001100708655001200719991611022230742620221120110603.0890605e198811  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890008662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaran, R.14aThe challenge of rural poverty  ap. 397-400.  aThis article reviews two reports released by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Vignali and A.J. Kenyon.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose - Traditional microbiological methods to monitor the growth or survival of microbes are very labour-intensive and rather expensive and the knowledge acquired is not cumulative. Predictive microbiology as an alternative approach has been developed utilizing mathematical models to predict the microbial inactivation, survival or growth during food processing. The purpose of this paper is to review the evolutions and limitations of primary mathematical models in predictive microbiology. Design/methodology/approach - Primary models deal with the variation of microbial populations against time under particular environmental and cultural conditions. According to the behaviour of micro organisms during food processing and storage, primary models can be divided into inactivation/survival models and growth models. Literature is reviewed to assess the performance of these mathematical models. Findings - In order to predict microbial survival or growth curves, some empirical mathematical models have been used. Most of them have no or little microbiological or physiological basis, which make the interpretation of some model parameters difficult and their performances do not match observed microbiological outcomes. To produce a more accurate mathematical model, more mechanisms are necessary to interpret model parameters with a biological basis. Originality/value - The paper reviews the evolution and limitations of primary mathematical models, which may help future model development. 3amathematical models 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3afood storage 3arisk assessment 3afood processing 3amicrobial growth 3apredictive microbiology 0aliterature reviews 0amicrobial contamination 0afood safety1 aXie, G.1 aEdmondson, A.0 tBritish food journal.g2007, v. 109, no. 8 p.608-626x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707007107724083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/01/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01529naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245006900136300001600205300003000221500001500251520062100266650002500887650001800912650001600930650001600946651001100962653001700973653003700990653003401027773006901061852000901130939003301139945000801172946001101180655001201191991611021790742620221120110545.0871005e198611  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870019692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown-John, C.L.10aReforms in regulatory processes affecting Canada's food industry  ap. 345-357.  ap. 345-357. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aA detailed review examines some of the major innovations that have occurred in the on-going regulatory reform in Canada that have a direct impact on Canada's food industry.

Male rats were catheterized 5 days before experiments were started. The mean thyroid-stimulating-hormone (TSH) plasma concentrations were 2.9 +/- 0.6 ng/ml during infusion of 0.25 ml/h of 0.9% NaCl (n = 12). T3 plasma concentrations were 2.6 +/- 0.4 ng/ml. T4 plasma levels were 22.0 5.6 microgram/dl. A bolus of 0.1 mg thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) significantly increased TSH plasma concentrations (P less than or equal to 0.001; from 2.9 +/- 0.6 to 7.8 +/- 1.1 ng/ml, n = 12). No pulsatile TSH secretion was observed in a 2-hour period with blood samples taken every 10 minutes (n = 12) and hourly sampling disclosed no circadian variation of TSH during a 24-hour period (n = 4). Successful xenografting was possible in 12 of 15 cases using a follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line (FTC 133). Measurement of human thyroglobulin (hTg) by a hTg IRMA revealed high levels in rats with functional FTC tumors, whereas no htg was detected in untransplanted rats or animals with nonfunctional transplants. 3arats 3aanimal models 3acell lines 3athyroid function 3acarcinoma 2aAnimals 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNeoplasm Transplantationxpathology 2aRats 2aRats, Nudexphysiology 2aThyroid Glandxphysiopathology 2aThyroid Neoplasmsxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aThyrotropinxblood 2aThyrotropin-Releasing Hormonexadministration & dosage 2aThyroxinexblood 2aTransplantation, Heterologousxpathology. 2aTriiodothyroninexblood 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 0agrafts1 aDralle, H.1 aSchroder, S.1 aOertel, M.1 aKohrle, J.1 aHesch, R.D.1 aMuhlen, A. von zur.1 aBrabant, G.0 tComparative medicine.g1992 Apr., v. 42, no. 2 p.164-167x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02768naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162100001800179245009800197300001600295500007000311500001500381520129200396650002801688650002001716650001201736650001701748650002301765650002601788650001901814650001601833650002501849651001601874653002201890653002701912653001601939700002001955700002101975700002101996700002002017773007402037852000902111856008502120930003302205945002502238946001102263655001202274IND4394107120221120100959.0070814s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439410712DNAL7 a10.1108/000707007107615362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, little is known about consumer preparation of poultry and the effects of commonly applied cooking times on bacterial inactivation. This study aimed to answer these questions. Design/methodology/approach - Surveys were mailed in The Netherlands and analysed and laboratory inactivation experiments were conducted for the most frequent preparation method. Findings - The surveys revealed that the predominant way of chicken meat cooking was (stir)frying fillets and that consumers were generally aware of the presence of bacteria on chicken meat. Thorough heating of meat was considered important, which was often checked by visual inspection. In the laboratory, D-values for C. jejuni were obtained at frying temperatures: D was 1.95?min for artificially contaminated whole and D 0.59?min for diced fillets, respectively under practically relevant conditions. Large variability in survival was found, however. Originality/value - The paper shows that by combining consumer research and food microbiology it was concluded that the actual risk of consumption of chicken breast fillets that contain surviving C. jejuni is higher than previously assumed. 3abacterial contamination 3adecontamination 3acooking 3achicken meat 3afood contamination 3ahome food preparation 3afood pathogens 3atemperature 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aNetherlands 0afood microbiology 0amicrobial inactivation 0afood safety1 aFischer, A.R.H.1 aAsselt, E.D. van1 aZwietering, M.H.1 aJong, A.E.I. de0 tBritish food journal.g2007, v. 109, no. 7 p.548-561x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707007107615363Available from publisher's Web site  a20071025b20071102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01425naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004500125300001800170520049000188650001700678650002200695650002700717650001100744650001200755650003600767653001600803653001500819653001500834653001500849700001500864700001700879700001500896773007400911852000900985930003300994945001301027946001101040655001201051IND2051091920221120085741.0960502e199603  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205109192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoul, J.L.10aOxygenated cyclohexanes from Piper cubeb  ap. 1097-1099.  aFurther investigation of the petrol extract of Piper cubeb yielded two new minor oxygenated cyclohexanes, (-)-rel-(2S,3R,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5-tetraacetoxy-1-benzoyloxy methylcyclohex-1(6)-ene-2,3,4,5-tetrol[(-)-piperenol C] and (+)-(2S,3R,4R,5R)-2,4,5-triacetoxy-1-benzoyloxy methylcyclohex-1(6kne-2,3,4,5-tetrol-3-benzoate[(+) -piperenol A-triacetate].

The relevant European Regulations and Directives are detailed, and references and websites given for access to full texts. Mandatory label information rules are presented, both "horizontal" rules applying to all foods (mainly pre-packaged foodstuffs for the ultimate consumer or for supply to caterers), and "vertical" rules defining the name and composition of specific products. Ingredient listing is discussed with regards to the recent amendment concerning food allergens. Voluntary label information is also presented, including quality and origin labelling, and organic production. The rules for novel foods and for genetically modified foods are analysed. The nutrition labelling Directive is detailed, together with texts ruling food supplements and foods for particular nutritional uses. Recent and still pending proposals for nutrition and health claims, and for nutrient fortification of foods are discussed. The results of critical surveys on the present implementation of food and nutrition labelling are summarised, together with the corresponding recommendations for improvement. 3afunctional foods 3aconsumer protection 3ahealth claims 3agenetically modified foods 3afood fortification 3aconsumer information 3anew products 3afood quality 3aEuropean Union 3afood allergies 3aingredients 3adietary supplements 3aorganic production 3anutrition labeling 0afood labeling 0aliterature reviews0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.531-550x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03448naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002200180245018800202300001600390500002400406520170000430650002102130650001402151650005202165650002402217650002802241650001202269650004802281650001402329650001502343650003102358650006402389650003202453650003702485651002802522651002802550651001102578700001702589700002602606700001802632773012202650852000902772856009202781930003302873945002502906946001102931655001202942IND4428622420221120065059.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442862242DNAL7 a198249522pmid7 a10.1111/j.1865-1682.2009.01093.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aVandenbussche, F.10aEmergence of Bluetongue Serotypes in Europe, Part 1: Description and Validation of Four Real-Time RT-PCR Assays for the Serotyping of Bluetongue Viruses BTV-1, BTV-6, BTV-8 and BTV-11  ap. 346-354.  aIncludes references  aThe control of bluetongue virus (BTV) in Central-Western Europe is greatly complicated by the coexistence of several BTV serotypes. Rapid, sensitive and specific assays are therefore needed to correctly identify the currently circulating BTV serotypes in field samples. In the present study, four serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR assays (RT-qPCR) are described for the detection of the BTV-1, BTV-6, BTV-8 and BTV-11 serotypes. The analytical sensitivity of the BTV-1/S2, BTV-6/S2, BTV-8/S2 and BTV-11/S2 serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is comparable to the earlier described serogroup-specific pan-BTV/S5 RT-qPCR assay. In silico and in vitro analyses indicated that none of the assays cross-react with viruses which are symptomatically or genetically related to BTV and only detect the intended BTV serotypes. All assays exhibited a linear range of at least 0.05-3.80 log₁₀ TCID₅₀ ml⁻¹ and a PCR-efficiency approaching the ideal amplification factor of two per PCR cycle. Both intra- and inter-run variations were found to be low with a total coefficient of variation of 1-2% for clear positive samples and <10% for very weak positive samples. Finally, the performance of the described assays was compared with commercially available kits for the detection of BTV-1, BTV-6 and BTV-8. Three in-house assays gave exactly the same diagnostic result (positive/negative) as the commercial assays and can thus be used interchangeably. Together with the earlier described serogroup-specific pan-BTV/S5, the serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays form a flexible and properly validated set of tools to detect and differentiate the BTV serotypes currently circulating in Central-Western Europe. 3aBluetongue virus 3aserotypes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3amicrobial detection 3apathogen identification 2aAnimals 2aBluetongue virusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aCell Line 2aCricetinae 2aReproducibility of Results 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSerotypingxmethodsxveterinary. 3aCentral European region 3aWestern European region 0aEurope1 aDe Leeuw, I.1 aVandemeulebroucke, E.1 aDe Clercq, K.0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2009 Dec., v. 56, no. 9-10 p.346-354dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1865-16747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2009.01093.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110606b20110701c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/12/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02428naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001700198245012400215300001500339500001500354520091100369650002301280650001701303650002101320650001401341650001501355650002201370650001601392650001301408650002101421650000901442650001901451650001601470650001201486650004501498650003601543650002501579650000901604650001101613653001701624700001401641773008001655852000901735856008501744930003301829945002501862946001101887655001201898IND4390707220221120065141.0070430e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439070722DNAL7 a173645472pmid7 a10.1080/000716606011614122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The research was carried out to investigate correlations between breeder age, egg cholesterol content, blood cholesterol level and hatchability of broiler breeders. 2. Egg cholesterol content increased with increased breeder age. The mean yolk cholesterol contents (mg per g yolk) were 10.47+/-0.28, 15.34+/-0.65 and 15.64+/-0.71 mg/g at 28, 45 and 65 weeks of age, respectively. 3. There were positive correlations between yolk weight and yolk cholesterol content (mg/g yolk) (r=01.941; P<0.01) and egg cholesterol content (mg/egg) (r=0.980; P<0.01). 4. Negative correlations were found between egg yolk cholesterol content and hatchability of fertile eggs (r=-0.345; P<0.05), fertility ratio (r=-0.609; P<0.01) and hatchability of total eggs (r=-0.574; P<0.01). 5. The mean blood cholesterol levels were 165.1+/-11.04, 166.5+/-11.97 and 179.5+/-11.33 mg/dl at 28, 45 and 65 weeks of age, respectively. 3atemporal variation 3ablood lipids 3abroiler breeders 3afecundity 3aanimal age 3alipid composition 3acholesterol 3aegg yolk 3aegg hatchability 3aeggs 3abreeding lines 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aChickensxbloodxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCholesterolxbloodxmetabolism. 2aEgg Yolkxmetabolism 2aEggs 2aFemale 0afood animals1 aSahan, U.0 tBritish poultry science.g2007 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.98-103x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716606011614123Available from publisher's Web site  a20070829b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02779naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001400162245006900176300001600245500010700261500001500368520148400383650001701867650002101884650001001905650002001915650003601935650001801971650001201989650001902001651001902020653002302039653001402062700001602076700001602092773007402108852000902182856008502191930003302276945002502309946001102334655001202345IND4397554220221120065231.0071106s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439755422DNAL7 a10.1108/000707007107723812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Vignali and A.J. Kenyon.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose - The purpose of this paper is to offer an exploratory case study of how the UK's top ten food retailers are employing corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a means of marketing to customers while they are within stores. Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with a short review of the characteristics and origins of CSR and it is followed by a literature review of current thinking on the relationships between marketing and CSR and a brief outline of the structure of food retailing in the UK. Data obtained from an internet search and a simple walk through visual inspection and information collection survey conducted within the largest store operated by each of the top ten retailers within the towns of Cheltenham and Gloucester, UK provides the empirical material for the case study. Findings - The survey revealed that the principal CSR themes being employed within stores were value for money, support for local food producers, Fairtrade, healthy living and healthy eating, commitment to organic products, charitable donations and initiatives to support the local community. Practical implications - That there was considerable variation in the extent to which the top ten retailers were using CSR themes in marketing communications within stores. Originality/value - Outlines the relationships between marketing and CSR and gives a brief summary of the structure of food retailing in the UK and will be of interest to those involved in those fields. 3asupermarkets 3asocial marketing 3afoods 3aindustry trends 3acorporate social responsibility 3afood industry 3asurveys 3afood retailing 3aUnited Kingdom 0aliterature reviews 0aconsumers1 aComfort, D.1 aHillier, D.0 tBritish food journal.g2007, v. 109, no. 8 p.582-593x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707007107723813Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/01/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02475naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245011800176300001200294500001500306520102600321650001601347650001601363650002301379650002101402650001201423650001601435650001801451650001501469650002301484650002301507650001701530650004301547650002001590650002601610650001001636650001901646650001201665650001201677650001701689653001801706653002801724700001701752700001801769773006801787852000901855930003301864945002501897946001101922655001201933IND4372284520221120065137.0050714e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437228452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The time to endpoint temperature (minimum 73 degrees C) for an RF-cooked product at 500 W was 40 min as compared to 150 min for a steam-cooked product. Proximate analysis of macro components, assays of the B-vitamins, thiamine and riboflavin, and texture profile analysis (TPA) revealed no significant difference (P greater than or equal to 0.05) between the two cooking methods. However, RF-cooked turkey rolls had lower Hunter a values (redness) than their steam cooked counterparts. In addition, the rate of lipid oxidation in RF-cooked rolls, during refrigerated storage at 5 degrees C, was significantly slower than in the steam-cooked products. While a sensory panel could distinguish between RF- and steam-cooked rolls, panellists did not express a preference for rolls cooked by either method. 3aturkey meat 3atemperature 3aspectrophotometers 3ameat composition 3atexture 3aradio waves 3abreast muscle 3ariboflavin 3asensory properties 3alipid peroxidation 3ameat quality 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3astorage quality 3aproximate composition 3acolor 3aheat treatment 3acooking 3athiamin 3acold storage 0ameat products 0aradio frequency heating1 aCronin, D.A.1 aBrunton, N.P.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Nov., v. 93, no. 1 p.1-7x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20070720b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/10  aNon-US 7aarticle01590naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007400126300001600200500001500216520081700231650001701048650001401065650001101079651001301090653003401103700001601137700001301153773006901166852000901235939003301244946001101277655001201288IND9001793820221120052650.0900425e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900179382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranzel, S.10aGrain marketing regulations--impact on peasant production in Ethiopia  ap. 347-358.  a2019-12-05  aDuring the past 10 years Ethiopia has established an elaborate system of trade restrictions, producer quotas and fixed producer prices for purchasing a substantial proportion of peasants, marketable surplus. Recent evidence suggests that the quotas are inequitably allocated among areas and that low fixed prices reduce farmer incomes, incentives to use improved inputs, and grain production. Regulation of marketplaces and interregional grain trade have important negative effects on consumers, producers and the national economy. By increasing grain prices the state can stimulate production and ensure adequate supplies of grain without the need for compulsory quotas. Relaxing the restrictions on marketplaces and on interregional trade can benefit farmers, consumers and the national economy with few costs. 3atrade policy 3amarketing 3agrains 3aEthiopia 0agovernment and administration1 aColburn, F.1 aDegu, G.0 tFood policy.g1989 Nov., v. 14, no. 4 p.347-358x0306-91927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01402naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008200131300001600213520070500229650000900934650001100943650002400954650001900978650001700997773006901014852000901083939003301092946001101125655001201136IND9001793620221120052617.0900425e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900179362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedeberg, A.S.10aProtectionist re-balancing or market-oriented reform?

The spectacular growth in EC oilseeds production, mirrored in a corresponding rise in EC oilseeds expenditure, has triggered off various proposals which would undermine the liberal nature of the oils and fats regime. 'Re-balancing' is the latest of these, but would be contrary to the very aims of the Uruguay Round and to the objectives of the EC's trade policy as set out in the EC Treaty. Rather than aiming at 're-balancing' the EC should therefore consider market-oriented reform. 3aoils 3alipids 3aagricultural policy 3aEuropean Union 3atrade policy0 tFood policy.g1989 Nov., v. 14, no. 4 p.301-307x0306-91927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02451naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001800189245005700207300001600264500002400280500001500304520068600319650001501005650002001020650002301040650002201063650002501085650003401110650001901144650002201163650003001185650001701215650002001232650001201252650002401264650002101288650001501309650004901324650001001373650003301383651001201416651002701428653001401455653002501469653002801494700001801522700001701540773012201557852000901679856009201688930003301780945002501813946001101838655001201849IND4428622720221120052523.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442862272DNAL7 a195488982pmid7 a10.1111/j.1865-1682.2009.01083.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8211 aChevalier, V.10aEndemic Transmission of Rift Valley Fever in Senegal  ap. 372-374.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRift Valley fever (RVF) is an expanding zoonotic disease transmitted from ruminant to ruminant by Culicidae mosquitoes. In 2004, a longitudinal serological survey was performed on small ruminants in the Ferlo are (Senegal) to study RVF transmission and compared the results with those obtained from the same study in 2003. The results confirm that the disease is endemic and that the spatial transmission of RVF is highly heterogeneous. The virus could be maintained during dry season by transovarian transmission in Aedes vexans. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the epidemiological cycle of RVF in this region to implement adapted surveillance measures. 3adry season 3asmall ruminants 3adisease prevalence 3aRift Valley fever 3alongitudinal studies 3aRift Valley fever phlebovirus 3ainsect vectors 3adisease outbreaks 3atransovarial transmission 3aAedes vexans 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aCulicidaexvirology 2aEndemic Diseases 2aPrevalence 2aRift Valley Feverxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiology 3aSenegal 0aSenegalxepidemiology. 0aCulicidae 0adisease transmission 0aRift Valley fever virus1 aThiongane, Y.1 aLancelot, R.0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2009 Dec., v. 56, no. 9-10 p.372-374dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1865-16747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2009.01083.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110606b20110701c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/12/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03660naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001600198245016700214300001600381520167100397650001202068650002102080650001102101650001802112650001902130650002102149650002302170650001702193650001902210650002002229650002102249650002302270650002002293650001002313650001602323650001602339650004702355650001202402650005802414650005002472650002102522650002402543650003702567650003402604650005502638650001202693650001602705653002402721700001502745700001802760773008102778852000902859856008502868930003302953945002502986946001103011655001203022IND4394392920221120050242.0070824e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439439292DNAL7 a175786912pmid7 a10.1080/000716607013705092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMayne, R.K.10aHigh dietary concentrations of biotin did not prevent foot pad dermatitis in growing turkeys and external scores were poor indicators of histopathological lesions  ap. 291-298.  a1. A randomised block experiment was conducted to determine the effects of increasing dietary biotin supplementation (0, 200, 800 and 1600 microgram/kg) on macroscopic and histological changes associated with the development of foot pad dermatitis (FPD) in growing turkeys. 2. Each treatment was replicated in 4 pens containing 36 birds at the start of the experiment. The birds were weighed and external foot pads were scored at 2-week intervals from 2 to 14 weeks of age. A blood sample was obtained at the same ages from two birds in each pen and tissue from one foot pad was processed for histological examination. Liver samples were obtained for determination of fat content. 3. Increasing dietary biotin supplementation was associated with higher initial plasma concentrations of biotin but there was no effect on external scores or histopathology of foot pad lesions. FPD increased rapidly from 2 to 6 weeks and remained similar thereafter. There was no effect of dietary biotin on liver fat content. 4. The correlations between external foot pad scores at different ages were all less than 0.4. The correlation between external and histopathological scores was 0.56 and the respective correlations with body weight were 0.52 and 0.65. There were no differences between the body weights of birds with different external scores but high histopathological scores were associated with lower body weights. 5. It was concluded that current recommendations for biotin in wheat-soy rations for growing turkeys are adequate for normal growth and development and that higher supplements of biotin in these experimental conditions did not prevent the occurrence of FPD. 3aturkeys 3apoultry diseases 3abiotin 3afoot diseases 3ahistopathology 3alesions (animal) 3adisease prevention 3adiet therapy 3aturkey feeding 3anutrient intake 3afeed supplements 3acontact dermatitis 3ablood chemistry 3aliver 3abody weight 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBiotinxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacology. 2aDermatitisxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aLiverxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aTurkeys 2aWeight Gain 0afoot pad dermatitis1 aElse, R.W.1 aHocking, P.M.0 tBritish poultry science.g2007 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.291-298x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716607013705093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080207b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03306naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215100001600232245007800248300001600326520187700342650001602219650001302235650001002248650002002258650002002278650002202298650001802320650001602338650002202354650002002376650002602396650002102422650001202443650003302455650001002488650002502498650001102523650001002534773008102544852000902625856008502634930003302719945002502752946001102777655001202788IND4394392520221120031904.0070824e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439439252DNAL7 a175786872pmid7 a10.1080/000716607013704832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBright,  A.10aPlumage colour and feather pecking in laying hens, a chicken perspective?  ap. 253-263.  a1. This study investigated whether feather damage due to feather pecking and bird behaviour were influenced by plumage colour in Oakham Blue laying hens (black, white, grey colour variants). The reflectance properties of feathers and spectral composition of light environments experienced by the hens were also examined. 2. Nine hundred and seventy-nine birds were inspected and scored for feather damage; 10.5 h of video recordings were examined to record feather pecking and bird behaviour. Feathers and light environments were measured using a USB-2000 spectrometer and DH-2000-CAL-DTH lamp. 3. Oakham Blue birds with white plumage had less feather damage due to feather pecking than black or grey birds. There was more severe feather pecking in the mornings than in the afternoon. White birds feather pecked severely more than black or grey birds, although there were no other behavioural differences between plumage colours. 4. White feathers reflected at a higher intensity than black or grey feathers. However, black and grey feather spectra were relatively flat and the contribution of UV wavelengths to plumage reflection was proportionally greater than that for white feathers. 5. Light intensity inside a poultry house was 100 x (UW/cm2/nm) less than on the range and there was low or no UV reflectance. Under the dim, artificial lights inside a poultry house, Oakham Blue hens with black and grey feathers may be less visible to conspecifics than white birds because their plumage reflects at a lower intensity. Furthermore, the lack of available UV light inside vs. outside and the higher contribution of UV reflectance to black and grey plumage may make black and grey birds appear more different inside the house than white birds. It is possible that this novel/unusual appearance may make black or grey Oakham Blue hens more susceptible to feather pecking. 3alaying hens 3afeathers 3acolor 3afeather pecking 3aanimal behavior 3aspectral analysis 3alight quality 3areflectance 3adiurnal variation 3alight intensity 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aColor 2aFeathersxphysiology 2aFemale 2aLight0 tBritish poultry science.g2007 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.253-263x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716607013704833Available from publisher's Web site  a20080207b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03049naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001700198245013600215300001600351500001500367520119000382650002001572650001801592650001601610650002101626650001601647650002201663650002001685650002301705650001201728650002501740650001101765650001001776650001201786650001301798650004601811650001101857650000901868650002501877650003201902650003901934650002301973650004501996650002602041653002302067653001802090653001202108653001102120653002002131700001602151773008102167852000902248856008502257930003302342945002502375946001102400655001202411IND4398419620221120024034.0071205e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439841962DNAL7 a179527262pmid7 a10.1080/000716607015959232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The onset of lay, quality of eggs during early lay and gonadal development of both sexes were analysed in meat-type lines of Japanese quail, HG and LG divergently selected for high and low relative weight gain between 11 and 28 d of age, respectively, and constant body weight (BW) at 49 d of age. 2. The LG line was sexually mature at an earlier age and lower BW than the HG line. This corresponded with the trend during embryonic and early postnatal development. 3. Analysis of gonads also confirmed earlier sexual development in the LG than in the HG line. In both lines, the growth of testes was detected about one week earlier than the growth of ovary. 4. Despite the different age and BW at onset of lay, HG and LG quail commenced lay at the same degree of maturity (about 90% of adult BW). This implied that the onset of sexual maturity could be identified as a point on the growth curve which terminates the linear phase. 5. When compared with the LG line, the HG line was characterised by a longer acceleration and shorter retardation phase of the growth curve. This difference is seen as an important determinant of line differences in growth and reproductive performance. 3asexual maturity 3aanimal growth 3abody weight 3aage at first egg 3aegg quality 3aCoturnix japonica 3aanimal breeding 3aselection criteria 3afemales 3aartificial selection 3atestes 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCoturnixxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aOrgan Sizexgenetics 2aOvaryxgrowth & development 2aOvipositionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSexual Maturationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aWeight Gainxgenetics 0asexual development 0agrowth curves 0aovaries 0agonads 0aJapanese quails1 aNovotna, B.0 tBritish poultry science.g2007 Oct., v. 48, no. 5 p.551-558x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716607015959233Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01596naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006000126300001600186500001500202520037600217650001400593650002100607650001900628650001100647650001200658650002200670650003600692650002700728651001200755653005100767653002400818653002100842653001300863653002300876700002300899700001800922700002100940700002100961700001800982773007201000852000901072930003301081945001301114946001101127655001201138IND2051188720221117180613.0960509e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205118872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarco, J.A.10aTricyclic sesquiterpenes from Artemisia chamaemelifolia  ap. 837-844.  a2019-12-05  aThe aerial parts of Artemisia chamaemelifolia ssp. chamaemelifolia yielded, in addition to known compounds, four acids with the silphiperfolane framework, a presilphiperfolane derivative, a bicyclic sesquiterpene formed therefrom by oxidative cleavage, a diacetylated monoterpene diol, a cadinane derivative, three acyclic sesquiterpenes and two tetrahydrofurane lignans. 3aArtemisia 3asesquiterpenoids 3amonoterpenoids 3afurans 3alignans 3aspectral analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3amolecular conformation 3aAndorra 0aartemisia chamaemelifolia ssp. chamaemelifolia 0apresilphiperfolanes 0asilphiperfolanes 0acadmanes 0achemical structure1 aSanz-Cervera, J.F.1 aMorante, M.D.1 aGarcia-Lliso, V.1 aValles-Xirau, J.1 aJakupovic, J.0 tPhytochemistry.g1996 Feb., v. 41, no. 3 p.837-844x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03049naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100002000196245011400216300001800330500001500348520151100363650001601874650002101890650001601911650002101927650003001948650002601978650002402004650000902028650001902037650001802056650001902074650002502093650001502118650002002133650002402153651001902177653002502196653001702221700002002238773010802258852000902366856008502375930003302460945002502493946001302518655001202531IND4393927920221117170712.0070811s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439392792DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207014355712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Research is needed to evaluate the environmental impact of the application to cropland of manure from animals fed low-phytic-acid corn. The purpose of this research was to determine P losses in runoff from a bare Piedmont soil (cecil clay loam; clayey, kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Kanhapludult) in the southeastern United States receiving surface applications of broiler litter from birds fed a low-phytic-acid corn (HAP broiler litter). The HAP litter was applied at rates of 0, 8, 16, 33, 49, 66, and 82 kg P ha(-1). Simulated rainfall was applied at a rate of 7.6 cm hr(-1) on the same day the litter sources were applied to the plots. Runoff volumes were measured, and samples were collected at 5-min intervals for 30 min and analyzed for reactive P (RP), algal-available P (AAP), and total P (TP). Flow-weighted concentrations and mass losses of P increased linearly with litter application rate (r(2) values=0.99). Flow-weighted concentrations of RP in runoff increased from 2.2 to 15.4 mg RP L(-1), and mass loss of TP in runoff ranged from 1.3 to 7.3 kg P ha(-1) over all application rates based on linear regression. Runoff volume losses were 47% greater after litter applications compare to the 0 application rate treatment. Reduced infiltration resulting from litter particles blocking pores in the soil surface is likely the reason for the increased runoff volumes. 3afeed grains 3abroiler chickens 3aphytic acid 3aapplication rate 3agroundwater contamination 3anutrient availability 3aagricultural runoff 3acorn 3apoultry manure 3aparticle size 3aeutrophication 3aenvironmental impact 3aphosphorus 3abroiler feeding 3aorganic fertilizers 3aNorth Carolina 0alow-phytic-acid corn 0afood animals1 aMikkelsen, R.L.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 13-14 p.1805-1814x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207014355713Available from publisher's Web site  a20070829b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/18  aOther US 7aarticle02418naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245011500172300001800287500001500305520080000320650001501120650000901135650002001144650001301164650001101177650003801188650001601226650001101242650003101253650001701284650002201301650002301323650002001346650002001366650001801386650001101404650003001415650003101445650002201476650003901498650002701537653001601564653002601580653001101606773010201617852000901719856007701728930003301805945001301838946001301851655001201864IND2229926520221117170703.0010206e200004  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222992652DNAL7 a107753682pmid7 a10.1021/jf99130542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRychlik, M.10aQuantification of free and bound pantothenic acid in foods and blood plasma by a stable isotope dilution assay  ap. 1175-1181.  a2019-12-04  aA stable isotope dilution assay for quantification of pantothenic acid in food and blood plasma uses a 4-fold labeled isotopomer of the vitamin as an internal standard.

In starch a detection limit of 44 microgram/kg, an intrasample relative standard deviation of 6.7%, and recovery values ranging between 97.5 and 99.4% were determined. Total pantothenic acid content was determined in rice, milk powder, apple juice, and blood plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis of the vitamin's conjugates; free pantothenic acid was quantified prior to enzyme treatment.

However, little is known about the sedimentological characteristics of sea turtle rookeries, how these sediment characteristics affect the vulnerability of rookeries to climate change, and the ecological implications of different sediment or altered sediment characteristics to sea turtles. Therefore, we described the sediment and identified the reef-building organisms of the seven most important rookeries used by the northern Great Barrier Reef (nGBR) green turtle population. We then reviewed the literature on the vulnerability of each identified reef-building organism to climate change and how various sediment characteristics ecologically affect sea turtles. Sediments from the studied rookeries are predominantly composed of well-sorted medium-grained to coarse-grained sands and are either dominated by Foraminifera, molluscs or both. Dissimilarities in the contemporary sedimentology of the rookeries suggest that each may respond differently to projected climate change. Potential ecological impacts from climate change include: (1) changes in nesting and hatchling emergence success and (2) reduction of optimal nesting habitat. Each of these factors will decrease the annual reproductive output of sea turtles and thus have significant conservation ramifications. 3aclimate change 3aeggs 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3aislands 3amolluscs 3anesting 3anests 3areproductive performance 3asea turtles 3asediments 3aGreat Barrier Reef 0acarbonate sediments 0acoastal morphology 0amarine turtles 0anesting grounds 0aocean acidification1 aDawson, J.L.1 aSmithers, S.G.1 aHamann, M.1 aLimpus, C.J.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2010, v. 61, no. 4 p.464-473dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF091423Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03304naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001600196245009500212300001800307520186500325650002002190650001202210650001902222650001902241650001702260650001502277650001602292650002202308650001502330650002802345650002502373650001802398650002602416650002302442651001702465700001902482700001602501700002002517773010802537852000902645856008502654930003302739945002502772946001302797655001202810IND4393928420221123041050.0070811s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439392842DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207014356472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMalhi, S.S.10aTillage System and Seeding Time Effects on Forage and Seed Yield of Alfalfa and Bromegrass  ap. 1897-1910.  aPerennial forages are an important component for the cropping systems of the Parkland region in the Canadian prairies, but only a few studies have reported on direct seeding of forages in northeastern Saskatchewan. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of tillage (conventional tillage, CT, and zero tillage, ZT) for seedbed preparation and different seeding times (October 1993, May 1994, and June 1994) on forage and seed yield of alfalfa (Medicago sativa Leyss) and bromegrass (Bromus inermis Lyess) on Gray Luvisol (Typic Cryoboralf) soils (sandy at Gronlid and clayey at Ridgedale) in northeastern Saskatchewan. Visual inspection of plant stands in the establishment year indicated that plant densities were generally higher under CT than ZT and with spring than autumn seeding. Forage yield in 1994 was greater under ZT than CT for alfalfa at both sites and for bromegrass at Ridgedale. In 1995 and 1996, tillage had no effect on forage yield in most cases. The 3-year forage production was greater under ZT than CT for alfalfa by 647 and 770 kg ha(-1) at Gronlid and Ridgedale, respectively, and for bromegrass at Ridgedale (by 697 kg ha(-1)), with the opposite result at Gronlid (by 237 kg ha(-1)). The effect of seeding time on forage production was not consistent. The seed yield in 1995 and 1996 was somewhat greater with ZT than CT, with autumn than spring seeding, and with May than June seeding for alfalfa, whereas the opposite was true for bromegrass, except at Ridgedale when autumn seeding produced greater seed yield than spring seeding. In summary, the lower plant population under ZT than CT in the establishment year did not necessarily result in lower forage and seed yield of alfalfa and bromegrass, suggesting that ZT can replace CT for forage production, and seeding time effect was mainly observed in the first year. 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aBromus inermis 3aforage grasses 3aforage crops 3ano-tillage 3asowing date 3aseed productivity 3acrop yield 3adry matter accumulation 3aconventional tillage 3aplant density 3aenvironmental factors 3atemporal variation 3aSaskatchewan1 aJohnston, A.M.1 aLoeppky, H.1 aBandara, P.M.S.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 13-14 p.1897-1910x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207014356473Available from publisher's Web site  a20070829b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/18  aOther US 7aarticle01286naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002300144245011500167300001600282500002700298520030100325650001700626650001700643650001600660650001800676650001200694650001600706651001100722653002100733700001600754773007600770852000900846930003300855945002500888946001100913655001200924IND4369070320221123041025.0050418e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436907032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The reasons for diverse symptomatology have been found to vary in several attributes and both parasite and host factors appear to play a role in the pathogenesis. The present study reports the in vitro haemolytic and cytotoxic activity of crude soluble extract (CSE) antigen of T. vaginalis isolates from 15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic women. The haemolytic activity following the interaction of CSE antigen with human erythrocytes and cytotoxic activity by adding CSE antigen to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was significantly higher with the use of CSE antigen of isolates from symptomatic women as compared to those from asymptomatic women. Furthermore, cytotoxic effect was found to be pH dependent. The study demonstrates, for the first time, the significant effect of parasite antigen of isolates from symptomatic women as compared to those from asymptomatic women in inducing haemolytic and cytotoxic effect and supports the earlier report that contact-independent mechanism(s) may be playing a role in establishing symptomatic trichomoniasis. 3aTrichomonas vaginalis 3aantigens 3acytotoxicity 3aepithelial cells 3aerythrocytes 3ahemolysis 3aparasites 3atrichomoniasis 3awomen1 aKaul, Praneet1 aSehgal, Rakesh1 aGuptā, Indu.0 tParasitology research.g2008 May, v. 102, no. 6 p.1375-1378dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-0947-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02066naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012900127300001600256520133400272650002601606650001101632650001701643650001201660773008701672852000901759939003301768946001101801655001201812IND9301102520221123040937.0930222s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930110252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennig, R.M.10aNeuronal control of the forewings in two different behaviours: stridulation and flight in the cricket, Teleogryllus commodus  ap. 617-627.  aThe forewing of the cricket is activated during the performance of two different behaviours, flight and stridulation. Intracellular recording and staining techniques were employed to determine the neuronal basis for these two behaviours and how they are interrelated. Both motor patterns were studied in a deafferented preparation. Stridulation was elicited by electrical stimulation of the brain and flight by brief puffs onto the cerci. 1. Bifunctional mesothoracic motoneurons (MN 90, MN 99) are activated with different patterns of synaptic input during flight and stridulation (Fig. 2). 2. Metathoracic flight motoneurons (MN 112, MN 119, MN 129) are only activated during flight and do not receive phasic excitatory input during stridulation (Figs. 3 and 6). 3. Two separate interneuronal pools, which include interneurons with resetter properties, appear to exist, one activated during flight, the other one activated during stridulation (Figs. 4 and 5). The interactions between these two pools are inhibitory. Both motor patterns may be switched rapidly (less than 0.5 s; Fig. 6). 4. It is possible to elicit both behaviours at the same time and then no strict coupling is observed between them (Figs. 7 to 9). These observations suggest that there are two distinct neural networks which control flight and stridulation. 3aTeleogryllus commodus 3aflight 3astridulation 3aneurons0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1990, v. 167, no. 5 p.617-627x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02832naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002100161245008800182300001800270500002400288520115900312650002501471650001701496650004301513650001201556650001401568650000701582650001601589650001601605650003901621650005001660650003701710650001401747650003601761650002401797650003401821650001601855650003601871650003601907650001901943700003101962700002501993700001902018700002002037700002002057700002502077773010902102852000902211856008202220655001202302IND4404382520221123031221.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440438252DNAL7 a183383652pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2007004582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercolini, Laura10aHPLC-F analysis of melatonin and resveratrol isomers in wine using an SPE procedure  ap. 1007-1014.  aIncludes references  aAn original analytical method has been developed for the determination of the antioxidants trans-resveratrol (t-RSV) and cis-resveratrol (c-RSV) and of melatonin (MLT) in red and white wine. The method is based on HPLC coupled to fluorescence detection. Separation was obtained by using a RP column (C8, 150 mmx4.6 mm id, 5 μm) and a mobile phase composed of 79% aqueous phosphate buffer at pH 3.0 and 21% ACN. Fluorescence intensity was monitored at λ = 386 nm while exciting at λ = 298 nm, mirtazapine was used as the internal standard. A careful pretreatment of wine samples was developed, using SPE with C18 cartridges (100 mg, 1 mL). The calibration curves were linear over the following concentration ranges: 0.03-5.00 ng/mL for MLT, 3-500 ng/mL for t-RSV and 1-150 ng/mL for c-RSV. The LOD values were 0.01 ng/mL for MLT, 1 ng/mL for t-RSV and 0.3 ng/mL for c-RSV. Precision data, as well as extraction yield and sample purification results, were satisfactory. Thus, the method seems to be suitable for the analysis of MLT and resveratrol isomers in wine samples. Moreover, wine total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity were evaluated. 3aantioxidant activity 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aisomers 3amelatonin 3apH 3aresveratrol 3awhite wines 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aIsomerism 2aMelatoninxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMolecular Structure 2aPhenolsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPolyphenols 2aSolid Phase Extractionxmethods 2aStilbenesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWinexanalysis1 aAddolorata Saracino, Maria1 aBugamelli, Francesca1 aFerranti, Anna1 aMalaguti, Marco1 aHrelia, Silvana1 aRaggi, Maria Augusta0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 Apr., v. 31, no. 6-7 p.1007-1014dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007004583Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02690naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009200127300001600219500001500235520193800250650002602188650001802214650001102232650001702243653001202260773008702272852000902359939003302368946001102401655001202412IND9301102620221123031213.0930222s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930110262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennig, R.M.10aNeuronal organisation of the flight motor pattern in the cricket, Teleogryllus commodus  ap. 629-639.  a2019-12-04  aThe neuronal organisation of the flight motor pattern in the cricket was investigated using electromyographic and intracellular recording and staining techniques with two objectives: (a) to compare neuromuscular control of the forewings during cricket flight and stridulation, and (b) to provide data for comparison with the well characterised locust flight system. A cricket suspended in a wind stream shows either wing-beating flight or a vibration of the folded wings. The cycle periods for each condition are different, however, the motor patterns appear to be very similar (Fig. 1). After deafferentation, cycle periods increase significantly and so does the variability of the centrally generated motor pattern (Fig. 2). Meso- and metathoracic elevator motoneurons (90, 119) show very similar patterns of synaptic input which may be divided into 3 phases: a slow depolarization, a fast depolarization, and a repolarization supported by IPSPs at the time of depressor activity (Figs. 4 and 6). By contrast, mesothoracic subalar MN 99 and metathoracic subalar MN 129, both of which are depressors, receive different patterns of synaptic input. MN 129 receives a short, phasic depolarisation, whereas MN 99 shows a more tonic depolarization interrupted by a distinct IPSP at the time of hindwing depressor activity (Figs. 5 and 7). 12 flight interneurons were identified (Fig. 8), in addition to the 5 interneurons described previously by Robertson (1987). These 17 interneurons may be grouped into 4 classes according to the timing and the shape of their bursts in a flight cycle (Fig. 9). Interneurons T401 (Fig. 10) and T404 (Fig. 11) Play important roles in flight rhythm generation (resetting and initiation) in the cricket and the locust. The findings of this study together with a previous one (Robertson 1987) suggest a similar organisation of the basic circuitry generating the flight motor pattern in cricket and locust. 3aTeleogryllus commodus 3amotor neurons 3aflight 3ainterneurons 0aneurons0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1990, v. 167, no. 5 p.629-639x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01703naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013900129300001600268500001500284520083900299650003001138650001501168650002701183650001601210651002101226653001301247653000901260773007901269852000901348939003301357946001101390655001201401IND9301102320221123020001.0930222e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930110232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvensson, B.W.10aMorphological variation in Gyrinus sericeolimbatus Reg. in New Guinea and description of a new Gyrinus species (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae)  ap. 499-514.  a2019-12-04  aSamples of Gyrinus sericeolimbatus from twenty-six localities in New Guinea vary greatly in metric body characters as well as in elytral reticulation patterns. The variation is smaller within than between populations. Although the characters of adjacent populations are usually similar, certain proximate populations exhibit significant differences, probably resulting from some kind of dispersal barrier. Similarities between populations at comparable latitudes suggest that some of the morphological variation is altitude-related. In addition, evidence is found for habitat-related morphological differentiation. Changes in phenotypes in response to possible environmental factors in ontogeny and constraints imposed by various selection pressures are discussed. A new species, G.brincki sp.n., from western New Guinea is described. 3ageographical distribution 3aColeoptera 3aanatomy and morphology 3anew species 3aPapua New Guinea 0ataxonomy 0akeys0 tSystematic entomology.g1991 Oct., v. 16, no. 4 p.499-514x0307-69707nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02939naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001400162245010700176300001800283500001500301520138400316650002801700650002701728650001801755650002601773650001501799650002401814650001301838650001401851650001801865650002301883650001501906650002901921650001701950650001201967650002501979650001302004651002502017653001302042653001302055653001202068653001502080700001302095700001602108773010802124852000902232856008502241930003302326945002502359946001302384655001202397IND4397622220221123015802.0071108s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439762222DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207015884372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aIslam, A.10aDeveloping a Technique to Quantify Heterotrophic and Autotrophic Nitrification in Acidic Pasture Soils  ap. 2309-2321.  a2019-12-04  aA series of laboratory incubation experiments were conducted on soils from Maindample and Ruffy in northeast Victoria and from Whittlesea in the Plenty Valley, north of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, to develop a technique for quantifying both autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrification in acidic pasture soils. The use of a specific inhibitor of the autotrophic ammonium oxidizers (N-serve) did not completely inhibit autotrophic nitrification in its commonly recommended concentrations (10 and 20 microgram g(-1) soil) in these soils. The N-serve concentration, which completely inhibited autotrophic nitrification, was found to be 60-80 microgram g(-1). Varying soil types, pHs, and organic-matter contents affected the optimum dose of N-serve required for complete inhibition of autotrophic nitrification. Mixing the inhibitor with the soil after application was also important for immediate inhibition of autotrophic nitrification. Using N-serve in combination with 15N-labeled glycine in the Maindample soil showed that heterotrophic organisms were using the organic route for nitrification, and N-serve did not affect heterotrophic nitrification. A lag of 12 to 24 h in complete inhibition of autotrophic nitrification by N-serve may have occurred suggesting nitrification studies using N-serve should include pre-incubation of the soils with N-serve for at least 1 day. 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3achemical concentration 3asoil bacteria 3aquantitative analysis 3aacid soils 3asoil organic matter 3apastures 3aVertisols 3anitrification 3aammonium compounds 3anitrapyrin 3anitrification inhibitors 3aheterotrophs 3asoil pH 3aglycine (amino acid) 3anitrates 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aSodosols 0aKurosols 0aN-serve 0aautotrophs1 aChen, D.1 aWhite, R.E.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 17-18 p.2309-2321x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207015884373Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/26  aOther US 7aarticle02675naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245006100146300001400207500001500221520165200236650001701888650001801905650001201923650005501935650001101990650006702001650001902068650001102087650002202098653001602120700001902136700001502155773007602170852000902246939003302255946001302288655001202301IND9303050220221122235056.0930519e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930305022DNAL7 a83846762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCompton, S.R.14aThe cellular and molecular pathogenesis of coronaviruses  ap. 15-28.  a2019-12-05  aCoronaviruses cause a wide spectrum of diseases in humans and animals but generally fall into two classes, with respiratory or enteric tropisms. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and rat coronaviruses are the virus most frequently encountered in the laboratory animal setting. This review focuses primarily on the cellular and molecular aspects of MHV pathogenesis. The high mutation and recombination rates of coronaviruses lead to a diverse, ever-changing population of MHV stains. The spike (S) protein is the most variable coronavirus protein and is responsible for binding to cell surface receptors, inducing cell fusion and humoral and cellular immunity. Differences within the S protein of different MHV strains have been linked to their variable tropisms. Since immunity to MHV is strain-specific, seropositive mice can be reinfected with different strains of MHV. Natural infections with MHV are acute, with persistence occurring at the population level, not within an individual mouse, unless it is immunocompromised. Age, genotype, immunologic status of the mouse, and MHV strain influence the type and severity of disease caused by MHV. Interference with research by MHV has been reported primarily in the fields of immunology and tumor biology and may be a reflection of MHV's capacity to grow in several types of immune cells. While many methods are available to diagnose coronavirus infection. serologic tests, primarily ELISA and IFA, are the most commonly used. MHV is best managed on a preventive basis. Elimination of MHV from a population requires cessation of breeding and halting the introduction of naive mice into the population. 3apathogenesis 3aCoronavirinae 2aAnimals 2aHepatitis, Viral, Animalxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aMurine hepatitis virusximmunologyxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aViral Proteins 2aVirion 2aVirus Replication 0aCoronavirus1 aBarthold, S.W.1 aSmith, Al.0 tComparative medicine.g1993 Feb., v. 43, no. 1 p.15-28x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03282naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245009000188300001800278520097300296650002301269650001301292650001501305650002401320650002201344650002101366650001101387650000701398650002401405650002001429650001101449650006401460650005501524650004301579650002101622650003301643650003101676650004501707650005001752650003401802650002801836650003801864650003801902650002801940650006401968650003802032650003302070650003002103653002402133653001002157653002202167653001702189700001602206700001302222700002002235700001502255700001402270700001602284700001502300773011202315852000902427856009202436930003302528946001102561655001202572IND4436211620221122235123.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443621162DNAL7 a204234562pmid7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07644.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichelon, D.10aContribution of exofacial thiol groups in the reducing activity of Lactococcus lactis  ap. 2282-2290.  aLactococcus lactis can decrease the redox potential at pH 7 (Eh₇) from 200 to -200 mV in oxygen free Man-Rogosa-Sharpe media. Neither the consumption of oxidizing compounds or the release of reducing compounds during lactic acid fermentation were involved in the decrease in Eh₇ by the bacteria. Thiol groups located on the bacterial cell surface appear to be the main components that are able to establish a greater exchange current between the Pt electrode and the bacteria. After the final Eh₇ (-200 mV) was reached, only thiol-reactive reagents could restore the initial Eh₇ value. Inhibition of the proton motive force showed no effect on maintaining the final Eh₇ value. These results suggest that maintaining the exofacial thiol (-SH) groups in a reduced state does not depend on an active mechanism. Thiol groups appear to be displayed by membrane proteins or cell wall-bound proteins and may participate in protecting cells against oxidative stress. 3aLactococcus lactis 3abacteria 3aelectrodes 3alactic fermentation 3amembrane proteins 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apH 3aproton-motive force 3aredox potential 3athiols 2aCarbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazonexpharmacokinetics 2aCulture Media, Conditionedxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDicyclohexylcarbodiimidexpharmacology 2aElectrochemistry 2aEthylmaleimidexpharmacology 2aFermentationxdrug effects 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentrationxdrug effects 2aLactococcus lactisxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aNigericinxpharmacology 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effects 2aProton-Motive Forcexdrug effects 2aStilbenesxpharmacology 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aSulfhydryl Reagentsxpharmacology 2aSulfonic Acidsxpharmacology 2aValinomycinxpharmacology 0aproton motive force 0aredox 0areducing activity 0athiol groups1 aAbraham, S.1 aEbel, B.1 aConinck, J. de.1 aHusson, F.1 aFeron, G.1 aGervais, P.1 aCachon, R.0 tFEBS journal.g2010 May, v. 277, no. 10 p.2282-2290dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07644.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02909naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001800196245010400214300001800318520160400336650001401940650002601954650002501980650002202005650001302027650001802040650000902058650001302067650000702080650001802087650000902105700001602114700001602130700001602146700001602162773010802178852000902286856008502295930003302380945002502413946001302438655001202451IND4397622620221122235056.0071108s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439762262DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207015884942doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCaballero, R.10aIron Chlorosis in Gerber as Related to Properties of Various Types of Compost used as Growing Media  ap. 2357-2369.  aNutrient deficiencies in crop plants may be influenced by a number of properties of the growing media. Some peat-substitute substrates can promote iron (Fe) chlorosis in sensitive plants, which has traditionally been ascribed to the elevated pH of growing media. To identify the origin of this problem in various types of composted organic residues used as growing media and possible corrections, a complete randomized experiment on gerber (Gerbera jamesonii Adlam) as an Fe-chlorosis sensitive crop involving three factors (growing medium, medium acidification, and the medium treatment with Fe) was performed. Although the Fe content in plants decreased with increasing pH in the growing medium, the chlorophyll content as measured using a chlorophyll meter (Minolta Soil Plant Analysis Development, SPAD) was not significantly related to pH. The SPAD readings and Fe concentrations in plants, dry matter, and flower production were not significantly related to diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable Fe in the growing media. The addition of Fe-chelate significantly increased yield (P < 0.01), and SPAD at 65 and 96 days after planting (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). However, the effect of the acid treatment was, different depending on the growing media. When the acidification promoted a positive effect on SPAD readings, this was nonsignificantly different than that obtained with the application of Fe-chelate. The estimated amount of available Fe in the growing media was not relevant, which explains the incidence of chlorosis as physiological factors related to pH. 3achlorosis 3anutrient deficiencies 3aplant micronutrients 3aGerbera jamesonii 3acomposts 3agrowing media 3airon 3achelates 3apH 3aacidification 3apeat1 aOrdovas, J.1 aPajuelo, P.1 aCarmona, E.1 aDelgado, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 17-18 p.2357-2369x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207015884943Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/26  aOther US 7aarticle02735naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100002100196245010500217300001800322500001500340520128300355650002301638650002101661650002601682650001201708650001601720650001401736650001001750650001901760650002001779650002101799650001401820650001301834653001601847653001401863653001601877700002201893700001901915700002201934773010801956852000902064856008502073930003302158945002502191946001302216655001202229IND4393929020221122235233.0070811s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439392902DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207013772452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

For plant and slag analysis (1.0-10.0 mg L⁻¹ Si), the method involves monitoring the yellowish molybdosilicic acid at 410 nm. Soil, fertilizer, water, and sugarcane juice analysis (0.5-5.0 mg L⁻¹ Si) were accomplished by adding a reducing agent, and the molybdenum blue compound that formed was monitored at 735 nm. Flexibility of the method allows determination in a variety of matrices involving a wide range of concentrations. Beer's law is followed up to 20.0 mg L⁻¹ Si (r<0.9997; n=6) for analysis at 410 nm and up to 10.0 mg L⁻¹ Si (r<0.9998; n=6) at 735 nm. For the yellow-color and blue-color methods, the detection limits were estimated as 0.5 and 0.1 mg L⁻¹ Si. Measurement frequency for both methods is approximately 75 h⁻¹ using 48 mg of ammonium heptamolybdate, 80 mg of oxalic acid, and 24 mg of ascorbic acid per determination. Results are precise (r.s.d.>0.1%, n=10) and in agreement with inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Statistical differences between data sets were not confirmed after applying the Student's ttest at the 95% confidence level (t(exp)=0.195>t(tab)=2.57) related to n=6. 3aspectrophotometers 3anutrient content 3aSaccharum officinarum 3asilicon 3afertilizers 3afrequency 3awater 3asoil fertility 3asugarcane juice 3asoil test values 3aprecision 3aaccuracy 0amethodology 0asugarcane 0anew methods1 aRossete, A.L.R.M.1 aOliveira, G.S.1 aBendassolli, J.A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 11-12 p.1411-1423x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207013772453Available from publisher's Web site  a20070830b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle02699naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245010100192300001800293520108600311650001201397650001701409650001301426650001201439650001001451650001101461650001201472650003501484650003601519650002101555650003501576650002301611650003701634650002101671650001101692650001801703650000901721650004701730650000901777650002301786653002401809653004101833700001901874700001901893773011201912852000902024856009202033930003302125946001102158655001202169IND4436212420221122231416.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443621242DNAL7 a204234622pmid7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07656.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKallberg, Yvonne10aClassification of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily using hidden Markov models  ap. 2375-2386.  aThe short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily now has over 47 000 members, most of which are distantly related, with typically 20-30% residue identity in pairwise comparisons, making it difficult to obtain an overview of this superfamily. We have therefore developed a family classification system, based upon hidden Markov models (HMMs). To this end, we have identified 314 SDR families, encompassing about 31 900 members. In addition, about 9700 SDR forms belong to families with too few members at present to establish valid HMMs. In the human genome, we find 47 SDR families, corresponding to 82 genes. Thirteen families are present in all three domains (Eukaryota, Bacteria, and Archaea), and are hence expected to catalyze fundamental metabolic processes. The majority of these enzymes are of the 'extended' type, in agreement with earlier findings. About half of the SDR families are only found among bacteria, where the 'classical' SDR type is most prominent. The HMM-based classification is used as a basis for a sustainable and expandable nomenclature system. 3aArchaea 3aMarkov chain 3abacteria 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahumans 2aAnimals 2aArchaeaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBacteriaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCluster Analysis 2aComputational Biologyxmethods 2aDatabases, Protein 2aEukaryotaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGenomexgenetics 2aHumans 2aMarkov Chains 2aMice 2aOxidoreductasesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aRats 2aSequence Alignment 0ahidden Markov model 0ashort-chain dehydrogenases/reductase1 aOppermann, Udo1 aPersson, Bengt0 tFEBS journal.g2010 May, v. 277, no. 10 p.2375-2386dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07656.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02109naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245005100144300001600195520108000211650001301291650002201304650002101326650001801347650002701365650002301392650002601415650001201441650001901453651001101472700001801483700002201501700001901523700001901542773007201561852000901633930003301642945002501675946001101700655001201711IND4372099720221122214618.0050708e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437209972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The identification of fatty acids done by equivalent chain length for trans fatty acids. Total TFA ranged from 12.2% to 31.2% of total fatty acid and the mean was 20.1%. Trans 18:1 isomers were the major group of TFA present in all the analyzed brands, representing 83.2% of total trans isomers. The mono-trans 18:2 isomer content ranged from 1.6% to 4.2% of total fatty acids, this being the most prevalent group of trans polyunsaturated acid. The di-trans 18:2 isomer (9t, 12t) was found at very low levels (0.10-0.15% of total fatty acids). Trans 18:3 isomer content ranged from 0.11% to 0.75% of total fatty acids representing 24.4-75.0% of total alpha-linolenic acid. The results indicate that Brazilian cream cracker biscuits contain considerable proportions of trans fatty acids, both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. 3abiscuits 3atrans fatty acids 3afood composition 3alipid content 3afatty acid composition 3agas chromatography 3aliquid chromatography 3aisomers 3alinolenic acid 3aBrazil1 aCarapelli, R.1 aVisantainer, J.V.1 aMatsushita, M.1 aSouza, N.E. de0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.445-448x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02037naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010400125300001600229500001500245520065100260650002200911650002000933650001700953650001000970650001800980650002100998650002801019650001901047650001701066650001501083650001401098650001101112650001801123650003601141650002101177650002701198650001601225650001601241653001601257653002301273700001301296700001501309700001501324700001401339700001601353773007201369852000901441930003301450945001301483946001101496655001201507IND2051163920221122214640.0960508e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205116392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimura, Y.10aCyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl), a plant growth regulator produced by the fungus Penicillium sp  ap. 665-669.  a2019-12-05  aCyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) was isolated from an unidentified Pencillium sp.

We evaluated the air distribution and air turnover rates in unoccupied shoe-box mouse cages, filter-top covered cages and shoe-box mouse cages housed in flexible film isolator by using discontinuous gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and smoke. Results showed that air turnover was most rapid in the unoccupied shoe-box mouse cage and slowest in the filter-top covered cage. Placing mice in the filter-top covered cage did not significantly improve the air turnover rate. Although filter-top covered cages reduce cage-to-cage transmission of disease, the poor air flow observed within these cages could lead to a buildup of gaseous pollutants that may adversely affect the animal's health. 3aventilation systems 3alaboratory animals 3acages 3agases 3apollutants 3aanimal health 2aAir Conditioning 2aAir Movements 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Laboratory 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aMice 2aVentilation1 aWhite, W.J.1 aSnider, M.T.1 aLang, C.M.0 tComparative medicine.g1989 May, v. 39, no. 3 p.237-242x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02109naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245008200159300001600241520075700257650001901014650001101033650000901044650002201053650002701075650002001102650001801122650002601140650002301166650002301189650002101212650002301233650002601256650002001282650002601302650002301328650001901351700002101370700001701391700001501408700001401423700001601437773007201453852000901525930003301534945002501567946001101592655001201603IND4372100120221122181620.0050708e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437210012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Structural and mechanical characterizations on the nanocomposite films were performed. The results show, in the case of starch/clay material, a good intercalation of the polymeric phase into clay interlayer galleries, together with an increase of mechanical parameters, such as modulus and tensile strength. Finally the conformity of our samples with actual regulations and European directives on biodegradable materials was verified by migration tests and by putting the films into contact with vegetables and simulants. 3afood packaging 3astarch 3aclay 3afilms (materials) 3abiodegradable products 3amontmorillonite 3aparticle size 3aprocessing technology 3aproduct evaluation 3acomposite polymers 3atensile strength 3amodulus of rupture 3amodulus of elasticity 3aproduct testing 3aproduct certification 3achemical structure 3aEuropean Union1 aVlieger, J.J. de1 aErrico, M.E.1 aFisher, S.1 aVacca, P.1 aVolpe, M.G.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.467-474x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01313naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245005000132300001600182300002400198520045000222650002000672650001500692650001200707650001600719650003900735651001200774653002100786653005000807773006900857852000900926939003300935945000800968946001100976655001200987991611005350742620221122181614.0890605e198811  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890008652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolawole, A.10aRBRDAs and vulnerability to hunger in Nigeria  ap. 389-396.  ap. 389-396. charts.  aOstensibly formulated to aid the process of rural transformation and the country's drive to self-sufficiency in food production, River Basin and Rural Development Authorities (RBRDAs) have become the source of vulnerability to hunger in Nigeria.

The transgenic plants as well as transformed calli produced functional adenine methyltransferase enzyme, but the level of expression was higher in tobacco calli. A transgenic tobacco cell line that expressed the methyltransferase enzyme and carried an Arabidopsis cab3 gene containing a single target site for the adenine methyltransferase enzyme showed that the adenine residue was not methylated.

The genes are separated by 2.2 kbp and have the same direction of transcription. Conserve elements preceding the translation start have been identified. In addition to the TATA box, a stretch of 11 identical nucleotides is found 23-24 bp downstream of the TATA box. The putative mature peroxidases encoded by LPG I and LPG II are 87% identical in amino acid sequence. Both are preceded by two basic residues, also observed in lignin peroxidases from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Strong evidence suggests that LPG I encodes a quantitatively dominant lignin peroxidase isozyme (TvLP12), whereas the product of LPG II has not been identified so far. 3aCoriolus versicolor 3alignin 3aperoxidases 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aligninolytic microorganisms 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenomic Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPeroxidasesxgenetics 2aPolyporaceaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTATA Box 2aTranscription, Genetic 0acomparisons 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x75655 0aembl/x756551 aNyman, P.O.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1994 Aug. 2, v. 1218, no. 3 p.408-412x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01738naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007500128300001400203520098400217650001601201650002201217650002001239650001601259700001901275773010001294852000901394930003301403945001301436946001101449655001201460IND2044436420221122115641.0950203e199412  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204443642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNotermans, S.10aMicrobiological challenge testing for ensuring safety of food products  ap. 33-39.  aMicrobiological challenge testing (MCT), storage testing, and predictive modelling are tools to simulate or to test what can happen to a food product during processing, distribution and subsequent handling. MCT is carried out if the microorganism of interest is suspected to be present in low numbers or only incidentally, and should be applied if full knowledge about the characteristics of a potential hazardous microorganism does not exist. MCT involves: (a) an appropriate experimental design; (b) an inoculation procedure; (c) a test procedure; and (d) interpretation of results. If MCT is carried out properly, information is obtained on the types of microorganisms capable of growth in the product, so that risks of food poisoning can be assessed. Therefore, the information obtained can be the basis for setting safety criteria at the critical control points in a food processing operation. However, it remains necessary to verify the test results under field conditions. 3afood safety 3afood microbiology 3afood processing 3aplate count1 aVeld, P. in't.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1994 Dec., v. 24, no. 1/2 p.33-39x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01846naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245009000142300001600232520067400248650001200922650002900934650001800963650001200981650001800993650002401011650002001035650003101055650007801086653002301164653002001187700001801207700001601225700001401241700001501255773010001270852000901370930003301379945001301412946001101425655001201436IND2043901120221122084932.0941230e199410  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204390112DNAL7 a78487822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarza, S.10aHeat resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated from spoiled peach puree  ap. 209-213.  aThe heat resistance of three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated from spoiled peach puree, in McIlvaine buffer (pH 4 and 7) and peach puree (pH 3.9) was studied.

Disruption of HS synthetic enzymes causes perturbation of growth factor signaling and malformation in vertebrate and invertebrate development. Our previous studies show that the O-sulfation patterns of HS are essential for the specific binding of growth factors to HS chains, and that depletion of O-sulfotransferases results in remarkable developmental defects in Drosophila, zebrafish, chick, and mouse. Here, we show that inhibition of chick HS-6-O-sulfotransferases (HS6ST-1 and HS6ST-2) in the prospective limb region by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in the truncation of limb buds and reduced Fgf-8 and Fgf-10 expressions in the apical ectodermal ridge and in the underlying mesenchyme, respectively. HS6ST-2 RNAi resulted in a higher frequency of limb truncation and a more marked change in both Fgf-8 and Fgf-10 expressions than that achieved with HS6ST-1 RNAi. HS6ST-1 RNAi and HS6ST-2 RNAi caused a significant but distinct reduction in the levels of different 6-O-sulfation in HS, possibly as a result of their different substrate specificities. Our data support a model where proper levels and patterns of 6-O-sulfation of HS play essential roles in chick limb bud development. 3achicks 3alimb bud 2aAnimals 2aChick Embryo 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aHeparitin Sulfatexmetabolism 2aLimb Budsxembryologyxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxpharmacology 2aSulfotransferasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aheparan sulfate 0aheparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferases 0aRNAi1 aHabuchi, Hiroko1 aNogami, Ken1 aAshikari-Hada, Satoko1 aTamura, Koji1 aIde, Hiroyuki1 aKimata, Koji0 tDevelopment, growth & differentiation.g2010 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.146-156dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0012-15927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01148.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01385naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001200154245006900166246008400235300001600319300002100335520047200356650002600828650002100854650001800875773009200893852000900985856005700994939003301051946001101084655001201095IND8400050720221121135205.0840106e198308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND840005072DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0865652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSen, U.10aStomatal structure and stomatogenesis in Azolla pinnata R.

The analytical procedure includes an acidic hydrolysis to free all the bound forms (NAD and NADP) and to convert all the niacin into nicotinic acid, after that the chromatographic separation of the acid form is performed by a cation-exchange column and UV detection (262 nm). The evidence of several interferences that did not allow a good resolution of the nicotinic acid peak in fresh meat matrix led us to improve the resolution by means of statistical optimisation. A three level factorial design and response surface methodology were applied to optimise the chromatographic conditions (mobile phases compositions) and to assess the robustness of the method. Analytical performances of the optimised method were investigated in terms of linearity, limit of detection (LOD) and precision. The complete analytical procedure to extract and determine the nicotinic acid in meat was validated by IC-MS. 3aspectrophotometers 3apork 3acured meats 3aion exchange chromatography 3ameat composition 3afood analysis 3avitamin content 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3ameat quality 3avalidity 3aresponse surface methodology 3amass spectrometry 3aacid hydrolysis 3araw meat 3aniacin 3aprecision 3aaccuracy 0aoptimization 0atest sensitivity1 aTanzi, E.1 aMallozzi, S.1 aCavalli, S.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Sept., v. 92, no. 2 p.373-379x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20070720b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03691naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002400128245015800152300002000310520159400330650001901924650001401943650001601957650001001973650001701983650002902000650002402029650001202053650002602065650003602091650001802127650003202145650002902177650002302206650001402229650002802243650002002271650001302291650002802304650002302332650003302355650004402388650004202432650003402474650002702508653002302535653001602558653001502574653002802589653001902617653001902636653001902655653001602674653001602690653001602706653003202722700001402754700001502768700001702783700001502800773009802815852000902913930003302922945001302955946001302968655001202981IND2048983620221121065444.0951129e19941118mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204898362DNAL7 a79618032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasteels-Josson, K.10aAcute transcriptional response of the honeybee peptide-antibiotics gene repertoire and required post-translational conversion of the precursor structures  ap. 28569-28575.  aThe cell-free immune repertoire of honeybees (Apis mellifera) consists of four polypeptides that are induced by bacterial infection and, through complementarity, provide broad-spectrum antibacterial defense. apidaecin is overproduced by a combination of low threshold transcriptional activation and a unique, genetically encoded amplification mechanism. In contrast, sizable experimental infections are required for induction of the normally silent hymenoptaecin, abaecin, and bee defensin genes; even so, bee defensin transcription is minimal and delayed, and only minute quantities of corresponding peptide are produced. The specific, temporal organization of the multi-component immune response in bees has therefore likely been selected to cope with infection of prevalent, plant-associated Gram-negative bacteria. Post-translational processing and modifications are substantially different for each of the four antibacterial peptides. While no similarities were observed among precursor structures of the various bee peptides, surprisingly, the signal sequences of abaecin (bee) and drosocin (Drosophila) shared unmistakable homology, possibly indicating common ancestral secretion/ processing mechanisms. Finally, we report that bee defensin contains a typical disulfide-rich structure (40 amino acids) but also a unique, amphipathic, putatively amidated carboxyl-terminal tail (10 amino acids). We speculate that this structure is a "co-drug," assembled by fusing "disulfide-rich" and "alpha-helical" class peptide antibiotics, a novel concept in naturally occurring antibacterials. 3aApis mellifera 3ahemolymph 3aantibiotics 3agenes 3apolypeptides 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agents 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptides 2aBase Sequence 2aBeesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBlood Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDefensins 2aGlycopeptidesxgenetics 2aInsect Proteins 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxgenetics 2aProtein Precursorsxgenetics 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0atranslation 0aprecursors 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u15954 0agenbank/u15955 0agenbank/u15956 0aembl/u15954 0aembl/u15955 0aembl/u15956 0apost-translation regulation1 aZhang, W.1 aCapaci, T.1 aCasteels, P.1 aTempst, P.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Nov. 18, v. 269, no. 46 p.28569-28575x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03456naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245003900141300002000180520197000200650001102170650002302181650002002204650002502224650002502249650001802274650003002292650001202322650001802334650001102352650002002363650002302383650002402406650001102430650004602441650001302487650002302500650002602523653001902549653001602568653002302584653002502607700001602632700001502648700001602663700001502679700001402694700001702708773009702725852000902822930003302831945001302864946001302877655001202890IND2040594920221121065323.0940629e19940408mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204059492DNAL7 a81446122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, H.10aLipoprotein lipase domain function  ap. 10319-10323.  aHuman lipoprotein lipase (LPL) monomer consists of two domains, a larger NH2-terminal domain that contains catalytic residues and a smaller COOH-terminal domain that modulates substrate specificity and is a major determinant of heparin binding. Analyses of NH2-terminal domain function were performed after site-directed mutagenesis of the putative active-site serine residue, while COOH-terminal domain function was assessed following reaction with a monoclonal antibody. The native enzyme and mutant LPL in which serine 132 was replaced with alanine, cysteine, or glycine were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Mutant proteins were synthesized and secreted at levels comparable to native LPL; however, none of the mutants retained enzymatic activity. The mutant with alanine replacing serine 132 was purified and shown to be inactive with both esterase and lipase substrates; however, binding to a 1,2-didodecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine monolayer was comparable to native LPL. These results are consistent with a catalytic, and not a lipid binding, role for serine 132. To investigate the function of the smaller COOH-terminal domain, LPL lipolytic and esterolytic activities as well as heparin binding properties were determined after reaction with a monoclonal antibody specific for this domain. Lipolytic activity was inhibited by the monoclonal antibody, whereas esterolytic activity was only marginally affected, indicating that the LPL COOH-terminal domain is required for lipolysis, perhaps by promoting interaction with insoluble substrates. Also, the affinity of antibody-reacted LPL for heparin was not significantly different from that of LPL alone, suggesting that (i) the heparin-binding site is physically distinct from the COOH-terminal domain region required for lipolysis and (ii) binding of antibody did not cause dimer dissociation. A model is proposed for the two LPL domains fulfilling different roles in the lipolytic process. 3ahumans 3alipoprotein lipase 3aenzyme activity 3aamino acid sequences 3aphosphatidylcholines 3abinding sites 3asite-directed mutagenesis 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aCattle 2aCells, Cultured 2aDNA, Complementary 2aHeparinxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aLipoprotein Lipasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aSerinexmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 0acatalytic site 0aactive site 0alipolytic activity 0aesterolytic activity1 aDavis, R.C.1 aThuren, T.1 aGoers, J.W.1 aNikazy, J.1 aWaite, M.1 aSchotz, M.C.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Apr. 8, v. 269, no. 14 p.10319-10323x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03344naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010800146300002000254520154500274650001101819650002101830650002701851650002201878650002501900650002501925650001101950650002001961650002501981650000902006650001602015650001002031650001802041650002402059650001202083650001802095650002402113650001102137650002002148650004902168650002802217650002002245650003302265650004702298653001902345653002802364700001702392700001402409700001602423700001802439700001402457700001502471700001502486700001302501700001502514773009702529852000902626930003302635945001302668946001302681655001202694IND2057385520221121060959.0970530e19951208mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205738552DNAL7 a74939862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorishita, R.10aPrimary structure of a gamma subunit of G protein gamma 12, and its phosphorylation by protein kinase C  ap. 29469-29475.  aWe have determined the primary structure of a novel gamma subunit (gamma12, previously designated gammaS1) of G protein purified from bovine spleen. The mature gamma12 protein composed of 68 amino acids had acetylated serine at the N terminus and geranylgeranylated/carboxylmethylated cysteine at the C terminus. This was consistent with the C-terminal prenylation signal in the amino acid sequence, which was predicted from gamma12 cDNA isolated from a bovine spleen cDNA library. Western blots with the specific antibody against gamma12 showed that gamma12 is present in all tissues examined. Among various gamma subunits (gamma1, gamma2, gamma3, gamma7, and gamma12), gamma12 has a unique property to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The phosphorylated amino acid residue was Ser1 (or Ser2). The phosphorylated beta gamma12 associated with Go alpha more tightly than the unphosphorylated form. Exposure of Swiss 3T3 and aortic smooth muscle cells to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and NaF induced phosphorylation of gamma12. Stimulation of aortic smooth muscle cells with natural vasoactive agents such as angiotensin II and vasopressin also induced phosphorylation of gamma12. The extent of phosphorylation of beta gamma12 in vitro was suppressed by a complex formation with Go alpha, which was relieved by the addition of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) or aluminum fluoride. These results strongly suggest that gamma12 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C during activation of receptor(s) and G protein(s) in living cells. 3acattle 3abinding proteins 3aguanosine triphosphate 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aspleen 3aphosphorylation 3aimmunohistochemistry 3arats 3afibroblasts 3aaorta 3asmooth muscle 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCalciumxphysiology 2aCattle 2aCells, Cultured 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Kinase Cxphysiology 2aTetradecanoylphorbol Acetatexpharmacology 0agenbank/u37561 0amolecular sequence data1 aNakayama, H.1 aIsobe, T.1 aMatsuda, T.1 aHashimoto, Y.1 aOkano, T.1 aFukada, Y.1 aMizuno, K.1 aOhno, S.1 aKozawa, O.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 Dec. 8, v. 270, no. 49 p.29469-29475x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02952naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245015200141300001600293500001500309520146100324650002701785650002201812650002601834650002101860650001801881650001501899650001901914650002301933650001801956650001701974650002401991650001802015650002702033650002002060650002602080650001602106650003202122651002102154653001702175653003202192653002602224700001402250700002002264773007202284852000902356930003302365945002502398946001102423655001202434IND4371208320221121060922.0050610e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437120832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCelik, M.12aA comparison of the proximate compositions and fatty acid profiles of zander (Sander lucioperca) from two different regions and climatic conditions  ap. 637-641.  a2019-12-05  aThe proximate compositions and fatty acid profiles of the flesh of the fresh water fish zander (Sander lucioperca) obtained from Egirdir Lake and from Seyhan Dam Lake were compared. The crude protein (18.8-18.1%), ash (1.37-0.75), and dry matter (20.67-20.09) contents of fish in Seyhan Dam Lake were observed to be higher than those in the other lake. Zander in Seyhan Dam Lake had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher lipid content than its Egirdir counterpart. Differences were also observed in the fatty acid profiles. The percentages of total saturated fatty acids (SFA) and total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were higher in the zander in Seyhan Dam Lake than in Egirdir Lake, whereas the corresponding total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content was lower. Moreover, the fatty acid composition of these fish showed a relatively high ratio of PUFA/SFA (1.00). Both zanders showed palmitic acid, C16:0, to be predominant, (19.6-20.8%), followed by oleic acid, C 18:1 n - 9, (19.2-13.4%). The data obtained indicate that the % composition of n - 3 PUFAs is greater in the flesh of zander in Egirdir Lake. This finding is in compliance with the fact that n - 3 fatty acids in fish living in cold climatic conditions have a higher % composition. It was concluded that the consumption of zander, widely found in Egirdir Lake and having higher % composition of n - 3 PUFAs than those caught from Seyhan Dam Lake, is more beneficial for human health. 3afatty acid composition 3aSander lucioperca 3aproximate composition 3afood composition 3apalmitic acid 3aoleic acid 3aclimatic zones 3adry matter content 3acrude protein 3afish fillets 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3alipid content 3ageographical variation 3anutritive value 3aenvironmental factors 3aash content 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aTurkey (country) 0afood quality 0amonounsaturated fatty acids 0asaturated fatty acids1 aDiler, A.1 aKucukgulmez, A.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Oct., v. 92, no. 4 p.637-641x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060622b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01859naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002000161245007300181300001800254500002400272520099400296650001401290650001301304650002301317650001201340700001701352773010901369852000901478856008201487655001201569IND4404383920221121061106.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440438392DNAL7 a183064352pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2007005462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoole, Salwa K.14aThe orthogonal character of stationary phases for gas chromatography  ap. 1118-1123.  aIncludes references  aA database of system constants for 32 open-tubular columns at 100°C is used to identify stationary phases for obtaining a wide selectivity space in comprehensive GC. Three parameters based on the Euclidean distance (D-parameter) or vectors (d-parameter and cosθ) in hyperspace are used to establish the chemical similarity and retention correlation as an inverse scale of selectivity differences. It is shown that the poly(methyloctylsiloxane) stationary phase is the best candidate for a low-selectivity stationary phase and affords a wider selectivity space when combined with a selective polar stationary phase than poly(dimethylsiloxanes). The most suitable polar stationary phases are poly(ethylene glycols) or bis(cyanopropylsiloxane-co-silarylenes and to a lesser extent poly(methyltrifluoropropylsiloxanes). No systems are truly orthogonal but angles between individual stationary phase vectors of about 75° are possible by choosing the correct combination of stationary phases. 3adatabases 3aethylene 3agas chromatography 3aglycols1 aPoole, C.

Thermodynamics and kinetics of umbelliferyl glycoside binding  ap. 5072-5077.  a2019-12-05  aCoccinia indica agglutinin (CIA) is a chitooligosaccharide-specific lectin with two binding sites/homodimer of Mr 32,000. Quenching studies implied tryptophan involvement in binding activity, which was confirmed by chemical modification experiments (A.R. Sanadi and A. Surolia, submitted for publication). Binding of 4-methylumbelliferyl chitooligosaccharides has been carried out to study their binding by CIA. Reversal experiments confirm the validity of the data previously obtained (A.R. Sanadi and A. Surolia, submitted for publication) from intrinsic fluorescence studies. Surprisingly, unlike wheat germ agglutinin, there is no consistent thermodynamic effect of the chromophoric label on binding activities as compared with the native sugars. From the changes in the optical properties of the chromophoric group upon binding to CIA, it has been possible to confirm that the tryptophan located in the binding site is closest to the fourth subsite. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the binding of the labeled tetrasaccharide is very strongly entropically driven, with the terminal, nonreducing sugar residue protruding from the binding pocket. The results of stopped-flow kinetic studies on the binding of the chromophoric trisaccharide by CIA show that the mechanism of binding is a one-step process. 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3alectins 3atryptophan 3aentropy 3aphloem 3abinding sites 3aoligosaccharides 3aCoccinia grandis 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCalorimetry 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aChitin 2aGlycosidesxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aLectinsxchemistry 2aMathematics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligosaccharides 2aPlant Lectins 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aThermodynamics 2aUmbelliferones 0afruits 0ainteractions 0athermodynamics1 aSurolia, A.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Feb. 18, v. 269, no. 7 p.5072-5077x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03213naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245009400187300001600281520155000297650002301847650001301870650002301883650001501906650001001921650001001931650000901941650001301950650001901963650001301982650001301995650002802008650001702036650006202053650001202115650002302127650001102150650000902161650002802170651002302198653001602221653000802237653002402245700001702269700001802286700001602304700001602320700001602336700001402352773011202366852000902478856009202487930003302579946001102612655001202623IND4433795120221121050227.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443379512DNAL7 a199170442pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2009.01978.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiles, L.G.10aQTL mapping for two commercial traits in farmed saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus)  ap. 142-149.  aThe recent generation of a genetic linkage map for the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) has now made it possible to carry out the systematic searches necessary for the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting traits of economic, as well as evolutionary, importance in crocodilians. In this study, we conducted genome-wide scans for two commercially important traits, inventory head length (which is highly correlated with growth rate) and number of scale rows (SR, a skin quality trait), for the existence of QTL in a commercial population of saltwater crocodiles at Darwin Crocodile Farm, Northern Territory, Australia. To account for the uncommonly large difference in sex-specific recombination rates apparent in the saltwater crocodile, a duel mapping strategy was employed. This strategy employed a sib-pair analysis to take advantage of our full-sib pedigree structure, together with a half-sib analysis to account for, and take advantage of, the large difference in sex-specific recombination frequencies. Using these approaches, two putative QTL regions were identified for SR on linkage group 1 (LG1) at 36 cM, and on LG12 at 0 cM. The QTL identified in this investigation represent the first for a crocodilian and indeed for any non-avian member of the Class Reptilia. Mapping of QTL is an important first step towards the identification of genes and causal mutations for commercially important traits and the development of selection tools for implementation in crocodile breeding programmes for the industry. 3aCrocodylus porosus 3abreeding 3achromosome mapping 3acrocodiles 3afarms 3agenes 3ahead 3aindustry 3alinkage groups 3amutation 3apedigree 3aquantitative trait loci 3asaline water 2aAlligators and Crocodilesxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aFemale 2aMale 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 3aNorthern Territory 0acrocodilian 0aQTL 0asaltwater crocodile1 aIsberg, S.R.1 aThomson, P.C.1 aGlenn, T.C.1 aLance, S.L.1 aDalzell, P.1 aMoran, C.0 tAnimal genetics.g2010 Apr., v. 41, no. 2 p.142-149dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2009.01978.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02718naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001500161245012800176300001800304500002400322520095600346650002201302650001401324650002601338650002101364650001401385650001101399650001301410650002501423650001201448650001401460650001301474650001801487650005001505650003301555650001101588650002401599650002101623650003901644650008801683650005701771650003801828700002101866700001301887700001801900700001401918700001401932700001801946773010901964852000902073856008202082655001202164IND4404384720221121050223.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440438472DNAL7 a183816902pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2007005072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing10aScreening of anti-platelet aggregation agents from Panax notoginseng using human platelet extraction and HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS  ap. 1173-1180.  aIncludes references  aRoot of Panax notoginseng (Sanqi in Chinese) is a highly valued and commonly used Chinese medicine. It has been widely used for treatment of cardio- and cerebro-vascular diseases. In this study, a method involving human platelet extraction and HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS was developed for screening potential anti-platelet aggregation agents in Sanqi. Five compounds which could interact with human platelets were found, and four were identified as adenosine, guanosine, ginsenoside Rh1, and ginsenoside F1, respectively. The effects on rabbit platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid, adenosine diphosphate, and thrombin were also investigated in vitro. The results showed that the nucleosides adenosine and guanosine mainly contributed to the anti-platelet aggregation of Sanqi. The data suggest that human platelet extraction combined with HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS is a useful method for screening anti-platelet aggregation agents from Chinese medicines. 3aPanax notoginseng 3aadenosine 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aarachidonic acid 3aguanosine 3ahumans 3amedicine 3aplatelet aggregation 3arabbits 3ascreening 3athrombin 2aCell Extracts 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDrug Evaluation, Preclinical 2aHumans 2aMolecular Structure 2aPanaxxchemistry 2aPlatelet Aggregationxdrug effects 2aPlatelet Aggregation Inhibitorsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods1 aHuang, Zhao-gang1 aCao, Hui1 aWang, Yi-Tao.1 aHui, Ping1 aHoo, Chai1 aLi, Shao-ping0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 Apr., v. 31, no. 6-7 p.1173-1180dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007005073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02779naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002600186245012400212300001600336520150000352653001901852653000801871653000801879653000801887700002201895700001601917700002501933700002001958700001801978700002401996700004002020700001802060700001902078700002302097700002302120773010902143852000902252856008502261946001102346655001202357IND4439117520221121033920.0100625e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443911752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00251-010-0450-32doi7 aPMC28900732pmcid7 a204801612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolomon, Christopher 14aThe most common Chinese rhesus macaque MHC class I molecule shares peptide binding repertoire with the HLA-B7 supertype  ap. 451-464.  aOf the two rhesus macaque subspecies used for AIDS studies, the Simian immunodeficiency virus-infected Indian rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is the most established model of HIV infection, providing both insight into pathogenesis and a system for testing novel vaccines. Despite the Chinese rhesus macaque potentially being a more relevant model for AIDS outcomes than the Indian rhesus macaque, the Chinese-origin rhesus macaques have not been well-characterized for their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) composition and function, reducing their greater utilization. In this study, we characterized a total of 50 unique Chinese rhesus macaques from several varying origins for their entire MHC class I allele composition and identified a total of 58 unique complete MHC class I sequences. Only nine of the sequences had been associated with Indian rhesus macaques, and 28/58 (48.3%) of the sequences identified were novel. From all MHC alleles detected, we prioritized Mamu-A1*02201 for functional characterization based on its higher frequency of expression. Upon the development of MHC/peptide binding assays and definition of its associated motif, we revealed that this allele shares peptide binding characteristics with the HLA-B7 supertype, the most frequent supertype in human populations. These studies provide the first functional characterization of an MHC class I molecule in the context of Chinese rhesus macaques and the first instance of HLA-B7 analogy for rhesus macaques. 0aRhesus macaque 0aMHC 0aHLA 0aCTL1 aSouthwood, Scott 1 aHoof, Ilka 1 aRudersdorf, Richard 1 aPeters, Bjoern 1 aSidney, John 1 aPinilla, Clemencia 1 aMarcondes, Maria Cecilia Garibaldi 1 aLing, Binhua 1 aMarx, Preston 1 aSette, Alessandro 1 aMothé, Bianca R. 0 tImmunogenetics.g2010 July, v. 62, no. 7 p.451-464dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0093-77117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00251-010-0450-33Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03729naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245012500182300001400307520221500321650001202536650001402548650000902562650002202571650003502593650003202628650001102660650001102671650000902682650004702691650001502738650002402753650001802777651001002795653003802805653002502843700001802868700001502886700001902901700001802920700001302938700001302951773011902964852000903083856008503092930003303177946001303210655001203223IND4439490320221121033938.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443949032DNAL7 a204113512pmid7 a10.1007/s12013-010-9083-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, JieYan 10aEfficacy of Coronary Angioplasty on Long-Term Outcome in Elderly Chinese Patients with ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction  ap. 59-65.  aThe benefit and efficacy of interventional coronary therapies in elderly patients is still a controversial subject, especially in parts of the world where traditional and conservative medicine is still mainstream. In China, the benefit of intervention is still questionable, hence, this study investigated the prognostic significance of coronary angioplasty on outcomes of elderly patients presenting with ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). The study cohort comprised of 270 elderly (age ≥ 75 years) patients who had confirmed STEMI. Some 116 patients underwent coronary angioplasty (called CA group) and their prognoses and survival over the short- and long-term periods (up to 80 months) were compared to 154 comparable patients who received a noninvasive, more conservative medical therapy (non-CA group). The subsequent Kaplan-Meier survival curves and statistical analyses were used to ascertain any difference between the groups. There was no significant differences between the two groups in terms of their clinical presentation, clinical risk, cardiac features, medications and medical procedures, except that the peak creatine kinase was significantly higher in the CA group. The success rate of interventional percutaneous coronary intervention observed in the CA group was 92.4% and during the hospitalization period, there were fewer deaths in the CA group (11 vs. 61 in the non-CA group). Furthermore, after 1-year and up to 7 years postsurgery, the CA group had a significant survival when compared to the non-CA cohort. Analysis of the longer-term data, using multivariate Cox regression analysis after 80 months indicated a hazard ratio of mortality for patients in CA group to be 0.283 (95% CI: 0.140-0.534, P < 0.001). Also, multivariate logistic regression analysis identified conservative treatment, chronic renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia, chronic lung disease and left ventricular ejection fraction, as predictors of higher long-term mortality in elderly patients with STEMI. In conclusion, this study clearly indicates that elderly Chinese patients with STEMI who undergo coronary angioplasty benefit and have a better survival rates in both the short- and long-term. 3aelderly 3amortality 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAngioplasty, Balloon, Coronary 2aCreatine Kinasexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMyocardial Infarctionxmortalityxtherapy. 2aOdds Ratio 2aRegression Analysis 2aSurvival Rate 0aChina 0aST elevated myocardial infarction 0aCoronary angioplasty1 aDu, YongPing 1 aSong, Wei 1 aLiu, Jianping.1 aJin, ShuXuan 1 aBu, Jun 1 aHe, Ben 0 tCell biochemistry and biophysics.g2010 July, v. 57, no. 2-3 p.59-65dNew York : Humana Press Incx1085-91957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12013-010-9083-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02661naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168300001400285520133700299592002801636650002301664650001701687650001901704650001701723650001901740650001201759650001501771650001601786650001701802650002001819653002101839653001801860653001701878653002301895653001501918653001301933700001901946700002001965700002401985700002002009773008102029856008402110852000902194655001202203IND60556720720221120113023.0161102e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055672072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jung-Gil12aA novel multi-stage direct contact membrane distillation module: Design, experimental and theoretical approaches  ap. 47-56.  aAn economic desalination system with a small scale and footprint for remote areas, which have a limited and inadequate water supply, insufficient water treatment and low infrastructure, is strongly demanded in the desalination markets. Here, a direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) process has the simplest configuration and potentially the highest permeate flux among all of the possible MD processes. This process can also be easily instituted in a multi-stage manner for enhanced compactness, productivity, versatility and cost-effectiveness. In this study, an innovative, multi-stage, DCMD module under countercurrent-flow configuration is first designed and then investigate both theoretically and experimentally to identify its feasibility and operability for desalination application. Model predictions and measured data for mean permeate flux are compared and shown to be in good agreement. The effect of the number of module stages on the mean permeate flux, performance ratio and daily water production of the MDCMD system has been theoretically identified at inlet feed and permeate flow rates of 1.5 l/min and inlet feed and permeate temperatures of 70 °C and 25 °C, respectively. The daily water production of a three-stage DCMD module with a membrane area of 0.01 m2 at each stage is found to be 21.5 kg.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adesalination 3adirect contact 3adistillation 3ainfrastructure 3amarkets 3aprediction 3atemperature 3awater supply 3awater treatment 0aMulti-stage DCMD 0aModule design 0aDesalination 0aComposite membrane 0aExperiment 0aModeling1 aKim, Woo-Seung1 aChoi, June-Seok1 aGhaffour, Noreddine1 aKim, Young-Deuk0 tWater research.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 107 p.47-56dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002900138245012000167300001400287500001500301520183600316592002802152650001502180650001702195650001502212650001102227650002502238650001402263650001302277650001602290650001902306650001702325650001502342653001602357700002102373700002102394700001702415700002402432700001802456773011302474852000902587856007502596655001202671IND2320991920221119223119.0190314e200102  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232099192DNAL7 a10.1007/BF007766452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulido-Novicio, Lilibeth10aAdsorption capacities and related characteristics of wood charcoals carbonized using a one-step or two-step process  ap. 48-57.  a2019-12-05  aSugi (Cryptomeria japonlca D. Don) wood powder was carbonized at varying temperatures by a onestep process up to 1000‡C and a two-step process using wood charcoal as the raw material up to 1600‡C. This study was conducted to evaluate the adsorptive properties of wood charcoal and discuss the mechanism of its adsorptive function in relation to the physical and anatomical characteristics of wood after carbonization. Anatomical characteristics of carbonized wood materials were directly observed under heating using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM); the cell wall structures were analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The largest weight losses were observed at the highest temperatures, in both the one-step and twostep processes but leveled off above 800‡C. Shrinkages in the tangential, radial, and longitudinal directions increased with carbonization temperature, peaking at 1000‡C. Direct observations by ESEM showed distinct shrinkage at around 400‡C. The first trial observations by HRTEM on the changes in the ultrastructure of cell walls of wood charcoals were done, and it was assumed to affect the formation of micropores. Adsorption was found to follow the Langmuir isotherm model. With the one-step carbonization process, the iodine adsorption capacities of the carbonized wood powders increased with increasing carbonization temperature, peaking at 800‡C, but decreased at higher temperatures. The wood powder carbonized at 1000‡C with the two-step process showed the highest capacity, but further heating up to 1400‡C drastically decreased the adsorption. The shrinkage of cells was related to the increases and decreases in its specific surface area. Specific surface area and total pore volume were evidently related to the adsorptive properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicropores 3asurface area 3acell walls 3amodels 3aCryptomeria japonica 3ashrinkage 3acharcoal 3atemperature 3aultrastructure 3awood anatomy 3aadsorption 0amethodology1 aHata, Toshimitsu1 aKurimoto, Yasuji1 aDoi, Shuichi1 aIshihara, Shigehisa1 aImamura, Yuji0 tJournal of wood science.g2001 Feb., v. 47, no. 1 p.48-57dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF007766453Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02608naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011900175300001400294520129300308592002801601650001301629650001801642650001301660650002201673650001401695650001501709650001401724650002501738650001101763650001101774653001701785653001601802653001601818653001301834653002201847700002101869700002401890700002101914700002101935700002501956773007501981856008502056852000902141655001202150IND60545123620221121014302.0161019e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054512362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2015.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima-dos-Santos, I.10aCharacterization of Neuwiedin, a new disintegrin from Bothrops neuwiedi venom gland with distinct cysteine pattern  ap. 57-64.  aDisintegrins are cysteine-rich toxins containing the RGD motif exposed in a loop that binds integrins such as αIIbβ3, α5β1 and αvβ3. The flexibility of the RGD loop, controlled by the profile of the cysteine pairs and the residues flanking the RGD sequence, are key structural features for the functional activity of these molecules. Recently, our group reported a transcript in the venom gland of Bothrops neuwiedi corresponding to a new P-II SVMP precursor, BnMPIIx, in which the RGD-binding loop includes many substituted residues and unique cysteine residues at the C-terminal. In this paper, we obtained the recombinant disintegrin domain of BnMPIIx, Neuwiedin, which inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation, endothelial cell adhesion to fibrinogen and tube formation in Matrigel with no particular selectivity to αIIbβ3 or endothelial cell integrins. This value was also comparable to the inhibition observed with other recombinant disintegrins with conserved cysteine positions and residues in RGD loop. In this regard, Neuwiedin is an important component to understand the functional relevance of the diversity generated by accelerated evolution of venom toxins as well as to find out eventual new disintegrin-dependent targets that may be approached with disintegrins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBothrops 3acell adhesion 3acysteine 3aendothelial cells 3aevolution 3afibrinogen 3aintegrins 3aplatelet aggregation 3atoxins 3avenoms 0aSnake venoms 0aDisintegrin 0aRecombinant 0aPlatelet 0aEndothelial cells1 aDella-Casa, M.S.1 aPortes-Junior, J.A.1 aCalabria, P.A.L.1 aMagalhães, G.S.1 aMoura-da-Silva, A.M.0 tToxicon.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 104 p.57-64dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2015.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03826naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245009900171300001600270500001500286520219600301592002802497650002302525650001702548650002902565650001802594650001602612650001402628650001102642650001202653650002002665650001902685650002902704650002402733650001202757650002002769650001902789650002502808650001502833650002102848650001302869650001502882651001202897651001002909651001802919651001302937653001202950653001102962653001902973653002502992700002503017773010803042852000903150856008903159655001203248IND2052182320221119161348.0181002e199605  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205218232DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-199605000-000062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, Mark B.10aSoil and soil solution chemistry under red spruce stands across the northeastern united states  ap. 314-328.  a2019-12-04  aRed spruce ecosystems in the northeastern United States are of interest because this species is undergoing regional decline. Their underlying soils have been examined closely at only a few sites, and information available on red spruce soils throughout this region is limited. This study was conducted to examine soil and soil solution chemistry at red spruce sites in the northeastern US that encompass the range of soil conditions in which red spruce grow. Soils and soil solutions from Oa and B horizons were obtained over a 2-year period from 12 undisturbed red spruce forests (elevations of 80-975 m) in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. All sites had extremely acid Spodosols (Oa soil pH range 2.56 to 3.11 in 0.01 M CaCl2), with generally low concentrations of base cations and high concentrations of Al on soil exchange sites. There was considerable range in exchange chemistry across the sites, however, with exchangeable Ca in Oa horizons ranging from 2.1 to 21.6 cmolc kg and exchangeable Al from 3.6 to 18.3 cmolc kg. Solution chemistry had high concentrations of DOC in the Oa horizons (1160 - 15200 µmol L), with higher concentrations in the fall than in the spring, which was probably a reflection of fresh litter inputs. Despite high concentrations of DOC in all solutions, inorganic Al was found in some Oa solutions at concentrations as high as 26 µmol L. Ratios of Ca to inorganic Al concentrations were less than 1.0 in the Oa horizon of one site, and were well below 1.0 in B horizons of all sites. That soil chemistry was related to soil solution chemistry was demonstrated by solution Al concentrations in the forest floor having significant relationships with pyrophosphate extractable Al, although it was not related in the B horizon. Soil exchangeable Ca/Al ratios in the Oa horizon explained 75% of the variation in solution Ca/inorganic Al ratios when mean values were used for each site. Our studies have expanded the range of soil chemical conditions measured for red spruce soils. By characterizing the regional variability, these results will enable site intensive process studies to be better applied to regional problems such as spruce decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseasonal variation 3aforest soils 3adissolved organic carbon 3asoil solution 3aPicea abies 3aSpodosols 3aanions 3asoil pH 3abase saturation 3aforest decline 3acation exchange capacity 3asoil organic matter 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3ainorganic ions 3aexchangeable cations 3aacid soils 3aorganic horizons 3aaluminum 3aB horizons 3aVermont 3aMaine 3aNew Hampshire 3aNew York 0acations 0acarbon 0asoil chemistry 0achemical composition1 aLawrence, Gregory B.0 tSoil science.g1996 May, v. 161, no. 5 p.314-328dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-199605000-000063Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02765naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010800169300001600277520135100293592002801644650001801672650002201690650001601712650001801728650002201746650002401768650002801792651001301820653002101833653001501854653001701869653001101886653001801897700002101915700002001936700001901956700001801975700001601993700002002009700001502029700001902044773013702063856008602200852000902286655001202295IND60761322320221119232203.0220130e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076132232DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2021.19197032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazzaq, Abdul13aAn Automatic Determining Food Security Status: Machine Learning based Analysis of Household Survey Data  ap. 726-736.  aHousehold food security is a major issue in developing countries like Pakistan. Despite significant breakthroughs in grain production within the country, the problem of food availability and utilization persists. Diet is one of the most potent determinants of nutritional condition. The dietary intake method has been utilized to determine the food security status of households, which depends on various factors. There are no automatic and user-friendly methods available to decide food security status, which is generally determined by manually calculating calorie intakes. Due to its high performance and precision, machine learning holds major significance. In this paper, the status of food security has been examined by applying machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine, naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, and neural network, on survey data of households for best predicting the status. A food analysis (FA) app has been developed to automatically predict the FAO status of a household’s food security by implementing the random forest model that found higher precision among algorithms. Additionally, the proposed mobile app will also be helpful for collecting the households’ data. Furthermore, the objective of the study was to enhance food security awareness among individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood analysis 3afood availability 3afood intake 3afood security 3ahousehold surveys 3aregression analysis 3asupport vector machines 3aPakistan 0aMachine learning 0aMobile app 0aHouseholders 0aSurvey 0aRandom forest1 aAhmed, Umar Ijaz1 aHashim, Sarfraz1 aHussain, Aamir1 aQadri, Salman1 aUllah, Sami1 aNawaz Shah, Ali1 aImran, Ali1 aAsghar, Attika0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.726-736dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1532-23867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2021.19197033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245011500171520140300286592002801689650002201717650001301739650001601752650002201768650001501790650002401805650001701829650001701846651001401863700002101877700002701898773016001925856007702085852000902162655001202171IND60790975420221119192227.0220826e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079097542DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi110804422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeevarethnam, Mathanraj 10aPrediction of Urban Sprawl by Integrating Socioeconomic Factors in the Batticaloa Municipal Council, Sri Lanka  aDue to extensive population growth, urbanization increases urban development and sprawl in the world’s cities. Urban sprawl is a socioeconomic phenomenon that has not extensively incorporated socioeconomic factors in the prediction of most of the urban sprawl models. This study aimed to predict the urban sprawl pattern in 2030 by integrating socioeconomic and biophysical factors. NDBI, Cramer’s V, logistic regression, and CA-Markov analyses were used to classify and predict built-up patterns. The built-up area is the dominant land use, which had a gradual growth from 1990 to 2020. A total of 20 socioeconomic and biophysical factors were identified as potentials in the municipality, affecting the urban sprawl. Policy regulation was the most attractive driver with a positive association, and land value had a high inverse association. Three prediction scenarios for urban sprawl were achieved for 2030. Higher sprawling growth is expected in scenario 3, compared with scenarios 1 and 2. Scenario 3 was simulated with biophysical and socioeconomic factors. This study aids in addressing urban sprawl at different spatial and temporal scales and helps urban planners and decision makers enhance the development strategies in the municipality. Predicted maps with different scenarios can support evaluating future sprawling growth and be used to develop sustainable planning for the city.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3aland values 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aspatial data 3aurbanization 3aSri Lanka1 aRusli, Noradila 1 aLing, Gabriel Hoh Teck0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi110804423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008900161300001600250520108700266592002801353650002101381650001501402650002201417650002401439650000901463650001201472650002501484650001101509650001701520653002401537653001901561653002801580653002901608653003001637700001701667700001801684700001901702773012101721856008201842852000901924655001201933IND60532975120221117162055.0160728e20140328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053297512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.02.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying10aConstruction and direct electrochemistry of orientation controlled laccase electrode  ap. 201-205.  aA laccase has multiple redox centres. Chemisorption of laccases on a gold electrode through a polypeptide tag introduced at the protein surface provides an isotropic orientation of laccases on the Au surface, which allows the orientation dependent study of the direct electrochemistry of laccase. In this paper, using genetic engineering technology, two forms of recombinant laccase which has Cys-6×His tag at the N or C terminus were generated. Via the Au-S linkage, the recombinant laccase was assembled orientationally on gold electrode. A direct electron transfer and a bioelectrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction were observed on the two orientation controlled laccase electrodes, but their electrochemical behaviors were found to be quite different. The orientation of laccase on the gold electrode affects both the electron transfer pathway and the electron transfer efficiency of O2 reduction. The present study is helpful not only to the in-depth understanding of the direct electrochemistry of laccase, but also to the development of laccase-based biofuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3agenetic engineering 3agold 3alaccase 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aoxygen 3apolypeptides 0aRecombinant laccase 0aGold electrode 0aOriented immobilization 0aDirect electron transfer 0aElectron transfer pathway1 aZhang, Jiwei1 aHuang, Xirong1 aWang, Tianhong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Mar. 28, v. 446 p.201-205dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.02.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03897naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245012900205300001600334506007600350520159000426592002802016506003702044650002602081650002102107650002602128650001702154650002602171650001302197650002302210650001502233650002202248650001302270650001002283650001502293650001802308650001302326650002102339650001402360650001902374650001602393653000802409653000902417653000702426653000802433653000802441653000802449653000802457653001002465653000702475653000802482653000802490653000802498653000702506653000902513653003302522653002302555653001502578653002702593653004102620700001802661700001902679700002402698700001902722700002402741700002102765700001702786700002602803700002202829700002902851773009702880856008102977852000903058655001203067IND60551127720221207104339.0161017e20140109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055112772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2013.09.0112doi7 aPMC38722092pmcid7 a240514162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qingping10aStructures of a Bifunctional Cell Wall Hydrolase CwlT Containing a Novel Bacterial Lysozyme and an NlpC/P60 dl-Endopeptidase  ap. 169-184.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTn916-like conjugative transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes are found in a diverse range of bacteria. Orf14 within the conjugation module encodes a bifunctional cell wall hydrolase CwlT that consists of an N-terminal bacterial lysozyme domain (N-acetylmuramidase, bLysG) and a C-terminal NlpC/P60 domain (γ-d-glutamyl-l-diamino acid endopeptidase) and is expected to play an important role in the spread of the transposons. We determined the crystal structures of CwlT from two pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus Mu50 (SaCwlT) and Clostridium difficile 630 (CdCwlT). These structures reveal that NlpC/P60 and LysG domains are compact and conserved modules, connected by a short flexible linker. The LysG domain represents a novel family of widely distributed bacterial lysozymes. The overall structure and the active site of bLysG bear significant similarity to other members of the glycoside hydrolase family 23 (GH23), such as the g-type lysozyme (LysG) and Escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase MltE. The active site of bLysG contains a unique structural and sequence signature (DxxQSSES+S) that is important for coordinating a catalytic water. Molecular modeling suggests that the bLysG domain may recognize glycan in a similar manner to MltE. The C-terminal NlpC/P60 domain contains a conserved active site (Cys-His-His-Tyr) that appears to be specific to murein tetrapeptide. Access to the active site is likely regulated by isomerism of a side chain atop the catalytic cysteine, allowing substrate entry or product release (open state), or catalysis (closed state).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium difficile 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aactive sites 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3acatalytic activity 3acell walls 3acrystal structure 3acysteine 3agenes 3aglycosides 3aisomerization 3alysozyme 3amolecular models 3apathogens 3apeptidoglycans 3atransposons 0aasu 0aJCSG 0aLT 0aMGE 0aNAG 0aNAM 0aNIH 0aNIGMS 0aMR 0aMAD 0aPSI 0aTEV 0aMD 0aSSRL 0abifunctional cell wall lysin 0abacterial lysozyme 0amuramidase 0aNlpC/P60 endopeptidase 0aTn916 family conjugative transposons1 aChiu, Hsiu-Ju1 aFarr, Carol L.1 aJaroszewski, Lukasz1 aKnuth, Mark W.1 aMiller, Mitchell D.1 aLesley, Scott A.1 aGodzik, Adam1 aElsliger, Marc-André1 aDeacon, Ashley M.1 aWilson, I.

Direct observations of specific resource use by each species in single‐ and multispecies communities, as quantified by stable isotopes, facilitates a mechanistic understanding of the importance of each species for ecosystem functioning. We tested the effects of altered biodiversity (species richness) of deposit‐feeding macrofauna on incorporation and burial of phytodetritus in combinations of three species representing natural communities found in the sediments of the species‐poor Baltic Sea. The three species, two amphipods and a bivalve, had different rates of incorporation and burial and different needs for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The amphipods exhibited clear resource partitioning in sympatry, as a result of vertical separation in the sediment and consequent differential use of food. Communities of several species incorporated more C and N than expected from the respective single‐species treatments, due to higher incorporation by surface feeders in multispecies treatments. Community incorporation of N in the most diverse treatment even exceeded N incorporation by a single‐species treatment of the best‐performing species, showing transgressive over‐yielding. This over‐yielding was primarily due to positive complementarity in all treatments. Diverse soft bottoms are also likely to be more productive in the long run, as species‐specific traits (subsurface feeding) preserve fresh phytodetritus by burying it to depths in the sediment at which the mineralization rate is low. The more diverse sediment communities showed more efficient trophic transfer of phytodetritus, a finding of general significance for understanding biological processes driving the transformation of nutrients and energy in benthic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3abenthic organisms 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3afauna 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3astable isotopes 3asympatry 3aBaltic Sea1 aNascimento, Francisco J.

Recent studies have shown that the inclusion of a first-order reaction term in numerical transport models results in complex numerical calculation errors in both convection and dispersion and even in the reaction rate itself. This suggests the need for very small time increments to ensure sufficient accuracy. However, in the case of diffusion-reaction, and using a comprehensive Taylor expansion analysis, we show that the first-order errors (errors in reaction) and second-order errors (errors in diffusion) in an explicit finite difference calculation scheme reduce to simple functions of only two parameters, the time increment and the first-order reaction rate coefficient. Based on this, we present a Diffusion And Reaction Corrected (DARC) calculation scheme that allows for rapid and accurate solution of simultaneous one-dimensional diffusion and first-order reaction in the soil gaseous or liquid phases. A general criterion for ensuring numerical stability when using the DARC scheme is derived. Tests against analytical solutions and data for methane consumption in intact soil columns show that the DARC scheme allows for the use of much larger time increments compared with the traditionally used non-corrected scheme without significant loss of accuracy. The combined procedure for deriving terms for correction of numerical errors and criteria for avoiding numerical instability seems useful for better controlling numerical errors in simulation models for transport and transformations.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3asorption 3adiffusivity 3asoil 3adiffusion 3akinetics 3adegradation 3aaccuracy 3abiogeochemical cycles 0amathematical models1 aKruse, C.

Therefore, increasing the stability of W/O microemulsions is necessary to broaden their applications. In our experiment, a protein microemulsion system was constructed and its stability was investigated. The effects of surfactants, co-surfactants, quality ratio of them (Km) and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values were determined by using the pseudo-ternary phase diagrams and the area of microemulsions (MEs) as the indexes. The results showed that MEs’ stability was the best when the limonene was used as oil phase, Tween 20 + span 80 as the surfactant, and anhydrous alcohol as co-surfactant, if and only if HLB = 6.0 and Km = 3:1. Under this condition, the area of micro-emulsion was the largest, and the quality of microemulsion was better when the mass ratio of oil phase and emulsifier was 7:5.The protein microemulsion was a water-in-oil type, with a particle size of 1.41 ± 0.03 μm, containing 1127.37 ± 30.87 μg/g of proteins. Moreover, the temperature, light, and sample observation tests showed that the solution’s protein retention rate was lower than those in the microemulsion. Low-concentration NaCl, less than 9% of glucose and maltose exerted no significant influence on the protein microemulsion stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesmodium intortum 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3aglucose 3alimonene 3alipids 3amaltose 3aoils 3aparticle size 3apolysorbates 3asolubility 3asurfactants 3atemperature 0aDesmodium intortum protein 0amicroemulsion 0aPseudo-ternary phase diagram1 aLiu, Pan-Dao1 aYan, Lin-Ling1 aChen, Zhi-Jian1 aHuan, Heng-Fu1 aLi, Xin-Yong1 aDong, Rong-Shu1 aChen, Jian0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.764-779dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1532-23867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2021.19247773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245016200155300001800317520120700335592002801542650001901570650001701589650002601606650002301632650001501655650001401670650001801684650002001702653003401722653001401756653002801770653001001798700002201808773012201830856007101952852000902023655001202032IND60718750420221122151853.0201125s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071875042DNAL7 a10.1071/MF193582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Bum Soo14aThe potential impact of bacterial communities exposed to crude oil and light on the growth of the harmful algal blooming species Karenia brevis (Dinophyceae)  ap. 1714-1718.  aPhytoplankton blooms have been occasionally observed to occur after oil spills, and changes in bacterial communities (BC) associated with phytoplankton are known to affect phytoplankton growth. In the present study, to examine the effects of BC exposed to crude oil on phytoplankton blooms, established free-living (FL) BC in Karenia brevis (Dinophyceae) culture were collected and then exposed to crude oil under light or dark conditions. These exposed FL BC were then added to K. brevis culture to investigate the effects on growth rate of this dinoflagellate. Enhanced growth of K. brevis was observed following addition of FL (24.7%) BC exposed to crude oil and light. Whereas BC grown with crude oil in the dark did not enhance growth, and BC without treatment showed a slight growth inhibition (13–15%) of K. brevis. In addition, the growth-promoting effect had a positive correlation with the inoculated bacterial density; the treatment with a higher (~1.5 times) density of FL (42.9%) BC that were exposed to crude oil and light showed an increase in the growth-promoting effect. Taken together, BC exposed to crude oil and light may play an important role in enhancement of K. brevis growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKarenia brevis 3aalgal blooms 3abacterial communities 3agrowth retardation 3aoil spills 3apetroleum 3aphytoplankton 3apoisonous algae 0abacterial community structure 0acrude oil 0agrowth-promoting effect 0alight1 aBuskey, Edward J.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2020, v. 71, no. 12 p.1714-1718dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957320x1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF193583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245009900162300001600261520145400277592002801731650001901759650001501778650002101793650002001814650002901834650001201863650003101875650003101906650001101937650001401948650001501962650001501977650001401992650001202006650001002018653001702028653001802045653002902063653002502092653002202117700002902139700001802168700001702186700002002203773010302223856008102326852000902407655001202416IND4460124020221119171458.0151127e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446012402DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-10-00148.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasin, Roberta12aA Single-Time Survey Method to Predict the Daily Weed Density for Weed Control Decision-Making  ap. 270-275.  aDecision-making processes must indicate if, how, and when weed control should be practiced. So far, Decision Support Systems (DSSs) for weed control to prevent crop yield losses can guide decisions on ““if”” and ““how.”” Experience shows that farmers need a DSS that can also guide when to treat, but this can only be done if the actual weed density observed in the field is known during the crop cycle. Emergence models allow the prediction of daily density, but precision depends on the survey date. This study focuses on the estimation of the date of the survey for the best prediction of the daily density throughout the crop cycle. The predicted daily density of each species can be used by DSSs without any further survey, saving time and money and improving the use of the DSSs. Results showed that the best date is when the actual density of each weed reaches or exceeds 50%% emergence, and this is earlier than the critical point date, supporting the validity of the date estimation method. The possibility to provide specific advice for farmers considering a proper mortality rate of weed seedlings is then discussed. The ability to optimize the date of sampling can improve the reliability of decision-making tools for integrated weed management, in agreement with the European Union goal of sustainable use of pesticides and more environmentally sustainable cropping systems through the use of integrated pest management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3afarmers 3aintegrated pest management 3aintegrated weed management 3amodels 3amortality 3apesticides 3aprediction 3aseedlings 3asurveys 3aweeds 0aWeed density 0aweed sampling 0aDecision Support Systems 0aemergence prediction 0ahydrothermal time1 aVasileiadis, Vasileios P1 aLoddo, Donato1 aOtto, Stefan1 aZanin, Giuseppe0 tWeed science.g2011 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.270-275dWeed Science Society of Americax0043-17457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWS-D-10-00148.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01878naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011900168300002000287520081200307592002801119650002501147650001901172650001101191650002301202650001501225650002501240700002001265700002601285700002101311773012901332856008201461852000901543655001201552IND60585087620221117072903.0171102e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058508762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b075852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsyshevsky, Roman10aComprehensive End-to-End Design of Novel High Energy Density Materials: II.

Multiscale computational modeling that combines first-principles calculations, analytical theory, and empirical statistical analysis served to further advance the proposed methodology. The established materials design guiding principles led to development of a set of new energetic molecules, PHE-1, PHE-2, and PHE-3, that represent improved variations of the heterocyclic energetics and are predicted to be superior to the existing conventional energetic materials. Molecular mechanisms of the enhanced performance and sensitivity of the proposed energetic materials as a function of their chemical composition and structure are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aenergy density 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis1 aPagoria, Philip1 aSmirnov, Aleksandr S.1 aKuklja, Maija M.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Nov. 02, v. 121, no. 43 p.23865-23874dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b075853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01730naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002600149245007900175300001600254520078600270592002801056650001301084650001701097650001001114650001001124650002201134650001101156650001601167700002301183700002101206773008301227856008501310852000901395655001201404IND4468975920221119150815.0141111e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446897592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2011.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeane, Christopher R.10aAltruism, reciprocity and health: A social experiment in restaurant choice  ap. 143-150.  aWe used an experimental game to determine whether people imitate restaurant choice, reciprocate food gifts, and thus spread health choices. We randomly paired 138 subjects and recorded their decision to give or keep restaurant vouchers and their choice of restaurant. The majority (83.3%) chose an unhealthy restaurant if their randomly assigned partner chose an unhealthy restaurant. Similarly, 77.8% chose a healthy restaurant if their partner did (p=0.005). The altruistic were more likely to choose a healthy restaurant (p=0.017). In sum, restaurant choice is influenced by reciprocity. A cycle of projection, gifting and reciprocation may explain the social dynamics of food choice.

But it is not the first time this infectious viral disease has appeared, in 2002 SARS-CoV infected more than 8000 individuals of which 9.6% patients died and in 2012 approximately 35% of MERS-CoV infected patients have died. Literature reports indicate that a chymotripsin-like cystein protease (3CLᵖʳᵒ) is responsible for the replication of the virus inside the host cell. Therefore, design and synthesis of 3CLᵖʳᵒ inhibitor molecules play a great impact in drug development against this COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we are discussing the anti-SARS effect of some small molecule 3CLᵖʳᵒ inhibitors with their various binding modes of interactions to the target protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronavirus infections 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3aWorld Health Organization 3adesign 3adrug development 3ainfection 3aliterature 3amortality 3apandemic 3apatients 3apeople 3aproteinases 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asynthesis 3aviruses 3aChina 0a3CLpro 0aInhibitors 0aSARS-CoV 0aSARS-CoV-21 aSarma, Diganta0 tTetrahedron.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 77 p.131761-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2020.1317613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04990naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013900163506010400302506007600406520295700482592002803439506003703467650001303504650001503517650001203532650001003544650001603554650001003570650001303580650003903593650001303632650001603645650001503661650001503676653002103691653002903712653004103741653002003782700001803802700002003820700001903840700001903859700002203878700002103900700001603921700002703937700001903964700002103983700002604004700002204030700001804052700001904070700002204089700002104111700001804132773011104150856008204261852000904343655001204352IND60781347620221207120112.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078134762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2022.1131422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Cheng10aProperties of aerosol and surface derived from OLCI/Sentinel-3A using GRASP approach: Retrieval development and preliminary validation  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3A satellite is a medium-resolution and multi-spectral push-broom imager acquiring radiance in 21 spectral bands covering from the visible to the far near-infrared. These measurements are primary dedicated to land & ocean color applications, but actually include also reliable information for atmospheric aerosol and surface brightness characterization. In the framework of the EUMETSAT funded study to support the Copernicus Program, we describe the retrieval of aerosol and surface properties from OLCI single-viewing multi-spectral Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiances based on the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. The high potential of the OLCI/GRASP configuration stems from the attempt to retrieve both aerosol load and surface reflectance simultaneously using a globally consistent high-level approach. For example, both over land and ocean surfaces OLCI/GRASP uses 9 spectral channels (albeit with different weights), strictly the same prescribed aerosol models and globally the same a priori constraints (though with some differences for observations over land and ocean). Due to the lack of angular multi-viewing information, the directional properties of underlying surface are strongly constrained in the retrieval: over ocean the Fresnel reflection together with foam/whitecap albedo are exclusively computed using a priori wind speed; over land, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is slightly adjusted from a priori values of climatological Ross-Li volumetric and geometric terms. Meanwhile, the isotropic reflectance is retrieved globally under mild spectral smoothness constraints. It should be noticed that OLCI/GRASP configuration employs innovative multi-pixel concept (Dubovik et al., 2011) that enhance retrieval by simultaneously inverting large group of pixels. The concept allows for benefiting from knowledge about natural variability of the retrieved parameters. The obtained OLCI/GRASP products were validated with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) and intercompared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol and surface products. The overall performance is quite comparable to the community-referenced MODIS. Over ocean the OLCI/GRASP results are encouraging with 67% of the AOD (550 nm) satisfying the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirement using AERONET coastal sites and 74% using MAN deep ocean measurements, and an AOD (550 nm) bias 0.01 with AERONET and nearly zero bias with MAN. Over land, 48% of OLCI/GRASP AOD (550 nm) satisfy the GCOS requirement and a bias within ±0.01 for total and AOD < 0.2. Key challenges are identified and discussed: adequate screening of cloud contaminations, retrieval of aerosol over bright surfaces and in the regions containing complex mixtures of aerosol.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3aclimate 3acolor 3aenvironment 3afoams 3ageometry 3agovernmental programs and projects 3aisotropy 3areflectance 3asatellites 3awind speed 0aOLCI/Sentinel-3A 0aSatellite remote sensing 0aAerosol and surface characterization 0aGRASP algorithm1 aDubovik, Oleg1 aLitvinov, Pavel1 aFuertes, David1 aLopatin, Anton1 aLapyonok, Tatyana1 aMatar, Christian1 aKarol, Yana1 aFischer, Jürgen,cMD,1 aPreusker, Rene1 aHangler, Andreas1 aAspetsberger, Michael1 aBindreiter, Lukas1 aMarth, Daniel1 aChimot, Julien1 aFougnie, Bertrand1 aMarbach, Thierry1 aBojkov, Bojan0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2022 Oct., v. 280 p.113142-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.1131423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006600160500001900226520119300245592002801438650002601466650001801492650001701510650001801527650001201545650001401557650001501571650001701586700002601603700002201629700002201651700002601673700001901699700002601718700002501744700002601769773012601795856007401921852000901995655001202004IND60735178720221120182239.0210423e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073517872DNAL7 a10.3390/md190401792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Amy  E.10aAntiplasmodial Compounds from Deep-Water Marine Invertebrates  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNovel drug leads for malaria therapy are urgently needed because of the widespread emergence of resistance to all available drugs. Screening of the Harbor Branch enriched fraction library against the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistant strain (Dd2) followed by bioassay-guided fractionation led to the identification of two potent antiplasmodials; a novel diterpene designated as bebrycin A (1) and the known C21 degraded terpene nitenin (2). A SYBR Green I assay was used to establish a Dd2 EC₅₀ of 1.08 ± 0.21 and 0.29 ± 0.02 µM for bebrycin A and nitenin, respectively. Further analysis was then performed to assess the stage specificity of the inhibitors antiplasmodial effects on the Dd2 intraerythrocytic life cycle. Exposure to bebrycin A was found to block parasite maturation at the schizont stage if added any time prior to late schizogony at 42 hours post invasion, (HPI). In contrast, early life cycle exposure to nitenin (prior to 18 HPI) was identified as crucial to parasite inhibition, suggesting nitenin may target the maturation of the parasite during the transition from ring to early trophozoite (6–18 HPI), a novel property among known antimalarials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantimalarials 3aditerpenoids 3afractionation 3amalaria 3aparasites 3aschizogony 3atherapeutics1 aCollins, Jennifer  E.1 aRoberts, Bracken 1 aRoberts, Jill  C.1 aWinder, Priscilla  L.1 aReed, John K.,1 aDiaz, Maria  Cristina1 aPomponi, Shirley  A.1 aChakrabarti, Debopam 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 19, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190401793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010800159300002000267520114200287592002801429650001401457650001501471650002401486650003101510650002901541650002101570650001101591650001301602650001301615650001201628650001301640650002201653650001601675700002001691700002901711700002601740773012501766856007401891852000901965655001201974IND60700541920221122165332.0200701e20200623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070054192DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra03938a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Y.

GQDs are endowed with the properties of both carbon dots (CDs) and graphene. This review addresses applications of GQD based materials in sensing, bioimaging and energy storage. In the first part of the review, different approaches of GQD synthesis such as top-down and bottom-up synthesis methods have been discussed. The prime focus of this review is on green synthesis methods that have also been applied to the synthesis of GQDs. The GQDs have been discussed thoroughly for all the aspects along with their potential applications in sensors, biomedicine, and energy storage systems. In particular, emphasis is given to popular applications such as electrochemical and photoluminescence (PL) sensors, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensors, humidity and gas sensors, bioimaging, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, supercapacitors and dye-sensitized solar cells. Finally, the challenges and the future perspectives of GQDs in the aforementioned application fields have been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3abioimaging 3acarbon quantum dots 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ahumidity 3alithium 3amedicine 3aphotoluminescence 3asolar cells1 aDeshmukh, Kalim1 aSadasivuni, Kishor Kumar1 aPasha, S.

I.10aHigh cell density fed-batch fermentations for lipase production: feeding strategies and oxygen transfer  ap. 1527-1543.  aThis review is focused on the production of microbial lipases by high cell density fermentation. Lipases are among the most widely used of the enzyme catalysts. Although lipases are produced by animals and plants, industrial lipases are sourced almost exclusively from microorganisms. Many of the commercial lipases are produced using recombinant species. Microbial lipases are mostly produced by batch and fed-batch fermentation. Lipases are generally secreted by the cell into the extracellular environment. Thus, a crude preparation of lipases can be obtained by removing the microbial cells from the fermentation broth. This crude cell-free broth may be further concentrated and used as is, or lipases may be purified from it to various levels. For many large volume applications, lipases must be produced at extremely low cost. High cell density fermentation is a promising method for low-cost production: it allows a high concentration of the biomass and the enzyme to be attained rapidly and this eases the downstream recovery of the enzyme. High density fermentation enhances enzyme productivity compared with the traditional submerged culture batch fermentation. In production of enzymes, a high cell density is generally achieved through fed-batch operation, not through perfusion culture which is cumbersome. The feeding strategies used in fed-batch fermentations for producing lipases and the implications of these strategies are discussed. Most lipase-producing microbial fermentations require oxygen. Oxygen transfer in such fermentations is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abatch fermentation 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3aculture media 3afeeding methods 3amicroorganisms 3aoxygen 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aAnnuar, M.

However, for industrial applications of P. phenolica further research is required to explore the biological mechanism for maximizing the activities and productivities of this bacterium. In this study, we investigated the osmotic stress resistance and specific protease activities of P. phenolica in a normal-salt medium (0.3 M NaCl) and high-salt medium (1 M NaCl) based on intra- and extracellular multi-omics approaches. Proteins related to betaine and proline biosynthesis were increased under high salt stress. The targeted metabolite analysis found that proline was overproduced and accumulated outside the cell at high salinity, and betaine was accumulated in the cell by activation of biosynthesis as well as uptake. In addition, extracellular serine proteases were shown to be upregulated in response to salt stress by the extracellular proteomic analysis. The specific proteolytic activity assay indicated that the activities of serine proteases, useful enzymes for the recycling of organic wastes, were increased remarkably under high salt stress. Our results suggest that betaine and proline are key osmoprotectant metabolites of P. phenolica, and they can be used for the improvement of protease production and P. phenolica activities for the recycling of high-salt organic wastes in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudoalteromonas 3abacteria 3abetaine 3abiosynthesis 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3aindustrial applications 3ametabolites 3amultiomics 3aorganic wastes 3aosmotic stress 3aosmotolerance 3aproline 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3arecycling 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aserine proteinases 3asodium chloride 3astress tolerance1 aKim, Seong-Min1 aJo, Sung-Hyun1 aLee, Jae-Seung1 aJeon, Hyo-Jin1 aKo, Byoung Joon1 aChoi, Kwon-Young1 aYang, Yung-Hun1 aKim, Yun-gon,0 tRSC advances.g2020 June 23, v. 10, no. 40 p.23792-23800dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra04034g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245016700161300001600328520182100344592002802165650002402193650002802217650002202245650002002267650001002287650004302297650002202340650001602362650001502378650001702393650001302410650002202423650001002445650001102455650002002466650004402486650003702530653001702567653001302584653001402597653002202611653001502633653002902648700002302677700002002700700002702720700002102747700002302768700002702791773010702818856007402925852000902999655001203008IND60133466220221123021008.0190415e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013346622DNAL7 a10.1093/mp/sst1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaparre, Jérôme10aCombining Metabolomics and Gene Expression Analysis Reveals that Propionyl- and Butyryl-Carnitines Are Involved in Late Stages of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis  ap. 554-566.  aThe arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is a widespread mutualistic association between soil fungi (Glomeromycota) and the roots of most plant species. AM fungi are obligate biotrophs whose development is partially under the control of their plant host. We explored the possibility to combine metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches to find putative mycorrhiza-associated metabolites regulating AM fungal development. Methanol extracts of Medicago truncatula roots colonized or not with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis were analyzed and compared by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC), high-resolution mass spectrometry (Q-TOF), and multivariate statistical discrimination. We detected 71 mycorrhiza-associated analytes exclusively present or at least 10-fold more abundant in mycorrhizal roots. To identify among these analytes those that could regulate AM fungal development, we fractionated by preparative and semi-preparative HPLC the mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal root extracts and established how the 71 analytes were distributed among the fractions. Then we tested the activity of the fractions on germinating spores of R. irregularis by quantifying the expression of 96 genes known for their diverse in planta expression patterns. These investigations reveal that propionyl- and butyryl-carnitines accumulated in mycorrhizal roots. The results suggest that these two molecules regulate fungal gene expression in planta and represent interesting candidates for further biological characterization.By comparing the metabolomes of roots colonized or not by an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, 71 mycorrhiza-associated analytes were identified. Among them, propionyl- and butyryl-carnitines were found to be active molecules potentially able to modify fungal gene expression in planta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago truncatula 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3achemical elements 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amethanol 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aroots 3aspores 3atranscriptomics 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0ametabolomics 0aAM fungi 0asymbiosis 0aplant metabolites 0acarnitines 0atranscriptomic screening1 aMalbreil, Mathilde1 aLetisse, Fabien1 aPortais, Jean-Charles,1 aRoux, Christophe1 aBécard, Guillaume1 aPuech-Pagès, Virginie0 tMolecular plant.g2014 Mar., v. 7, no. 3 p.554-566dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mp/sst1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156300002000271520114900291592002801440650002901468650001101497650002601508650001401534650001401548650001601562650001501578700001501593700002601608700001801634700001701652700001301669773012501682856007401807852000901881655001201890IND60700542220221122063257.0200701e20200622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070054222DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra04058d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Runze10aWavelength modulation of ZnO nanowire based organic light-emitting diodes with ultraviolet electroluminescence  ap. 23775-23781.  aAlthough organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) can find important applications in display-related fields, it still remains a challenge to fabricate high-efficiency ultraviolet (UV) OLEDs with tunable wavelength. In this work, we demonstrate a facile method to adjust the electroluminescence (EL) peak from an inverted UV-OLED device that has zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs) as an electron injection layer. The organic–inorganic interface between ZnO NWs and the 3-(4-biphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-tert-butylphenyl-1,2,4-triazole (TAZ) emission layer employed in this work allows a reduction of the diffusion length of excitons, which further results in a hampered relaxation process of higher energy states as well as a blue shift of the EL spectrum. As a result, the emission peaks of the UV-OLED can be easily adjusted from 383 nm to 374 nm by tuning both the length of the ZnO NWs and the thickness of the TAZ emission layer. Our work reveals an important correlation between emission peaks and exciton diffusion, and presents a novel approach to fabricate high-performance UV-OLEDs with the capability of facilely modifying the emission wavelength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aenergy 3alight emitting diodes 3ananowires 3atriazoles 3awavelengths 3azinc oxide1 aLiu, Chuan1 aAsare-Yeboah, Kyeiwaa1 aZhang, Ziyang1 aHe, Zhengran1 aLiu, Yun0 tRSC advances.g2020 June 22, v. 10, no. 40 p.23775-23781dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra04058d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013800163300001600301520134600317592002801663650001301691650002101704650001801725650001101743650001901754650001301773650001901786650001401805650002201819650001101841650001401852650001101866653002501877653003201902653002401934653002201958700001901980700001801999700001702017700001702034700001802051700001302069700001802082700005302100773008802153856008502241852000902326655001202335IND60644075520221118150357.0190628e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064407552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Peng10aAdvanced Graphene@Sulfur composites via an in-situ reduction and wrapping strategy for high energy density lithium–sulfur batteries  ap. 224-232.  aGraphene/sulfur composite has been extensively studied for sulfur cathodes. However, a rapid and scalable fabrication of sulfur/graphene composite with advanced structures and functions is still a big challenge. Here, we report a unique solution-based strategy to simultaneously realize the reduction of graphene oxide (GO), the synthesis of elemental sulfur (S) and the effective packaging of S. In this strategy, the S firstly reacts with hydrazine hydrate and N, N-Dimethylformamide mixture, which generates a reductive sulfur-containing compound. When mixing this reductive sulfur-containing compound with GO dispersion, GO will be reduced and the reductive sulfur-containing compound will be oxidized to generate S. At the same time S will be well encapsulated inside highly wrinkled graphene layers because of the great interaction between graphene and sulfur through this method. Benefited from the unique packaging structures, the sulfur cathode demonstrates superior electrochemical performance in specific capacity, rate capability and cycling stability. A record high specific capacity of 705 mA h/g is realized at 2C even for a thick sulfur cathode with an areal density of 8.1 mg cm−2. This study brings a facile strategy for the fabrication of advanced sulfur/graphene composites with high energy and power densities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrazine 3alithium batteries 3amixing 3aoxidation 3asulfur 0arGO/sulfur composite 0aIn-situ chemical deposition 0aConductive wrapping 0aIn-situ reduction1 aXiao, Zhi-Chao1 aWang, Qian-Yu1 aPei, Jing-Ke1 aNiu, Yan-Hua1 aBao, Rui-Ying1 aWang, Yu1 aYang, Ming-Bo1 aYang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0198-16320 tCarbon.g2019 Sept., v. 150 p.224-232dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015300166300001600319520166600335592002802001650002402029650002402053650002102077650001202098650001402110650002202124650003202146650000902178650001002187650001102197650001902208650001902227650001202246650002302258650001802281650001902299650001902318650002902337650001802366650001602384653002002400653000902420653001102429653001702440700002002457700003102477700002902508700002002537700002102557700002902578773009702607856008502704852000902789655001202798IND60686678620221120084844.0200412e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068667862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Lanlan10aPhoto-catalytic pretreatment of biomass for anaerobic digestion using visible light and Nickle oxide (NiOx) nanoparticles prepared by sol gel method  ap. 128-135.  aThe biodegradability of lignocellulosic biomass in anaerobic digesters is the key factor that limits the biogas production. Therefore, scientists are finding the possible ways to reduce the recalcitrant lignin content of biomass that greatly hinder the digestion process. The Photo-oxidation considered advanced oxidation of organic polymers in the presence of optically active catalyst preferably metal oxide. Hence, the present study was designed to report the effects of NiOₓ along with visible light (350–780 nm) to oxidize the highly lignified wheat straw (WS). Specifically, the experiment was designed to pretreat WS with four different NiOₓ concentrations under three different exposure times. Consequently, the differentially pretreated samples were subjected to biochemical methane potentials (BMPs) and continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). Further, the pretreatment with 3 wt% NiOₓ at 4 h light exposure showed 40% (p < 0.05) increase in methane yield during BMP assays and 30% in CSTRs. In addition, the products of lignin oxidation were also quantified as vanillic acid and benzoic were found to be markedly higher (2.6 ± 0.0 mg/gVS and 0.92 ± 0.06 mg/gVS respectively) in the maximum pretreated sample that produced. Moreover, the pretreatment with visible light using NiOₓ nanoparticles was confirmed and it was concluded that light or NiOₓ alone posed no significant pretreatment of WS. Moreover, the products of lignin oxidation did not halt the efficacy of BMP assays as well as CSTRs. For economical balance the substrate breakpoint was estimated to be 4.53 g per treatment for positive efficacy of the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3aexposure duration 3agas production (biological) 3agels 3alight 3alignin 3alignin content 3alignocellulose 3amethane 3amethane production 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotooxidation 3arenewable energy sources 3avanillic acid 3awheat straw 0aPhoto oxidation 0aNiOx 0aBiogas 0aPretreatment1 aAwais, Muhammad1 aJaved, Hafiz Muhammad Asif1 aMustafa, Muhammad Salman1 aTlili, Iskander1 aKhan, Sami Ullah1 aSafdari Shadloo, Mostafa0 tRenewable energy.g2020 July, v. 154 p.128-135dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010000167300001400267506010400281506007600385520167000461592002802131506003702159650001302196650001602209650001102225650001402236650001802250650001202268650001402280650002102294650002402315650001402339650002602353650001302379650001702392650001602409650002402425650001402449653002002463653001402483653001702497700002502514700002602539773011202565856008302677852000902760655001202769IND60781347920221207120116.0220726e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078134792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorelli, Elena10aAssociations between putative risk factors and poor colostrum yield in Holstein Friesian cattle  ap. 74-81.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhen dairy cows produce little or no colostrum, calves are likely to suffer from failure of passive transfer (FPT). Volume of colostrum produced by the dam may be affected by: nutrition; environmental conditions; time from calving to milking; parity; dry period length; calving difficulty; calf weight; calf sex; calf viability; cow BCS / body weight; milk production in previous lactation and dam health. While risk factors for poor IgG concentration in colostrum have been extensively studied, there is little published literature on low colostrum yields and associated risk factors. The aim of this observational study was to identify risk factors for poor colostrum yield in dairy cows and to quantify the effect of variation in those variables that the farmer can directly control (length of dry period, and close-up transition period nutrition) using inverse probability modelling. 439 animals from a single Scottish dairy farm were used as a convenience sample. First milking colostrum yield was measured by farmers using a graduated bucket. For each animal, risk factor data and meteorological data from the nearest weather were obtained. Decreased colostrum yield was associated with increasing daily temperature range, while increasing UV index, lactation number and number of days dry increased colostrum yield. Marginal effect models revealed that for each additional day of dry period, colostrum yield increased. Higher UV indices the month before calving were positively associated with colostrum yield, particularly in primiparous cows, and higher temperatures in the months before calving were positively associated with colostrum yield in all cows.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3abody weight 3acalves 3acolostrum 3adairy farming 3afarmers 3alactation 3alactation number 3ameteorological data 3anutrition 3aobservational studies 3aresearch 3arisk factors 3atemperature 3aveterinary medicine 3aviability 0aColostrum yield 0aDairy cow 0aRisk factors1 aJonsson, Nicholas N.1 aDenholm, Katharine S.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2022 Dec., v. 149 p.74-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005100150245010500201500001400306520054800320592002800868650002200896650001300918650001600931650004400947650002300991650001501014650001401029653001501043653001801058653002101076700001701097700001601114700005401130700005401184773011001238856008501348852000901433655001201442IND60718466220221117222625.0201202e20201217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071846622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1526072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2197-899110aRegioisomeric α-[70]fullerene-fused lactones: Synthesis, characterization and solubility difference  aNAL-light  aTwo types of regioisomeric α-[70]fullerene-fused lactones were synthesized from the reaction of C₇₀ with 2-alkylmalonates under basic conditions.

Composite soil samples were taken from soil bunds with desho grass and soil bunds only at three landscape positions with three replications, whereas 117 respondents were identified using simple random sampling. The result revealed that the clay, soil moisture content, soil pH, OC, TN, Av.P, and CEC were higher in soil bund with desho grass as compared to adjacent soil bund only, whereas, bulk density, silt, and sand contents were higher in adjacent soil bund only compared to soil bund with desho grass. About 83.5% of the respondents were users of soil and water conservation measures and among them, 40.19% perceived that soil bund with desho grass has an effect on soil properties, while 25.35% perceived that soil bund only had better soil and water conservation practices. Respondents’ years of experience, education level, and access to soil and water conservation extension services significantly (p≤0.1) affected their perception of the use of soil bunds with desho grass. Therefore, soil bund with desho grass at appropriate landscape positions by considering farmer perception improves the soil’s physicochemical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3abunds 3aclay 3aeducational status 3afarmers' attitudes 3agrasses 3alandscapes 3asand 3asilt 3asoil pH 3asoil water content 3asubwatersheds 3awater conservation 3aEthiopia1 aDoboch, Dinsa0 tApplied and environmental soil science.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:jnl4582843x1687-76757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/92956503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011100177300001500288520133900303592002801642650001501670650001501685650001401700650001401714650001901728650002201747650001601769650001501785650002401800650001501824650001701839650001701856650002301873650001601896653003001912653003001942653002401972653002501996653002202021700002102043700003202064700002802096700002102124700002402145700001502169700002802184700001902212773009602231856008502327852000902412655001202421IND60686678720221120084840.0200412e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068667872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiddyaningsih, Liangna10aFeasibility study of nanocrystalline cellulose as adsorbent of steryl glucosides from palm-based biodiesel  ap. 99-106.  aIncreasing the content of biodiesel in the diesel fuel mixture faces some challenges due to the presence of steryl glucosides (SG) compounds, which causes the filter clogging and the reduction of engine power. In this study, coarse filter paper-based nanocrystalline cellulose (CFP-based NCC) with the crystallinity of 85.73% is selected as a potential adsorbent to separate SG compounds in palm-based biodiesel (PO–B100). The adsorption experiments were carried out at various CFP-based NCC to PO-B100 mass ratio (1:50, 1:75, 1:100, 1:125, 1:150, 1:175, 1:200) and temperature (65, 75, 85 °C). The maximum SG removal was 91.81%, obtained at 75 °C for CFP-based NCC to PO-B100 mass ratio of 1:50. The adsorption treatment also improves the cold stability of PO-B100 by reducing the cloud point from 13.2 °C to 11.5 °C. Langmuir isotherm model is best-fitted to the equilibrium adsorption data and thermodynamic studies suggested that the adsorption of SG onto the CFP-based NCC surface is spontaneous and endothermic. The isotherm and thermodynamic study showed that the mechanism governing the adsorption process may be driven by both dipole-dipole interactions and ion exchange. The adsorption results showed that CFP-based NCC has great affinity and selectivity to SG and can be considered as a promising adsorbent of SG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiodiesel 3acellulose 3acold stability 3acrystal structure 3adiesel fuel 3aendothermy 3afeasibility studies 3aglucosides 3aion exchange 3ananocrystals 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 0aSteryl glucosides removal 0aNanocrystalline cellulose 0aAdsorption isotherm 0aAdsorption mechanism 0aFeasibility study1 aSetiawan, Albert1 aSantoso, Shella Permatasari1 aSoetaredjo, Felycia Edi1 aIsmadji, Suryadi1 aHartono, Sandy Budi1 aJu, Yi-Hsu1 aTran-Nguyen, Phuong Lan1 aYuliana, Maria0 tRenewable energy.g2020 July, v. 154 p.99-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245012400177300001800301520105700319592002801376650001401404650002101418650001001439650001701449650002501466650001201491650001401503650000901517650001801526650002301544653002201567653004601589653003001635653004501665700002701710700002101737700001801758700002301776700002401799700002301823700002301846773010101869856009001970852000902060655001202069IND60599676320221119054316.0180702e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059967632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.10.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaiguera, Silvia10aElectrospun gelatin scaffolds incorporating rat decellularized brain extracellular matrix for neural tissue engineering  ap. 1205-1214.  aThe fabrication of an instructive bioabsorbable scaffold is one of the main goals for tissue engineering applications. In this regard, genipin cross-linked gelatin scaffolds, produced by electrospinning, were tested as a platform to include decellularized rat brain extracellular matrix as an active agent to provide fundamental biochemical cues to the seeded cells. This approach is expected to furnish a suitable natural-based polymeric scaffold with sufficient temporal stability to support cell attachment and spreading, also providing tissue-specific signals that can contribute to the expression of the requested cellular phenotype. We first demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed decellularization protocol and the cytocompatibility of the resulting brain matrix. Then, the in vitro biological assays of the conditioned electrospun scaffolds, using rat allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells, confirmed their biocompatibility and showed a differentiative potential in presence of just 1% w/w decellularized rat brain extracellular matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3abiocompatibility 3abrain 3acrosslinking 3aextracellular matrix 3agelatin 3aphenotype 3arats 3astromal cells 3atissue engineering 0aCytocompatibility 0aDecellularized brain extracellular matrix 0aNeural tissue engineering 0aMesenchymal stromal cell differentiation1 aDel Gaudio, Costantino1 aLucatelli, Elena1 aKuevda, Elena1 aBoieri, Margherita1 aMazzanti, Benedetta1 aBianco, Alessandra1 aMacchiarini, Paolo0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Jan., v. 35, no. 4 p.1205-1214dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.10.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009300159500001900252520147000271592002801741650002001769650001201789650001001801650001701811650002401828650004301852650001701895650001701912650002101929650002201950650001301972650001601985650001802001650003802019650001602057650002102073700001702094700002402111700001902135700001802154700001902172700002202191700002302213773012602236856007402362852000902436655001202445IND60735179120221120221940.0210423e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073517912DNAL7 a10.3390/md190402002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumagai, Yuya 10aCharacterization of ACE Inhibitory Peptides Prepared from Pyropia pseudolinearis Protein  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMore than 7000 red algae species have been classified. Although most of them are underused, they are a protein-rich marine resource. The hydrolysates of red algal proteins are good candidates for the inhibition of the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE). The ACE is one of the key factors for cardiovascular disease, and the inhibition of ACE activity is related to the prevention of high blood pressure. To better understand the relationship between the hydrolysates of red algal proteins and the inhibition of ACE activity, we attempted to identify novel ACE inhibitory peptides from Pyropia pseudolinearis. We prepared water soluble proteins (WSP) containing phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. In vitro analysis showed that the thermolysin hydrolysate of the WSP had high ACE inhibitory activity compared to that of WSP. We then identified 42 peptides in the hydrolysate by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Among 42 peptides, 23 peptides were found in chloroplast proteins. We then synthesized the uncharacterized peptides ARY, YLR, and LRM and measured the ACE inhibitory activity. LRM showed a low IC₅₀ value (0.15 μmol) compared to ARY and YLR (1.3 and 5.8 μmol). In silico analysis revealed that the LRM sequence was conserved in cpcA from Bangiales and Florideophyceae, indicating that the novel ACE inhibitory peptide LRM was highly conserved in red algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlorideophyceae 3aPyropia 3aalgae 3achloroplasts 3acomputer simulation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysates 3ahypertension 3amarine resources 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3aphycocyanin 3aphycoerythrin 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3athermolysin 3awater solubility1 aToji, Keigo 1 aKatsukura, Satoshi 1 aMorikawa, Rie 1 aUji, Toshiki 1 aYasui, Hajime 1 aShimizu, Takeshi 1 aKishimura, Hideki 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 19, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190402003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006600142245014500208520126300353592002801616650002401644650001301668650002501681650002201706650003701728650001601765650001701781650002101798650001401819650002501833650001701858650001301875650000901888651001001897700006001907700006601967700006402033773010702097856007702204852000902281655001202290IND60757060220221122144132.0211122e20211108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075706022DNAL7 a10.1155/2021/96566532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsungre, Peter Anabire1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0588-284510aGenotype by Environment Interaction on Grain Yield Stability and Iron and Zinc Content in OPV of Pearl Millet in Ghana Using the AMMI Method  aTwenty-two open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) genotypes were tested in two locations for three seasons in Ghana to estimate the magnitude of genetic variability, heritability, and stability for grain yield and related traits and grain micronutrients among the varieties. General analysis of variance within and across locations and years revealed very highly significant variability (p<0.01) among the genotypes. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analyses revealed significant genotype × environment interaction (GEI) that influenced the relative ranking of genotypes across the environments. Genotypic variance (σ2g) contributed a greater proportion of the phenotypic variance (σ²p) for plant height (530.31) and grain Fe content (34.72). Broad-sense heritability (hbs2) varied widely from 24.82% for grain yield to 77.53% in days to flower. Phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) was higher than genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) for all traits, indicating strong play of environment on trait expressions. 11 out of the 22 OPVs were stable for grain yield and micronutrients across environments for the three-year period and included GB 8735 and ICMV 221 Wbr and SOSAT-C88.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenchrus americanus 3aagronomy 3aanalysis of variance 3agenetic variation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3aheritability 3aopen pollination 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant height 3avariance 3azinc 3aGhana1 aAkromah, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4199-03571 aKena, Alexander Wireko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3385-49451 aGangashetty, Prakash1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6766-14150 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2021 Nov. 8, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/96566533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003200113040001800145100001400163245008600177300001800263500000900281520167800290592002801968650002301996650002402019650002802043650002002071650002502091650002602116650002702142650002402169650002202193650001802215650002202233650001802255650002102273650002402294650001502318650001202333650002202345651001302367651001302380651001302393700001902406700001902425700002002444700001902464700001902483700001702502700001902519773014002538852000902678856011202687856007902799961001302878655001202891IND4410025720221119222606.0191228e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441002572DNAL7 a10113/192882hdl7 a10.2136/sssaj2007.01542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Y.10aCQESTR Simulation of Management Practice Effects on Long-Term Soil Organic Carbon  ap. 1486-1492.  aepub  aManagement of soil organic matter (SOM) is important for soil productivity and responsible utilization of crop residues for additional uses. CQESTR, pronounced “sequester,” a contraction of “C sequestration” (meaning C storage), is a C balance model that relates organic residue additions, crop management, and soil tillage to SOM accretion or loss. Our objective was to simulate SOM changes in agricultural soils under a range of climate and management systems using the CQESTR model. Four long-term experiments (Champaign, IL, >100 yr; Columbia, MO, >100 yr; Lincoln, NE, 20 yr; Sidney, NE, 20 yr) in the United States under various crop rotations, tillage practices, organic amendments, and crop residue removal treatments were selected for their documented history of the long-term effects of management practice on SOM dynamics. CQESTR successfully simulated a substantial decline in SOM with 50 yr of crop residue removal under various rotations at Columbia and Champaign. The increase in SOM following addition of manure was simulated well; however, the model underestimated SOM for a fertilized treatment at Columbia. Predicted and observed values from the four sites were significantly related (r ² = 0.94, n = 113, P < 0.001), with slope not significantly different from 1. Given the high correlation of simulated and observed SOM changes, CQESTR can be used as a reliable tool to predict SOM changes from management practices and offers the potential for estimating soil C storage required for C credits. It can also be an important tool to estimate the impacts of crop residue removal for bioenergy production on SOM level and soil production capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic carbon 3acrop residue management 3asoil amendments 3acarbon sequestration 3along term experiments 3afertilizer application 3anutrient management 3asimulation models 3acrop residues 3asoil productivity 3acrop rotation 3aclimatic factors 3aorganic fertilizers 3aprediction 3atillage 3acomputer analysis 3aIllinois 3aNebraska 3aMissouri1 aGollany, H.

The present Digest Article aims to cover the literature on the subject to-date.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiazo compounds 3adrugs 3aliterature 3amethodology 0aSpirocyclic scaffolds 0aCyclization 0aMultiple reactivity modes 0aPrivileged structures for drug discovery1 aEremeyeva, Maria1 aZhukovsky, Daniil1 aDar'in, Dmitry1 aKrasavin, Mikhail0 tTetrahedron letters.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 62 p.152671-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1526713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007800162500001900240520102700259592002801286650002901314650001401343650001601357650001101373650002601384650001301410650001101423650002101434650000901455650001701464650002001481650003001501700002001531700002301551700001901574700002201593700001901615700002701634700002801661700002201689700002601711773012601737856007401863852000901937655001201946IND60735179220221120213216.0210423e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073517922DNAL7 a10.3390/md190402012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahbah, Eshak  I.10aMolecular Mechanisms of Astaxanthin as a Potential Neurotherapeutic Agent  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNeurological disorders are diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system that affect millions of people, and the numbers are rising gradually. In the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, the roles of many signaling pathways were elucidated; however, the exact pathophysiology of neurological disorders and possible effective therapeutics have not yet been precisely identified. This necessitates developing multi-target treatments, which would simultaneously modulate neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. The present review aims to explore the potential therapeutic use of astaxanthin (ASX) in neurological and neuroinflammatory diseases. ASX, a member of the xanthophyll group, was found to be a promising therapeutic anti-inflammatory agent for many neurological disorders, including cerebral ischemia, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and neuropathic pain. An effective drug delivery system of ASX should be developed and further tested by appropriate clinical trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aapoptosis 3aastaxanthin 3aautism 3adrug delivery systems 3aischemia 3alutein 3aoxidative stress 3apain 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 3aperipheral nervous system1 aGhozy, Sherief 1 aAttia, Mohamed  S.1 aNegida, Ahmed 1 aEmran, Talha  Bin1 aMitra, Saikat 1 aAlbadrani, Ghadeer  M.1 aAbdel-Daim, Mohamed  M.1 aUddin, Md.

The chemical structure, molecular weight, moisture uptake and degree of crystallization of polysaccharide were investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), viscosimetry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction. The results shown that the polysaccharide was a glucomannan with a backbone of (1,4)-linked β-d-mannopyranosyl residues and β-d-glucopyranosyl residues, and was demonstrated to be composed of d-mannose and d-glucose in 2.25/1.0 molar ratio and having a relatively low degree of branching at C6 positions of the hexose residues. The degree of acetylation was about 7.57% and the acetyl group might attach to glucose and mannose residues at positions C2, C3, and C6. The molecular weight of glucomannan was Mᵥ=1.57×10⁶Da.

The responsiveness of polymer solution assemblies and surfaces to biological stimuli (e.g. pH, reduction–oxidation, enzymes, glucose) and externally applied triggers (e.g. temperature, light, solvent quality) shows particular promise for various biomedical applications including drug delivery, tissue engineering, medical diagnostics, and bioseparations. Furthermore, the integration of copolymer architectures into stimuli-responsive materials design enables exquisite control over the locations of responsive sites within self-assembled nanostructures. The combination of new synthesis techniques and well-defined copolymer self-assembly has facilitated substantial developments in stimuli-responsive materials in recent years. In this tutorial review, we discuss several methods that have been employed to synthesize self-assembling and stimuli-responsive copolymers for biomedical applications, and we identify common themes in the response mechanisms among the targeted stimuli. Additionally, we highlight parallels between the chemistries used for generating solution assemblies and those employed for creating copolymer surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomposite polymers 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3aglucose 3apH 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aAlbert, Julie N.

Among these nano-aggregates, polymersomes have attracted tremendous interests as versatile carriers due to their colloidal stability, tunable membrane properties and ability of encapsulating or integrating a broad range of drugs and molecules. Biodegradable block polymers, especially aliphatic polyesters such as polylactide, polyglycolide and poly (ε-caprolactone) have been widely used as biomedical materials for a long time to well fit the requirement of biomedical drug carriers. To have a precise control of the aggregation behavior of nano-aggregates, the more ordered polypeptide has been used to self-assemble into the drug carriers. In this review we focus on the study of polymersomes which also named pepsomes formed by polypeptide-based copolymers and attempt to clarify the polypeptide-based polymersomes from following aspects: synthesis and characterization of the polypeptide-based copolymers, preparation, multifunction and application of polypeptide-based polymersomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abiomedical materials 3acomposite polymers 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3apolyesters 3apolylactic acid 3apolypeptides 0aPolypeptide-based amphiphilic copolymer 0aPolymersome 0aSynthesis 0aPreparation 0aMultifunction 0aApplication1 aLi, Nuannuan1 aWang, Kaiming1 aShi, Chunhuan1 aZhang, Longlong1 aLuan, Yuxia0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Jan., v. 35, no. 4 p.1284-1301dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.10.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01761naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010900170300001600279520079800295592002801093650002201121650003001143650001801173650001801191650001601209700001801225700001901243700002101262773010701283856004801390852000901438655001201447IND50063329120221118114857.0130324e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006332912DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674120500962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondratenko, V.

Such ion cyclotron resonance frequencies are calculated for the majority of basic biogenic components of biological tissue as well as for certain xenobiotics with consideration of all forms of occurrence of the objects being treated in solution.

In this paper, we propose an energy trading model based on the Nash bargaining game to study cooperative benefits between an IES and several EVCSs. The proposed model not only considers individual interests, but also enables the players to fairly benefit from cooperation. In particular, the uncertainties of the market prices, renewable energies and integrated demand response are considered. To ensure that the entire game is computationally tractable, the original problem is decomposed into a major energy trading problem and an additional payment bargaining problem. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm based on modified Benders decomposition is used to overcoming the players’ privacies. The results show the considerable benefits where the costs of the IES may be reduced by 3.89% and the profits associated with the EVCSs may be increased by at least 7.8%. The proposed algorithm is proven to be able to find the optimal global solutions efficiently and accurately.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclimate change 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy 3amarket prices 3amodels 3apermeability 3aprofits and margins 3arenewable energy sources 3auncertainty 0aIntegrated energy systems 0aElectric vehicle charging stations 0aNash bargaining theory 0aDistributed algorithm1 aWang, Xiuli1 aShao, Chengcheng1 aGong, Naiwei0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Aug., v. 155 p.513-530dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015200166300002000318520135400338592002801692650001301720650001601733650001501749650001601764650001101780650002101791650002001812650002201832650002101854650002001875650001501895650002001910653003001930653002601960653003101986653002102017700001702038700001402055700001902069700001402088700001602102700005702118773014602175856008602321852000902407655001202416IND60757060620221122144217.0211122e20211111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075706062DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c035972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Peng10aFunctionalized Carbon Nanotube-Decorated MXene Nanosheet-Enabled Microfluidic Electrochemical Aptasensor for Carcinoembryonic Antigen Determination  ap. 15386-15393.  aFabrication of a portable sensing platform for cancer biomarkers has important implications for disease diagnosis. Herein, an integrated microfluidic electrochemical platform was fabricated for sensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The integrated sensing platform mainly consists of two functional parts: a herringbone-embedded microfluidic chip and an electrochemical aptasensor. The electrochemical aptasensor is constructed based on a novel MXene composite nanomaterial assembled from MXene nanosheets and functionalized carbon nanotubes, which enables superior signal amplification. The herringbone-embedded chip above the aptasensor is introduced to generate local mixed flow and enhance the interaction between target molecules and the sensing interface, which is then demonstrated through numerical analysis. Based on these designs, the whole process of sample injection, efficient enrichment, specific capture, and sensitive detection can all be achieved on one integrated platform, allowing for user-friendly tests. This sensing platform shows satisfactory performance for CEA determination, and the limit of detection (LOD) is 2.88 pg/mL in a wide dynamic range of 10–1 ×10⁶ pg/mL. In addition, it can be applied for precise determination of CEA in serum, showing desirable application prospects in disease diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aaptasensors 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3adisease diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3agreen chemistry 3ananosheets 3aorgan-on-a-chip 0aportable sensing platform 0aTi3C2 MXene composite 0aelectrochemical aptasensor 0aherringbone chip1 aZheng, Jilin1 aLiang, Yi1 aTian, Fengchun1 aPeng, Lan1 aHuo, Danqun1 aHou, Changjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3608-116X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Nov. 11, v. 9, no. 46 p.15386-15393dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c035973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01905naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245006300188300001600251520090700267592002801174650003101202650001301233650000901246650002601255650000701281650002701288650003301315650001601348700002501364773009601389856008501485852000901570655001201579IND60087823820221120055832.0141102e20110211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008782382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.12.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicone, Carolina Siqueira Franco10aInfluence of pH on formation and properties of gellan gels  ap. 662-668.  aThe effect of pH (3.5, 5.3 and 7.0) on the formation of deacylated gellan gels was studied using oscillatory shear measurements and microcalorimetric trials in heating–cooling cycles at 1°Cmin⁻¹. In addition, the mechanical properties and structure of the gels formed at the different pH values were evaluated by uniaxial compression and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. An increase in pH led to an increase in temperature and decrease in enthalpy of the coil–helix transition. These results were attributed to a decreased formation of junction zones at higher pH values due to greater electrostatic repulsion between the gellan molecules. As a consequence, gels formed at neutral pH were more fragile and deformable than acid gels. All the samples showed thermo-reversible rheological behavior, presenting the same rheological properties at 20°C, before and after heating to 90°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenthalpy 3agels 3amechanical properties 3apH 3arheological properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature1 aCunha, Rosiane Lopes0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 Feb. 11, v. 84, no. 1 p.662-668dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.12.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245009500158300001600253520144600269592002801715650001501743650001001758650002401768650001401792650001401806650001001820650003101830650001101861650001601872650001101888650001301899650001401912650001101926650002301937651001401960700002301974773009601997856007102093852000902164655001202173IND60518793420221122031438.0160419e198708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051879342DNAL7 a10.2307/19383622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHershey, Anne E.10aPredator Avoidance by Cricotopus: Cyclomorphosis and the Importance of Being Big and Hairy  ap. 913-920.  aIn laboratory experiments, we tested in importance of body size and long abdominal hairs in determining susceptibility of two aquatic midges, Cricotopus sylvestris and C. bicinctus, (Diptera: Chironomidae), to predation by Hydra and the damselfly Ischnura verticalis. The chironomids co—occur on dense macrophytes in the Yahara River, Dane County, Wisconsin, USA, and differ structurally in that C. sylvestris has long hairs and C. bicinctus has short hairs. We also monitored Hydra density and C. sylvestris hair length for 2 yr. Large C. bicinctus were less susceptible to predation by both Hydra and small Ischnura, but prey size had no effect on susceptibility to large Ischnura. Long hairs offered no protection from Ischnura, but did protect C. sylvestris from Hydra, relative to short—haired C. bicinctus or C. sylvestris with experimentally shortened hairs. Hair length is negatively allometric relative to body size in ontogeny; hair absolute length remains constant as the larvae increase in size. Hair length was also cyclomorphic; successive generations of C. sylvestris showed a seasonal pattern of hair length. Hydra density also varied seasonally. When Hydra density was high, hairs on C. sylvestris were longest; when Hydra density was low, hairs were shortest. The observed cyclomorphic and allometric patterns of hair length were both beneficial characteristics in the presence of Hydra, and the benefits were additive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCricotopus 3aHydra 3aIschnura verticalis 3aallometry 3abody size 3ahairs 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3amacrophytes 3amidges 3aontogeny 3apredation 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3aWisconsin1 aDobson, Stanley I.0 tEcology.g1987 Aug., v. 68, no. 4 p.913-920dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19383623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245019000133300001600323500001400339520156800353592002801921650002201949650001301971650001201984650002201996650002502018650001102043650001302054650002402067650002602091650001402117650001102131650001502142650002402157650002802181650001402209650001702223650001402240650001802254650001102272650001102283650001002294650001102304650002102315651001002336653001902346653001402365653002202379653002302401700001802424700001602442773013002458852000902588655001202597IND60709982320221120065252.0200908e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070998232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Triptesh10aPrecision nutrient management in wheat (Triticum aestivum) using Nutrient Expert®: Growth phenology, yield, nitrogen-use efficiency and profitability under eastern sub-Himalayan plains  ap. 174-180.  aNAL-light  aA field experiment was conducted during the winter season (rabi) of 2014–15 and 2015–16 at Coochbehar, West Bengal, to assess the performance of Nutrient Expert® software on performance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under both zero and conventional tillage. The experiment was designed in a split-plot design, with tillage options in main plot and nutrient management options in subplot. The treatment receiving 100% N-P-K through Nutrient Expert (NE) software resulted in higher plant height (90.2 cm) and leaf-area index (LAI) (4.70 at 90 days after sowing) with increased biomass (9.10 t/ha). As indicated from attainment of various phonological dates, it was revealed that the crop duration was drastically reduced due to shorter vegetative and reproductive phase under noor minimum nutrient-application treatment. Nutrient-management options also had a significant effect on the yield components of wheat, viz. spikes/m², grains/spike as well as 1, 000-seed weight. Treatment based on Nutrient Expert® produced significantly higher number of spikes/m² (382), grains/spike (55.7), spike length (11.25 cm) as well as 1, 000-seed weight (41.65 g) leading to the maximum yield (3.83 t/ha), 11% higher over recommended dose of nutrient application; thus, reflecting its superiority under both conventional and zero tillage. The NE-based recommendation indicated the superiority towards greater agronomic nitrogen-use efficiency (16.74 kg grain/kg N), economic nitrogen-use efficiency (2.11 kg grain/ invested in N) as well as benefit: cost ratio (1.57).  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3acomputer software 3aconventional tillage 3adosage 3aduration 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3aleaf area 3alength 3ano-tillage 3anutrient management 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphenology 3aplant height 3aprecision 3aprofitability 3asowing 3aweight 3awheat 3awinter 3ayield components 3aIndia 0aCrop phenology 0aEconomics 0aNutrient Expert® 0aWheat productivity1 aMitra, Biplab1 aDas, Saikat0 tIndian journal of agronomy.g2018 June, v. 63, no. 2 p.174-180dThe Indian Society of AgronomywJournal:2040x0974-44607nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245010000196300001500296520151600311592002801827650001501855650002201870650001201892650001101904650001201915650001901927650001001946650002501956650002401981650001702005650002302022700002002045700002002065700002002085700001902105700001902124700001902143773015202162856007002314856009602384990002302480852000902503655001202512IND60608661820221122144117.0190510e20180321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060866182DNAL7 a10.3791/573532doi7 aPMC59332342pmcid7 a296300412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, David A.10aTracking Drosophila larval behavior in response to optogenetic stimulation of olfactory neurons  ap. e57353.  aThe ability of insects to navigate toward odor sources is based on the activities of their first-order olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). While a considerable amount of information has been generated regarding ORN responses to odorants, the role of specific ORNs in driving behavioral responses remains poorly understood. Complications in behavior analyses arise due to different volatilities of odorants that activate individual ORNs, multiple ORNs activated by single odorants, and the difficulty in replicating naturally observed temporal variations in olfactory stimuli using conventional odor-delivery methods in the laboratory. Here, we describe a protocol that analyzes Drosophila larval behavior in response to simultaneous optogenetic stimulation of its ORNs. The optogenetic technology used here allows for specificity of ORN activation and precise control of temporal patterns of ORN activation. Corresponding larval movement is tracked, digitally recorded, and analyzed using custom written software. By replacing odor stimuli with light stimuli, this method allows for a more precise control of individual ORN activation in order to study its impact on larval behavior. Our method could be further extended to study the impact of second-order projection neurons (PNs) as well as local neurons (LNs) on larval behavior. This method will thus enable a comprehensive dissection of olfactory circuit function and complement studies on how olfactory neuron activities translate in to behavior responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3acomputer software 3ainsects 3alarvae 3aneurons 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aolfactory perception 3aolfactory receptors 3aoptogenetics 3atemporal variation1 aKohler, Donovan1 aMathis, America1 aSlankster, Eryn1 aKafle, Samipya1 aOdell, Seth R.1 aMathew, Dennis0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Mar. 21, , no. 133 p.e57353-e57353dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/573533Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57353/tracking-drosophila-larval-behavior-response-to-optogenetic  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015100168300001600319520163600335592002801971650001401999650002502013650001102038650001802049650002102067650001002088650002902098650002402127650001902151653002702170653001402197653002602211653002302237653002302260700002102283700001502304700001802319773009702337856008502434852000902519655001202528IND60686679420221120072625.0200412e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068667942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Yun-Zhi10aPerformance study of phase change materials coupled with three-dimensional oscillating heat pipes with different structures for electronic cooling  ap. 636-649.  aElectronic cooling has been a rising issue mainly due to the rapid development of high-throughput computing in data centres as well as battery energy storage, which release huge amount of heat through compact surfaces. The electronic cooling process is not only energy-intensive but also difficult to control. This paper proposes an effective cooling method for electronic devices by integrating phase change materials (PCMs) with three-dimensional oscillating heat pipes (3D-OHPs), where PCMs are used to store heat dissipated by the electronic device and 3D-OHPs to fast transport the stored heat from PCMs to the environment. A novel leaf-shaped structure is designed for the 3D-OHPs. Experimental study is carried out on the leaf-shaped 3D-OHPs with various working parameters including cooling air velocity, wind direction and heat input. Further, the leaf-shaped 3D-OHPs are embedded into PCMs to cool down the electronic devices. Temperature variations and thermal resistance are evaluated and compared with the conventional air cooling method. The experimental results indicate that the surface temperature of electronic devices can be well controlled below 100 °C, which is ∼35 °C lower than that with conventional air cooling. The thermal resistance is decreased up to 36.3%. The 3D-OHPs with a filling ratio of 34–44% achieve the best thermal performance. What’s more, the leaf-shaped structure of the 3D-OHPs contributes to a ∼2 °C lower temperature on the electronic device’s surface than the typical used 3D-OHPs. This research will promote the development of effective cooling for electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectronic equipment 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3aphase transition 3apipes 3arenewable energy sources 3asurface temperature 3awind direction 0aThermal energy storage 0aHeat pipe 0aPhase change material 0aElectronic cooling 0aThermal management1 aZhang, Xiao-Song1 aWang, Feng1 aShe, Xiao-Hui0 tRenewable energy.g2020 July, v. 154 p.636-649dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245016900130300001600299500001400315520128300329592002801612650002201640650001301662650001801675650002501693650002401718650002601742650001401768650001601782650002601798650001401824650001101838650001001849650002501859650001001884650001101894651001001905653001701915653001401932700001901946700001701965700001801982700002102000700001602021773013002037852000902167655001202176IND60709982520221120074630.0200908e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070998252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeena, Rajpal10aRole of precision irrigation scheduling and residue-retention practices on water-use efficiency and wheat (Triticum aestivum) yield in north-western plains of India  ap. 186-196.  aNAL-light  aThe field experiment was carried out in split-plot design during the winter (rabi) seasons of 2011–12 to 2014–15 at Karnal, Haryana, to study the effect of precision irrigation scheduling and conservation agricultural practices on yield and water-use efficiency (WUE) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop in north-western plains of India. The crop residue retention @ 2.5 t/ha resulted in significantly higher grain yield (5.73 t/ha) and generated a net return of (42, 645/ha) in comparison to no-crop residue retention (5.54 t/ha) and residue retention @ 5 t/ha (5.61 t/ha). Application of less volume of water at greater frequency via tensiometer-based irrigation scheduling helped conserve water. The tensiometer-based irrigation scheduling proved far superior to the other irrigation practices for the fact that irrigation scheduling was significantly affected based on SWP. The water-use efficiency under irrigation scheduled at 80 kPa was the highest (1.95 kg/m³) followed by 60 kPa (1.45 kg/m³) and irrigations scheduled at critical growth stages (1.11 kg/m³), though yield at 80 kPa was significantly lower than other 2 irrigation schedules. Irrigation scheduling at 60 kPa yielded higher and also was more efficient than irrigation at all critical growth stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3acrop residues 3adevelopmental stages 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3afrequency 3agrain yield 3airrigation scheduling 3aprecision 3avolume 3awater 3awater use efficiency 3awheat 3awinter 3aIndia 0aCrop residue 0aEconomics1 aTripathi, S.C.1 aSharma, R.K.1 aChhokar, R.S.1 aChander, Subhash1 aJha, Ankita0 tIndian journal of agronomy.g2018 June, v. 63, no. 2 p.186-196dThe Indian Society of AgronomywJournal:2040x0974-44607nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245005400160300001800214500001900232520117000251592002801421650002501449650002301474650001101497650001301508650001801521650001701539650001301556700002301569700002201592700002101614700002101635773013601656856007401792852000901866655001201875IND60661412020221119210952.0190829e20130923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066141202DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cs35520a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallas, Andrzej10aChemistry and formulations for siRNA therapeutics  ap. 7983-7997.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSmall interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) form potentially the most important class of next generation therapeutics. However, achieving their efficient delivery in the correct dose, time and location in the body remains a significant challenge. Rapid developments in the chemistries of siRNA formulations are enabling new strategies to overcome the core obstacles to delivery which include poor ribonuclease (RNase) resistance, short biological half-life, lack of tissue targeting, inefficient cellular uptake and undesirable toxicity. In this review we describe these principal challenges and evaluate recent approaches proposed to overcome the chemical, biochemical and physiological barriers. The role of the specific chemical structure of siRNA is considered and an overview of selected literature-reported siRNA formulations is provided. These include chemically-modified siRNAs and analogues, aptamer–siRNA chimeras, self-assembled nanoparticles, lipid and polymer complexes, bioconjugates and fusion protein complexes. We conclude the review with an outlook for the clinical use of this highly promising, but pharmaceutically challenging biotherapeutic.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological half-life 3achemical structure 3alipids 3apolymers 3aribonucleases 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aAlexander, Cameron1 aDavies, Martyn C.1 aPuri, Sanyogitta1 aAllen, Stephanie0 tChemical Society reviews.g2013 Sept. 23, v. 42, no. 20 p.7983-7997dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cs35520a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002900137245009800166300001600264520177100280592002802051650002202079650001602101650002102117650001202138650001302150650001602163650001802179650002302197651001902220651001402239773009602253856007102349852000902420655001202429IND60518793720221122035408.0160419e198708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051879372DNAL7 a10.2307/19383662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Christopher G.10aInfluences of Flow Regime on Development and Desiccation Response of Lotic Diatom Communities  ap. 946-954.  aDiatom communities developed in either sheltered or direct—current habitats in the Colorado River below Lake Mead were subjected to short—term desiccation to test the hypothesis that communities inhabiting placid (sheltered) environments are less resistant to unpredictable disturbance than are those from more rigorous (direct—current) habitats. Direct—current communities exhibited lower cell accumulation rates and supported lower biomass and diatom densities than sheltered communities, suggesting that current shear and flow variability limited accumulation in direct current. Diatom communities that developed in sheltered habitats were less resistant to desiccation stress than communities from more rigorous flow conditions. Both biomass and cell densities were reduced by desiccation on sheltered substrates, whereas the same desiccation frequency in direct current had either no effect or caused increases in abundance parameters, depending on community age. Desiccation caused greater taxonomic change in sheltered than in direct—current environments. Low resistance to desiccation in sheltered environments was probably due to lack of nutrient renewal by current and to competition for resources in high—density communities. Temporal variability in ash content was greater in undisturbed than in desiccated communities in both flow regimes, indicating greater binding capacity of desiccated communities and suggesting that mucilage production increased with desiccation. In direct—current communities, where diatom accrual was suppressed by shear forces associated with fast flow, mucilage production after desiccation may have enhanced diatom immigration success, resulting in both higher densities and diversity in desiccated communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aash content 3abinding capacity 3abiomass 3ahabitats 3aimmigration 3alotic systems 3atemporal variation 3aColorado River 3aLake Mead0 tEcology.g1987 Aug., v. 68, no. 4 p.946-954dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19383663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245008300176300001600259520111200275592002801387650003001415650001401445650001601459650001501475650002301490650001101513650001301524650000901537650001101546650001001557650001601567650001201583650005201595650002801647650002701675650003701702650002701739650001101766650001601777650001101793650003901804650000901843650002401852650003301876650002401909650003701933700002101970700001901991700002102010700001902031700001802050700002502068700002102093700002102114700002002135700002302155773013402178856004002312852000902352655001202361IND4476104520221120174345.0120706e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447610452DNAL7 a212543202pmid7 a10.1002/tox.206622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jing‐Pin10aRutin inhibits human leukemia tumor growth in a murine xenograft model in vivo  ap. 480-484.  aNumerous studies have shown that rutin has anticancer effects. We have previously reported that rutin induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in murine leukemia WEHI‐3 cells in vitro and in vivo. However, there are no data showing that rutin inhibits human leukemia HL‐60 cells in vivo in a murine xenograft animal model. Human leukemia HL‐60 cells were implanted into mice and treated with vehicle (1% DMSO), rutin (120 mg/kg of body weight) or vinblastine (120 μg/kg of body weight). Compounds and agents were injected once every four days intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 36 days. Treatment with 120 mg/kg of rutin or with 120 μg/kg of vinblastine resulted in a reduction of tumor weight and volume when compared with the control groups. Tumor size in xenograft mice treated with 120 mg/kg of rutin was significantly smaller than that in the untreated‐control group. These novel findings indicate that rutin inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft animal model. Rutin may be useful in treating leukemia but certainly much more research is needed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, little is known about the effects of melatonin on these events in mice vitrified GV oocytes. In this study, the effects of melatonin on meiosis maturation potential and the incidence rate of aneuploidy in mouse vitrified oocytes were analyzed by supplementing in vitro maturation (IVM) solution with melatonin at different concentrations. This study, for the first time, showed that the mitochondrial heat production was markedly increased in vitrified oocytes (P < 0.05), which compromised the first polar body extrusion (PBE) of vitrified oocytes (73.3% vs. 85.1%, P < 0.05). However, 10−11 mol/L melatonin could significantly decrease mitochondrial heat production and ROS level (9.1 vs. 12.0 pixels, P < 0.05), meanwhile increase ATP level (1.1 vs. 0.88 pmol, P < 0.05) and mtDNA copies (107438 vs. 67869, P < 0.05), which rescued the abnormal chromosome alignment (32% vs. 69%, P < 0.05) and reduced the incidence of aneuploidy (15.6% vs. 38.5%, P < 0.05) in vitrified oocytes. The meiosis maturation ability of vitrified oocytes with melatonin supplementation was similar to that of fresh ones (83.4% vs. 85.1%, P > 0.05). Collectively, our data revealed that melatonin has a protective action against vitrification-induced injuries of oocytes meiosis maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaneuploidy 3achromosomes 3aextrusion 3agerminal vesicle 3aheat production 3ameiosis 3amelatonin 3amice 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3avitrification 0aMouse 0aOocytes 0aVitrification 0aMelatonin 0aMitochondrial1 aDu, Ming1 aZhuan, Qingrui1 aLuo, Yuxi1 aLi, Junyou1 aHou, Yunpeng1 aZeng, Shenming1 aZhu, Shien1 aFu, Xiangwei0 tCryobiology.g2019 Aug., v. 89 p.68-75dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2019.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007900154300001800233500001500251520093100266592002801197650001301225650002301238650002101261650002301282650002101305650001701326650001101343650001301354650001801367650001801385650001301403650001801416650002101434650002401455700002101479700002201500700002001522700001701542700002201559700002101581700002301602773013401625856007401759852000901833655001201842IND60661412320221119210844.0190829e20130528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066141232DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cs35523c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Ming10aModel studies of heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation reactions with gold  ap. 5002-5013.  agolden set  aSupported gold nanoparticles have recently been shown to possess intriguing catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions, particularly for selective hydrogenation reactions. However, fundamental studies that can provide insight into the reaction mechanisms responsible for this activity have been largely lacking. In this tutorial review, we highlight several recent model experiments and theoretical calculations on a well-structured gold surface that provide some insights. In addition to the behavior of hydrogen on a model gold surface, we review the reactivity of hydrogen on a model gold surface in regards to NO₂ reduction, chemoselective CO bond hydrogenation, ether formation, and O–H bond dissociation in water and alcohols. Those studies indicate that atomic hydrogen has a weak interaction with gold surfaces which likely plays a key role in the unique hydrogenative chemistry of classical gold catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3achemical reduction 3achemoselectivity 3adissociation 3aethers 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ananocatalysts 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen dioxide 3areaction mechanisms1 aBrush, Adrian J.1 aPozun, Zachary D.1 aHam, Hyung Chul1 aYu, Wen-Yueh1 aHenkelman, Graeme1 aHwang, Gyeong S.1 aMullins, C.

Here hierarchical interaction means directionality: points on a higher level of hierarchy affect the locations of points on the lower levels, but not vice versa. Such relations are common, for example, in ecological communities. Interacting point patterns are often modeled by Gibbs processes with pairwise interactions. However, these models are inherently symmetric, and the hierarchy can be acknowledged only when interpreting the results. We suggest the following in allowing the inclusion of the hierarchical structure in the model. Instead of regarding the pattern as a realization of a stationary multivariate point process, we build the pattern one type at a time according to the order of the hierarchy by using nonstationary univariate processes. As interactions connected to points x on a certain level are considered, the effect of the higher levels is interpreted as heterogeneity of the pattern x, and the points on the lower levels are neglected because of the hierarchical structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3acommunity ecology 3ainsect behavior 3ainsect ecology 3amathematics and statistics 3amodels1 aSäUrkkä, Aila0 tBiometrics.g1999 Dec., v. 55, no. 4 p.1051-1058dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.01051.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015700169300002000326520176600346592002802112650001302140650001302153650001702166650001702183650002802200650003202228650001602260650002202276650002102298650001102319650001302330650001402343650001702357650001802374650001302392650001702405650000902422651001502431700006002446700001902506700002102525700003802546700003502584773015502619856008302774852000902857655001202866IND60756159720221118234944.0220220e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075615972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14973-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Hemal10aEnergy, emission, profitability, and sustainability analyses of a grid-connected solar power plant proposed in airport sites of Bangladesh: a case study  ap. 61369-61379.  aNowadays, the aviation industry is one of the significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. An optimum solution to this concern is the substitution of conventional electricity consumption with clean energy sources. Barren lands are available in airport sites as buffer zones. These lands can be utilized to generate electricity from clean energy sources like solar, wind, and others. This study proposed a 5 MW grid-connected solar power plant at airport sites by utilizing the substantial barren area of the airport. The targeted airports for this study are Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka, and Shah Amanat International Airport, Chittagong, Bangladesh. Mathematical and simulation analyses have been performed for this purpose. Besides, sustainability analysis has also been incorporated for the grid-connected solar power plant. The energy efficiency varies from 18.74 to 7.79% for the Shah Amanat International Airport, and for the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, it ranges from 17.71 to 7.45%. Based on the project outcome, the revenue earned was 25% higher if the total cost was invested in power plants rather than keeping it in the bank as a deposit. On the other hand, emission analysis presented that a gross reduction of 3827.5 tons of CO₂/MWh can be achieved from the Shah Amanat International Airport, while 3926 tons of CO₂/MWh can be removed from the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. Based on the sustainability analysis, the energy depletion ratio for Shahjalal Airport varies from 0.82 to 0.93, while for Shah Amanat Airport, it is in the range of 0.81 and 0.92. The findings of this study suggested that investment in grid-connected solar power plants is economically viable and environmentally benign.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairports 3aaviation 3acase studies 3aclean energy 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gases 3aincome 3aindustry 3apollution 3apower plants 3aprofitability 3aresearch 3asolar energy 3awind 3aBangladesh1 aChowdhury, Tamal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8975-77521 aHossain, Nazia1 aChowdhury, Piyal1 ados Santos Mascarenhas, Jefferson1 aBhuiya, Muhammad Mostafa Kamal0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 43 p.61369-61379dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14973-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017200168300002000340520153500360592002801895650002001923650001601943650002201959650001001981650001401991650003302005650001302038650001002051650001002061650001302071651001202084700002302096700005702119773015502176856008302331852000902414655001202423IND60718746220221122151755.0220220e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071874622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11323-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabouri, Saddam10aAbundance and spatial distribution of the structure supporting the nest of White Stork Ciconia ciconia in Guerbes-Sanhadja wetland eco-complex, northeastern of Algeria  ap. 45974-45982.  aIn the present investigation, the spatial distribution of the nest of White Stork Ciconia ciconia was examined. Spearman’s rank-order correlations test and the principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to a total of 227 nests recorded in the Guerbes-Sanhadja wetland eco-complex, northeastern of Algeria, over seven sites, for which the percentage of occupied nests reaches 89% (202 nest were occupied). Our goals are twofold: to explore the variation and distribution of the structure supporting the nest and to explain their spatial variability. The Spearman’s rank-order correlation test show that steel electricity poles had non-significant correlations with tree, and only concrete electricity poles structure had statistically significant positive correlation with mobile phone antennas structure (R = 0.757; at p < .05), and the roofs of houses had statistically significant positive correlation with mobile phone antennas structure (R = 0.825; at p < .05). According to the PCA results, it was observed that the PC1, which explains 50.86% of the total inertia, further represents and synthesizes the dominant structure supporting the nest, i.e., tree, steel electricity poles, and concrete electricity poles, which were strongly correlated with PC1, having a component loading nearly equal to 0.766, 0.821, and − 0.929, respectively, while the PC2, which explains 30.30% of the total inertia, includes the structure rarely recorded in the studied region, i.e., wooden electricity poles and the roofs of houses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiconia ciconia 3aelectricity 3amobile telephones 3anests 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3asteel 3atrees 3awetlands 3aAlgeria1 aMetallaoui, Sophia1 aHeddam, Salim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8055-84630 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 Dec., v. 27, no. 36 p.45974-45982dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11323-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011200157300001600269500002000285520234600305592002802651650001202679650002602691650001902717650002202736650001502758650001102773650001102784650001202795650001402807650001702821650001102838650001502849651001502864651001102879700002002890773009602910856007303006852000903079655001203088IND60523577720221116170612.0160623e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052357772DNAL7 a10.1890/09-0536.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanford, Eric10aLocal adaptation along a continuous coastline: Prey recruitment drives differentiation in a predatory snail  ap. 891-901.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent work demonstrates that nearshore oceanography can generate strong variation in the delivery of resources (nutrients and larvae) to benthic marine communities over spatial scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers. Moreover, variation in the strength of these bottom‐up inputs is often spatially consistent, linked to regional centers of upwelling, coastal topography, and other stable features of the coastline. Whereas the ecological effects of these oceanographic links are increasingly clear, the possibility that these same bottom‐up forces might impose spatially varying selection on consumers has not been addressed. Here, we test the hypothesis that a carnivorous snail (Nucella canaliculata) with direct development is locally adapted to persistent differences in prey recruitment within two adjacent oceanographic regions (northern California and Oregon, USA). Previous laboratory studies demonstrated that snails from Oregon rarely drilled the thick‐shelled mussel Mytilus californianus, whereas snails from California readily drilled this prey. To test whether these differences reflect local adaptation, snails from two populations in each region were raised through two laboratory generations to minimize the potential influence of nongenetic effects. We then reciprocally outplanted these F2 generation snails to field enclosures at each of the four sites and monitored their growth for 11 months. Recruitment and availability of preferred prey (the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula and blue mussel Mytilus trossulus) at the experimental sites were 1–3 orders of magnitude lower in California than in Oregon. At the California sites, snails that originated from Oregon sources failed to drill larger M. californianus, encountered few alternative prey, and showed almost no growth. In contrast, snails from California drilled M. californianus and showed substantial growth. These results strongly suggest that the capacity of California snails to drill M. californianus allows these snails to succeed in an oceanographic region where the recruitment of alternative, preferred prey is low. More broadly, our results suggest that persistent spatial variation in recruitment and other oceanographically mediated processes may lead to adaptive differentiation among populations of consumers in adjacent coastal regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalanus 3aMytilus californianus 3aMytilus edulis 3aMytilus trossulus 3acarnivores 3acoasts 3alarvae 3amussels 3anutrients 3aoceanography 3asnails 3atopography 3aCalifornia 3aOregon1 aWorth, David J.0 tEcology.g2010 Mar., v. 91, no. 3 p.891-901dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-0536.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003000146245006900176520190100245592002802146650002202174650001402196650001802210650001402228650000902242650002002251650002002271650001702291650001602308651001102324700002402335700002102359700003402380700002202414700003002436773012202466856008102588852000902669655001202678IND60790972220221120063526.0220826e20220816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079097222DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology90801472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheodosopoulou, Zafeiria 12aA Fast Data-Driven Tool for Flood Risk Assessment in Urban Areas  aPost-disaster flood risk assessment is extremely difficult owing to the great uncertainties involved in all parts of the assessment exercise, e.g., the uncertainty of hydrologic–hydraulic models and depth–damage curves. In the present study, a robust and fast data-driven tool for residential flood risk assessment is introduced. The proposed tool can be used by scientists, practitioners and/or stakeholders as a first step for better understanding and quantifying flood risk in monetary terms. Another contribution of the present study is the fitting of an equation through depth–damage points provided by the Joint Research Center (JRC). The approach is based on hydrologic simulations for different return periods, employing a free and widely used software, HEC-HMS. Moreover, flood depths for the study area are estimated based on hydrodynamic simulations employing the HEC-RAS software and the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation method. Finally, flood risk, in monetary terms, is determined based on the flood depths derived by the coupling of hydrodynamic simulations and the IDW method, depth–damage curves reported in the literature, vulnerability of residential areas and the residential exposure derived by employing GIS tools. The proposed tool is applied in a highly urbanized and flood-prone area, Mandra city, in the Attica region of Greece. The results are maps of flood depths and flood risk maps for specific return periods. Overall, the results derived from the application of the proposed approach reveal that the tool can be highly effective for post-disaster flood risk management. However, it must be noted that additional information and post-disaster data are needed for the verification of the damages from floods. Additional information can result in better calibration, validation and overall performance of the proposed flood risk assessment tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrology 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 3aGreece1 aKourtis, Ioannis M.1 aBellos, Vasilis 1 aApostolopoulos, Konstantinos 1 aPotsiou, Chryssy 1 aTsihrintzis, Vassilios A.0 tHydrology.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology90801473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245013300173300002000306520118100326592002801507650002501535650002201560650002201582650002201604650001101626650002201637650001101659650001401670650001301684651001301697700005301710700002301763700001701786773015501803856008301958852000902041655001202050IND60756159820221118234924.0220220e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075615982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14744-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuqmān, Muḥammad,10aQuantile nexus between human development, energy production, and economic growth: the role of corruption in the case of Pakistan  ap. 61460-61476.  aThis paper examines the quantile cointegration relation between human development, energy production, and economic growth by incorporating corruption into the model for Pakistan through Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) model covering the period from 1965 to 2016. The research findings indicate that the association is quantile dependent which provides some exciting results. The Wald test is applied that rejects the null hypothesis and confirms the short- and long-run relationship between the variables. The changes in human development and economic growth are responsible for past and current changes in energy production and corruption that is confirmed through the Error Correction Model (ECM). This paper provides some interesting findings that energy production is contributing positively to human development. Further, energy production contributes negatively to economic growth, while corruption contributes positively to economic growth.

Datasets acquired from Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS) allow for river monitoring at high spatial and temporal resolution, and may be the only alternative in areas that are difficult to access. Image or video-based methods for river flow monitoring have become very popular since they are not time-consuming or expensive in contrast to traditional methods. This study presents a non-contact methodology to estimate streamflow based on data collected from UAS. Both surface velocity and river geometry are measured directly in field conditions via the UAS while streamflow is estimated with a new technique. Specifically, surface velocity is estimated by using image-based velocimetry software while river bathymetry is measured with a floating sonar, tethered like a pendulum to the UAV. Traditional field measurements were collected along the same cross-section of the Aggitis River in Greece in order to assess the accuracy of the remotely sensed velocities, depths, and discharges. Overall, the new technique is very promising for providing accurate UAV-based streamflow results compared to the field data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3ageometry 3aremote sensing 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asonar 3astream flow 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avelocimetry 3aGreece1 aZaimes, George N.0 tHydrology.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology90801483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008800160300001600248500002000264520172600284592002802010650002202038650003202060650002702092650001002119650001102129650002402140650001702164650002302181650002402204650002302228650002302251650001102274650001302285650001102298650002202309650002302331650001002354651001502364700002202379773009602401856007302497852000902570655001202579IND60523577920221116171159.0160623e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052357792DNAL7 a10.1890/08-1738.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLadwig, Laura M.10aSpatiotemporal dynamics of lianas during 50 years of succession to temperate forest  ap. 671-680.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough they are important components of forest communities, the general ecology and spatiotemporal patterns of temperate lianas during forest regeneration are largely unknown. The dependence of lianas on other plants for physical support makes them a potentially important driver of community dynamics. We examined 50 years of vegetation data from an old‐field succession study to determine the dynamics and community controls on liana expansion within the Piedmont region of New Jersey, USA. Four lianas, Lonicera japonica, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Toxicodendron radicans, and Vitis spp., occurred in enough abundance for detailed analyses. In general, liana cover peaked during mid‐succession (20–30 years post‐abandonment) when community composition was mostly herbaceous with scattered trees and shrubs. Liana cover began to decrease as trees became dominant and the canopy closed. Temporal patterns of cover dynamics of abundant species indicated three early‐ and one late‐successional liana species within the community. In contrast to cover, frequency of lianas increased throughout succession, indicating that liana populations persisted despite dramatic declines in cover for the three early‐successional species. Temporal dynamics between native and nonnative lianas were similar but spatially distinct as cover of native species dispersed and expanded near the forest edge while the nonnative species preferentially grew far from the forest. These dynamics indicate that successional processes may ultimately lead to the decline of most lianas. However, the persistence of lianas as high numbers of suppressed individuals suggests that they may rebound quickly following canopy disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLonicera japonica 3aParthenocissus quinquefolia 3aToxicodendron radicans 3aVitis 3acanopy 3acommunity structure 3aedge effects 3aforest communities 3aforest regeneration 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3alianas 3apiedmont 3ashrubs 3atemperate forests 3atemporal variation 3atrees 3aNew Jersey1 aMeiners, Scott J.0 tEcology.g2010 Mar., v. 91, no. 3 p.671-680dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1738.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002100138245007100159300001600230520102200246592002801268650001601296650001401312650001601326650001101342650001001353650001201363650002101375650001001396650002301406700002501429700002201454700002501476773011501501852000901616856007501625655001201700IND2208450520221119221438.0190314e200010  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220845052DNAL7 a10.1007/BF007764052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatsumi, Daisuke10aUltrasonic treatment to improve the quality of recycled pulp fiber  ap. 405-409.  aThe effect of ultrasound on the quality of recycled fibers was investigated. Ultrasound was applied to recycled pulp fiber suspension before ink removal by conventional flotation. The ultrasonic treatment induced an increase in the sedimentation volume of the fiber, which implies that the flexibility and bulkiness of the fiber increase. The water retention value of the ultrasonically treated fiber recovered from the loss caused by the recycling. These facts are due to a beating effect of the treatment. The paper sheets prepared from the ultrasonically treated fiber suspension showed higher sheet density, tensile strength, and brightness than that from an untreated fiber suspension. The process, which consists of ultrasonic treatment for 1 min following flotation deinking, requires about 1.4 times as much energy as the conventional flotation deinking process, but it induced 20% improvement in brightness. The results indicate that the ultrasonic treatment is effective in improving recycled fiber quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aultrasonics 3arecycling 3asuspensions 3avolume 3apaper 3adensity 3atensile strength 3acolor 3aoptical properties1 aHigashihara, Takashi1 aKawamura, Shin'ya1 aMatsumoto, Takayoshi0 tJournal of wood science.g2000 Oct., v. 46, no. 5 p.405-409dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF007764053Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02657naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245017500169520150500344592002801849650002001877650002301897650001101920650001501931650002401946650002401970650001601994650001502010651001302025700001402038700002002052700002302072773012202095856008102217852000902298655001202307IND60790972620221120063637.0220826e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079097262DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology90801502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbraham, Tesfalem 10aPrediction at Ungauged Catchments through Parameter Optimization and Uncertainty Estimation to Quantify the Regional Water Balance of the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lake Basin  aQuantifying uncertainties in water resource prediction in data-scarce regions is essential for resource development. We use globally available datasets of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for the regionalization of model parameters in the data-scarce regions of Ethiopia. A regional model was developed based on 14 gauged catchments. Three possible parameter sets were tested for regionalization: (1) the best calibration parameters, (2) the best validation parameter set derived from behavioral parameters during the validation period, and (3) the stable parameter sets. Weighted multiple linear regression was applied by assigning more weight to identifiable parameters, using a novel leave-one-out cross-validation technique for evaluation and uncertainty quantification. The regionalized parameter sets were applied to the remaining 35 ungauged catchments in the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lake Basin (RVLB) to provide regional water balance estimations. The monthly calibration of the gauged catchments resulted in Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies (NSE) ranging from 0.53 to 0.86. The regionalization approach provides acceptable regional model performances with a median NSE of 0.63. The results showed that, other than the commonly used best-calibrated parameters, the stable parameter sets provide the most robust estimates of regionalized parameters. As this approach is model-independent and the input data used are available globally, it can be applied to any other data-scarce region.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aresource management 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aEthiopia1 aLiu, Yan 1 aTekleab, Sirak 1 aHartmann, Andreas 0 tHydrology.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology90801503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015600172300001600328520089900344592002801243650002001271650002501291650002501316650001201341650001301353650002701366653001701393653002701410653003301437653003101470653001501501653001901516773009801535856008501633852000901718655001201727IND60546988020221119084522.0170711e20151116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054698802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHörisch, Jacob,10aCrowdfunding for environmental ventures: an empirical analysis of the influence of environmental orientation on the success of crowdfunding initiatives  ap. 636-645.  aThe realisation of many environmental ventures requires funding from external parties, which is not always easy to obtain. Crowdfunding offers a new potential source of financing, which is frequently expected to favor environmentally oriented ventures. However, little is known if and how crowdfunding can be effectively used for such ventures. The article empirically examines this phenomenon by analysing how the environmental orientation of crowdfunding projects influences their likelihood of successful funding. Surprisingly, no positive connection between environmental orientation and crowdfunding success can be observed in the dataset used. Therefore, reasons for the relatively low rate of success of environmentally oriented crowdfunding projects are discussed and potential measures to assist in the more effective use of crowdfunding in the context of sustainability are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental policy 3afunding 3aindustry 3asustainable technology 0aCrowdfunding 0aEnvironmental ventures 0aSustainable entrepreneurship 0aFinancing entrepreneurship 0aInvestment 0aSustainability0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Nov. 16, v. 107 p.636-645dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.05.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002400143245011500167300001600282520189000298592002802188650001702216650002302233650001802256650001602274650001902290650001502309650002002324650003102344650001102375650001002386650001802396650001002414650001102424650000902435650001802444650001302462650001702475653001802492653001502510653003102525700002402556700002002580700001902600773010302619856008102722852000902803655001202812IND4460123720221119171424.0151127e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446012372DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-10-00137.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBangarwa, Sanjeev K10aGlucosinolate and Isothiocyanate Production from Brassicaceae Cover Crops in a Plasticulture Production System  ap. 247-254.  aBrassicaceae cover crops are gaining attention as potential biofumigants for soil pest suppression because of their ability to release biologically active isothiocyanates (ITCs) and other compounds from hydrolysis of glucosinolates (GSLs). However, biofumigation potential of a Brassicaceae is related to its GSL and ITC profile and GSL to ITC conversion efficiency. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the biofumigation potential of seven Brassicaceae cover crops for weed control in plasticulture tomato and bell pepper. GSL concentration and composition varied among cover crops and between roots and shoots of each cover crop. Similar GSLs were produced in both years by roots or shoots of each cover crop, but GSL concentrations were variable between years. Total GSLs contributed to the soil by incorporation of Brassicaceae cover crop tissues were estimated between 47 to 452 nmol g⁻⁻¹ soil. Highest ITC concentration was detected in soil at 3 h after cover crop incorporation, and concentration decreased at later timings. GSL to ITC conversion efficiency ranged from 1 to 39%%, with variation among cover crops and between years. No injury was observed in tomato and bell pepper transplanted 1 wk after cover crop incorporation, indicating the tolerance of tomato and pepper to ITCs released by the cover crops. Early-season yellow nutsedge control from Brassicaceae cover crops was ≤≤ 53%% at 2 wk after transplanting and declined to ≤≤ 18%% later in the season. This research demonstrates that Brassicaceae cover crops have marginal potential for early-season weed control and cannot be used as a weed control practice in commercial tomato and bell pepper production.Nomenclature: Yellow nutsedge, Cyperus esculentus L.

The ticks were examined for the presence of Babesia by PCR detecting part of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and nuclear small subunit rRNA (SS-rDNA) for determining of Babesia spp. and Babesia microti, respectively. The overall incidence of Babesia strains in I. ricinus ticks was 4.6 %. Three species of Babesia were identified. The prevalent species was B. microti which occurred in 2.8 % of ticks, while Babesia venatorum, Babesia divergens, and unidentified Babesia species were found at the frequency of 1.2, 0.2, and 0.3 %, respectively. Altogether, B. microti constituted 61.5 % of the total strains detected in I. ricinus, B. venatorum—25.7 %, B. divergens—5.1 %, and unidentified Babesia species—7.7 %. The prevalence of Babesia species in I. ricinus did not depend significantly on locality (χ ² = 1.885, P = 0.390) nor on the tick stage (χ ² = 4.874, P = 0.087). The incidence of Babesia strains in D. reticulatus ticks was 2.7 %. Two species of Babesia were identified. Again, the prevalent species was B. microti which occurred in 2.1 % of ticks, while B. canis was found in 0.7 % of ticks. In one D. reticulatus female, B. canis and B. microti co-infection was found. Altogether, B. microti constituted 75 % of the total strains detected in D. reticulatus while B. canis formed 25 % of the total strains. The frequency of the occurrence of Babesia species in D. reticulatus did not depend significantly on locality (χ ² = 0.463, P = 0.793). The difference between the prevalence of Babesia in males and females of D. reticulatus was insignificant (P = 0.0954); nymphs were not found. The dominance of B. microti in the species composition of tick-borne Babesia found in this study was typical for eastern Europe. In conclusion, the results revealed that the population inhabiting the forested area of eastern Poland could be exposed to Babesia parasites, especially to those from the species B. microti, by a bite of I. ricinus, a competent vector of human babesiosis, and probably also by a bite of D. reticulatus whose role in the transmission of human babesiosis needs to be clarified.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBabesia divergens 3aBabesia microti 3aDermacentor reticulatus 3aIxodes ricinus 3ababesiosis 3afemales 3aforests 3agenes 3ahumans 3amales 3amixed infection 3anymphs 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aspecies diversity 3aticks 3aEastern European region 3aPoland1 aZając, Violetta1 aSawczyn, Anna1 aCisak, Ewa1 aDutkiewicz, Jacek0 tParasitology research.g2015 Aug., v. 114, no. 8 p.3111-3116dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4529-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009000156300001800246500002000264520236600284592002802650650001402678650001902692650001602711650001502727650001902742650000902761650001102770650001302781650001302794650001402807650001602821650001402837650002402851650001202875650002202887700001602909700001402925773009702939856007303036852000903109655001203118IND60523578120221116170529.0160623e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052357812DNAL7 a10.1890/09-1446.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rui-Wu10aDiffusive coevolution and mutualism maintenance mechanisms in a fig–fig wasp system  ap. 1308-1316.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn reciprocal mutualism systems, the exploitation events by exploiters might disrupt the reciprocal mutualism, wherein one exploiter species might even exclude other coexisting exploiter species over an evolutionary time frame. What remains unclear is how such a community is maintained. Niche partitioning, or spatial heterogeneity among the mutualists and exploiters, is generally believed to enable stability within a mutualistic system. However, our examination of a reciprocal mutualism between a fig species (Ficus racemosa) and its pollinator wasp (Ceratosolen fusciceps) shows that spatial niche partitioning does not sufficiently prevent exploiters from overexploiting the common resource (i.e., the female flowers), because of the considerable niche overlap between the mutualists and exploiters. In response to an exploiter, our experiment shows that the fig can (1) abort syconia‐containing flowers that have been galled by the exploiter, Apocryptophagus testacea, which oviposits before the pollinators do; and (2) retain syconia‐containing flowers galled by Apocryptophagus mayri, which oviposit later than pollinators. However, as a result of (2), there is decreased development of adult non‐pollinators or pollinator species in syconia that have not been sufficiently pollinated, but not aborted. Such discriminative abortion of figs or reduction in offspring development of exploiters while rewarding cooperative individuals with higher offspring development by the fig will increase the fitness of cooperative pollinating wasps, but decrease the fitness of exploiters. The fig–fig wasp interactions are diffusively coevolved, a case in which fig wasps diversify their genotype, phenotype, or behavior as a result of competition between wasps, while figs diverge their strategies to facilitate the evolution of cooperative fig waps or lessen the detrimental behavior by associated fig wasps. In habitats or syconia that suffer overexploitation, discriminative abortion of figs or reduction in the offspring development of exploiters in syconia that are not or not sufficiently pollinated will decrease exploiter fitness and perhaps even drive the population of exploiters to local extinction, enabling the evolution and maintenance of cooperative pollinators through the movement between habitats or syconia (i.e., the metapopulations).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaonidae 3aFicus racemosa 3acoevolution 3aextinction 3afemale flowers 3afigs 3afruits 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3amutualism 3aoviposition 3aphenotype 3apollinating insects 3aprogeny 3aspatial variation1 aSun, Bao-Fa1 aZheng, Qi0 tEcology.g2010 May, v. 91, no. 5 p.1308-1316dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-1446.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009900163300001100262520170200273592002801975650001302003650000902016650002302025650001402048650002302062650001402085650002102099650001402120650001602134650001502150700005602165700002102221700001902242700002002261700001402281700001802295700006302313773010902376856008302485852000902568655001202577IND60718746720221120232956.0210303e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071874672DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-020-01245-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeevan, B.10aGenetic analysis of maydis leaf blight resistance in subtropical maize (Zea mays L.) germplasm  ap. 89.  aKnowledge on the genetics of maydis leaf blight (MLB) is crucial to breed the resistant maize cultivars to combat disease epidemics as a sustainable and cost-effective approach.

The CM119 and SC-7-2-1-2-6-1 showed susceptible and resistant reactions with mean disease reaction of 3.89–3.98 and 1.88–2.00, respectively. The derived generations, namely F₁, F₂, BC₁P₁ and BC₁P₂ showed mean disease reaction of 2.15–2.28, 2.44–2.51, 2.19–2.24 and 2.22–2.28, respectively in the test locations. The segregating generations (F₂: 0.35–0.37; BC₁P₁: 0.24–0.29 and BC₁P₂: 0.17–0.20) showed variation for MLB disease resistance over the parental and first filial generations (P₁: 0.11–0.17; P₂: 0.08–0.13 and F₁: 0.12–0.14). The genetic analysis of MLB resistance revealed the nonallelic interactions of duplicate epistasis type across the test locations. Among the gene interactions, dominance × dominance [l] effect was predominant over additive × additive [i] and additive × dominance [j] effects. The segregation analysis and the prediction of the number of major loci revealed at least two major genes associated with MLB tolerance in subtropical maize. Our investigation paved the foundation for the improvement of subtropical maize germplasm of MLB resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acost effectiveness 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3aepistasis 3agenetic analysis 3agermplasm 3aleaf blight 3aprediction1 aGogoi, Robin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1985-39061 aSharma, Devender1 aManjunatha, C.1 aRajashekara, H.1 aRam, Dama1 aMishra, K.

The potential scope and sustainability of irrigation interventions under current and future climates however remains poorly understood. Potential adaptation options in Western Nepal were analyzed using bias-corrected Regional Climate Model (RCM) data and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The RCM climate change scenario suggested that average annual rainfall will increase by about 4% with occurrence of increased number and intensity of rainfall events in the winter. RCM outputs also suggested that average annual maximum temperature could decrease by 1.4 °C, and average annual minimum temperature may increase by 0.3 °C from 2021 to 2050. Similarly, average monthly streamflow volume could increase by about 65% from March–April, although it could decrease by about 10% in June. Our results highlight the tight hydrological coupling of surface and groundwater. Farmers making use of surface water for irrigation in upstream subbasins may inadvertently cause a decrease in average water availability in downstream subbasins at approximately 14%, which may result in increased need to abstract groundwater to compensate for deficits. Well-designed irrigated crop rotations that fully utilize both surface and groundwater conversely may increase groundwater levels by an average of 45 mm from 2022 to 2050, suggesting that in particular subbasins the cultivation of two crops a year may not cause long-term groundwater depletion. Modeled crop yield for the winter and spring seasons were however lower under future climate change scenarios, even with sufficient irrigation application. Lower yields were associated with shortened growing periods and high temperature stress. Irrigation intensification appears to be feasible if both surface and groundwater resources are appropriately targeted and rationally used. Conjunctive irrigation planning is required for equitable and year-round irrigation supply as neither the streamflow nor groundwater can provide full and year-round irrigation for intensified cropping systems without causing the degradation of natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acrop yield 3afood security 3agroundwater 3aheat stress 3aingredients 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3apoverty 3arain 3aspring 3astream flow 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awater shortages 3awinter 3aNepal1 aUrfels, Anton 1 aSrinivasan, Raghavan 1 aBayissa, Yared 1 aShrestha, Nirman 1 aPaudel, Gokul P.1 aKrupnik, Timothy J.0 tHydrology.g2022 July 26, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology90801323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03784naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245012000210300002000330520216100350592002802511650001302539650002202552650001602574650001602590650001502606650001102621650001502632650001602647650001002663650001102673650002402684650002102708650001502729650001502744650001802759650001002777650001902787650001102806650001802817650001402835650001302849650001802862651001002880700002602890700002502916700001602941700003802957773015502995856008303150852000903233655001203242IND60756160520221119000506.0220220e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075616052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-15086-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarlapati, Deviram1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5674-594X10aDistribution patterns and seasonal variations in phytoplankton communities of the hypersaline Pulicat lagoon, India  ap. 61497-61512.  aPhytoplankton structure and patterns are key components to forecast the net result of the gain and loss process that outline the resilience of the lagoon ecosystem. In order to understand the phytoplankton community structure and its relationship with the environmental variables in the shallow hypersaline Pulicat lagoon, east coast of India, observations were carried out during August 2018–January 2019 covering the three seasons: premonsoon (PrM), monsoon (M), and postmonsoon (PoM). The salinity of the lagoon varied with a minimum of 12.1 for the M and a maximum of 81.65 during the PoM. The clustering analysis performed on the phytoplankton abundance data separated the lagoon into three sectors: north sector (NS), central sector (CS), and south sector (SS). A total of 59 taxa/morphotypes from four taxonomic classes (Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, and Dinophyceae) were recorded during the study period. The class Bacillariophyceae was dominant in the lagoon both spatially and temporally by 44.06% with Chaetoceros borealis as dominant species. Presence of characteristic species like Dunaliella sp. was observed in the higher salinity, whereas Pediastrum duplex and Scenedesmus sp. were dominant in the freshwater influx areas. The individual-based functional approach allowed grouping these taxa into 11 functional entities based on the derived 4 functional trait values (cell size, trophic regime, mobility, and coloniality). Formation of algal blooms of Protoperidinium sp. (3.3×10⁵ind L⁻¹) and Odentella sp. (2.8×10⁵ind L⁻¹) was observed in the SS during PoM as a result of reduced water exchange in the lagoon. During the same period, toxin-producing strains like Anabaena sp. and Nostoc sp. of Cyanophyceae were also recorded. Correlating the three sectors of the lake (NS, CS, and SS), it is observed that the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the lake varied continuously depending on the season and freshwater availability. Seasonal nutrient stoichiometry played a significant role in regulating the community structure and distribution pattern of phytoplankton communities of the lagoon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChaetoceros 3aDinophyceae 3aDunaliella 3aNostoc 3aPediastrum 3aScenedesmus 3aalgae 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3adominant species 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3ahypersalinity 3alakes 3amonsoon season 3amorphs 3aphytoplankton 3apollution 3aresearch 3astoichiometry 3aIndia1 aMunnooru, Kumaraswami1 aVinjamuri, Ranga Rao1 aKarri, Ramu1 aMallavarapu, Venkata Ramanamurthy0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 43 p.61497-61512dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15086-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012000159300001800279500002000297520197300317592002802290650002502318650001302343650001502356650001002371650001202381650001302393650001502406650001502421650001102436650001302447650002202460650001302482650000902495650002002504650002602524650001402550650001902564650001002583650001402593700002002607700002102627700002002648773009702668856007302765852000902838655001202847IND60523578220221116171327.0160623e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052357822DNAL7 a10.1890/09-0653.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox-Dobbs, Kena10aTermites create spatial structure and govern ecosystem function by affecting N2 fixation in an East African savanna  ap. 1296-1307.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe mechanisms by which even the clearest of keystone or dominant species exert community‐wide effects are only partially understood in most ecosystems. This is especially true when a species or guild influences community‐wide interactions via changes in the abiotic landscape. Using stable isotope analyses, we show that subterranean termites in an East African savanna strongly influence a key ecosystem process: atmospheric nitrogen fixation by a monodominant tree species and its bacterial symbionts. Specifically, we applied the ¹⁵N natural abundance method in combination with other biogeochemical analyses to assess levels of nitrogen fixation by Acacia drepanolobium and its effects on co‐occurring grasses and forbs in areas near and far from mounds and where ungulates were or were not excluded. We find that termites exert far stronger effects than do herbivores on nitrogen fixation. The percentage of nitrogen derived from fixation in Acacia drepanolobium trees is higher (55–80%) away from mounds vs. near mounds (40–50%). Mound soils have higher levels of plant available nitrogen, and Acacia drepanolobium may preferentially utilize soil‐based nitrogen sources in lieu of fixed nitrogen when these sources are readily available near termite mounds. At the scale of the landscape, our models predict that termite/soil derived nitrogen sources influence >50% of the Acacia drepanolobium trees in our system. Further, the spatial extent of these effects combine with the spacing of termite mounds to create highly regular patterning in nitrogen fixation rates, resulting in marked habitat heterogeneity in an otherwise uniform landscape. In summary, we show that termite‐associated effects on nitrogen processes are not only stronger than those of more apparent large herbivores in the same system, but also occur in a highly regular spatial pattern, potentially adding to their importance as drivers of community and ecosystem structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia drepanolobium 3aIsoptera 3aecosystems 3aforbs 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3asavannas 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3asubterranean termites 3asymbionts 3atermite mounds 3atrees 3aungulates1 aDoak, Daniel F.1 aBrody, Alison K.1 aPalmer, Todd M.0 tEcology.g2010 May, v. 91, no. 5 p.1296-1307dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-0653.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245007600166300001400242500001500256520133600271592002801607650001201635650001501647650001801662650001301680650001701693650001901710650002001729650001701749650002501766650002501791650002701816651001401843653001901857700001701876700001601893773010701909852000902016856008902025655001202114IND2050673220221120125601.0181002e199602  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205067322DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-199602000-000012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, J.10aImpact of forest harvesting on the hydraulic properties of surface soil  ap. 79-86.  a2019-12-04  aTimber harvesting and its associated activities cause drastic changes in soil physical structures and hydraulic properties. Increasing concern is being voiced both by the forestry industry and by environmental conservation groups in regard to quantitative changes such events may cause. This study is an attempt to assess in situ changes of surface soil hydraulic properties using a newly developed disc permeameter. Five forest sites, two radiata pine forests and three native eucalypt forests in southeastern Australia, were selected to investigate the impact of timber harvesting on soil structure and hydraulic properties. The soils were sampled both before and after loggingOn most of the study sites there was an increase in soil bulk density and a declining trend in sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity associated with logging. The changes in hydraulic properties suggested that the logging and associated activities had resulted in soil compaction, attributable mainly to redistribution of soil pore sizes and with a decrease mostly in pores greater than 3 mm in diameter. This reduction in macroporosity suggests a reduction in aeration and a change of water retention characteristics. The merits and limitations of the disc permeameter in measuring in situ hydraulic properties were discussed in relation to this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3alogging 3aEucalyptus 3aPinus radiata 3aporosity 3abulk density 3asoil structure 3asoil compaction 3aforest soils 3aenvironmental impact 3asoil water retention 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aAustralia 0asurface layers1 aLacey, S.

In a uniform-balanced, crossover design, 10 participants performed 2 separate testing sessions involving a lower body resistance exercise component consisting of a lower intensity (50% of 1-repetition maximum; 1RM) protocol and a higher intensity (80% of 1RM) protocol of equal volumes. Muscle samples were obtained at before exercise, 45 min, 3 h, 24 h, and 48 h postexercise. Resistance exercise did not alter total PGC-1α mRNA expression; however, distinct responses of each PGC-1α isoform were observed. The response of each isoform was consistent between sessions, suggesting no effect of resistance exercise intensity on the complex transcriptional expression of the PGC-1α gene. IGF-1Ea mRNA expression significantly increased following the higher intensity session compared with pre-exercise and the lower intensity session. Myostatin mRNA expression was significantly reduced compared with pre-exercise values at all time points with no difference between exercise intensity. Further research is needed to determine the effects of the various isoforms of PGC-1α in human skeletal muscle on the translational level as well as their relation to the expression of IGF-1 and myostatin.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-over studies 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3amyostatin 3anutrition 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3askeletal muscle 3astrength training 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 0aresistance exercise 0agene expression 0askeletal muscle 0aexercise intensity 0aPGC-1α 0aIGF-1 0amyostatin1 aMcKinley-Barnard, Sarah K.1 aSpillane, Mike B.1 aAndre, Thomas L.1 aGann, Joshua J.1 aWilloughby, Darryn S.0 tApplied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.g2016 Apr. 6, v. 41, no. 8 p.856-863dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2016-00473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245010900177300001600286520117000302592002801472650001601500650001801516650001901534650001501553650001701568650001601585650001601601650001101617650002401628650001401652650002101666650001801687650002301705650001101728650001501739650002201754650002001776650001301796651001001809653001701819653001801836653001501854653002201869653002201891700002201913700002601935700002601961700002701987773011502014856008802129852000902217655001202226IND60540147520221122030245.0190318e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054014752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Sejuti Naha10aImpact of multispecies diatom bloom on plankton community structure in Sundarban mangrove wetland, India  ap. 306-311.  aA multispecies bloom caused by the centric diatoms, viz. Coscinodiscus radiatus, Chaetoceros lorenzianus and the pennate diatom Thalassiothrix frauenfeldii was investigated in the context of its impact on phytoplankton and microzooplankton (the loricate ciliate tintinnids) in the coastal regions of Sagar Island, the western part of Sundarban mangrove wetland, India. Both number (15–18 species) and cell densities (12.3×103cellsl−1 to 11.4×105cellsl−1) of phytoplankton species increased during peak bloom phase, exhibiting moderately high species diversity (H′=2.86), richness (R′=6.38) and evenness (E′=0.80). The diatom bloom, which existed for a week, had a negative impact on the tintinnid community in terms of drastic changes in species diversity index (1.09–0.004) and population density (582.5×103 to 50×103indm−3). The bloom is suggested to have been driven by the aquaculture activities and river effluents resulting high nutrient concentrations in this region. An attempt has been made to correlate the satellite remote sensing-derived information to the bloom conditions. MODIS-Aqua derived chlorophyll maps have been interpreted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetoceros 3aCoscinodiscus 3aThalassiothrix 3aTintinnida 3aalgal blooms 3aaquaculture 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3aeffluents 3anutrient content 3aphytoplankton 3apopulation density 3arivers 3asatellites 3aspecies diversity 3awater pollution 3awetlands 3aIndia 0aDiatom bloom 0aWater quality 0aTintinnids 0aSpecies diversity 0aSundarban wetland1 aRakshit, Dibyendu1 aSarkar, Santosh Kumar1 aSarangi, Ranjit Kumar1 aSatpathy, Kamala Kanta0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 85, no. 1 p.306-311dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011600163300001800279520199700297592002802294650001902322650002102341650002902362650001302391650002002404650002402424650001602448650001002464650004202474650003202516650001402548650003302562650001402595650004502609650001802654650001802672650002302690700001602713700001702729773011002746856008102856852000902937655001202946IND60438867620221119173538.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043886762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4494-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLott, M. J.10aParasitic nematode communities of the red kangaroo, Macropus rufus: richness and structuring in captive systems  ap. 2925-2932.  aCaptive management practices have the potential to drastically alter pre-existing host-parasite relationships. This can have profound implications for the health and productivity of threatened species in captivity, even in the absence of clinical symptoms of disease. Maximising the success of captive breeding programmes requires a detailed knowledge of anthropogenic influences on the structure of parasite assemblages in captive systems. In this study, we employed two high-throughput molecular techniques to characterise the parasitic nematode (suborder Strongylida) communities of the red kangaroo, Macropus rufus, across seven captive sites. The first was terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of a region of rDNA encompassing the internal transcribed spacers 1 (ITS1), the 5.8S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). The second was Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing of the ITS2 region. The prevalence, intensity of infection, taxonomic composition and comparative structure of strongylid nematode assemblages was assessed at each location. Prevalence (P = <0.001) and mean infection intensity (df = 6, F = 17.494, P = <0.001) differed significantly between the seven captive sites. Significant levels of parasite community structure were observed (ANOSIM, P = 0.01), with most of the variation being distributed within, rather than between, captive sites. The range of nematode taxa that occurred in captive red kangaroos appeared to differ from that of wild conspecifics, with representatives of the genus Cloacina, a dominant nematode parasite of the macropodid forestomach, being detected at only two of the seven study sites. This study also provides the first evidence for the presence of the genus Trichostrongylus in a macropodid marsupial. Our results demonstrate that contemporary species management practices may exert a profound influence on the structure of parasite communities in captive systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacropus rufus 3aTrichostrongylus 3aanthropogenic activities 3abreeding 3acaptive animals 3acommunity structure 3aforestomach 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ainfection 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aparasites 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3athreatened species1 aHose, G.

This results in a persistent paralysis of peripheral nerve terminals known as botulism. They are the most potent toxins known and are classified as one of the six highest-risk threat agents of bioterrorism. Despite their high toxicity, two of them are used as valuable pharmaceutical for the therapy of many neurological and non-neurological disorders.

Therefore, potential means of therapy are needed. The present work evaluated the effect of gamma irradiation on mestacestode causing CE. Metacestode of Echinococcus granulosus were exposed to 15, 30, and 60 Gy irradiation and examined after 24 h for viability, morphologic, and ultrastuctural alterations by light and electron microscopy. Apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 activity by colorimetric assay and immunohistochemistry. The irradiated metacestodes showed loss of viability, damage of protoscolices, formation of lipid droplets and vacuoles, and separation of the germinal layer. Apoptosis was prominent after irradiation. Our results suggested that gamma irradiation have therapeutic potential in CE. Moreover, understanding the destructive effect of irradiation may help in developing prophylactic measures against CE. Further studies are needed to test the efficacy of ionizing radiation in long-term animal models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acolorimetry 3adroplets 3aechinococcosis 3aelectron microscopy 3agamma radiation 3aimmunohistochemistry 3airradiation 3alipids 3aprotoscoleces 3asurgery 3avacuoles 3aviability1 aBadawy, Abeer Fathy0 tParasitology research.g2015 Aug., v. 114, no. 8 p.3145-3150dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4533-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017400167300001600341520156200357592002801919650002601947650001601973650001301989650001102002650001102013650001602024650001002040650001702050650001602067650002302083650001402106650001902120650002602139650001302165650001502178650001702193650001802210650002102228650001802249650002102267650001802288650001602306650000902322653003202331653002802363653002902391653004502420653001702465700001602482700001702498700001502515700001302530773008302543856008402626852000902710655001202719IND60556719020221120030802.0161102e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055671902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhuofeng10aCo-occurrence of mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes in municipal solid waste landfill leachates: A preliminary insight into the role of landfill age  ap. 583-592.  aSince municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill harbours miscellaneous wastes, pollutants and microorganisms, it gradually becomes a huge potential reservoir for breeding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and diversity of ARGs associated with various mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in MSW landfill leachates. The relationship of ARGs with leachate characteristics was also studied to explore the influence of landfill age. Seven sulfonamides (sulfapyridine, sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine and sulfaquinoxaline), three encoded ARGs (sul-I, sul-II and sul-III) and four types of MGEs (plasmids, transposons, integrons and insertion sequences) were quantified in leachates with landfill ages ranging from 3 months–6 years. ARGs increased to an absolute concentration of 106 copies/μL and were positively correlated (p < 0.05) to MGEs. Significant correlations (p < 0.05) were also discovered among ARGs and the increasing humic acids, heavy metals (Zn, Cu and Co) and antibiotics (except for sulfathiazole and sulfaquinoxaline), implying landfilling might contribute to the enrichment of ARGs in the long-term. Non-target full scans revealed the role of persistent unknown compounds in stimulating the ARGs dissemination. Overall, this study demonstrates the exacerbation of ARGs pollution in landfill environment and a detailed delineation of the complex inter-relationships between ARGs and the substances harbouring in landfills is badly required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abreeding 3acobalt 3acopper 3acorrelation 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3ahumic acids 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amicroorganisms 3amunicipal solid waste 3aplasmids 3apollutants 3asulfadiazine 3asulfamerazine 3asulfamethoxazole 3asulfapyridine 3asulfaquinoxaline 3asulfathiazole 3atransposons 3azinc 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aMobile genetic elements 0aHorizontal gene transfer 0aMunicipal solid waste landfill leachates 0aLandfill age1 aHe, Pinjing1 aShao, Liming1 aZhang, Hua1 aLu, Fan,0 tWater research.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 106 p.583-592dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245009600167300001600263520156200279592002801841650001401869650001001883650001301893650001301906650001201919650002101931650001201952650001501964650001501979650001601994650001002010650001502020650001402035650002302049650002102072650001002093653001802103653001502121653001202136653001502148653001302163653001002176700002402186773014002210856007802350852000902428655001202437IND60537126620221120132624.0160807e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053712662DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2016-00532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalanian, Jason L.10aLow and moderate doses of caffeine late in exercise improve performance in trained cyclists  ap. 850-855.  aThe aim of the present study was to assess if low and moderate doses of caffeine delivered in a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CES) late in exercise improved time-trial (TT) performance. Fifteen (11 male, 4 female) cyclists (age, 22.5 ± 0.9 years; body mass, 69.3 ± 2.6 kg; peak oxygen consumption, 64.6 ± 1.9 mL·min⁻¹·kg⁻¹) completed 4 double-blinded randomized trials. Subjects completed 120 min of cycling at ∼60% peak oxygen consumption with 5 interspersed 120-s intervals at ∼82% peak oxygen consumption, immediately followed by 40-s intervals at 50 W. Following 80 min of cycling, subjects either ingested a 6% CES (PL), a CES with 100 mg (low dose, 1.5 ± 0.1 mg·kg body mass⁻¹) of caffeine (CAF1), or a CES with 200 mg (moderate dose, 2.9 ± 0.1 mg·kg body mass⁻¹) of caffeine (CAF2). Following the 120-min cycling challenge, cyclists completed a 6-kJ·kg body mass⁻¹ TT. There was no difference between respiratory, heart rate, glucose, free fatty acid, body mass, hematocrit, or urine specific gravity measurements between treatments. The CAF2 (26:36 ± 0:22 min:s) TT was completed faster than CAF1 (27:36 ± 0:32 min:s, p < 0.05) and both CAF1 and CAF2 TTs were completed faster than PL (28:41 ± 0:38 min:s, p < 0.05). Blood lactate was similar between trials and rose to a greater extent during the TT (p < 0.05). In summary, both doses of caffeine delivered late in exercise improved TT performance over the PL trial and the moderate dose (CAF2) improved performance to a greater extent than the low dose (CAF1).  aPublisher supplied data 3abicycling 3ablood 3acaffeine 3aexercise 3afemales 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3aheart rate 3ahematocrit 3alactic acid 3amales 3ametabolism 3anutrition 3aoxygen consumption 3aspecific gravity 3aurine 0aergogenic aid 0ametabolism 0acycling 0atime trial 0aexercise 0aelite1 aSpriet, Lawrence L.0 tApplied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.g2016 Apr. 1, v. 41, no. 8 p.850-855dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2016-00533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015900169300001100328500001900339520203600358592002802394596005002422650001902472650002402491650001402515650001502529650001802544650001202562650002002574650002302594650000902617650002102626650001302647650002602660650001902686650001502705650001602720700002402736700005802760773010302818856008302921852000903004655001203013IND60718747420221121013341.0201220e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071874742DNAL7 a10.1186/s12898-020-00333-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColesie, Claudia10aDifferences in growth-economics of fast vs. slow growing grass species in response to temperature and nitrogen limitation individually, and in combination  ap. 63.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: Fast growing invasive alien species are highly efficient with little investment in their tissues. They often outcompete slower growing species with severe consequences for diversity and community composition. The plant economics trait-based approach provides a theoretical framework, allowing the classification of plants with different performance characteristics. However, in multifaceted background, this approach needs testing. The evaluation and prediction of plant performance outcomes in ecologically relevant settings is among the most pressing topics to understand and predict ecosystem functioning, especially in a quickly changing environment. Temperature and nutrient availability are major components of the global environmental change and this study examines the response of growth economic traits, photosynthesis and respiration to such changes for an invasive fast-growing (Bromus hordaceus) and a slow-growing perennial (Bromus erectus) grass species. RESULTS: The fully controlled growth chamber experiment simulated temperature—and changes in nitrogen availability individually and in combination. We therefore provide maximum control and monitoring of growth responses allowing general growth trait response patterns to be tested. Under optimal nitrogen availability the slow growing B. erectus was better able to handle the lower temperatures (7 °C) whilst both species had problems at higher temperatures (30 °C). Stresses produced by a combination of heat and nutrient availability were identified to be less limiting for the slow growing species but the combination of chilling with low nutrient availability was most detrimental to both species. CONCLUSIONS: For the fast-growing invader B. hordeaceus a reduction of nitrogen availability in combination with a temperature increase, leads to limited growth performance in comparison to the slow-growing perennial species B.erectus and this may explain why nutrient-rich habitats often experience more invasion than resource-poor habitats.  aPublisher supplied data  aFeodor LynencAlexander von Humboldt-Stiftung 3aBromus erectus 3acommunity structure 3aeconomics 3aecosystems 3aglobal change 3agrasses 3agrowth chambers 3agrowth performance 3aheat 3ainvasive species 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphotosynthesis 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aStangl, Zsofia Reka1 aHurry, Vaughan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5151-51840 tBMC ecology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.63-63dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4138408x1472-67857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12898-020-00333-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002200138245016400160300001600324500001500340520192500355592002802280650001502308650004402323650001702367650001102384650002302395650002202418650001102440650001202451650002002463653001402483700001902497700001802516700001602534700002102550700001602571773011502587852000902702856007502711655001202786IND2243822820221119223542.0190314e200012  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224382282DNAL7 a10.1007/BF007658042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatayama, Takeshi10aAbsolute configuration of arylglycerol-β-aryl ethers obtained by asymmetric reduction of the correspondingα-ketonic compound with intactFusarium solani cells  ap. 458-465.  a2019-12-05  aWhen (±)-α-oxo-guaiacylglycerol-β-(vanillic acid) ether (1) is degraded byFusarium solani M-13-1, theα-ketone is initially reduced to giveerythro andthreo guaiacylglycerol-β-(vanillic acid) ethers (2), arylglycerol-β-aryl ethers, both of which are enantiomerically pure. The absolute configuration in each2 was determined by Mosher's method; the products were converted toα,γ-di-(R)-α-methoxy-α-trifluoromethylphenylacetates (MTPA esters) (3′) oferythro (-)- andthreo (+)-veratrylglycerol-β-(methyl vanillate) ethers (3), whose¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were examined and compared with those of four di-(R)-MTPA ester (3′) diastereomers from chemically synthesizederythro (±)-3 andthreo (±)-3. To assign theα- andγ-MTPA-OCH₃ peaks, the¹H NMR scans of several compounds that have substructures of 3′ and their 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl analogues were examined. When a racemic alcohol reacts with (R)-MTPA to give a pair of (R)-MTPA ester diastereomers, the Δδ value was defined as the absolute value of the difference in the¹H chemical shifts of the peak between the diastereomers. It was found that the Δδ values ofα-MTPA-OCH₃ were larger than those ofγ-MTPA-OCH₃ owing to a shielding effect of the veratryl ring located on theα-MTPA-OCH₃, and that theα-MTPA-OCH₃ peaks in the 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl compounds shifted downfield relative to those in the veratryl compounds. On the basis of the¹h NMR data of (R)-MTPA esters, the absolute configuration of the four chemically prepared diastereomers (3′) were determined. The catabolicerythro 3′ [fromerythro (-)-3] andthreo 3′ [fromthreo (+)-3] were identical to (R, αS, βR)-erythro 3′ and (R, αS, βS)- threo 3′, respectively. An hydrogen species in the fungal reduction would attack theα-ketone fromre-face of both (βR)-1 and (βS)-1, givingerythro (αS, βR)-2 andthreo (αS, βS)-2, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametabolism 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3adecayed wood 3aethers 3achemical structure 3aspectral analysis 3alignin 3aketones 3aFusarium solani 0areduction1 aTsutsui, Jyoji1 aTsueda, Kazuo1 aMiki, Takao1 aYamada, Yasuhiro1 aSogo, Murao0 tJournal of wood science.g2000 Dec., v. 46, no. 6 p.458-465dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF007658043Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03459naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245010400176300001600280520181400296592002802110650001302138650002502151650002102176650002002197650002302217650001902240650002102259650001502280650002602295650001602321650001502337650001502352650001202367650001402379650001402393650001502407653002502422653002002447653001802467653002502485653001402510700002802524700002102552700002802573700002202601700003602623700003102659773014002690856007802830852000902908655001202917IND60537126720221120142445.0160807e20160407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053712672DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2016-00932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos-Campo, Domingo Jesús10aMuscle damage, physiological changes, and energy balance in ultra-endurance mountain-event athletes  ap. 872-878.  aThe biological response to ultra-endurance mountain race events is not yet well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the biochemical and physiological changes after performing an ultra-endurance mountain race in runners. We recruited 11 amateur runners (age: 29.7 ± 10.2 years; height: 179.7 ± 5.4 cm; body mass: 76.7 ± 10.3 kg). Muscle damage, lactate concentration, energy balance, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), body composition changes, and jump performance were analyzed before, during (only lactate, HR, and HRV), and after the race. Athletes completed 54 km in 6 h, 44 min (±28 min). After the race, myoglobin and creatine kinase concentration increased from 14.9 ± 5.2 to 1419.9 ± 1292.1 μg/L and from 820.0 ± 2087.3 to 2421.1 ± 2336.2 UI/L, respectively (p < 0.01). In addition, lactate dehydrogenase and troponin I significantly increased after the race (p < 0.01). Leukocyte and platelet count increased by 180.6% ± 68.9% and 23.7% ± 11.2%, respectively (p < 0.001). Moreover, after the competition, athletes presented a 3704 kcal negative energy balance; a significant increase in RPE values; a decrease in countermovement and squat jump height; and a decrease in body mass and lower limb girths. During the event, lactate concentration did not change and subjects presented a mean HR of 158.8 ± 17.7 beats/min, a significant decrement in vagal modulation, and a significant increase in sympathetic modulation. Despite the relative “low” intensity achieved, ultra-endurance mountain race is a stressful stimulus that produces a high level of muscle damage in the athletes. These findings may help coaches to design specific training programs that may improve nutritional intake strategies and prevent muscle damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3ablood platelet count 3abody composition 3acreatine kinase 3aeducation programs 3aenergy balance 3afatigue strength 3aheart rate 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactic acid 3aleukocytes 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3amyoglobin 3anutrition 3atroponin I 0aautonomic modulation 0acreatine kinase 0aenergy intake 0alactic dehydrogenase 0amyoglobin1 aÁvila-Gandía, Vicente1 aAlacid, Fernando1 aSoto-Méndez, Fulgencio1 aAlcaraz, Pedro E.1 aLópez-Román, Francisco Javier1 aRubio-Arias, Jacobo Ángel0 tApplied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.g2016 Apr. 7, v. 41, no. 8 p.872-878dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2016-00933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245006100167520145300228592002801681650002001709650001901729650002001748650001601768650001401784650001501798650001601813700001701829700001801846773012201864856008101986852000902067655001202076IND60790973220221119190322.0220826e20220730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079097322DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology90801362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReggiani, Paolo 10aTowards Informed Water Resources Planning and Management  aIn Water Resources Planning and Management, decision makers, although unsure of future outcomes, must take the most reliable and assuring decisions. Deterministic and probabilistic prediction techniques, combined with optimization tools, have been widely used to meet the objective of improving planning as well as management. Bayesian decision approaches are available to link probabilistic predictions to optimized decision schemes, but scientists are not fully able to express themselves in a language familiar to decision makers, who fear basing their decisions on “uncertain” forecasts in the vain belief that deterministic forecasts are more informative and reliable. This situation is even worse in the case of climate change projections, which bring additional degrees of uncertainty into the picture. Therefore, a need emerges to create a common approach and means of communication between scientists, who deal with optimization tools, probabilistic predictions and long-term projections, and operational decision makers, who must be facilitated in understanding, accepting, and acknowledging the benefits arising from operational water resources management based on probabilistic predictions and projections. Our aim here was to formulate the terms of the problem and the rationale for explaining and involving decision makers with the final objective of using probabilistic predictions/projections in their decision-making processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3afearfulness 3ahydrology 3aprediction 3auncertainty1 aTalbi, Amal 1 aTodini, Ezio 0 tHydrology.g2022 July 30, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology90801363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011600173520146100289592002801750650002201778650002601800650001901826650001101845650001901856650001701875650001701892650001401909650000701923650001301930650001101943653001901954653001301973653001001986653001001996653002102006653001402027700002302041700002102064700002102085700002102106700002202127700009702149773011902246856008802365852000902453655001202462IND60656060420221120191042.0191121e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065606042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1337492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiles, Sarah M.10aTolerance and cytotoxicity of naphthenic acids on microorganisms isolated from oil sands process-affected water  aThe expansion of oil sands has made remediation of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) critical. As naphthenic acids (NAs) are the primary contributors to toxicity, remediation is required. Bioremediation by native microorganisms is potentially effective, however, toxicity of NAs towards native microorganisms is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to isolate microorganisms from OSPW, assess tolerance to stressors, including naturally sourced NAs and examine exposure effect of NAs on cell membranes. Microorganisms were isolated from OSPW, including the first reported isolation of a fungus (Trichoderma harzianum) and yeast (Rhodotorula mucilaginosa). Isolates tolerated alkaline pH, high salinity, and NA concentrations far exceeding those typical of OSPW indicating toxic effects of OSPW are likely the result of interactions between OSPW components. Comparisons of toxicity determined that OSPW exhibited higher cytotoxicity than NAs. The fungal isolate was able to grow using commercial NAs as its sole carbon source, indicating high resistance to NAs' cytotoxic effects. Future studies will focus on the organisms' ability to degrade NAs, and subsequent effects on toxicity. Characterization of OSPW constituents should be investigated with focus on the synergistic toxic effects of dissolved compounds. A better understanding of OSPW toxicity would enable more effective and targeted bioremediation schemes by native microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodotorula rubra 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acell membranes 3acytotoxicity 3anaphthenates 3aoil sands 3apH 3asalinity 3ayeasts 0aBioremediation 0aToxicity 0aFungi 0aYeast 0aNaphthenic acids 0aOil sands1 aHofstetter, Simmon1 aEdwards, Timothy1 aDlusskaya, Elena1 aCologgi, Dena L.1 aGänzle, Michael,1 aUlrich, Ania C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0455-1574 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0455-15740 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 695 p.133749-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1337493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245013900166520149100305592002801796650001801824650002001842650002201862650001701884650001701901650001301918650001701931650001501948650001601963650001001979650001601989650001902005650002302024650001502047653001702062653002402079653001902103653002202122653002702144653001802171653002002189653001602209653002102225653001802246700001802264700001102282700001802293700001702311700001702328700001402345700001602359700001502375773009902390856008802489852000902577655001202586IND60779711020221119130935.0220726e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077971102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2022.1132642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Yue10aUndescribed diphenyl ethers betaethrins A-I from a desert plant endophytic strain of the fungus Phoma betae A.B. Frank (Didymellaceae)  aTen diphenyl ethers (DPEs), including nine undescribed analogs named betaethrins A-I, were isolated from the desert plant endophytic fungus Phoma betae A.B. Frank (Didymellaceae). Their structures were determined mainly by NMR, HR-ESI-MS spectral and X-ray diffraction experiments. Betaethrins D-I possessed different fatty acid chains connected with the B-ring, which was the first report in all DPEs. The shielding effect of the B-ring on H-6 (A-ring) in methyl barceloneate, betaethrin A and betaethrins D-F (asterric acid analogs) was first observed and analyzed, which could differentiate the ¹H-NMR chemical shift values of H-4/H-6 without the assistance of 3-OH. An empirical rule was then suggested: the steric hindrance between the A- and B-rings in asterric acid analogs might prevent these two aromatic rings from rotating freely, which led to the ¹H-NMR chemical shift value of H-6 being in the high field zone due to the shielding effect of the B-ring on H-6. Based on the empirical rule, the chemical shift values of the A-ring in methyl barceloneate were revised. The possible biosynthesis of these isolates was postulated. Betaethrin H showed moderate cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and HepG2 cancer cell lines. Betaethrins A-F, H and I displayed strong antioxidant activities. These results further implied that endophytic fungi from unique environments, such as desert plants, with few chemical studies are an important resource of undescribed and bioactive metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDidymellaceae 3aPleospora betae 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3abiphenyl 3acytotoxicity 3aendophytes 3afatty acids 3afungi 3ametabolites 3aneoplasm cells 3aplant biochemistry 3axerophytes 0aDesert plant 0aSuaeda glauca Bunge 0aChenopodiaceae 0aEndophytic fungus 0aPhoma betae A.B. frank 0aDidymellaceae 0aDiphenyl ethers 0aBetaethrins 0aShielding effect 0aBioactivities1 aWang, Yan-Duo1 aLi, Qi1 aXing, Xiao-Ke1 aNiu, Shu-Bin1 aSun, Bing-Da1 aChen, Lin1 aPan, Rui-Le1 aDing, Gang0 tPhytochemistry.g2022 Sept., v. 201 p.113264-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2022.1132643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014100165300001600306520180300322592002802125650002202153650001502175650001302190650001002203650001402213650002102227650001902248650003702267650001202304650000902316650001902325650001402344650000702358650003402365650003302399650001402432650002302446650001802469650000902487653001802496653002602514653001802540653001902558653001702577653003102594653000702625653000802632653000802640653000702648653000802655653000902663653000802672653000902680653000802689653000802697653000902705653000802714653000802722700005602730700001802786700001402804773008302818856008402901852000902985655001202994IND60556719220221120030740.0161102e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055671922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Manjie10aCharacteristics of iron corrosion scales and water quality variations in drinking water distribution systems of different pipe materials  ap. 593-603.  aInteraction between old, corroded iron pipe surfaces and bulk water is crucial to the water quality protection in drinking water distribution systems (WDS). Iron released from corrosion products will deteriorate water quality and lead to red water. This study attempted to understand the effects of pipe materials on corrosion scale characteristics and water quality variations in WDS.A more than 20-year-old hybrid pipe section assembled of unlined cast iron pipe (UCIP) and galvanized iron pipe (GIP) was selected to investigate physico-chemical characteristics of corrosion scales and their effects on water quality variations. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) were used to analyze micromorphology and chemical composition of corrosion scales. In bench testing, water quality parameters, such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation reduction potential (ORP), alkalinity, conductivity, turbidity, color, Fe2+, Fe3+ and Zn2+, were determined. Scale analysis and bench-scale testing results demonstrated a significant effect of pipe materials on scale characteristics and thereby water quality variations in WDS.Characteristics of corrosion scales sampled from different pipe segments show obvious differences, both in physical and chemical aspects. Corrosion scales were found highly amorphous. Thanks to the protection of zinc coatings, GIP system was identified as the best water quality stability, in spite of high zinc release potential. It is deduced that the complicated composition of corrosion scales and structural break by the weld result in the diminished water quality stability in HP system. Measurement results showed that iron is released mainly in ferric particulate form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkalinity 3acoatings 3acolor 3acorrosion 3adissolved oxygen 3adrinking water 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahybrids 3airon 3amicrostructure 3aoxidation 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aturbidity 3awater distribution 3awater quality 3azinc 0aCorroded pipe 0aScale characteristics 0aWater quality 0aPipe materials 0aIron release 0aWater distribution systems 0aDO 0aEDS 0aGIP 0aHP 0aHRT 0aICDD 0aICP 0aLDIP 0aORP 0aSEM 0aUCIP 0aWDS 0aXRD1 aLiu, Zhaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4536-20911 aChen, Yongcan1 aHai, Yang0 tWater research.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 106 p.593-603dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245016900154300001600323520173500339592002802074650001702102650001402119650001602133650002302149650001402172650001302186700002002199700002202219773011502241852000902356856007502365655001202440IND2243822520221119223408.0190314e200012  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224382252DNAL7 a10.1007/BF007658022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Yi Min10aStudy of hydration behavior of wood cement-based composite II: effect of chemical additives on the hydration characteristics and strengths of wood-cement composites  ap. 444-451.  aThe influence of the 30 chemical additives on the hydration characteristics of birch wood-cement-water mixture was determined by measuring the maximum hydration temperature (T ₘₐₓ) and the time (t ₘₐₓ) required to reach the temperature. The chemical additives were tested and divided into two types depending on the pattern of exothermic reaction peak within the 24-h observation period. The wood-cement-water mixtures with additions of each of the 11 type I chemical additives showed a two-peak temperature-time curve similar to that for neat cement. CaCl₂, FeCl₃, and SnCl₂ reached the highestT ₘₐₓ above 50°C. When the 19 type II chemical additives were included, the mixtures offered only one peak hydration temperature-time curve. Among them, the 10 chemical additives caused an obvious temperature increase at the beginning of the hydration reaction. The most significant effect was with the addition of diethanolamine, where the mixture produced aT ₘₐₓ above 50°C. The strength values (modulus of rupture, internal bond strength) of word-cement board were tested with separate additions of the 10 chemical additives arranged by the highestT ₘₐₓ. There was a good positive correlation betweenT ₘₐₓ and the strength values. In addition, the composite chemical additives were preliminarily examined to determine if they accelerated the hydration reaction of blast-furnace slag cement. The results revealed that composite chemical additives evidently accelerated the hydration reaction and the setting of blast-furnace slag cement mixed with wood. Blast-furnace slag cement can thus be considered for use as an acceptable inorganic bonding material for wood-cement panel manufacture.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater uptake 3aadditives 3atemperature 3achemical reactions 3aadhesives 3aduration1 aZhou, Yia Guang1 aTomita, Bunichiro0 tJournal of wood science.g2000 Dec., v. 46, no. 6 p.444-451dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF007658023Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03056naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011900169520151000288592002801798650001701826650003201843650001301875650001701888650001901905650001401924650001101938650001501949650004301964650000902007650001102016650000902027650001702036650001702053650001502070650002502085653004102110653002902151653003102180653002502211653001802236700009102254700001302345773011902358856008802477852000902565655001202574IND60656060520221120191011.0191121e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065606052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1337502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yizhu10aDistribution of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria from six atmospheric environments: Exposure risk to human  aAntibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as an emerging environmental pollutant, have received widespread attention. There are many studies on ARGs in water and soil. However, there are few studies on airborne ARGs. We used qPCR to detect 19 ARG subtypes in six atmospheric environments. Among the different atmospheric environments including wastewater treatment plant (fine screens and sludge thickener), bathroom, laboratory, hospital and outdoor, the highest total concentration of ARGs is detected in the haze outdoor (9 × 105 copies/m3), while the lowest is in the bathroom atmosphere (4.2 × 104 copies/m3). Furthermore, β-lactam ARGs are found to be the dominant ARGs in these 6 atmospheric environments. Due to the large number and widespread use of antibiotics, the airborne ARGs in hospital have the highest diversity and equitability. The β-lactam ARGs are significantly positively correlated with sulfonamides ARGs, indicating the mechanism of co-resistance since these two ARGs may be on the same genetic elements and thus simultaneously exhibit both resistances. The network analysis provides potential host information between the airborne ARGs and the coexisted microbial taxa. Sphingomonas and Bradyhizoblum strains presumably host for tetracycline and β-lactam ARGs, respectively. The ADDoutdoor of blaTEM-1 was 7.8 × 105 copies/d/kg, more than the ADD (7.6 × 103 copies/d/kg) of blaTEM-1 by drinking water. We can't ignore ARGs in the atmospheric environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphingomonas 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacteria 3abeta-lactams 3adrinking water 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3apollutants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asludge 3asoil 3asulfonamides 3atetracycline 3athickeners 3awastewater treatment 0aAirborne antibiotic resistance genes 0aAtmospheric environments 0aHigh-throughput sequencing 0aCorrelation analysis 0aExposure risk1 aWang, Can1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3575-5975 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3575-59751 aSong, Lu0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 694 p.133750-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1337503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014000171506010400311506007600415520131900491592002801810506003701838650002301875650001201898650002501910650001001935650001601945650001901961650001001980650000901990650001701999650002102016653002102037653001702058653001702075653001602092653002702108700002402135700002302159700002702182700003402209700002402243773010802267856008202375852000902457655001202466IND60779711120221207095551.0220829e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077971112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2022.1019922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasr, Mohammed A.F.10aGrowth, carcass parameters, biochemical and oxidative stress indices, and meat traits of duck breeds under different stocking densities  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis investigation was aimed to inspect if there is an influence of various stocking density on growth, carcass parameters, blood indices, and meat traits of Muscovy and Mallard ducks.

Group one (SD₁) was 5 ducks/m², while group 2 (SD₂) was 7 ducks/m² and group 3 (SD₃) was 9 ducks/m². The growth, carcass parameters, meat quality, blood indices were calculated. Body weight of SD₁ was 18 and 4.5% heavier than SD₂, while, it was 29.5 and 12% heavier than SD₃ of Muscovy and Mallard duck breeds, respectively. SD₃ possessed the highest levels of, H/L, ALT, AST, LDL, VLDL, and MDA with the lowest levels of lymphocyte, SOD,GSH, GPX, C3, total antioxidant capacity and IGG of both ducks' breeds. The carcass weight decreased by 40 and 15% from SD₁ to SD₃ in Muscovy and mallard ducks, respectively. The dressing % was highest at SD₁ (84 and 83%) when compared with SD₃(71and80%) of Muscovy and Mallard ducks, respectively. Cooking loss was 20 and 16% greater in group three when compared with group one in Muscovy and Mallard ducks, respectively.

However, the application of LCA methodology in the field of wastewater treatment is still in progress. This paper has made a review of the LCA studies dealing with biological (activated sludge) WWTPs, with the aim to provide qualitative interpretation of the associated environmental impact categories: eutrophication potential, global warming potential, toxicity-related impacts, energy balance, water use, land use and other impact categories. Possible sources for each impact category of WWTPs are summarized in order to provide information about the critical aspects in WWTP systems that might influence LCA results. Moreover, recent development and the application status of characterization models for each impact category have been reviewed. The analysis indicates that it is important to carry out site-specific LCA studies on WWTPs. The specificity is most typical for the eutrophication potential and toxicity-related impact categories, which need implementation of spatial differentiated characterization methods, considering the emission location, spatial dimensions (transfer between environmental compartments) and even properties of pollutants. Although remarkable progresses have been obtained, their applications in the field of wastewater treatment are still limited. For the global warming potential impact category, it is most crucial to calculate accurately the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, because nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), as well as fossil origin carbon dioxide (CO2) in wastewater have the potential to make considerable contributions. In the end, prospective is made about which aspects in WWTPs are candidates for further LCA studies. Overall, there is still room for pursuing more accurate results when applying LCA to WWTPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abiological assessment 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy balance 3aenvironmental impact 3aeutrophication 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aland use 3alife cycle assessment 3amethane 3amodels 3anitrous oxide 3apollutants 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aLife cycle assessment 0aWastewater treatment plant 0aLife cycle impact category 0aCharacterization model1 aLi, Yi1 aWang, Chao1 aZhang, Wenlong1 aXiong, Wei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Nov. 16, v. 107 p.676-692dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.05.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013600167300001200303500001900315520125000334592002801584596003401612596003201646650001901678650001301697650002301710650001501733650001101748650003301759650001901792650001201811650001901823650001101842700002201853700002001875700005801895773011801953856008302071852000902154655001202163IND60718747820221121013433.0201204e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071874782DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-020-02545-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaishnav, Avni10aUtilization of mixed fruit waste for exopolysaccharide production by Bacillus species SRA4: medium formulation and its optimization  ap. 550.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe main focus of this research work was to carry out the fermentative production of EPS with mixed fruit waste as substrate. The medium formulation studied by sequential addition of medium components and replacement of sugar with mixed fruit waste. Amongst the six species of Bacillus studied, Bacillus species SRA4 produced EPS in range of 3.0–17.9 g/L, which was highest amongst all the species selected for the study. Thus for further optimization, the response surface methodology was used making use of Bacillus species SRA4. EPS production enhanced to 23.75 g/L. In 10 L shake flask and fermenter scale-up study was carried out. In the study, 10 L flask showed the highest EPS production of 17.95 g/L in 120 h, whereas in 10 L fermenter, it was as high as 25.1 g/L that too in 72 h only. The optimization study resulted in 1.76-fold increase in EPS production with nearly 48 h reduction in EPS production time as compared to initial production procedure. Replacement of sucrose with fruit waste extract made the process environmentally friendly; omission of L-cystine and use of 50% reduced amount of sodium acetate in the medium lowered the production cost of EPS. This method also solved the fruit waste disposal problem.  aPublisher supplied data  aInspire fellowshipcDST India  aEmeritus fellowcUGC, India 3aculture flasks 3acysteine 3aexopolysaccharides 3afermenters 3afruits 3aresponse surface methodology 3asodium acetate 3asucrose 3awaste disposal 3awastes1 aUpadhayay, Kinjal1 aTipre, Devayani1 aDave, Shailesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2153-15780 t3 Biotech.g2020 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.550-550dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02545-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011700176300001600293520121700309592002801526650001501554650001101569650001501580650003801595650002601633650001901659650000901678650001601687650001901703650001101722650002101733650001901754650003901773650001601812650001301828650001301841650002701854650005801881650001101939650001101950651002201961653002101983653002002004653001602024653001502040653001302055653001302068700003002081700002302111700002002134700002002154700002102174700001702195700001902212773007602231856008502307852000902392655001202401IND60545122020221121014258.0161019e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054512202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2015.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaustsen, Andreas H.10aDanger in the reef: Proteome, toxicity, and neutralization of the venom of the olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis  ap. 187-196.  aFour specimens of the olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, were collected off the coast of Western Australia, and the venom proteome was characterized and quantitatively estimated by RP-HPLC, SDS-PAGE, and MALDI-TOF-TOF analyses. A. laevis venom is remarkably simple and consists of phospholipases A2 (71.2%), three-finger toxins (3FTx; 25.3%), cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP; 2.5%), and traces of a complement control module protein (CCM; 0.2%). Using a Toxicity Score, the most lethal components were determined to be short neurotoxins. Whole venom had an intravenous LD50 of 0.07 mg/kg in mice and showed a high phospholipase A2 activity, but no proteinase activity in vitro. Preclinical assessment of neutralization and ELISA immunoprofiling showed that BioCSL Sea Snake Antivenom was effective in cross-neutralizing A. laevis venom with an ED50 of 821 μg venom per mL antivenom, with a binding preference towards short neurotoxins, due to the high degree of conservation between short neurotoxins from A. laevis and Enhydrina schistosa venom. Our results point towards the possibility of developing recombinant antibodies or synthetic inhibitors against A. laevis venom due to its simplicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantivenoms 3acoasts 3acomplement 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aintravenous injection 3alethal dose 50 3amice 3aneurotoxins 3aneutralization 3aolives 3aphospholipase A2 3aphospholipases 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3aproteome 3arecombinant antibodies 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asnakes 3avenoms 3aWestern Australia 0aAipysurus laevis 0aOlive sea snake 0aSnake venom 0aProteomics 0aToxicity 0aVenomics1 aGutíerrez, José María,1 aRasmussen, Arne R.1 aEngmark, Mikael1 aGravlund, Peter1 aSanders, Kate L.1 aLohse, Brian1 aLomonte, Bruno0 tToxicon.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 107 p.187-196dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2015.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013700168300001600305520219900321592002802520650001702548650001902565650001902584650002102603650002002624650001002644650001402654650002502668650001602693650003302709650002502742650002502767650000902792650001802801651001202819653000802831653001702839653002202856653002102878653001802899653002502917700003102942700002902973700003003002773009803032856008503130852000903215655001203224IND60546989220221119084722.0170711e20151116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054698922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.05.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiero, Monia10aHow to manage uncertainty in future Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) scenarios addressing the effect of climate change in crop production  ap. 693-706.  aWhen Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to provide insights on how to pursue future food demand, it faces the challenge to describe scenarios of the future in which the environmental impacts occur. In the case of future crop production, the effects of climate change should be considered. In this context, the objectives of this paper are two-fold: (i) to recommend an approach to deal with uncertainty in scenario analysis for LCA of crop production in a changed climate, when the goal of the study is to suggest strategies for adaptation of crop cultivation practices towards low environmental impacts, and (ii) to implement the suggested approach to spring barley cultivation in Denmark. First, the main implications of climate change for future crop cultivation are analyzed, and the factors which should be included when modeling the climate change effects on crops through LCA are introduced, namely climate, soil, water loss and production parameters. Secondly, the handling of these factors in the inventory modeling is discussed and finally implemented in the case study. Our approach follows a 3-step procedure consisting of: (1) definition of a baseline scenario at the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) level for the selected crop and performance of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) including normalization and contribution analysis, in order to identify the focus points in terms of impact categories, unit processes and substances; (2) identification of the main deviations from the baseline scenario for these key parameters in alternative future scenarios; (3) comparison of the different scenarios including quantification of the uncertainty at inventory level.The procedure presented was successfully implemented to assess the consequences of the changed climate on Danish spring barley cultivated under future climate conditions. The LCA results, obtained using mainly primary data from phytotron experiments mimicking a future Danish climate, emphasized that adaptation strategies should prioritize the development of resilient and stable cultivars, i.e. robust to the expected extremes of the future climate and offering a reasonable yield under different climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3acrop production 3acrops 3acultivars 3aenvironmental impact 3ainventories 3alife cycle impact assessment 3alife cycle inventory 3ascenario uncertainty 3asoil 3aspring barley 3aDenmark 0aLCI 0aPrimary data 0aScenario analysis 0aHotspot analysis 0aNormalization 0aUncertainty analysis1 aIngvordsen, Cathrine Heinz1 aJørgensen, Rikke Bagger1 aHauschild, Michael Zwicky0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Nov. 16, v. 107 p.693-706dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.05.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245005900205300002000264500001900284520194800303592002802251650002202279650001502301650002002316650002802336650001702364700005902381773013802440856008002578852000902658655001202667IND60716528520221119175158.0201105e20201027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071652852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c079772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManna, Biswajit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0409-800410aExciton Dynamics in Pyrene and Perylene Nanoaggregates  ap. 24470-24487.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhotophysical and diffusion properties of excitons generated in perylene and pyrene nanoaggregates have been investigated using steady state as well as time-resolved absorption and emission spectroscopic techniques. The average sizes and heights of the nanoaggregates prepared by the reprecipitation method have been estimated as 120 ± 20 and 60 ± 10 nm, respectively. X-ray diffraction spectra reveal that molecular packing in these nanoaggregates is very similar to that in the α-form (face-to-face pair or dimeric structure) of the crystals, but with possibilities of a large number of disordered regions consisting of monomer molecules. Therefore, following photoexcitation of nanoaggregates, both monomeric and dimeric exciton states are populated. This work, for the first time, could reveal the dynamics of interactions between these two kinds of exciton states, because of which the photophysical and diffusion properties of the excitons are significantly different from those in single crystals. Population yield of the dimeric self-trapped exciton or E state, which is the lowest energy exciton state, is negligibly small via self-trapping of dimeric excitons (dimeric channel) in the <200 ps time domain because of efficient energy transfer from dimeric excitons to monomers. However, the monomeric excitons, which are populated either independently through direct photoexcitation or by energy transfer from the dimeric excitons, contribute to an additional (monomeric) channel populating the E state via energy transfer processes occurring in the nanosecond (ns) time domain. Diffusion coefficients and diffusion lengths of the monomeric excitons estimated in both these nanoaggregates are comparable to those in the β-form of the crystals but much larger than those values reported for the α-form and hence ensure a better or comparable efficiency of energy migration in nanoaggregates as compared to that of single crystals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aenergy transfer 3aphotochemical reactions 3aspectroscopy1 aPalit, Dipak K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0262-90780 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Oct. 27, v. 124, no. 44 p.24470-24487dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c079773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015300166300001600319520172400335592002802059650001202087650001502099650001302114650001102127650001702138650001902155650002002174650001702194650001302211650001902224650001702243650000902260650000702269650001002276650000902286650002002295650001602315650001702331653002802348653001902376653001902395653002802414653002902442653001902471700001202490700001402502700001602516700001202532700002002544700001702564773008302581856008402664852000902748655001202757IND60556719520221120030739.0161115e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055671952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Wenhai10aCopper increases reductive dehalogenation of haloacetamides by zero-valent iron in drinking water: Reduction efficiency and integrated toxicity risk  ap. 141-150.  aThe haloacetamides (HAcAms), an emerging class of nitrogen-containing disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs), are highly cytotoxic and genotoxic, and typically occur in treated drinking waters at low μg/L concentrations. Since many drinking distribution and storage systems contain unlined cast iron and copper pipes, reactions of HAcAms with zero-valent iron (ZVI) and metallic copper (Cu) may play a role in determining their fate. Moreover, ZVI and/or Cu are potentially effective HAcAm treatment technologies in drinking water supply and storage systems. This study reports that ZVI alone reduces trichloroacetamide (TCAcAm) to sequentially form dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm) and then monochloroacetamide (MCAcAm), whereas Cu alone does not impact HAcAm concentrations. The addition of Cu to ZVI significantly improved the removal of HAcAms, relative to ZVI alone. TCAcAm and their reduction products (DCAcAm and MCAcAm) were all decreased to below detection limits at a molar ratio of ZVI/Cu of 1:1 after 24 h reaction (ZVI/TCAcAm = 0.18 M/5.30 μM). TCAcAm reduction increased with the decreasing pH from 8.0 to 5.0, but values from an integrated toxic risk assessment were minimised at pH 7.0, due to limited removal MCAcAm under weak acid conditions (pH = 5.0 and 6.0). Higher temperatures (40 °C) promoted the reductive dehalogenation of HAcAms. Bromine was preferentially removed over chlorine, thus brominated HAcAms were more easily reduced than chlorinated HAcAms by ZVI/Cu. Although tribromoacetamide was more easily reduced than TCAcAm during ZVI/Cu reduction, treatment of tribromoacetamide resulted in a higher integrated toxicity risk than TCAcAm, due to the formation of monobromoacetamide (MBAcAm).  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3abyproducts 3achlorine 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3adehalogenation 3adetection limit 3adisinfection 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3agenotoxicity 3airon 3apH 3apipes 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atemperature 3awater supply 0aDisinfection byproducts 0aHaloacetamides 0aDechlorination 0aZero-valent iron/copper 0aIntegrated toxicity risk 0aDrinking water1 aLi, Xin1 aBond, Tom1 aGao, Naiyun1 aBin, Xu1 aWang, Qiongfang1 aDing, Shunke0 tWater research.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 107 p.141-150dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014900165300001600314500001500330520130800345592002801653650002501681650002601706650001701732650001901749650002001768650001701788650001501805650002301820650001901843650002201862653003001884653001001914653001301924653001801937653001101955653001801966700001301984700001601997700001502013700001402028700001902042700001602061700001702077700001702094700001802111773012102129856008202250852000902332655001202341IND60533134620221123023032.0160728e20150306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053313462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.01.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Quizhi,10aLeukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer cells and involved in cell proliferation and invasion  ap. 399-404.  a2019-12-06  aPrevious studies have shown that leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1) is expressed on most types of hamatopoietic cells and negatively regulate immune response, but the roles of LAIR-1 in tumor of the non-hematopoietic lineage have not been determined. Despite advances in therapy of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), many questions relating to EOC pathogenesis remain unanswered. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of LAIR-1 expression in EOC and explore the possible association between LAIR-1 and cancer. In this study, a tissue microarray containing 78 ovarian cancer cases was stained following a standard immunohistochemical protocol for LAIR-1 and the correlation of LAIR-1 expression with clinicopathologic features was assessed. LAIR-1 was detected to express in tumor cells of ovarian cancer tissues (73.1%) and EOC cell lines COC1 and HO8910, not in normal ovarian tissues. In addition, LAIR-1 expression correlates significantly with tumor grade (p = 0.004). Furthermore, down-regulation of LAIR-1 in HO8910 cells increased cell proliferation, colony formation and cell invasion. These data suggest that LAIR-1 has a relevant impact on EOC progression and may be helpful for a better understanding of molecular pathogenesis of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amicroarray technology 3atherapeutics 3aneoplasm cells 3aimmune response 3apathogenesis 3aepithelium 3acell proliferation 3aanimal ovaries 3aovarian neoplasms 0aEpithelial ovarian cancer 0ashRNA 0aInvasion 0acell invasion 0aLAIR-1 0aProliferation1 aFu, Aili1 aYang, Shude1 aHe, Xiaoli1 aWang, Yue1 aZhang, Xiaoshu1 aZhou, Jiadi1 aLuan, Xiying1 aYu, Wenzheng1 aXue, Jiangnan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Mar. 06, v. 458 p.399-404dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.01.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009900169300001600268520184200284592002802126650001502154650001302169650002702182650001602209650001202225650001402237650001602251650001302267650001702280650002002297650000902317650001102326650001202337650002102349650002502370650002202395650001102417650001802428650001102446651001302457653001902470653002302489700002202512700002002534700002102554700001702575700002202592700001902614700001702633700001902650700002502669773013702694856008602831852000902917655001202926IND60761320920221119232402.0220130e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076132092DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2021.19002412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeed, Farhan10aAmino acid profile and safety assessment of infant formula available in local market, Pakistan  ap. 533-543.  aThe objective of the present research work was to explore the nutritional composition of different infant formulas and determine the safety status of these products. For this purpose, different infant formula brands were procured from the local market of Faisalabad, Pakistan. After the collection of these different brands, nutritional composition, i.e. fat, protein, ash, moisture and fiber was determined whilst the microbial analysis, such as Salmonella, Yeasts and Molds Count, and Total Bacteria Count, was carried out through their methods. In addition, the amino acid profile was assessed through paper chromatography. Furthermore, an appropriate statistical design was carried out to determine the level of significance. Mean values for amino acids, i.e. lysine, valine and cysteine varied from 3.06 g/100 g to 6.63 g/100 g, 4.90 g/100 g to 6.51 g/100 g, and 2.32 g/100 g to 3.04 g/100 g, respectively, in different brands of infant formula. Moreover, moisture content, crude proteins, crude fat, crude fiber, ash content, and nitrogen-free extract (NFE) varied from 1.6% to 3.83%, 10.55% to 14.67%, 9.82% to 26.63%, 1.00% to 4.13%, 1.87% to 4.20%, and 51.03% to 69.17%, respectively. It is evident from the microbiological analyses that Salmonella was not present in any brand of infant formula. Whereas yeast and mold counts were ≤2 cfu/g to ≤10 cfu/g in different brands. Moreover, total bacteria count was exhibited in the range of 1.5 × 10³cfu/g to 6.3 × 10³ cfu/g among different brands. Local infant formulas contained high amounts of heavy metals, i.e. 0.99 pp, of lead content followed by cadmium and aluminum as 0.28–0.98 ppm and 1.48–2.05 ppm, respectively. Conclusively, it is evident from whole research that local brands contained higher contents of heavy metal as compared to branded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aaluminum 3aamino acid composition 3aash content 3acadmium 3acrude fat 3acrude fiber 3acysteine 3aheavy metals 3ainfant formulas 3alead 3alysine 3amarkets 3anutrient content 3apaper chromatography 3asafety assessment 3avaline 3awater content 3ayeasts 3aPakistan 0aInfant formula 0aamino acid profile1 aUllah Khan, Azmat1 aMushtaq, Zarina1 aAfzaal, Muhammad1 aNiaz, Bushra1 aHussain, Muzzamal1 aHameed, Ayesha1 aAhmad, Awais1 aAnjum, Faqir M1 aSuleria, Hafiz Ansar0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.533-543dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1532-23867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2021.19002413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006400138245012000202500002000322520150900342592002801851596007501879596008301954596007102037596003202108596005202140650001302192650000902205650001602214650001302230650002102243650002002264650002402284650001602308650000902324650001002333650002102343700002202364700006202386700006202448773010802510856007302618852000902691655001202700IND60790666220221119182723.0220826e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079066622DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.3102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Hannah M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4655-625010aNodal root diameter and node number in maize (Zea mays L.) interact to influence plant growth under nitrogen stress  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnder nitrogen limitation, plants increase resource allocation to root growth relative to shoot growth. The utility of various root architectural and anatomical phenotypes for nitrogen acquisition are not well understood. Nodal root number and root cross‐sectional area were evaluated in maize in field and greenhouse environments. Nodal root number and root cross‐sectional area were inversely correlated under both high and low nitrogen conditions. Attenuated emergence of root nodes, as opposed to differences in the number of axial roots per node, was associated with substantially reduced root number. Greater root cross‐sectional area was associated with a greater stele area and number of cortical cell files. Genotypes that produced few, thick nodal roots rather than many, thin nodal roots had deeper rooting and better shoot growth in low nitrogen environments. Fewer nodal roots offset the respiratory and nitrogen costs of thicker diameter roots, since total nodal root respiration and nitrogen content was similar for genotypes with many, thin and few, thick nodal roots. We propose that few, thick nodal roots may enable greater capture of deep soil nitrogen and improve plant performance under nitrogen stress. Synergistic interactions between an architectural and anatomical trait may be an important strategy for nitrogen acquisition. Understanding trait interactions among different root nodes has important implications in for improving crop nutrient uptake and stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013‐02682cUSDA | National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)  a2014‐67013‐21572cUSDA | National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)  aPen04732cUSDA | National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)  cHoward G Buffett Foundation  aDE‐AR0000821cU.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3aresource allocation 3aroot growth 3asoil 3astele 3astress tolerance1 aYang, Jennifer T.1 aBrown, Kathleen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4960-52921 aLynch, Jonathan P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7265-97900 tPlant direct.g2021 Mar., v. 5, no. 3 p.e00310-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.3103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245010900178520172600287592002802013650001302041650001202054650001902066650001402085650001002099650001302109653002502122653001002147653002502157653003202182700002402214700002602238700002302264773010502287856008702392852000902479655001202488IND60761101320221119183707.0220118e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076110132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1059822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStolzenburg, Maribeth10aLuminosity with large amplitude pulses after the initial breakdown stage in intracloud lightning flashes  aOptical data are presented for two intracloud flashes in which there were five events having large amplitude, bipolar electric field change (E-change) pulses and strong VHF emissions. These bright events occurred 18.98–67.33 ms after the initiating event and 10–59 ms after the end of the initial breakdown stage. The three largest events were coincident with WorldWide Lightning Location Network detections of the sort previously associated with terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs); these pulses had range-normalized E-change amplitudes of 8.73, 8.33, and 3.81 V/m and estimated peak current magnitudes of 262, 250, and 114 kA. The other two events were 3.20 and 1.62 V/m (96 and 49 kA). All five events have bright enhanced luminosity (>10% above background) for durations of 0.7–1.20 ms, similar to durations of their moderate-to-strong VHF emissions. Full-frame peak intensities are factors of 1.82–4.46 times the background level. Maximum cumulative intensity in the camera frame occurs 84–98 μs after the E-change peak in three cases and ranges from −10 μs (before) to +115 μs (after) for all cases. Notably, in all five events the luminosity starts increasing when the E-change and VHF sensors begin detecting oscillations, 135–550 μs before the E-change peak. Pulse locations of each event extend through 3.6 to 4.3 km depth, starting below and ending above the altitude of flash initiation, and the linear path-length of activity with these events is estimated at 8.9–11.3 km within radar reflectivities of 20–40 dBZ. Although these events are not initial breakdown pulses, their luminosity could be visible from satellite-borne instruments and they may be associated with TGFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acameras 3aelectric field 3alightning 3aradar 3aresearch 0aIntracloud lightning 0aWWLLN 0aLightning luminosity 0aTerrestrial gamma-ray flash1 aMarshall, Thomas C.1 aBaṇḍāra, Sampat,1 aSiedlecki, Raymond0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 267 p.105982-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1059823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010800167300001400275520117500289592002801464650001401492650002101506650002101527650002001548650002801568650001701596650002501613650001601638653002501654653001401679653002701693653003001720653001301750653002401763700001701787700001801804700001701822773011101839856008501950852000902035655001202044IND60634706620221118053537.0190325e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063470662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Guangji13aAn integrated chemical management methodology for hydraulic fracturing: A fuzzy-based indexing approach  ap. 63-75.  aA fuzzy-based indexing approach was developed for the management of hydraulic fracturing chemical additives. The environmental and human health hazards of an additive are converted to hazard indices using an indexing system. To account for uncertainties, a fuzzy-based approach is adopted based on fuzzy inference and fuzzy clustering analysis to assess the risk potential of different additives for informed chemical management decision making. The assessment of the randomly selected additives showed that this fuzzy-based indexing approach gave different chemical hazard assessment results for about 30% of the assessed additives. This shows that accounting for uncertainties using this methodology can lead to better informed chemical management decision making. The hazard assessment results also indicate that based on current indexing methodology more than half of the additives permitted for use in hydraulic fracturing operations are considered moderate environmental and human health hazards. However, based on the new fuzzy-based approach the majority (80%) of the additives were identified as low and very low risk potential due to their low use frequencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3achemical hazards 3acluster analysis 3adecision making 3ahazard characterization 3ahuman health 3ahydraulic fracturing 3auncertainty 0aHydraulic fracturing 0aAdditives 0aFuzzy inference system 0aFuzzy clustering analysis 0aIndexing 0aChemical management1 aKaur, Manjot1 aHewage, Kasun1 aSadiq, Rehan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 20, v. 187 p.63-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245009400169520174100263592002802004650001902032650001202051650002002063650002202083650001202105650002102117650002002138651000902158700002002167773011902187856007302306852000902379655001202388IND60653376820221119065924.0190714e20180813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337682DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafari Shalamzari, Masoud10aAssessing Water Scarcity Using the Water Poverty Index (WPI) in Golestan Province of Iran  aPopulation growth and rising water demand, climate change, severe droughts, and land-use changes are among the top severe issues in Iran. Water management in this country is sectoral and disintegrated. Each authority evaluates water based on its final intention and there is no commonplace indicator for evaluation programs. In this research, we used the Water Poverty Index (WPI) to map the status of water scarcity in a north-eastern province of Iran. Water poverty was measured based on five components of &ldquo;Resources&rdquo;, &ldquo;Access&rdquo;, &ldquo;Capacity&rdquo;, &ldquo;Use&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Environment&rdquo;. The scores on each component were then aggregated using the weighted multiplicative function, assuming equal weights for all components. The overall WPI was evaluated to be 41.1, signaling an alarming and serious water poverty in the study area. Based on the results, Azadshahr (29.1) and Gorgan (61.6) districts had the worst and the best conditions among all cases, respectively. To better understand the importance of WPI components, four weighting alternatives were used; however, none of them resulted in a tangible improvement of WPI index. The cross-correlation between the components was also evaluated, with Access and Capacity showing significant results. Leaving out &ldquo;Capacity&rdquo;, however, reduced WPI by 8.1. In total, &ldquo;Access&rdquo;, &ldquo;Capacity&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Use&rdquo; had the highest correlation with WPI, implying that any attempt to improve water poverty in the province must firstly tackle these issues. This study showed that WPI is an effective indicator of water scarcity assessment and could be used to make priorities for policy-making and water management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aland use change 3apopulation growth 3apoverty 3awater management 3awater shortages 3aIran1 aZhang, Wanchang0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 13, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013700169300001600306500001500322520167300337592002802010650002802038650002802066650002902094650002202123650002002145650002202165650001402187650001302201650001702214651001302231653002402244700001902268700001802287773010302305856004802408852000902456655001202465IND50060820020221120235717.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006082002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-012-0300-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWale, Haile Adamu10aPlant community and ecological analysis of woodland vegetation in Metema Area, Amhara National Regional State, Northwestern Ethiopia  ap. 599-607.  a2019-12-06  aWe studied woodland vegetation in broad-leaved deciduous woodlands of Metema in northwestern Amhara regional state, Ethiopia to determine plant community types and species distribution patterns and their relationships with environmental variables, including altitude, pH, cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity (EC), and moisture. We used a selective approach with a systematic sampling design. A total of 74 quadrats, each 25m × 25m at intervals of 150–200 m were sampled along the established transect lines. For herbaceous vegetation and soil data collection, five subquadrats each 1m × 1m were established at the four corners and the center of each quadrat. Three community types were identified using TWINSPAN analysis. All three community types showed high diversity (Shannon-Weiner index), the highest in community type II at 3.55. The highest similarity coefficient was 0.49 (49%) between community types II and III, reflecting 0.51 (51%) dissimilarity in their species richness. The canonical correspondence ordination diagram revealed that the distribution pattern of community type I was explained by moisture while that of community types III and II was explained by EC and altitude and moisture, respectively. Altitude was the most statistically significant environmental variable, followed by moisture and EC in determining the total variation in species composition and distribution patterns while pH and cation exchange capacity were non significant. In conclusion, we recommend that any intervention should take into account these three discrete community types and their environmental settings to make the intervention more successful.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3aelectrical conductivity 3acation exchange capacity 3aplant communities 3adata collection 3aspecies diversity 3awoodlands 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3aEthiopia 0aspecies differences1 aBekele, Tamrat1 aDalle, Gemedo0 tJournal of forestry research.g2012 Dec., v. 23, no. 4 p.599-607dSpringer-Verlagx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-012-0300-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03825naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100004100152245008700193520200800280592002802288650002102316650002402337650002602361650002202387650000902409650001302418650002502431650001302456650001202469651001102481653001902492653003002511653000902541653002302550653003302573700004202606700002702648700001802675700001702693700002302710700002502733700003002758700003002788700002202818700001802840700004202858700003702900700001802937700003402955700002902989700002803018773010503046856008703151852000903238655001203247IND60761101520221119183657.0220118e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076110152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1059842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira-Júnior, José Francisco de10aUrban rainfall in the Capitals of Brazil: Variability, trend, and wavelet analysis  aThe patterns of urban rainfall in Brazil's capitals are critical, due to population growth and extreme weather. Therefore, the objectives are: i) to identify homogeneous rainfall groups and meteorological systems, ii) to evaluate the trend of the monthly rainfall time series and iii) to apply wavelet analysis to estimate the variance at different frequencies in the rainfall series in the capitals of the Brazil. Monthly rainfall data during 1960–2020 for 27 stations located in the capitals of Brazil were used. The data were flawed, and data imputation (mtsdi package) was applied via Fully Conditional Specification (FCS). Rainfall data were submitted to descriptive, exploratory statistics (boxplot), multivariate analysis (Cluster Analysis - CA) and the Mann-Kendall (MK) test. Seven CA methods (Ward, Single, Complete, Average, McQuity, Median and Centroid) were tested using the cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC) with a significance level of 5%, the Average method obtained CCC > 0.81 (S). The CA identified three homogeneous regions (G1, G2 and G3) in the capitals of Brazil. The G1 group is formed by the capitals of the Northeast of Brazil (NEB), except for Boa Vista, (North of Brazil - NB). The G2 group is the largest group formed by the capitals of the Midwest (MWB), Southeast (SEB) and South (SB) of Brazil. The G3 group is the smallest group, with the capitals of the NB and some of the NEB. The capitals with the category of significant growth trend were only Porto Alegre and Florianópolis (SB), Vitória (SEB) and Belém (NB). The category of non-significant increase trend prevailed in most capitals of Brazil, with emphasis on the corridor formed between the NB and the Center-South, except for Natal (NEB). The without trend category prevailed in the North, Northeast and Midwest regions of Brazil. Monthly precipitation analyzes for trend detection purposes via Wavelet Analysis showed that ENSO phases are significant in rainfall variability in Brazilian capitals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3ameteorological data 3amultivariate analysis 3apopulation growth 3arain 3aresearch 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3awavelet 3aBrazil 0aUrban rainfall 0aClimatic variability mode 0aENSO 0aTrends of rainfall 0aLong-term trends in rainfall1 aCorreia Filho, Washington Luiz Félix1 aMonteiro, Lua da Silva1 aShah, Munawar1 aHafeez, Amna1 aGois, Givanildo de1 aLyra, Gustavo Bastos1 aCarvalho, Marcel Abreu de1 aBarros Santiago, Dimas de1 aSousa, Amaury de,1 aMendes, David1 aSouza Costa, Carlos Eduardo Aguiar de1 aBlanco, Claudio José Cavalcante1 aZeri, Marcelo1 aPimentel, Luiz Cláudio Gomes1 aJamjareegulgarn, Punyawi1 aSilva, Elania Barros da0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 267 p.105984-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1059843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010900174300002000283520108900303592002801392650003901420650001901459650002001478650001101498650002001509650001401529650003401543700002101577700002001598773011301618856008601731852000901817655001201826IND60556281120170413000000.0161102e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055628112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b033632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrášek, Zdeněk10aConfocal Luminescence Lifetime Imaging with Variable Scan Velocity and Its Application to Oxygen Sensing  ap. 10736-10743.  aThe dependence of the luminescence lifetime on the probe environment is the basis of a range of sensing techniques. The major advantage of using the lifetime as the sensitive parameter is its independence on the probe concentration. However, the instrumentation for lifetime measurements is complex, generally requiring time-resolved excitation and detection. Here, we present a simple method for the measurement of luminescence lifetimes on the microsecond scale based on variable excitation time determined by the scanning velocity. The technique is implemented in a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), thus allowing not only simple lifetime measurement but also phosphorescence lifetime imaging. Since the method exploits the spatiotemporal dependence of sample excitation in a CLSM, there is no need for a pulsed or modulated light source or for additional time-resolved detection. The method can be realized in a standard CLSM without any modifications. The principle is demonstrated on oxygen sensing by collisional quenching of an oxygen-sensitive ruthenium(II) complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aimage analysis 3ainstrumentation 3aoxygen 3aphosphorescence 3aruthenium 3ascanning electron microscopes1 aBolivar, Juan M.1 aNidetzky, Bernd0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 88, no. 21 p.10736-10743dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b033633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006200168300001400230520146600244592002801710650002001738650002301758650001501781650002001796650001701816650001801833650002901851650001601880651001201896653002301908653002101931653002501952653003501977700001802012700001902030700002002049773011102069856008502180852000902265655001202274IND60634706820221118053530.0190325e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063470682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeura, Pekka10aRegional impacts of sustainable energy in western Finland  ap. 85-97.  aThe scope of this research is to make quantitative estimates of the potential economic and employment impacts of renewable energy self-sufficiency. The study aims to make generalizations on a regional, or even national level, and to give directions for future research. This paper analyses direct monetary values and employment impacts in two regions, in a theoretical situation where all energy is produced by renewables from the respective region.Renewable energy, especially utilization of existing but presently unused resources, can play an important role in vitalizing regional economies, especially in rural areas. The money spent on fossil energy could be kept circulating in the regional economy. The amount spent on energy in the research areas was almost €4860 per capita per year, totalling more than €300 m annually. The existing data shows that there is the potential for self-sufficiency, or even surplus production. The results suggest that the regional economic impacts increase considerably if the region is self-sufficient in raw materials, including intermediates. On a larger scale, e.g., nationally, the loss of jobs in the fossil energy industry and the eventual variations within economies potentially based on renewable energy, will affect the overall impacts.There is at present insufficient scientific literature, knowledge or quantitative data for analysing these impacts thoroughly. This paper contributes to filling this gap.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic impact 3aeconomic valuation 3aemployment 3aenergy industry 3afossil fuels 3araw materials 3arenewable energy sources 3arural areas 3aFinland 0aSustainable energy 0aRegional economy 0aRegional value added 0aRenewable energy sources (RES)1 aHaapanen, Ari1 aReini, Kaarina1 aTörmä, Hannu,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 20, v. 187 p.85-97dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245011400177500001900291520140800310592002801718650001501746650001901761650002601780650001101806650002301817650001801840650001301858650001301871650001301884650001801897650001601915653001901931653001301950653001101963653000901974653002601983700002202009700003202031773013202063856008402195852000902279655001202288IND60734787120221120203214.0210610e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073478712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2021.1515672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro-Ojeda, Nebis A.10aTemperature effects on the early ontogenetic stages of the intertidal stone crab Xantho poressa (Olivi, 1792)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTemperature is a well-known environmental factor that affects the survival rate and development times of larvae in many brachyuran species. Intertidal species, such as the stone crab Xantho poressa are subject to aquatic and aerial temperature conditions, which make them suitable model species to analyse the effects of climate change. In this study, we analyse the effects of temperature on the duration of embryonic and larval development, as well as larval survival, of X. poressa under laboratory conditions. For brood incubation times, 18 ovigerous females were maintained at three different constant temperatures (17, 21 and 25 °C) in seawater (salinity of 35) until hatching. The larvae from other three ovigerous females were reared individually at the same temperature and in the same salinity conditions as for the brood incubation experiments. Embryonic incubation times decreased as temperature increased. Mean incubation times ranged between 23 and 9 days at 17 and 25 °C, respectively. Larvae development was completed at the three temperatures tested with the highest survival rate occurring at 25 °C. The duration of larval development also decreased with increasing temperature. The mean number of days from hatching to the megalopa stage ranged between 35 (17 °C) and 15 days (25 °C). An additional zoeal stage (ZV) was observed at the lowest temperature tested (17 °C).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithodidae 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3alarvae 3alarval development 3alittoral zone 3aontogeny 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 0aEgg incubation 0aSurvival 0aEmbryo 0aZoea 0aEmbryonic development1 aCuesta, José A.,1 aGonzález-Ortegón, Enrique0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2021 Aug., v. 541 p.151567-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2021.1515673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005400170300001600224520130400240592002801544650001701572650001501589650002801604650001401632650001101646653001501657653003801672653002601710700002001736700002201756773012801778856008501906852000901991655001202000IND60573718320221119032958.0170724e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371832DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2017.12857732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlei, David M.10aVariational Inference: A Review for Statisticians  ap. 859-877.  aOne of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.

The Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis extracts the three leading modes of PM₂.₅, including one monopole pattern (Mcₒₙ), a north-south dipole pattern (Mₛₙ), and a west-east dipole pattern (Mₑw). The three modes exhibit distinct quasi-biweekly oscillation features (QBWO) under the coupling effects of two Rossby wave trains within the polar front jet and the subtropical westerly jet. The quasi-biweekly evolutions of the Eurasian teleconnection pattern (EU) and Circumglobal teleconnection pattern (CGT) are responsible for the propagation of the two wave trains. The QBWO typical combination cases of the two wave trains are the decay of the EU negative phase and development of the CGT negative phase for Mcₒₙ, the development of the EU negative phase and decay of the CGT positive phase for Mₛₙ, and the decay of the EU negative phase and development of the CGT positive phase for Mₑw. A consistent change in surface southerly wind anomalies forms in the north and south when the decay of the EU negative phase works cooperatively with the development of the CGT negative phase, resulting in the PM₂.₅ monopole pattern (Mcₒₙ). The combination case with the development of the EU negative phase and decay of the CGT positive phase favors strong stratification stability in the north and vigorous vertical convection in the south, causing opposing north-south changes in pollutants (Mₛₙ). When the decay of the EU negative phase couples with development of the CGT positive phase, surface southerly wind anomalies prevail in the Fenwei Plain, and surface northeasterly wind anomalies from the sea trigger convection in the Yellow River Basin and Huaihe River Basin, forming opposing west-east changes in PM₂.₅ (Mₑw).  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3aresearch 3awatersheds 3awind 3awinter 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aEastern China pollution 0aIntraseasonal oscillation 0aEurasian wave trains 0aAtmospheric teleconnection1 aHuang, Wenyu1 aZhang, Qiang0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 267 p.105990-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1059903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245015100153300001400304500001400318520175100332592002802083650002402111650001202135650001302147650002002160650001202180650001302192650003102205653002402236653001302260653002402273700001502297700001402312700001402326700001502340773014202355856007302497852000902570655001202579IND60723077520221121095946.0210112e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072307752DNAL7 a10.3920/CEP2000172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaher, T.10aEffect of inspiratory muscle training in hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients during acute care: a randomised clinical trial  ap. 55-63.  aNAL-light  aWeakness of respiratory muscles along with respiratory failure is a common finding in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients which leads to dyspnoea and hence decreased functional capacity. Despite a sound theoretical rationale regarding the potential role of inspiratory muscles, the role of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) along with the conventional non-invasive ventilation (NIV) on important clinical outcomes has not been investigated in these patients during acute care. 34 hypercapnic stable COPD patients were randomly allocated to one of the interventions that lasted for 10 days: IMT with NIV (n=17), and NIV alone (n=17). IMT was administered 2 times in a day (15 min each time) by threshold loading at an intensity starting from 30% and progressed to 60% of their maximal inspiratory effort (PIₘₐₓ). NIV was given at an optimal pressure titrated for each patient for at least >8 h per day. Outcome measures (respiratory muscle strength, respiratory failure, dyspnoea, and functional capacity) were assessed before and after 10 days of intervention. Clinical characteristics and outcome variables of patients were similar between the groups at baseline. Addition of IMT led to a significantly greater increase in respiratory muscle strength (P=0.01), reduction in dyspnea (modified medical research council dyspnea scale, P=0.001); improved outcomes of respiratory failure (PaCO₂, P=0.03; PaO₂, P=0.002) and improved functional capacity (6 min walk distance, P=0.001) as compared to NIV alone. A short duration IMT program in addition to NIV was found to be effective in improving respiratory muscle strength, perception of dyspnoea, functional capacity and respiratory failure in hypercapnic COPD patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomedical research 3adyspnea 3aexercise 3amuscle strength 3amuscles 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 0arespiratory failure 0adyspnoea 0afunctional capacity1 aMoiz, J.A.1 aBhati, P.1 aAli, M.S.1 aTalwar, D.0 tComparative exercise physiology.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 17, no. 1 p.55-63dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000061x1755-25597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/CEP2000173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002000157245008600177300001400263520174500277592002802022650000802050650001802058650001102076650001602087650001402103650001102117650002902128650002502157650003002182650001702212650002202229650002602251650001602277650001502293650002602308650002502334650001202359650001702371650001102388650002102399651002502420651001602445653003102461653002602492653002402518653002702542700002902569700002302598700003202621773011102653856009202764852000902856655001202865IND60536694620221119143830.0190412e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusso, Giovanni10aEnvironmental analysis of geothermal heat pump and LPG greenhouse heating systems  ap. 11-23.  aThe use of low-impact energy sources for greenhouse cultivations is growing quickly due to environmental demands, constrained by the increased price of fossil energy sources, market demand for low cost greenhouse production, and need for air pollution reduction. This paper demonstrates via environmental analysis the efficiency of a Photovoltaic-Geothermal Heat Pump integrated system (PV-GHP) as a greenhouse heating system, compared to a conventional hot air generator using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG-HG). The tests were carried out in twin experimental greenhouses in the Mediterranean area (Valenzano-Italy). In order to evaluate the environmental performance of a heat pump system with electricity supplied from the national grid, a scenario (GHP Geothermal Heat Pump) was realised. The microclimatic conditions in the two greenhouses, the thermal energy produced, and the electricity consumption were analysed. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the long-term environmental impact, an environmental analysis was conducted using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, carried out according to standard UNI EN ISO 14040. The interpretation of the results using method CML2001 (Centre of Environmental Science, Leiden, Netherlands) showed that neither system is more advantageous from an environmental point of view and that the GHP scenario has the higher environmental burdens. Limiting the analysis to the emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect, the plant with the geothermal heat pump and photovoltaic panels reduces carbon emissions by 50%. In order to assess the sustainability of the geothermal heat pump plant, the estimated payback-time for energy and for carbon emissions were 1 year and 2.25 years, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse effect 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3aheat pumps 3alife cycle assessment 3aliquid petroleum gas 3amarkets 3amicroclimate 3aprices 3asolar collectors 3aMediterranean region 3aNetherlands 0aGreenhouse heating systems 0aLife cycle assessment 0aEnergy payback time 0aEmissions payback time1 aAnifantis, Alexandros S.1 aVerdiani, Giuseppe1 aMugnozza, Giacomo Scarascia0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Nov., v. 127 p.11-23dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011800170300001600288520067100304592002800975650002101003650000901024650001801033650001201051650001401063650001101077650001701088650001501105650001301120650001201133651001101145700001901156700001801175700001801193700001801211700002401229773009701253856008101350852000901431655001201440IND60573988320221120110839.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057398832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-016-0543-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasegawa, Takamasa10aCollection and aging of greater amberjack Seriola dumerili larvae and juveniles around the Penghu Islands, Taiwan  ap. 145-150.  aTo investigate the early life history of Seriola dumerili, we first validated otolith daily increments using reared fish (11–51 days after hatching).

The lake limits lifespan due to its high pH and brackish water. For this reason, only a single species of fish (Van Fish) is living in the lake that has been adapted to these conditions. In the present study, we investigated the total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), malondialdehyde (MDA) level and DNA damage effect of bisphenol A (BPA) (10⁻⁷, 10⁻⁶ and 10⁻⁵ M) on primary gill cell culture of Van Fish for 24 and 48 h of incubation periods. TAS levels were not changed when compared to those of the control group, but TOS levels were decreased in both 24 and 48 h. The MDA level increased only at the highest concentration (10⁻⁵) at the end of 12 and 24 h (p < .05). DNA damage increased only at the 10⁻⁵ M concentration after 48 h. At the end of the experiment, BPA exposure caused lipid peroxidation and genotoxic effect. These results indicate that high levels of BPA exposure induced oxidative stress and DNA damage by time- and concentration-dependent fashion in the gill cell culture of Van Fish. Gill cell culture is a useful model for the rapid identification of the harmful effects of chemicals in the aquatic environment.  aThis study was supported by a grant (FBA-2016-5058) from Directory of Scientific Research Project, Van Yuzuncu Yil University, Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data  aFBA-2016-5058cDirectory of Scientific Research Project, Van Yuzuncu Yil University, Turkeydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010760 3aAlburnus tarichi 3aDNA damage 3aantioxidants 3aaquatic environment 3abisphenol A 3abrackish water 3acell culture 3afish 3agenotoxicity 3alakes 3alipid peroxidation 3alongevity 3amalondialdehyde 3amodels 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3aTurkey (country) 0aAlburnus tarichi 0aBisphenol A 0agill cell culture 0aoxidative stress1 aArihan, Okan1 aOğuz, Ahmet R.0 tChemistry in ecology.g2018 Nov. 26, v. 34, no. 10 p.914-924dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12214x1029-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2018.15208463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013800168520190800306592002802214650001302242650001102255650001202266650001602278650002002294650001202314650001402326650001602340650001302356650002002369650001902389651001002408653002802418653002202446653001702468653001002485700001702495700001302512700001602525700001802541700001802559700001702577773010502594856008702699852000902786655001202795IND60761101920221119184010.0220207e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076110192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1059912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhili10aEvaluation of surface solar radiation trends over China since the 1960s in the CMIP6 models and potential impact of aerosol emissions  aAccurate representation of surface solar radiation (SSR) trends is an important indicator for global climate models (GCMs) to correctly reproducing the historical climate evolution. This study examines the annual mean SSR trends in China under all-sky and clear-sky conditions for the period 1961–2014 in 34 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models using the latest homogenized in-situ SSR dataset. The site-observed annual mean SSR over China shows a significant decadal decline during 1961–2005 but an uptrend during 2006–2014, with the trends being −6.4 (−8.6) W m⁻² and + 2.5 (+5.9) W m⁻² per decade under all-sky (clear-sky) condition, respectively. All CMIP6 models simulate the sustained decline in SSR over China for the period 1961–2005 but significantly underestimate the dimming. The model results show trends of −1.9 ± 0.5 W m⁻² and -2.5 ± 0.7 W m⁻² per decade during 1961–2005 under all-sky and clear-sky conditions, respectively, which are around one third of the observed results. Furthermore, the models fail to capture the reversal of SSR trends in China during 2006–2014, with the trends being −1.1 ± 1.7 W m⁻² and -2.2 ± 0.9 W m⁻² per decade under all-sky and clear-sky conditions, respectively. We infer that the underestimation of anthropogenic aerosol emissions, especially absorbing black carbon emissions cause the underestimated simulation of SSR in dimming period over China. After 2005, the unseasonal increase in carbonaceous aerosol emissions and the weaker decline of sulfur dioxide emissions in China in the models result in an opposite SSR trends relative to the trends based on the site-observations. Our results suggest that improving the anthropogenic aerosol emissions inventory will be useful for generating a more accurate reproduction of the regional SSR evolution over China in GCMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3adata collection 3adecline 3aevolution 3ainventories 3aresearch 3asolar radiation 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aSurface solar radiation 0aAerosol emissions 0aBlack carbon 0aCMIP61 aWang, Chense1 aYang, Su1 aLei, Yadong1 aChe, Huizheng1 aZhang, Xiaoye1 aWang, Qiuyan0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 268 p.105991-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1059913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001500159245009000174300001600264500002000280500000900300520161900309592002801928650001601956650001401972650001301986650002301999650002302022650002602045650001102071650002902082700001902111700001902130773014802149852000902297856009602306655001202402IND2046524120221119094424.0220514e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204652412DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900020022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlk, D.

The purpose of this study was to determine K fixation rates under simulated field moisture regimes. Fixation rates were measured during three consecutive wetting‐drying cycles and in long‐term aerobic incubations with soil moisture held constant at different matric pressures. In all studies, 12 mmol KCl kg⁻¹ soil was applied before monitoring K fixation. All rates conformed to first‐order kinetics. Each wetting‐drying cycle had a rapid fixation phase lasting 2 d with slower fixation thereafter, and rate constants of fixation decreased in each successive cycle for both phases. Depending on the soil, rate constants of the rapid phase in the first cycle ranged from 0.064 to 0.143 d⁻¹ and were 0.026 to 0.061 d⁻¹ in the second cycle. Slow‐phase rate constants ranged from 0.030 to 0.058 d⁻¹ in the first cycle and 0.005 to 0.021 d⁻¹ in the second cycle. In samples maintained as saturated pastes, the rapid phase was extended to 5 d but the rate constant was smaller in magnitude than when soil was drying. The rapid phase represented an abiotic process that was controlled by K⁺ diffusion. When soil moisture was held constant in a long‐term aerobic incubation, K fixation rate constants increased at lower soil moisture levels. Rate constants of fixation were 0.00055 d⁻¹ at −0.03 MPa and 0.00114 d⁻¹ at −0.48 MPa, an increase of 107%. The measured fixation rates were sufficient to explain long‐term fixation measured in a related field study.  aPublisher supplied data 3avermiculite 3apotassium 3akinetics 3asoil water regimes 3asoil water content 3anutrient availability 3adrying 3amineralogical soil types1 aCassman, K.

Here, an efficient and ambient-stable C-ZnO/Ag₃PO₄ composite with various C-ZnO ratios was innovatively designed for environmental governance via visible light catalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP). The present study significantly enhanced the spatial charge separation capability by constructing the S-scheme structure between C-ZnO and Ag₃PO₄, as well as addressed the photocorrosion and stability issues of Ag₃PO₄ by anchoring nanoscale C-ZnO nanosheet. As a result, the photocatalysts were successfully fabricated via the green grinding method and were synergistically characterized using different technologies. Remarkably, the optimal mass proportion of C-ZnO in as-prepared composite was 30%, and the supreme rate constant of CIP degradation was 0.04811min⁻¹, which was 11.7 and 2.8 times that of C-ZnO and Ag₃PO₄, respectively. The preset work can not only offer several insights into resolving the undesirable photocatalytic performance and stability of Ag₃PO₄, but also offer the design of other novel p-type Ag₃PO₄-based composites for multifarious applications in environmental remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aciprofloxacin 3aenvironmental governance 3alight 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aremediation 0aS-scheme 0aC-ZnO/Ag3PO4 0aGreen synthesis 0aVisible light 0aPhotocatalytic performance1 aHu, Wenna0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct. 01,  p.130298-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.130298  aDNAL 7aarticle03951naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013100166300001600297520204300313592002802356650002002384650001302404650001202417650002302429650001102452650001202463650002002475650001302495650001302508650000902521650001102530650001102541650001202552650001002564650000902574650001002583650001802593650001902611650001102630650001102641650003302652650001102685650000902696650001302705650001102718650000902729650001402738650001302752650000902765651001002774651001302784653002602797653001802823653001802841653001702859700001602876700001402892700001802906700002002924700001902944700001802963700001402981700001402995700001403009773008903023856008403112852000903196655001203205IND60544839220221119042020.0160901e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054483922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarrica, D.10aMetals and metalloids in hair samples of children living near the abandoned mine sites of Sulcis-Inglesiente (Sardinia, Italy)  ap. 366-374.  aThe Sulcis-Iglesiente district (SW Sardinia, Italy) is one of the oldest and most important polymetallic mining areas in Italy. Large outcrops of sulfide and oxide ores, as well as the products of the long-lasting mining activity, are present throughout the district releasing significant quantities of metals and metalloids into the surrounding environment. Here are reported concentrations of 21 elements determined in scalp hair samples from children (aged 11–13 years) living in different geochemical environments of southwestern Sardinia: Iglesias, hosting several abandoned mines, and the island of Sant׳Antioco, not affected by significant base metal mineralization events. Trace element determinations were performed by ICP-MS. Statistically significant differences (p<0.01) in elemental concentration levels between the two study sites were found. Hair of children from Iglesias exhibited higher concentration values for Ag, Ba, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, U, V, and Zn. Rubidium, V and U resulted more abundant at Sant׳Antioco. Hair samples from Iglesias showed gender-related differences for a larger number of elements (Ag, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Sr, U and Zn) than at Sant׳Antioco, where only U was significantly different. The above elemental concentrations in females were always higher than in male donors. Robust Principal Component Analysis operated on log-transformed elemental concentrations showed components indicative of a) sulfides ore minerals (PC1) reflecting the influence of the diffuse mineralization covering the entire study area, b) the presence of some bioavailable As sources (PC2) as As-rich pyrite and Fe-containing sphalerite and c) other sources of metals overlapping the diffuse mineralizations, as carbonate rocks and coal deposits (PC3). The results provided evidence of a potential risk of adverse effects on the health of the exposed population, with children living at Iglesias being greatly exposed to several metals and metalloids originated in mining tailings, enriched soils, waters and food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3aat-risk population 3abarium 3acadmium 3acarbonate rocks 3achildren 3achromium 3acoal 3acobalt 3acopper 3afemales 3ahairs 3alead 3amales 3amine tailings 3amineralization 3amining 3anickel 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyrite 3arisk 3arubidium 3asilver 3asoil 3astrontium 3avanadium 3azinc 3aItaly 3aSardinia 0aMetals and metalloids 0aBiomonitoring 0aHair analysis 0aMining sites1 aTamburo, E.1 aMilia, N.1 aVallascas, E.1 aCortimiglia, V.1 aDe Giudici, G.1 aDongarrà, G.1 aSanna, E.1 aMonna, F.1 aLosno, R.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Oct., v. 134 p.366-374dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245015700172520133100329592002801660650001501688650002101703650001801724650001601742650001901758650002201777650002601799650002501825650002601850650002101876650001501897650001301912650001101925650001301936650001101949650002101960650001001981650001901991653003502010653002002045653002302065653002102088653002602109700001302135700001802148700005602166700001202222700001702234700001802251700005602269773011902325856008802444852000902532655001202541IND60676619820221120080547.0200318e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067661982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1356292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Changjian10aDouble-layer substrate of shale ceramsite and active alumina tidal flow constructed wetland enhanced nitrogen removal from decentralized domestic sewage  aThis study explored the application of shale ceramsite (SC) overlaid onto active alumina (AA) to function as a double-layer substrate in tidal flow constructed wetland (TFCW, SC-AA-TFCW) for decentralized domestic sewage treatment. This was compared to AA or SC substrate alone (AA-TFCW or SC-TFCW) for nitrogen removal, variation of dissolved oxygen and porosity in TFCWs, as well as structure of bacterial communities at varied hydraulic load (HL) of 0.204–2.448 m³/m² d with time ratio of the wet and dry phase of 3:1. The results demonstrate that SC-AA-TFCW removed 86% NH₄⁺-N and 79% total nitrogen at HL of 0.612 m³/m² d, which was better than AA-TFCW(76%) or SC-TFCW(49%). The higher nitrogen removal performance in SC-AA-TFCW was mainly attributed to enhanced oxygen transportation due to non-uniform flow field and irregular gap distribution in layered structure, as well as less pore blockage during long-term operation. Denitrifying bacteria including Dechloromonas, Acidovorax, Chryseobacterium and Thermomonas species took up 32% of the microbiome in SC-AA-TFCW, which was higher than in AA-TFCW (17%) and SC-TFCW (7.7%). This study highlighted the importance of layered structures and determined an optimal HL of TFCW to achieve an efficient and stable nitrogen removal for domestic sewage treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidovorax 3aChryseobacterium 3aDechloromonas 3aThermomonas 3aaluminum oxide 3aammonium nitrogen 3abacterial communities 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenitrifying bacteria 3adissolved oxygen 3amicrobiome 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aporosity 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3ashale 3atotal nitrogen 0aTidal flow constructed wetland 0aHydraulic loads 0aLayered substrates 0aNitrogen removal 0aMicrobial communities1 aLi, Xing1 aYang, Yanling1 aFan, Xiaoyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2219-20291 aTan, Xu1 aYin, Wenchao1 aLiu, Yongwang1 aZhou, Zhiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2260-09770 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 703 p.135629-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1356293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011300157300002000270520120800290592002801498650001501526650001701541650001601558650002901574650001601603650001801619650002001637650001501657650001901672650002101691650002601712700001601738700001701754700001501771700001901786773012501805856007401930852000902004655001202013IND60688723220221121153242.0200416e20200406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068872322DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra10626j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Ruifen10aSynthesis of anti-photolysis lignin-based dispersant and its application in pesticide suspension concentrate  ap. 13830-13837.  aIn the formulation of pesticide Suspension Concentrate (SC), some photosensitive pesticides are easily decomposed in the preparation. In this study, a hindered amine modified lignosulfonate (SL-Temp) with anti-photolysis function was synthesized using 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (Temp) and Sodium Lignosulfonate (SL) to solve this problem. The obtained SL-Temp was used as a dispersant to prepare 5% SC of avermectin, which shows good physical stability. The decomposition rate of the avermectin in SC after accelerating hot storage is 0%, which is much lower than 6.1% when SL was used as the dispersant. After being exposed to UV irradiation for 60 hours, the highest retention rate of avermectin is 87.1% when SL-Temp was used as the dispersant, which is much higher than 73.6% when SL was used as the dispersant, and also higher than 76.3% when a small molecule antioxidant (BHT) was added to the formulation. QCM-D studies revealed that the SL-Temp adsorption layer on avermectin particles can compete to absorb partial ultraviolet rays, hinder the penetration of ultraviolet light, and scavenge the free radicals produced by photooxidation, so as to protect avermectin from degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantioxidants 3aavermectins 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3adispersants 3afree radicals 3alignosulfonates 3apesticides 3aphotooxidation 3aphotosensitivity 3aultraviolet radiation1 aPang, Yuxia1 aQiu, Xueqing1 aQian, Yong1 aZhou, Mingsong0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 06, v. 10, no. 23 p.13830-13837dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra10626j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245015300170300001600323520205700339592002802396650001502424650001202439650002002451650002102471650001102492650002102503650001602524650002302540650001602563650002902579650003102608650001302639650001802652650001902670650000902689650000902698650002202707651001202729653001002741653001802751653002102769653003002790653001902820653001402839700002002853700002102873700001902894700005502913773012502968856008303093852000903176655001203185IND60619555720221121023417.0201230e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061955572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeller, Sebastian10aN2O emissions from maize production in South-West Germany and evaluation of N2O mitigation potential under single and combined inhibitor application  ap. 215-223.  aIn a study on the emissions of nitrous oxide (N₂O) from maize production in South-West Germany, N₂O emissions where measured with an automated chamber system over two consecutive cropping seasons, including an intermediate fallow period. Urea-based fertilizer treatments included a fertilizer only control (U), as well as the use of pyraclostrobin, which showed inhibitory effects on denitrification in a laboratory experiment. Pyraclostrobin was used alone (U + P) and in combination with a NBPT/NPPT urease inhibitor (UI + P) and a reduced fertilizer rate (70% UI + P). The U control emitted 1.03 ± 0.22 and 1.94 ± 0.61 kg N₂O-N ha⁻¹ in the cropping seasons of 2012 and 2013, respectively. Fallow emissions mainly occurred after a soil freeze-thaw period and were 0.24 ± 0.08, 0.23 ± 0.09, 0.22 ± 0.06, 0.32 ± 0.21 kg N₂O-N ha⁻¹ for U, 70% UI + P, U + P and UI + P, respectively. In the cropping season 2012, no effects of the UI + P and U + P treatments could be observed. In 2013, UI + P increased N₂O emissions by 13% when compared to the U control, while a significant reduction of 24% was observed for the U + P treatment. The 70% UI + P treatment resulted in significantly lower (∼30%) N₂O emissions and only slight reductions (7–10%) of grain yields in both years. Climate conditions varied strongly between seasons (416 and 704 mm total rainfall in 2012 and 2013, respectively) which most likely also influenced the performance of the inhibitors. Direct emission factors (EFd%) also increased strongly in 2013 (0.28 ± 0.12 in 2012 vs. 0.94 ± 0.41 in 2013 for U) but were generally lower than the 1% IPCC default value. Values for nitrogen recovery efficiency and yield-scaled N₂O emissions were most preferable for the 70% UI + P treatment and indicate that reduced fertilizer rates in combination with inhibitors could represent a viable means for N₂O mitigation without significant yield penalties in agricultural systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aclimate 3adenitrification 3aemissions factor 3afallow 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizers 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alaboratory experimentation 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3apyraclostrobin 3arain 3asoil 3aurease inhibitors 3aGermany 0aMaize 0aNitrous oxide 0aUrease inhibitor 0aDenitrification inhibitor 0aPyraclostrobin 0aNBPT/NPPT1 aFischer, Alfred1 aWillibald, Georg1 aNavé, Barbara1 aKiese, Ralf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2814-48880 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 269 p.215-223dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245006500162520137600227592002801603650001201631650001901643650002101662650001501683650001301698650001901711650001701730650002001747651001601767651002001783700002301803700002401826773016101850856007702011852000902088655001202097IND60757773820221119131222.0211125e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075777382DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi101107942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamdar, Razieh 10aClimate Change and Vulnerability: The Case of MENA Countries  aClimate is changing and mitigation of the corresponding impacts requires assessment of vulnerability and adaptation building. This issue is particularly important in Middle East and North Africa (MENA), which is recognized as one of the most water scarce regions of the world and vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, the objective of this study was an assessment of the different sectors’ vulnerability as well as the overall vulnerability of the MENA countries to climate change. The Notre Dame-Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN) was used to investigate climate change vulnerability. Cluster analysis revealed the very high, high, medium and low levels of vulnerability for the MENA countries by distinguishing their extent of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Further results indicated that the MENA countries have an acceptable status of infrastructure and habitat, tolerable health and ecosystem statuses, and inappropriate water and food conditions. Water shortage is also a serious problem in this region, to the extent that it is often assumed that water shortage is the root cause of all other types of vulnerability in MENA. However, the obtained results do not support this assumption. These findings provide insight about the adaptation challenges that should be faced and the choices that should be made in response to climate change, in MENA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acluster analysis 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3ainfrastructure 3aspatial data 3awater shortages 3aMiddle East 3aNorthern Africa1 aKarami, Ezatollah 1 aKeshavarz, Marzieh 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi101107943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245021700164300001800381520168600399592002802085650001802113650001302131650001402144650002402158650003802182650001902220650002002239650002102259650001802280650002602298650001302324650001402337700001202351700001702363700001402380700001802394773009902412856008102511852000902592655001202601IND60439020620221119121938.0160405e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043902062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2539-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhixin10aRoles of the programmed cell death 1, T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3, and cluster of differentiation 288 pathways in the low reactivity of invariant natural killer T cells after chronic hepatitis B virus infection  ap. 2535-2545.  aOne of the main responses of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells to antigen stimulation is the rapid production of interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-γ cytokines. There is a decline in the function of iNKT cells in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. In this study, we explored the impact of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), and cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) expression on iNKT cell functions in CHB patients. Flow cytometry was used to test iNKT frequencies and levels of PD-1, Tim-3, CD28, IL-4, and IFN-γ secreted by iNKT cells. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure IL-4 and IFN-γ secretion upon α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) activation ex vivo. We found that the levels of expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 from iNKT cells in CHB patients were significantly higher than in healthy donors (p < 0.05), but there was lower expression of CD28 (p < 0.05) and an impaired capability to produce IL-4 and IFN-γ (p < 0.05). In vitro α-GalCer stimulation upregulated the expression of PD-1⁺ iNKT cells (p < 0.05), Tim-3⁺ iNKT cells (p < 0.05), and CD28⁺ iNKT cells (p < 0.05). In response to combination therapies consisting of α-GalCer and anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and/or anti-Tim-3 mAbs and/or anti-CD80/anti-CD28 mAbs, IL-4⁺ and IFN-γ⁺ iNKT cells demonstrated different degrees of growth (p < 0.05). The functional decline of iNKT cells was closely related to the decrease in CD28 expression and the increases of Tim-3 and PD-1. In addition, clinical antiviral treatment with lamivudine could partially restore the immune function of iNKT cells in CHB patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3aapoptosis 3achronic hepatitis B 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-4 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apatients 3asecretion1 aLei, Yu1 aChen, Chunbo1 aRen, Hong1 aShi, Tongdong0 tArchives of virology.g2015 Oct., v. 160, no. 10 p.2535-2545dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2539-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245004700156300001800203520099300221592002801214650002801242650002201270650001301292650001801305650001901323650001301342650001901355650001301374700001801387700001801405700002401423700002101447700002101468700002301489700002301512773010801535856007501643852000901718655001201727IND60532795720221119171755.0160728e20141013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279572DNAL7 a10.1021/bm50049482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHume, Jasmin10aEngineered Coiled-Coil Protein Microfibers  ap. 3503-3510.  aThe fabrication of de novo proteins able to self-assemble on the nano- to meso-length scales is critical in the development of protein-based biomaterials in nanotechnology and medicine. Here we report the design and characterization of a protein engineered coiled-coil that not only assembles into microfibers, but also can bind hydrophobic small molecules. Under ambient conditions, the protein forms fibers with nanoscale structure possessing large aspect ratios formed by bundles of α-helical homopentameric assemblies, which further assemble into mesoscale fibers in the presence of curcumin through aggregation. Surprisingly, these biosynthesized fibers are able to form in conditions of remarkably low concentrations. Unlike previously designed coiled-coil fibers, these engineered protein microfibers can bind the small molecule curcumin throughout the assembly, serving as a depot for encapsulation and delivery of other chemical agents within protein-based 3D microenvironments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3achemical elements 3acurcumin 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophobicity 3amedicine 3ananotechnology 3aproteins1 aSun, Jennifer1 aJacquet, Rudy1 aRenfrew, P.

Farmers and cattle ranchers throughout Brazil are legally required to set-aside riparian forest strips within their landholdings, but recent legislative changes have relaxed the minimum mandatory conditions of these riparian forests. In this context, we assessed the functional role of riparian forest remnants as landscape connectors for medium to large-bodied terrestrial mammals in a vast fragmented landscape of southern Amazonia. We selected 38 riparian forest strips and five riparian sites within continuous forest, installed four to five camera-traps along each riparian zone (199 camera-trap stations), and sampled the terrestrial mammal assemblage for 60days per station during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. We compared mammal use of riparian forests within both continuous and highly fragmented forests, and examined the effects of corridor width, corridor habitat structure, and landscape context on mammal species richness, composition, and functional diversity, all of which were higher in continuous forests than in riparian remnants. Functional diversity differences between corridor type was trait-independent and mediated by differences in species richness. Forest habitat degradation was associated with overall lower species richness, whereas forest specialists were more species-rich in increasingly wider corridors. Compositional shifts indicate that deforestation and forest degradation favours matrix-tolerant species with lower levels of forest habitat specificity. We show the potential landscape connectivity role for forest mammals of riparian corridors, whose width and forest degradation status are key predictors of community-wide responses. We provide evidence on the importance of these relict riparian strips to forest vertebrates, strengthening the scientific arguments that help justify the recently embattled legal requirements to maintain effective riparian corridors in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acattle 3adeforestation 3adry season 3afunctional diversity 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aland ownership 3alandscapes 3anatural resources conservation 3aranchers 3ariparian areas 3ariparian forests 3aspecies diversity 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aEcological corridors 0aForest degradation 0aFunctional diversity 0aLandscape connectivity 0aRiparian zones1 aPeres, Carlos A.1 aMachado, Ricardo Bomfim0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Feb., v. 206 p.283-292dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.11.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245005600167520135800223592002801581650002201609650001101631650001701642700002201659773016101681856007701842852000901919655001201928IND60757773920221119131127.0211125e20211026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075777392DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi101107212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRzeszewski, Michał 10aUsability of WebXR Visualizations in Urban Planning  aExtended reality (XR) technology is increasingly often considered in practical applications related to urban planning and smart city management. It offers many advantages as a new visualization technique that gives its users access to places that are not available in material space and a unique perspective on existing objects. It can provide immersive multi-sensory experience that can induce emotional response in participatory planning. However, standard mode of implementation that relies on mobile phone applications and VR headsets has a disadvantage when it comes to availability and accessibility. Here we test the WebXR solution that can mitigate those problems. We have created six AR and VR environments that resembled common urban planning scenarios and conducted usability tests with people having planning and GIS background. Results indicate that WebXR can provide useful solution in urban planning when the interface and environment resemble common practices and situations encountered in real life. Environments that have introduced new digital affordances like AR measurements or semi-transparent walkable scale models were rated lower. Users evaluated presented environment as having high usability and expressed their positive attitude toward using XR in their professional practice mainly as a participatory and visualization tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3amobile telephones 3apeople 3aspatial data1 aOrylski, Matuesz 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi101107213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245011400202300001600316520199700332592002802329650001802357650001602375650002302391650001202414650001502426650002102441650001102462650004302473650000902516650001902525650001502544650002502559650002202584650002302606650002102629650002702650651001002677653001802687653002302705653000902728653001802737653001802755653001802773700001902791700001602810700001402826700005602840773012502896856008303021852000903104655001203113IND60619555820221121015210.0201230e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061955582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Luping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8509-400410aSpatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture driven by ‘Grain for Green’ program on the Loess Plateau, China  ap. 204-214.  aThe continuous afforestation has led to significant changes in soil moisture (SM) dynamics on the Loess Plateau, China (LPC). However, evaluating the spatio-temporal distributions and driving factors of the SM changes following afforestation is challenging because of the difficulty of accessing areas and the lack of long-term series records. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) SM product by comparing with in-situ SM data in LPC, and quantified the spatio-temporal variations of SM in different periods from 1982 to 2015 under the ‘Grain for Green’ program (GGP). The results showed that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was well matched with the SM variations in more than 46% area of LPC from 1982 to 2015, which mainly located at the vegetated areas. The variations of SM responding to revegetation displayed obvious southeast-negative and northwest-positive patterns, which was the wet region (annual precipitation >450 mm) to be dry and dry region (annual precipitation ≤450 mm) to be wet. Path coefficient value revealed that the positive effect of vegetation activity for grassland on SM was ascribed to its promotion on the occurrence of rainfall (mean path coefficient = 0.278). Precipitation played vital impact on the SM in bareland and sparsely vegetated area, and evapotranspiration played a dominant role in the SM dynamic of the forestland, especially at the early stage of GGP (From 2000 to 2010), while precipitation and NDVI had stronger effects than evapotranspiration on the SM dynamics of grassland. Our study suggests that in arid and semi-arid areas, vegetation achieves the optimal water retention capacity when the vegetation fractions are 1.4%–3.7% and 3.8%–7.2%, respectively. Hence, vegetation should not be further expanded in semi-humid areas, but should be further restored in arid and semi-arid areas with sparse or excessively sparse vegetation cover (especially in desert).  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aland restoration 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3avegetation cover 3awater holding capacity 3aChina 0aAfforestation 0aEvapotranspiration 0aNDVI 0aPrecipitation 0aLoess Plateau 0aSoil moisture1 aFang, Linchuan1 aShi, Zhihua1 aDeng, Lei1 aTan, Wenfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3098-29280 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 269 p.204-214dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008700156300001800243520159300261592002801854650004401882650001201926650001801938650002501956650001201981650002401993650001302017650002302030650001302053650001702066650001002083650001502093650001802108650001902126650001102145650000702156650001502163650001302178700001802191700002802209773010802237856007502345852000902420655001202429IND60532795820170808000000.0160728e20141013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279582DNAL7 a10.1021/bm50062452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElyada, Alon10aPolyelectrolyte Multilayer-Calcium Phosphate Composite Coatings for Metal Implants  ap. 3511-3521.  aThe preparation of organic–inorganic composite coatings with the purpose to increase the bioactivity of bioinert metal implants was investigated. As substrates, glass plates and rough titanium surfaces (Ti-SLA) were employed. The method comprises the deposition of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMLs) followed by immersion of the coated substrate into a calcifying solution of low supersaturation (MCS). Single or mixed PEMLs were constructed from poly-l-lysine (PLL) alternating with poly-l-glutamate, (PGA), poly-l-aspartate (PAA), and/or chondroitin sulfate (CS). ATR-FTIR spectra reveal that (PLL/PGA)₁₀ multilayers and mixed multilayers with a (PLL/PGA)₅ base contain intermolecular β-sheet structures, which are absent in pure (PLL/PAA)₁₀ and (PLL/CS)₁₀ assemblies. All PEML coatings had a grainy topography with aggregate sizes and size distributions increasing in the order: (PLL/PGA)ₙ < (PLL/PAA)ₙ < (PLL/CS)ₙ. In mixed multilayers with a (PLL/PGA)ₙ base and a (PLL/PAA)ₙ or (PLL/CS)ₙ top, the aggregate sizes were greatly reduced. The PEMLs promoted calcium phosphate nucleation and early crystal growth, the intensity of the effect depending on the composition of the terminal layer(s) of the polymer. In contrast, crystal morphology and structure depended on the supersaturation, pH, and ionic strength of the MCS, rather than on the composition of the organic matrix. Crystals grown on both uncoated and coated substrates were mostly platelets of calcium deficient carbonate apatite, with the Ca/P ratio depending on the precipitation conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aapatite 3aaspartic acid 3abioactive properties 3acalcium 3achondroitin sulfate 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3acrystals 3aelectrolytes 3aglass 3aglutamates 3aglutamic acid 3aionic strength 3alysine 3apH 3aphosphorus 3atitanium1 aGarti, Nissim1 aFüredi-Milhofer, Helga0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 Oct. 13, v. 15, no. 10 p.3511-3521dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm50062453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245010500191300001600296500002000312520136500332592002801697650001201725650001601737650001401753650001601767650002501783650001201808650002101820650001601841650001401857650002901871650002701900650001901927650001201946650002501958650003301983650003302016650001402049650001602063651001702079700002302096773010002119852000902219856008802228655001202316IND4418245620221118020829.0160910e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441824562DNAL7 a192107172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02764.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Bruce10aGeographical covariation and local convergence of flower depth in a guild of fly‐pollinated plants  ap. 533-540.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Plant adaptations to pollinators are usually studied at the species level, but are expected to occur at the local population level and be reflected in fine‐scale patterns of floral variation. • Here, we examined whether a guild of c. 20 South African plant species pollinated by the long proboscid fly Prosoeca ganglbaueri (Nemestrinidae) exhibits fine‐scale patterns of geographical covariation and convergent evolution at a local scale. • Fly proboscis length is highly variable among sites (20–50 mm). Plant adaptation results in floral depths of plants within the guild being closely matched with the proboscis length of their fly pollinator across numerous sites. This results in patterns of divergence among allopatric populations and convergence among species within a site. • The most likely evolutionary processes driving these patterns include coevolution between the fly and plants with consistent and abundant rewards, as well as one‐sided evolution in rare and nonrewarding species that do not influence the coevolutionary process. Pollinator‐mediated selection on spur length was confirmed for a nonrewarding orchid species in the guild by a reciprocal translocation experiment. Thus, rarer and nonrewarding species in the guild are forced to keep pace with the coevolutionary race between common rewarding flowers and flies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aOrchidaceae 3aallopatry 3acoevolution 3aconvergent evolution 3aflowers 3aplant adaptation 3apollinators 3aproboscis 3areciprocal translocation 2aAdaptation, Biological 2aMagnoliopsida. 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aDipteraxanatomy & histology 2aFlowersxanatomy & histology 2aGeography 2aPollination 0aSouth Africa1 aJohnson, Steven D.0 tnew phytologist.g2009 Apr., v. 182, no. 2 p.533-540dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02764.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02180naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245009400160300001600254500001400270520096600284592002801250650000801278650002001286650002001306650002401326650001001350650001901360650003101379651001001410653000801420653002901428653000801457700001901465700001801484700001601502700001801518773014901536856007601685852000901761655001201770IND60710102820221116194357.0200908e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071010282DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-34432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManimaran, K.10aDetection of Mycoplasma galliseptium infection in chickens from Tamil Nadu State of India  ap. 115-118.  aNAL-light  aRespiratory Disease (CRD) among chickens of various age groups.

The aim of this paper is to study the performance of (GSHP) in future climate conditions (2040–2069) by using projected future hourly weather data of selected representative cities in the US to estimate future ground temperature change. The projected hourly weather data and estimated ground temperatures are input to an hourly simulation tool (TRNSYS and eQuest for this research), which provides reliable coupling of GSHP system and building performance.The simulation results show that global warming will decrease the energy efficiency of GSHP in US residential buildings because a rise in inlet and outlet water temperature is predicted for GSHP systems during the cooling season and because buildings will become more cooling dominated in the future. For office buildings, although the cooling performance of GSHP will not drop significantly under future climate, the overall energy efficiency for the system will decrease due to the increasing energy consumption of the ground loop pump. In the future, considering the significant ground heat imbalance for GSHP operation, GSHP will become less competitive both economically and technically than it is now in the context of US climate zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acities 3aclimatic zones 3acooling 3aenergy efficiency 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3ameteorological data 3aresidential housing 3awater temperature 3aUnited States 0aClimate change 0aGround source heat pump 0aBuilding performance 0aMorphing technique 0aEnergy efficiency1 aLukes, Jennifer R.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 101 p.632-643dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245020300157300002000360500001900380520116800399592002801567650001101595650002301606650001801629650001901647650001401666650001401680650001801694650001301712650001701725650001301742650001301755650001301768650001701781650001401798700001801812700003401830700002101864773012501885856007402010852000902084655001202093IND60688723520221121153334.0200416e20200403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068872352DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra10941b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanji, Nasim10aPalladium supported on a novel ordered mesoporous polypyrrole/carbon nanocomposite as a powerful heterogeneous catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to carboxylic acids and ketones on water  ap. 13616-13631.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPreparation of an ordered mesoporous polypyrrole/carbon (PPy/OMC) composite has been described through a two-step nanocasting process using KIT-6 as a template. Characterization of the PPy/OMC nanocomposite by various analysis methods such as TEM, XRD, TGA, SEM and N₂ sorption confirmed the preparation of a material with ordered mesoporous structure, uniform pore size distribution, high surface area and high stability. This nanocomposite was then used for the immobilization of palladium nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were almost uniformly distributed on the support with a narrow particle size of 20–25 nm, confirmed by various analysis methods. Performance of the Pd@PPy/OMC catalyst was evaluated in the aerobic oxidation of various primary and secondary alcohols on water as a green solvent, giving the corresponding carboxylic acids and ketones in high yields and excellent selectivity. The catalyst could also be reused for at least 10 reaction runs without losing its catalytic activity and selectivity. High catalytic efficiency of the catalyst can be attributed to a strong synergism between the PPy/OMC and that of supported Pd nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3ananocatalysts 3ananocomposites 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3aparticle size 3aporosity 3aporous media 3apyrroles 3asolvents 3asorption 3asurface area 3asynergism1 aKarimi, Babak1 aNajafvand-Derikvandi, Sepideh1 aVali, Hojatollah0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 03, v. 10, no. 23 p.13616-13631dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra10941b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011000172500001900282520116200301592002801463650001201491650001601503650001701519650001301536650001501549650001701564650001601581650001601597650001301613650001501626650000901641653001501650653002201665653002601687653002501713700001501738700001101753700005301764700002001817773011901837856008801956852000902044655001202053IND60709364620221120105455.0210624e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Fangyuan10aFormation of disinfection byproducts during chlorination of mixed nitrogenous compounds in swimming pools  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDisinfection byproducts (DBPs) in swimming pool waters are receiving increasing attention because of their toxicity and widespread occurrence. Current studies rarely investigate the formation of DBPs from typical precursors in swimming pools under mixed exposure. They also rarely investigate the formation of carbonaceous DBPs (C-DBPs) and nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs) simultaneously. In this study, the formation of C-DBPs and N-DBPs were investigated during chlorination of mixed precursors (i.e., tryptophan, urea, creatinine, and ammonia). The effects of precursors and operation parameters were also investigated. Among the four precursors, tryptophan had the highest DBP formation potential. Urea and ammonia restrained the formation of C-DBPs but promoted the formation of more toxic N-DBPs. C-DBP yields were significantly higher than N-DBP yields under all experimental conditions. Longer reaction time and higher chlorine dosage promoted the formation of C-DBPs, while higher temperature decreased the concentration of N-DBPs. The presence of bromide not only improved the sum yields of DBPs, but also shifted chlorinated DBPs to brominated species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abromination 3achlorination 3achlorine 3acreatinine 3adisinfection 3aenvironment 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3atryptophan 3aurea 0aPrecursors 0aHaloacetonitriles 0aTrichloronitromethane 0aOperating parameters1 aYang, Fang1 aLu, Yi1 aLi, Haipu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2028-41541 aYang, Zhaoguang0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 754 p.142100-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010700166300001500273520200500288592002802293650002102321650001902342650001202361650000902373650001402382650002502396650002302421650001102444650001402455650001402469650001302483650002502496650002202521651001902543700001802562773012302580856008402703852000902787655001202796IND60123428620221117162833.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012342862DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2013.8478772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeer, A. C.10aClimate Change, Migration Phenology, and Fisheries Management Interact with Unanticipated Consequences  ap. 94-110.  aAccumulating evidence indicates that as global temperatures rise, reproductive behaviors, including migrations, are occurring earlier across a range of taxa. Alone, these changes are ecologically important; however, for some fish populations, management practices may unknowingly interact with climate-induced changes in reproductive phenology, leading to unanticipated changes in fishing mortality. The potential for such an interaction exists for the Chesapeake Bay Striped Bass Morone saxatilis fishery, which opens on the same week each year during the spawning season. Earlier migrants spawn before the fishery opens; however, later migrants are vulnerable to fishing before they reach the spawning grounds. Consequently, if there are climate-induced changes in Striped Bass spawning phenology, unexpected levels of fishing mortality may occur for egg-bearing, prespawn females. To evaluate the potential consequences of this temporally fixed fishing season, we analyzed a time series of gill-net catch data using an inference-based modeling approach to identify the environmental cues driving variation in the migratory timing of Striped Bass onto their two primary spawning grounds. We hypothesized that factors driving migratory timing would also influence the proportion of egg-bearing, prespawn females caught in the fishery each year. Results indicated that spring water temperature was the primary factor influencing the timing of movement onto spawning grounds, with higher temperatures resulting in early migrations. Importantly, our results indicated that in cool years, when females moved onto the spawning grounds later, more egg-bearing females were caught in the fishery before they could spawn. This situation provides impetus for establishing management approaches that reduce potential climate-induced variability in fishing mortality in the Chesapeake Bay and fisheries around the globe.

The three process parameters selected for the optimization of SCM transesterification were temperature (240 to 300 °C), time (15 to 45 min) and MeOH: oil molar ratio (15:1 to 45:1). Initial experiments performed according to the central composite design (CCD) generated matrix of RSM and further validated by ANN. The ¹H-NMR analysis confirms the formation of methyl esters. Moreover, the corresponding regression coefficient (R²) for the model were 0.97 and 0.99 for RSM and ANN, respectively indicated excellent fit of the model to the experimental data. Furthermore, the final optimized condition for FAME conversion efficiency of RSM and ANN predicted models were 98.01% and 98.15%, respectively. The fitness function for GA was obtained from ANN predicted model equations and presented as globally optimized (GA conditions) reaction conditions for SCM: temp - 285.21 °C, time - 26.57 min and MeOH: oil molar ratio – 23.47. The predicted percent conversion efficiency of GA optimized conditions was 99.16% whereas, the experimental optimum FAME conversion reached to 98.12%. Additionally, the gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) analysis revealed the presence of palmitic (28%), oleic (33%), linoleic (8%) and other saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The other biodiesel properties such as acid value, iodine value, cetane number, calorific value, etc. were also analyzed and exhibited an analogous trend with standard ASTM D6571 standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid value 3aalgorithms 3abiodiesel 3aequations 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aiodine value 3amethanol 3amicroalgae 3aneural networks 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3atransesterification 0aSupercritical methanol (SCM) 0aResponse surface methodology (RSM) 0aArtificial neural network (ANN) 0aGenetic algorithm (GA) 0aChlorella CG121 aPaul, Atanu Kumar1 aGoud, Vaibhav V.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 156 p.269-278dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.10.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013500169520138800304592002801692650002601720650002501746650001601771650001501787650002001802650001601822650001301838650001101851650001401862650001901876650001301895650001801908650002801926653002801954653002001982653002202002653001802024653001802042700001702060700001502077700001702092700001702109700001102126700001402137773010302151856005302254852000902307655001202316IND60795540520221117210933.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079554052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1128892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Xiaomei10apH-Responsive non-antibiotic polymer prodrugs eradicate intracellular infection by killing bacteria and regulating immune response  aIntracellular bacterial infections pose enormous challenges to food safety and public health.

PEG-b-PCAE micelles could uptake by macrophage. Upon exposure to the acidic phagolysosome, PEG-b-PCAE micelles could release cinnamaldehyde (CA) through hydrolysis of the acetal linkage. PEG-b-PCAE could kill intracellular bacteria by damaging the bacterial membrane. Furthermore, PEG-b-PCAE micelles could generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages and subsequently activate immune system to clear bacteria by inducing macrophages differentiation to M1 phenotype. PEG-b-PCAE micelles could accelerate the wound healing process of the S. aureus-infected model in vivo. It is anticipated that multifunctional antibiotic-free PEG-b-PCAE micelles with intrinsic antibacterial activities hold promise for improved outcomes in intracellular S. aureus infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial infections 3afood safety 3ahydrolysis 3aimmune response 3amacrophages 3amicelles 3amodels 3aphenotype 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3apublic health 3areactive oxygen species 0aIntracellular infection 0aAntibiotic-free 0aIntracellular ROS 0aImmune system 0aWound healing1 aLiu, Xiaojun1 aYang, Lele1 aYuan, Siyuan1 aXu, Qingqing1 aLi, Yu1 aGao, Feng0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Dec., v. 220 p.112889-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.112889  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009500170520119800265592002801463650001501491650001401506650001601520650001701536650001401553650001101567650003101578650001701609650001601626650001201642650003101654653001301685653001901698653003301717653002201750700001601772700001701788700005601805700001501861773011901876856008801995852000902083655001202092IND60676620420221121182115.0200503e20200410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067662042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1356352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Yiqing14aThe effect of CuO loading on different method prepared CeO2 catalyst for toluene oxidation  aThe support effect on CeO₂ supported CuO catalysts are extensively investigated, but few studies have been reported in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation. Herein, CuO was impregnated on three conventional method synthesized CeO₂ to study its impact on toluene total oxidation over CeO₂ at low temperature (≤280 °C). Characterization results demonstrated that the shape and specific surface area of CeO₂ affected the degree of CuO dispersion, which determine the interaction between CuO and CeO₂. CuO significantly enhanced the toluene adsorption capacity of CeO₂, but lots of oxygen vacancies were lost during its loading. Although strong CuCe interaction induced new oxygen vacancies, the increase or decrease of final amount was related to the original surface properties of CeO₂. Mechanism analysis suggested that the activation of oxygen on oxygen vacancies controlled the toluene oxidation reaction rate. Therefore, the promotion or inhibition effect of CuO on CeO₂ for toluene oxidation depends on physical and chemical properties. Through this study, we have drawn some valuable information in guiding the synthesis and design of CuO-CeO₂ based catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3aceric oxide 3acupric oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphysicochemical properties 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 0aCuO-CeO2 0aSupport effect 0aOxygen adsorption activation 0aToluene oxidation1 aWang, Yanan1 aSong, Fujiao1 aZhang, Shule1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2194-93221 aZhong, Qin0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 10, v. 712 p.135635-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1356353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010500172300001600277520240300293592002802696650001302724650001702737650002002754650001302774650002902787650001002816650003502826650001502861650000902876650001502885650001602900650001702916650001802933650001402951653001302965653002202978653003603000653002303036653002003059653001603079700002403095700001803119700001703137773010703154856008503261852000903346655001203355IND60563005920221121094925.0190214e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056300592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2016.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhittock, Paul A.10aEffects of a dredging operation on the movement and dive behaviour of marine turtles during breeding  ap. 190-200.  aDredging presents a risk of injury or mortality to marine turtles via entrainment, vessel strike or the effects of noise and vibration. Dredging operations have increased in recent years, yet there remains an absence of supporting information for development proponents and regulators to accurately determine dredge-related impact predictions for marine turtles within an Environmental Impact Assessment. This absence therefore has implications for their conservation, as certain dredging impacts may be overlooked or the implementation of control measures and response strategies may be ineffective.This study presents a case study involving a major resource development whose proponent undertook satellite tracking of 48 reproductively-active flatback turtles (Natator depressus) at different stages of its dredging operation (before: n=20, during: n=10 and after: n=18). In addition, trained Marine Fauna Observers were on-board dredge vessels to mitigate interaction and detect injury and mortality events. We compared the dredge-related impact predictions stated in the Environmental Impact Assessment with the quantified dredge-related impact to flatback turtles as represented by changes to their movement and dive behaviour between each stage of the dredging operation and any injury and mortality events. Additionally, we considered the effectiveness of implemented dredge-related control measures in preventing their injury or mortality.We found that during the active dredging operation, flatback turtles increased their use of the dredging areas. Dive behaviour results showed they undertook longer and deeper resting dives during dredging, utilising the now deeper waters of the dredging areas. Possible reasons for this preferential use of areas being dredged are discussed. Despite their increased use and the presence of active dredge vessels, no events of injury or mortality were recorded. The implemented control measures may have been effective in preventing injury or mortality, though the spatial scale of their effectiveness may have been smaller than first anticipated.Our results are of great value for stakeholders involved in marine turtle conservation and managing dredging operations worldwide as no comparison of quantified marine turtle survivorship, movement and dive behaviour data at different stages of a dredging program has been recorded or reported previously.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acase studies 3acontrol methods 3adredging 3aenvironmental assessment 3afauna 3anatural resources conservation 3aprediction 3arisk 3asatellites 3asea turtles 3astakeholders 3asurvival rate 3avibration 0aDredging 0aNatator depressus 0aEnvironmental impact assessment 0aSatellite tracking 0aFlatback turtle 0aEntrainment1 aPendoley, Kellie L.1 aLarsen, Renae1 aHamann, Mark0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Feb., v. 206 p.190-200dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245014700165300001800312500001400330520114600344592002801490650002001518650002101538650001101559650001101570650001101581650002401592650002301616650001701639650001401656650001001670650001301680653001101693653001601704653003201720700002201752700002401774700002601798700002301824700002001847700002101867700002801888773015201916856007602068852000902144655001202153IND60710103520221116194324.0200908e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071010352DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-36642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaik, Swayamprabha10aAireml estimation of genetic parameters and study of factors affecting growth and fertility performance of sire line of IBL-80 broiler chicken  ap. 1281-1286.  aNAL-light  aThe present investigation included the data of 29, 879 birds pertaining to 8 generations, from 2010 to 2018 on growth line (PB1) of IBL-80 broiler.

To investigate an effective method for in-situ restoration, hydroxylamine (NH₂OH) and hydrazine (N₂H₄) of 2 mgN/L were dosed in PN/A process with nitrate built-up in a comparative study. NH₂OH treatment showed better performances on TN removal and nitrate reduction than N₂H₄ and blank control. Through 104 days' addition of NH₂OH, MRNN (mole ratio of NO₃⁻-N production to NH₄⁺-N removal) was decreased from 70% to 19.91%; TN removal was increased from 0.01 to 0.18 kgN/(m³ d). After stopping the chemical addition, nitrate rebounded for N₂H₄ treatment, but the restoration effect was stable and persistent for NH₂OH. NH₂OH addition resulted in a low reductive potential (−250 mV) and exerted strong inhibitions on nitrite oxidizing bacteria activities. Additionally, rapid enhancement of ammonia oxidizing bacteria activities, functional gene (hao) and Nitrosomonas gave rise to the restoration of PN/A with NH₂OH addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacteria 3acomparative study 3agenes 3ahydrazine 3ahydroxylamine 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3anitrites 0aAnammox 0aNitritation 0aHydroxylamine 0aHydrazine 0aIn-situ restoration1 aWang, Yuanyue1 aWang, Hongyan1 aYue, Wenhui1 aChen, Yanlin1 aYu, Dawei1 aChen, Meixue1 aWei, Yuansong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0900-74120 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 10, v. 707 p.135648-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1356483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003300113040001800146100001700164245009500181300001800276500000900294520163500303592002801938650001801966650001201984650001401996650002802010650002002038650002202058650001602080650002302096650001702119650002202136650001102158650002002169650001402189650001902203650001702222650001802239650002902257650001102286650002102297650002502318700002002343700002102363700001902384700001602403773012602419852000902545856011202554856008002666961001302746655001202759IND4411448220221120023257.0191226e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441144822DNAL7 a10113/216002hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2007.03722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, X.-C.12aA Wheat Grazing Model for Simulating Grain and Beef Production: Part I—Model Development  ap. 1242-1247.  aepub  aIt is a common practice to grow winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a dual-purpose crop in the U.S. Southern Great Plains to decrease production risk and to increase profit margin through cattle (Bos taurus) production. Crop management of the dual-purpose wheat is complex because of the tradeoffs between beef production and wheat grain yield. A wheat grazing model helps in making optimal decision. The objective of this study was to develop and incorporate a grazing and metabolizable energy-based cattle growth module into the Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate beef and wheat grain production. The wheat grazing model was comprised of wheat growth, wheat–cattle interaction, and cattle growth components. Wheat growth was simulated by the cropping system model (CSM) of DSSAT. For the wheat–cattle interface, removals of canopy biomass and leaf area by grazing were estimated daily. Predicted grain yield was also reduced by 50 kg ha⁻¹ per day for each day of grazing past the first hollow stem stage. Cattle growth rate was based on a metabolizable energy intake. Maximum voluntary daily intake was estimated based on stocker body weight and forage quality, and is further adjusted for actual forage availability, temperature, and adaptation status during the first 14 d of grazing to estimate the actual daily intake. Changes in wheat growth processes brought about by grazing, including a grazing effect on the delay of plant phenological development, are not simulated in the model. Field experiments to characterize any such effects are needed to help fine-tune the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy intake 3agrazing 3aphenology 3adry matter accumulation 3aliveweight gain 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3aad libitum feeding 3aplant growth 3asimulation models 3acattle 3aair temperature 3aleaf area 3aforage grasses 3awinter wheat 3aanimal growth 3adecision support systems 3acanopy 3acropping systems 3ametabolizable energy1 aPhillips, W.

At present, surgery is the main strategy for the treatment of endometrial carcinoma. However, in special cases such as serous, clear cell carcinoma and postoperative recurrences, chemotherapy is still essential and indispensable. The combined chemotherapy schemes of cisplatin, paclitaxel and doxorubicin (DOX) in clinical applications are unfortunately complicated and easily cause severe side effects. In recent years, with the development of nanotechnology, the targeted delivery of multi-chemotherapeutic drugs shows great advantages in reducing side effects and improving anticancer efficacy. Here, an ultra pH-sensitive nanovesicle based on polyethylene glycol-poly(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate (PEG-PDPA) was fabricated. A chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin) and an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 inhibitor (navitoclax) were co-encapsulated in the hydrophilic cavity and hydrophobic membrane of the vesicle, respectively. After accumulating in the tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the nanovesicles could be efficiently diffused in tumor cells by endocytosis and then rapidly release drugs in response to the lysosomal acidic environment, leading to an enhanced tumor-killing effect based on the combination therapy between DOX and the Bcl-2 inhibitor. The drug co-delivery system and microenvironment-triggered drug release may provide an efficient strategy for endometrial carcinoma therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acarcinoma 3acisplatin 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aendocytosis 3aendometrium 3aepithelium 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananotechnology 3aneoplasm cells 3apaclitaxel 3apermeability 3apolyethylene 3asurgery1 aZhang, Xu1 aChen, Chuangqi1 aHuang, Yuqiang1 aYu, Xingsu1 aLi, Xiaomao0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 8, no. 8 p.2264-2273dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00112k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245008100177500001900258520126200277592002801539650001201567650002301579650001701602650001101619650001601630650001401646650001601660650000701676650001501683653002001698653002101718653002501739653002601764700002101790700006001811700006001871773011901931856008802050852000902138655001202147IND60709365420221117163616.0210226e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandoval, Miguel A.10aArsenic and fluoride removal by electrocoagulation process: A general review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe environmental sector has expressed a growing interest in using electrocoagulation (EC) to treat groundwater/wastewater for drinking/recycling purposes. In the EC process, the electro-dissolution of sacrificial metallic anodes through direct application of current/cell potential dissolves the metals, which precipitate as oxides and hydroxides depending on the electrolyte pH. These particles have large surface areas and can remove pollutants by coagulation.The EC process has been considered an alternative technology due to its versatility, efficiency, low cost, and environmental compatibility. Unfortunately, the lack of knowledge about scaling-up this process has limited its implementation at the industrial scale.The aim of this study is to provide a review of the EC process used for removing arsenic and fluoride from groundwater and wastewater. Approximately 80 published studies were reviewed for this paper. The fundamentals of the EC process and importance of its operating conditions, i.e., electrode material, current density, supporting electrolyte, and pH, are reported in this paper. Additionally, overview of floc characterization and energy consumption are also presented. Finally, this paper also discusses the future perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3aelectrocoagulation 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3apH 3awastewater 0aArsenic removal 0aFluoride removal 0aWastewater treatment 0aGroundwater treatment1 aFuentes, Rosalba1 aThiam, Abdoulaye1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5024-18551 aSalazar, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2180-60220 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 753 p.142108-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010200173300001600275520164500291592002801936650001501964650002501979650002202004650000802026650003002034650002002064650000902084650003502093650000902128650002302137650001402160650001002174650002502184650001202209650001802221651001502239651001002254651001302264653001302277653002202290653002002312653001802332653001302350653001002363700001902373700002202392773010702414856008502521852000902606655001202615IND60563006320221121132151.0190214e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056300632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendiratta, Uttara10aEnforcement seizures reveal large-scale illegal trade in India's tortoises and freshwater turtles  ap. 100-105.  aIllegal trade in tortoises and freshwater turtles (TFTs) for pet, meat and traditional medicine markets in East and Southeast Asia poses significant threats to wild TFTs globally. South Asian countries such as India are believed to be disproportionately large sources of wild TFTs in illegal international markets, but the nature and dynamics of this trade in India are poorly understood. Using data from 223 enforcement seizure reports obtained through systematic online searches, we show that at least 15 of India's 28 TFT species, including 10 IUCN Threatened species, are illegally harvested, with over 58,000 live individuals seized during 2011–15. Geochelone elegans, Geoclemys hamiltonii and Lissemys punctata were recorded in the largest number of seizures and comprised the largest numbers of TFTs seized overall. Nearly 90% of all seizures were from illegal commercial trade, and there were numerous reports of Indian TFTs being transported by road, rail and air within India, as well as to known pet and meat trading hubs in Bangladesh, Thailand, and four other East/Southeast Asian countries. Commercial trade of live TFTs now targets twice as many Indian species as reported in the 1990s. Alongside illegal harvests for local consumption and TFT body parts for traditional East Asian medicines, this illegal trade poses a growing threat to Indian TFTs. Our findings indicate that building awareness and capacity for handling TFT seizures among enforcement agencies, and strengthening international cooperation for law enforcement, are important steps needed for conserving India's endangered tortoises and freshwater turtles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeochelone 3aGeoclemys hamiltonii 3aLissemys punctata 3aair 3ainternational cooperation 3alaw enforcement 3ameat 3anatural resources conservation 3apets 3athreatened species 3atortoises 3atrade 3atraditional medicine 3aturtles 3aworld markets 3aBangladesh 3aIndia 3aThailand 0aTortoise 0aFreshwater turtle 0aInternet search 0aIllegal trade 0aSeizures 0aIndia1 aSheel, Vallari1 aSingh, Shailendra0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Mar., v. 207 p.100-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002100136024001900157040001800176100002400194245014100218300001200359506007600371520109900447592002801546506003701574650001201611650001301623650001001636650000901646650001701655700003001672700002901702700001501731773010301746856008801849852000901937655001201946IND60119476120221207115415.0141214e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011947612DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2002-3-9-research00472doi7 aPMC1268722pmcid7 a122255862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade, Miguel A.,10aNEAT: a domain duplicated in genes near the components of a putative Fe3+ siderophore transporter from Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria  ap. 466.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Iron uptake from the host is essential for bacteria that infect animals. To find potential targets for drugs active against pathogenic bacteria, we have searched all completely sequenced genomes of pathogenic bacteria for genes relevant for iron transport. RESULTS: We identified a protein domain that appears in variable copy number in bacterial genes that are usually in the vicinity of a putative Fe³⁺siderophore transporter. Accordingly, we have denoted this domain NEAT for 'near transporter'. Most of the bacterial species containing this domain are pathogenic. Sequence features indicate that the domain is anchored to the extracellular side of the membrane. The domain seems to be under high selective pressure for rapid independent duplications that are typical of sequences involved in signaling and binding. CONCLUSIONS: The NEAT domain might be functionally related to iron transport. The taxonomic specificity of this domain and its predicted extracellular position could make it an interesting target for designing new drugs against some highly pathogenic bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3abacteria 3agenes 3airon 3asiderophores1 aCiccarelli, Francesca D.,1 aPerez-Iratxeta, Carolina1 aBork, Peer0 tGenome biology.g2002 Aug., v. 3, no. 9 p.466-466dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2002-3-9-research00473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245011200161300001800273500001400291520121900305592002801524650002001552650001001572650001601582650001701598650002001615650002101635650002301656650001101679650002501690651001001715653001201725653002001737653001301757653000901770653001101779653001101790700002001801700002001821700002301841700002101864700001501885773015201900856007602052852000902128655001202137IND60710104020221116194338.0200908e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071010402DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-36432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeotikar, P.V.10aSeasonal variation in oxidative stress markers of Murrah buffaloes in heavy metal exposed areas of Ludhiana  ap. 1310-1315.  aNAL-light  aThe parameters related to oxidative stress and heavy metal levels were assessed during summer and winter seasons in buffaloes from environmentally exposed areas (n=60) of Ludhiana district of Punjab (India) and control area (n=40). Buffaloes of heavy metal exposed areas exhibited significantly (p<0.05) increased blood levels of Cr, Ni, As and Pb along with significantly (p<0.05) higher erythrocytic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels; whereas significant (p<0.05) decrease was observed in superoxide dismutase activity and the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamins C and E as compared to buffaloes from control area. The level of oxidative stress was higher in all buffaloes during summer as compared to winter as indicated by significantly (p<0.05) higher MDA level, and lower concentrations of GSH, vitamins C and E irrespective of the area. Blood Cr, Ni, As and Pb levels showed highly significant positive correlation (p<0.01) with MDA level but negative correlation with SOD activity and the concentrations of GSH, vitamins C and E. Thus, it may be concluded that buffaloes exposed to heavy metals encounter significant oxidative stress and potential to quench free radicals is compromised during summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3ablood 3aglutathione 3aheavy metals 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aIndia 0aArsenic 0aBubalus bubalis 0aChromium 0aLead 0aNickel 0aSeason1 aNayyar, Sharif,1 aSingh, Calwant,1 aMukhopadhyay, C.S.1 aKakkar, S.

The variant differed by only one amino acid at position 12 from His to Asn. This change was observed in 23 of the 100 randomly selected enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates tested. There was a positive correlation between the presence of the STa enterotoxin and the STb variant. As the variant represented a high percentage of the ETEC strains tested, we were interested in determining if the single amino acid change results in altered biological characteristics of the toxin. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that the secondary structure of the variant was similar to wildtype and that their thermal stabilities were similar. Surface plasmon resonance showed that the variant and the wildtype toxins possessed similar binding affinities for sulfatide but the variant exhibited a reduced binding capacity. A flow cytometry-based internalization assay showed that the variant toxin is more internalized into epithelial intestinal cells than the wildtype strain. However, this difference was minor. Overall, our results indicate that while wildtype STb and the variant share similar structural properties, modest differences exist in their internalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abinding capacity 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aenterotoxins 3aintestinal mucosa 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asurface plasmon resonance 3aswine1 aHancock, Mark A.1 aMourez, Michaël1 aDubreuil, J.

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea with non-lethal effects in piglets was identified in Tottori prefecture in October 2014. Complete genome analysis revealed that the causative pathogen, Tottori2, is a new PEDV variant with a large (582 nt) deletion in the spike gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Tottori2 PEDV strain might have been derived from the current PEDV strains circulating in domestic pigs. Moreover, the Tottori2 PEDV strain was successfully isolated in Vero cells by serial passage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3adiarrhea 3agenes 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apiglets 3asequence analysis 3aJapan1 aMurakami, Satoshi1 aTakahashi, Osamu1 aMiyazaki, Ayako1 aOhashi, Seiichi1 aYamasato, Hiroshi1 aSuzuki, Tohru0 tArchives of virology.g2015 Oct., v. 160, no. 10 p.2565-2568dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2522-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01629naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245005600172300001600228520054300244592002800787650002800815650001600843650001100859650001400870650001300884650002000897650001300917650000900930650001900939653002200958653001300980653001600993653002701009653002501036773008901061856008401150852000901234655001201243IND60544840320221122050449.0160901e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolednik, Bernard10aAerosol and bioaerosol particles in a dental office  ap. 405-409.  aThis study reports comprehensive aerosol and bioaerosol measurements in a dental office.

Its larvae damage the leaves of many plants such as those belonging to the Oleaceae family, causing significant economic losses and seriously affecting the survival and reproduction of Cervus nippon; however, genetic data for this species are scarce. Methods: The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of B. hearseyi was sequenced using long-PCR and primer-walking methods. Phylogenetic analysis that was based on 13 PCGs and two rRNAs was carried out using the neighbor-joining and Bayesian interference methods. Results: The mitogenome is a typical circular molecule that is made up of 15,442 bp, which includes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and an A + T-rich region (456 bp). All of the PCGs, except for COX1 and COX2, start with ATN codons. COX2 and ND5 use the incomplete termination codon T, and 11 other PCGs use the typical stop codon TAA. All tRNA genes, except for trnS1 and trnS2, display a typical cloverleaf structure; trnS1 lacks the “DHU” arm, whereas trnS2 exhibits two mismatched base pairs in the anticodon stem. Phylogenetic analysis showed that B. hearseyi is clustered into Brahmaeidae, and the phylogenetic relationships are (Brahmaeidae + Lasiocampidae) + (Bombycidae + (Sphingidae + Saturniidae)). Conclusions: This study provides the first mitogenomic resources for the Brahmaeidae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aBombycidae 3aCervus nippon 3aLasiocampidae 3aOleaceae 3aSaturniidae 3aSphingidae 3amitochondrial genome 3amoths 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3astop codon 3atransfer RNA 3aChina1 aGao, Shangren 1 aCai, Shiyu 1 aZou, Zhiwen 1 aXin, Tianrong 1 aXia, Bin 0 tInsects.g2021 Oct. 28, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects121109733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009600160300001800256520128300274592002801557650002101585650001501606650001601621650001201637650002301649650001701672650002201689650001501711650003101726650001701757650001701774700001601791700001301807700001601820700001701836700001701853773012901870856007401999852000902073655001202082IND60688724420221122222859.0200416e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068872442DNAL7 a10.1039/d0bm00171f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiaoshuang12aA fluorinated low-molecular-weight PEI/HIF-1α shRNA polyplex system for hemangioma therapy  ap. 2129-2142.  aHemangioma, one of the most common angiogenic diseases in infants and children, is characterized by the abnormal and aggressive proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. Advanced therapeutic strategies like RNA interference can inhibit the expression of target proteins at the translational level, but they are rarely used in hemangioma treatment owing to the lack of safe carriers. In this study, we showed for the first time that RNAi technology targeting HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha) could benefit hemangioma therapy effectively. Heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFAA) was used to modify low-molecular-weight PEI (PEI1.8k), and a novel fluorinated polycation carrier named fluorinated PEI (FPEI) was synthesized. Furthermore, HIF-1α-shRNA-pDNA was condensed by FPEI to fabricate FPEI polyplexes. Compared with PEI25k polyplexes, which are usually the gold standard used in gene delivery, FPEI polyplexes showed lower cytotoxicity and higher serum stability, transfection efficiency and gene silencing efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we confirmed that FPEI polyplexes could efficiently inhibit the formation of new capillaries and tumor growth in vivo, which may provide a practicable strategy for clinical hemangioma treatment in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aanhydrides 3ablood serum 3acations 3acell proliferation 3acytotoxicity 3aendothelial cells 3ahemangioma 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3atherapeutics 3atransfection1 aYuan, Zihan1 aXu, Yang1 aWei, Minyan1 aFang, Zhiwei1 aYuan, Wei-En0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 8, no. 8 p.2129-2142dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00171f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245010900197300001800306506007600324520134700400592002801747506003701775650001301812650002301825650001801848650001801866650001701884650002601901650001001927650001101937650001701948650001401965650001901979650002301998650000702021650001802028650001802046650001302064650001702077700001902094700001902113700002402132773010802156856007502264852000902339655001202348IND60532796820221207110037.0160728e20141013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279682DNAL7 a10.1021/bm500883h2doi7 aPMC41955232pmcid7 a251486032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaler, Kevin10aAlbumin Hydrogels Formed by Electrostatically Triggered Self-Assembly and Their Drug Delivery Capability  ap. 3625-3633.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiological hydrogels are fundamentally biocompatible and have intrinsic similarities to extracellular matrices in medical applications and drug delivery systems. Herein we demonstrate the ability to form drug-eluting protein hydrogels using a novel mechanism that involves the electrostatically triggered partial denaturation and self-assembly of the protein via changes in pH. Partial denaturation increases the protein’s solvent exposed hydrophobic surface area, which then drives self-assembly of the protein into a hydrogel within 10 min at 37 °C. We describe the properties of an albumin hydrogel formed by this mechanism. Intrinsic drug binding properties of albumin to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) are conserved through the partial denaturation process, as confirmed by fluorescence quenching. atRA released from the hydrogel inhibited smooth muscle cell migration as per an in vitro scratch wound assay. Atomistic molecular dynamics and potential of mean force calculations show the preservation and potential creation of new atRA binding sites with a binding energy of −41 kJ/mol. The resulting hydrogel is also biocompatible and exhibits rapid postgelation degradation after its implantation in vivo. This interdisciplinary work provides a new tool for the development of biocompatible protein hydrogel drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalbumins 3abinding properties 3abinding sites 3acell movement 3adenaturation 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular dynamics 3apH 3aretinoic acid 3asmooth muscle 3asolvents 3asurface area1 aMichael, Raman1 aSzleifer, Igal1 aAmeer, Guillermo A.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 Oct. 13, v. 15, no. 10 p.3625-3633dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm500883h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002000158245015600178300001600334520169300350592002802043650001302071650001702084650000902101650001002110650001402120650001502134650001602149650001202165650000902177650002202186650001002208650002702218651001002245651001202255700002102267700002002288700002002308700002102328700001302349700002202362773011202384856004002496852000902536655001202545IND50072291920221118064511.0140125e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007229192DNAL7 a242892542pmid7 a10.1111/mec.126082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourguet, Denis10a‘Becoming a species by becoming a pest’ or how two maize pests of the genus Ostrinia possibly evolved through parallel ecological speciation events  ap. 325-342.  aNew agricultural pest species attacking introduced crops may evolve from pre‐existing local herbivores by ecological speciation, thereby becoming a species by becoming a pest. We compare the evolutionary pathways by which two maize pests (the Asian and the European corn borers, ACB and ECB) in the genus Ostrinia (Lepidoptera, Crambidae) probably diverged from an ancestral species close to the current Adzuki bean borer (ABB). We typed larval Ostrinia populations collected on maize and dicotyledons across China and eastern Siberia, at microsatellite and mitochondrial loci. We found only two clusters: one on maize (as expected) and a single one on dicotyledons despite differences in male mid‐tibia morphology, suggesting that all individuals from dicotyledons belonged to the ABB. We found evidence for migrants and hybrids on both host plant types. Hybrids suggest that field reproductive isolation is incomplete between ACB and ABB. Interestingly, a few individuals with an ‘ABB‐like’ microsatellite profile collected on dicotyledons had ‘ACB’ mtDNA rather than ‘ABB‐like’ mtDNA, whereas the reverse was never found on maize. This suggests asymmetrical gene flow directed from the ACB towards the ABB. Hybrids and backcrosses in all directions were obtained in no‐choice tests. In laboratory conditions, they survived as well as parental strain individuals. In Xinjiang, we found ACB and ECB in sympatry, but no hybrids. Altogether, our results suggest that reproductive isolation between ACB and ABB is incomplete and mostly prezygotic. This points to ecological speciation as a possible evolutionary scenario, as previously found for ECB and ABB in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstrinia 3abackcrossing 3acorn 3acrops 3agene flow 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amitochondrial DNA 3apests 3areproductive isolation 3aChina 3aSiberia1 aPonsard, Sergine1 aStreiff, Rejane1 aMeusnier, Serge1 aAudiot, Philippe1 aLi, Jing1 aWang, Zhen‐Ying0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.325-342dBlackwell SciencewJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.12608  aDNAL 7aarticle03854naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245010100171520253900272592002802811650002002839650001202859650001502871650000902886650001002895650001202905650001802917650001202935650001202947650003302959650001802992650001803010650001403028650002003042650002003062650001503082700002803097700002103125700002503146700002703171773012103198856008003319852000903399655001203408IND60757775120221119132941.0211125e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075777512DNAL7 a10.3390/insects121109562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamidou Leyo, Idriss 10aBreeding Enhancement of Musca domestica L. 1758: Egg Load as a Measure of Optimal Larval Density  aThe amount of waste produced by the population creates general health problems in terms of public health and hygiene. In recent years the common housefly (Musca domestica L. 1758; Dipteran: Muscidae) has been widely used in the treatment of organic wastes. This study aims to assess the effect of egg loading of the common housefly on maggot development and waste reduction. Housefly larvae were reared at four egg loads (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 mg) under three different diets (wheat bran, millet bran, cow dung). Two-factor ANOVA (α = 0.05) was used to test the effect of two fixed factors (egg load and substrate) on larval biomass, the survival rate from egg hatching until the last larval instar, number of larvae and substrate reduction rate. The comparison of means based on Duncan’s test was performed to compare the means of the different variables measured. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the relationship between the measured variables (larval biomass, the survival rate from egg hatching until the last larval instar, number of larvae, and substrate reduction rate) on the discrimination of the egg load factor. The results showed that under the same nutritional conditions, the yield of housefly larvae, the number of larvae and the reduction of substrates increased with increasing egg load. Indeed, at each of three substrates, the rearing egg load of 10 mg resulted in the maximum larval yield, maximum number of larvae, and maximum substrate reduction rate. At this optimum load, wheat bran generated greater biomass, greater number of larvae and greater reduction of substrate compared to millet bran and cow dung. The egg load as a whole had no effect on the survival rate from egg hatching until the last larval instar, unlike substrate type. The high egg load for the survival rate (from egg hatching until the last larval instar) for millet bran was 1.25 while there was no difference for the other two substrates. These results can help to make the waste treatment process efficient with the subsequent production of a large larval biomass that can serve as added value in animal feed. The egg load of 10 mg and the wheat bran were superior respectively to the other egg load and substrates type for all parameters tested excepted for the survival rate (from egg hatching until the last larval instar). Ours study indicated that larval biomass, larval number, egg viability and substrate rate reduction of Musca domestica are affected by the egg load, substrate type and their interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusca domestica 3abiomass 3acow manure 3aeggs 3afeeds 3ahygiene 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3amillets 3aprincipal component analysis 3apublic health 3asurvival rate 3aviability 3awaste reduction 3awaste treatment 3awheat bran1 aMoussa Ousmane, Zakari 1 aNoël, Gregoire 1 aFrancis, Frédéric 1 aCaparros Megido, Rudy 0 tInsects.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects121109563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012400169500002200293520121500315592002801530650001201558650001901570650001801589650001201607650001101619650002301630650002101653650002401674650002201698653004001720653002901760653001801789653003001807700001601837700001401853700005601867700001701923700001501940773007701955856008602032852000902118655001202127IND60585824920221120105211.0171114s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yiping10aExperimental and Numerical Optimization of Direct-contact Liquid Film Cooling in High Concentration Photovoltaic System  aPre-press version  aThermal management is a critical issue for normal operation of dense-array solar cells in high concentration photovoltaic system. A cooling method of direct-contact liquid film was experimentally and numerically investigated. In the experiments, deionized water was adopted as coolant and an electric heating plate was optimal designed to simulate dense-array solar cells. A two-dimension model was derived to present the temperature distribution on the surface of the simulated solar cells and flow characteristic of liquid film. The effect of various inlet parameters such as water temperature, inlet width and velocity had been numerical studied. The experiment results suggest that the surface temperature is well controlled under 120 °C at corresponding conditions, with concentration ratios ranging from 300 to 500X. The numerical results show that inlet width has a crucial effect on the liquid film thickness. The subcooled boiling state is a necessary condition to ensure cooling effect. High water inlet temperature is preferable for better heat transfer performance and temperature uniformity. The best optimizing inlet velocity, width and temperature are 1.06 m/s, 0.75 mm and 75°C, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling 3adirect contact 3aheat transfer 3aliquids 3amodels 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asolar collectors 3asurface temperature 3awater temperature 0aDirect-contact falling film cooling 0atemperature distribution 0aheat transfer 0ahigh concentration ratios1 aZhou, Liqun1 aKang, Xue1 aHuang, Qunwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7105-69231 aShi, Xusheng1 aWang, Chen0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005700188245010400245300001100349506007600360520244800436592002802884506003702912650002202949650001202971650001402983650001302997650001203010650002603022650001503048650001203063650001003075650001603085700001803101773013603119856008203255852000903337655001203346IND60594629120221207121904.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059462912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-018-2502-x2doi7 aPMC59457902pmcid7 a297739252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrinsted, Lena1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3904-372110aPredictors of nest growth: diminishing returns for subordinates in the paper wasp Polistes dominula  ap. 88.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn cooperative breeders, subordinates that have alternative reproductive options are expected to stay and help dominant breeders only as long as they contribute to group productivity, if their fitness is linked with colony success. Female Polistes dominula paper wasps live as cooperative breeders in small groups of typically fewer than 10 females. Subordinates tend to have high-quality outside options, and so could choose alternative breeding tactics if their work efforts increased productivity negligibly. In the founding stage before workers emerge, we tested the effect of various predictors on nest growth, as a proxy for group productivity, and explored the shape of the relationship between group size and nest growth. We found group size to be the only significant predictor of nest growth: variation among body sizes within the group showed no effect, suggesting a lack of size-dependent task specialization in this species. Average body size and average genetic relatedness between group members similarly showed no effects on nest growth. Group size had a non-linear effect so that per-capita benefits to nest growth decreased in larger groups, and groups of 10 or more would benefit negligibly from additional group members. Hence, females might be better off pursuing other options than joining a large group. This finding helps to explain why P. dominula groups are usually relatively small in our study population. Further studies may illuminate the mechanisms behind the smaller per-capita nest growth that we found in larger groups. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Identifying which factors influence the productivity of animal groups is key to understanding why different species breed cooperatively in groups of varying sizes. In the paper wasp Polistes dominula, we investigated the growth rate of nests as a measure of group productivity. We found that average body size, the variation in body sizes within the group, and average genetic relatedness between group members did not affect nest growth, while group size had a strong, positive effect: nests grew faster with more group members, but the per-capita benefit decreased in larger groups. The addition of extra group members in groups of 10 or more had negligible effects on nest growth. Hence, wasps may be better off pursuing other options than joining large groups. This finding helps to explain why groups normally consist of fewer than 10 wasps in this population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPolistes dominula 3aanimals 3abody size 3abreeding 3afemales 3agenetic relationships 3agroup size 3anesting 3anests 3apaper wasps1 aField, Jeremy0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2018 June, v. 72, no. 6 p.88-88dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-018-2502-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011000153300001400263520144700277592002801724650001101752650001201763650001501775650001601790650002401806650001001830650002101840650001701861650002101878650002101899650002201920650001901942650001401961650001301975650002201988650001202010650002102022650000702043650000902050700001702059700001902076700001802095700001702113700001202130700001802142700001802160700001802178773012502196856007502321852000902396655001202405IND60657838220221120231647.0190823e20131129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065783822DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60186b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Hao10aRatiometric fluorescence imaging of lysosomal Zn²⁺ release under oxidative stress in neural stem cells  ap. 89-97.  aZinc dyshomeostasis is a major mechanism of neuronal death, which is involved in many different neuropathological conditions. Lysosomal membrane permeabilisation has an important function in zinc-induced neuronal death under oxidative stress. To investigate lysosomal zinc functions in neurons with high spatial and temporal reliability, we report a ratiometric probe, LysoZn-1. It is derived from the styryl-BODIPY-DPA scaffold with a lysosome-targeted 2-morpholinoethylamine moiety to allow localisation in lysosomes. The electron donor at the meso-position of the BODIPY fluorophore makes the present probe prefer complexing with Zn²⁺ rather than Cd²⁺, which can be explained by HSAB (Hard–Soft Acid–Base) theory and was confirmed by Gaussian calculation. Upon Zn²⁺ binding, LysoZn-1 exhibits obvious fluorescence enhancement (F₅₇₈ ₙₘ) and ratio (F₅₇₈ ₙₘ/F₆₈₀ ₙₘ) changes. The emission intensities of LysoZn-1 and LysoZn-1 + Zn²⁺ do not change significantly under lysosomal pH ranging from 4.5 to 6.0. Confocal imaging experiments indicate that LysoZn-1 is able to localise to lysosomes in neural stem cells (NSCs), MCF-7 and Hela cells and detect exogenous Zn²⁺ levels in NSCs and MCF-7 cells. LysoZn-1 function is not disturbed by chloroquine in living cells. Furthermore, increases in lysosomal Zn²⁺ concentration upon H₂O₂ stimulation in NSCs are observed using LysoZn-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3acadmium 3acell death 3achloroquine 3aconfocal microscopy 3adeath 3aemissions factor 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimage analysis 3alysosomes 3amoieties 3aneural stem cells 3aneurons 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3azinc1 aFan, Jiangli1 aZhang, Shiling1 aCao, Jianfang1 aSong, Kedong1 aGe, Dan1 aDong, Huijuan1 aWang, Jingyun1 aPeng, Xiaojun0 tBiomaterials science.g2013 Nov. 29, v. 2, no. 1 p.89-97dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60186b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009400172300001600266520192500282592002802207650001602235650001102251650001802262650001302280650001502293650001502308650001302323650001102336650001602347650001102363650001902374650001102393650001302404651001002417700002302427700001602450700002002466700001902486773012402505856008402629852000902713655001202722IND60123429620221120061943.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012342962DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2013.8669962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZydlewski, Joseph10aGrowth and Smolting in Lower-Mode Atlantic Salmon Stocked into the Penobscot River, Maine  ap. 147-158.  aRestoration of Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar in Maine has relied on hatchery-produced fry and smolts for critical stocking strategies. Stocking fry minimizes domestication selection, but these fish have poor survival. Conversely, stocked smolts have little freshwater experience but provide higher adult returns. Lower-mode (LM) fish, those not growing fast enough to ensure smolting by the time of stocking, are a by-product of the smolt program and are an intermediate hatchery product. From 2002 to 2009, between 70,000 and 170,000 marked LM Atlantic Salmon were stocked into the Pleasant River (a tributary in the Penobscot River drainage, Maine) in late September to early October. These fish were recaptured as actively migrating smolts (screw trapping), as nonmigrants (electrofishing), and as returning adults to the Penobscot River (Veazie Dam trap). Fork length (FL) was measured and a scale sample was taken to retrospectively estimate FL at winter annulus one (FW1) using the intercept-corrected direct proportion model. The LM fish were observed to migrate as age-1, age-2, and infrequently as age-3 smolts. Those migrating as age-1 smolts had a distinctly larger estimated FL at FW1 (>112 mm) than those that remained in the river for at least one additional year. At the time of migration, age-2 and age-3 smolts were substantially larger than age-1 smolts. Returning adult Atlantic Salmon of LM origin had estimated FLs at FW1 that corresponded to smolt age (greater FL for age 1 than age 2). The LM product produces both age-1 and age-2 smolts that have greater freshwater experience than hatchery smolts and may have growth and fitness advantages. The data from this study will allow managers to better assess the probability of smolting age and manipulate hatchery growth rates to produce a targeted-size LM product.

Myzus persicae and Acyrthosiphon pisum are generalist and specialist species, respectively. In this study, these two aphid species were used to investigate host acceptance and plant resistance to aphid feeding. M.persicae survived and reproduced on rape (Brassica rapa), but few individuals (9%) survived on faba bean (Vicia faba). A.pisum survived and reproduced on faba bean, but no A.pisum survived on rape. The probing and feeding behavior of M. persicae and A. pisum on rape and faba bean was examined using an electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique. The results demonstrated the feeding preferences of these two aphid species. The EPG results suggest that the resistance of faba bean to M. persicae and that of rape to A. pisum are likely residing in the phloem and mesophyll tissues, respectively. Due to the distinct probing and feeding behaviors, specialist and generalist aphids would have different impacts on the epidemiology of plant viral diseases. The findings can be applied to the management of viral diseases transmitted by specialist or generalist aphids in crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aBrassica rapa 3aMyzus persicae 3aVicia faba 3acrop production 3aepidemiology 3afaba beans 3amesophyll 3aphloem1 aPoovendhan, Sushanthi 1 aHuang, Lixin,1 aTsai, Chi-Wei 0 tInsects.g2021 Oct. 28, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects121109753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245012900204300001100333520231100344592002802655650001202683650002002695650001602715650001002731650001502741650002202756650001402778650001302792650001202805650001502817650001202832650001002844650002502854650001902879650001002898650001402908650002002922700001902942700002002961773013602981856008203117852000903199655001203208IND60594629220221121071356.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059462922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-018-2504-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Emiliano1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8108-795014aThe bone collector: temporal patterns of bone-gnawing behaviour define osteophagia as a female prerogative in a large rodent  ap. 89.  aCalcium and phosphorous consumption is essential for bone development and maintenance throughout life, particularly to pregnant and lactating females. Bone consumption may provide mothers with the required supplemental amount of calcium and phosphorous. Osteophagia has been reported in a number of herbivore species as supplying such key mineral elements, although sound evidence is lacking for rodents. The diet of the crested porcupine is vegetarian and predominantly composed by roots and hypogeal storage organs. Gnawed bone residuals have often been observed in the surroundings of porcupine setts. This behaviour may have evolved to reduce the indefinite growth of incisor teeth, to increase calcium and phosphorous supply, or to fulfil both these functions. To clarify this issue, five setts were monitored for 3 years and bones in front of sett entries were counted and collected once a month. A total of 63 bones (mainly femurs and shins: 38.8%) was detected, mainly belonging to wild (46.03%) and domestic (28.57%) ungulates. The presence of gnawed bones in front of sett entries was recorded throughout the year, with a peak at the start of February. Camera-trapping data confirmed that areas surroundings house-farms, where most bones were probably collected, were only selected in the cold season. The peak of gnawed bone detection overlapped with the birth peak, suggesting that bones may be consumed by lactating females to increase the amount of minerals in their diet. This suggestion was further confirmed by the detection of no gnawed bones in front of the sett of the male-male pair. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Porcupines are known to collect and gnaw bones in the surroundings of their setts, but ecological explanations and temporal patterns of this behaviour are unknown. We monitored five setts for 3 years, measuring and identifying gnawed bones in front of sett entries once a month. We then conducted an intensive camera-trapping session to monitor areas surrounding house-farms. Bone collection occurred throughout the year, with a peak in February, coinciding with the birth peak of this species. We therefore suggested that bone consumption could be a female prerogative, related to a supply of minerals in diet, as no gnawed bone was observed at the sett of a male-male pair.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acamera trapping 3acold season 3afemur 3aherbivores 3alactating females 3alactation 3aminerals 3amothers 3aphosphorus 3arodents 3aroots 3askeletal development 3astorage organs 3ateeth 3aungulates 3avegetarian diet1 aLovari, Sandro1 aMazza, Giuseppe0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2018 June, v. 72, no. 6 p.89-89dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-018-2504-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013800159300001800297520102800315592002801343650004401371650002701415650002601442650002901468650002801497650001801525650001401543650002601557650002801583650002201611650001801633650001501651650001901666650001101685650003701696700001301733700002301746700002101769700002001790700002501810700002101835700001801856700001601874700002401890773010801914856007502022852000902097655001202106IND60532797120221119171821.0160728e20141013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279712DNAL7 a10.1021/bm500939x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBober, Patrycja10aBiocomposites of Nanofibrillated Cellulose, Polypyrrole, and Silver Nanoparticles with Electroconductive and Antimicrobial Properties  ap. 3655-3663.  aIn this work, flexible and free-standing composite films of nanofibrillated cellulose/polypyrrole (NFC/PPy) and NFC/PPy-silver nanoparticles (NFC/PPy-Ag) have been synthesized for the first time via in situ one-step chemical polymerization and applied in potential biomedical applications. Incorporation of NFC into PPy significantly improved its film formation ability resulting in composite materials with good mechanical and electrical properties. It is shown that the NFC/PPy-Ag composite films have strong inhibition effect against the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus. The electrical conductivity and strong antimicrobial activity makes it possible to use the silver composites in various applications aimed at biomedical treatments and diagnostics.

Those nanoparticles exhibited a spin glass like behaviour at a temperature around 9 K. The samples showed electronic conduction arising out of small polaron hopping between the Ni²⁺ and Ni³⁺ species present in the material. A large magnetodielectric parameter with a maximum value of 52.2% was observed in the sample at room temperature which resulted from the Maxwell–Wagner polarization effect. This was explained as arising due to a large negative magnetoresistance caused by spin polarized electron hopping between Ni²⁺ and Ni³⁺ sites with the consequential formation of space charge polarization at the interfaces of the NiO nanoparticles. This was substantiated by direct measurement of magnetoresistance of the samples which gave identical results. It is believed that negative magnetoresistance after direct measurement occurred due to the interaction between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases and the value was 37%, the highest reported in the literature so far. As a result of the presence of Ni³⁺ ions, antiferromagnetic phase and ferromagnetic like behaviour of NiO nanoparticles gave higher magnetization than other reported nanoparticles. Such large values of magnetoresistance of the samples will make the material useful as an ideal magnetic sensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aferromagnetism 3aglass 3anickel oxide 3aparticle size1 aMaiti, Ramaprasad1 aChakravorty, Dipankar0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 03, v. 10, no. 23 p.13708-13716dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00188k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245013400162300001400296500001500310520193000325592002802255650001202283650000902295650001802304650001102322650001002333650000902343650002902352650001502381650002402396650002402420650001202444650001902456650003402475650001802509650005302527650001002580650001102590651001802601653002402619653003502643653000802678653001802686653001502704653000802719653000802727653000802735653001102743700001902754700001602773700002602789700001902815773008702834856008402921852000903005655001203014IND60544840720221122050415.0160901e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.05.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Hui10aAssociations between blood lead level and substance use and sexually transmitted infection risk among adults in the United States  ap. 21-30.  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of low-level lead exposure on neuropsychological status in the United States (US) general adult population have been reported, and the relationship between neuropsychiatric dysfunction and health risk behaviors including substance use and sexual risk taking is well established. However, the potential influence of lead exposure on risk-taking behavior has received little attention. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010, we estimated multivariable logistic regression models to measure odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the cross-sectional associations between blood lead level and risk behaviors including binge drinking, drug use, and indicator of sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk. STI indicators included past 12 month sexual risk behaviors (age mixing with partners who were at least five years younger or older and multiple partnerships), self-reported STI, and biologically-confirmed herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection. Dose–response like relationships were observed between blood lead and substance use, age mixing with younger and older partners, self-reported STI, and HSV-2. In addition, participants with lead levels in highest quartile versus those with levels in the lowest quartile had over three times the odds of binge drinking and over twice the odds of injection drug or cocaine use in the past 12 months, while being in one of the top two quartiles was significantly associated with 30–70% increased odds of multiple partnerships, sex with older partners, and self-reported and biologically confirmed STI. Results from this study suggested that lead exposure may contribute to substance use, sexual risk-taking, and STI. However, given limitations inherent in the cross-sectional nature of the study, additional studies that use longitudinal data and measure detailed temporal information are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinging 3arisk 3adose response 3amixing 3adrugs 3alead 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 2 3aodds ratio 3aconfidence interval 3aregression analysis 3acocaine 3adrug injection 3asexually transmitted diseases 3arisk behavior 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3ablood 3aadults 3aUnited States 0aHuman herpesvirus 2 0aSexually transmitted infection 0aCIs 0aSubstance use 0aBlood lead 0aMEC 0aSTI 0aORs 0aNHANES1 aScheidell, Joy1 aXu, Xiaohui1 aCoatsworth, Ashley M.1 aKhan, Maria R.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Nov., v. 135 p.21-30dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010300164300001600267520132000283592002801603650001501631650001701646650001701663650001201680650002601692650002601718650001601744650001201760650001601772650001001788650002001798650001201818650000901830650002001839700002401859700001701883773008001900856004801980852000902028655001202037IND4479816620221119150448.0120428e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447981662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-011-0636-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDlouhá, Jana,10aRepresentativeness of wood biomechanical properties measured after storage in different conditions  ap. 695-703.  aObtaining representative values of green wood properties is essential for studies investigating the biomechanical aspects of tree development and ecology. Here, we compare the biomechanical properties of wood stored in various conditions between their collection in the field and their measurement. The study was performed on a large sample of wood specimens from different tropical species and different location in the trees, representing a wide diversity in wood structures. Elastic and viscoelastic properties are measured on green wood, and measured again after storage in different conditions: immersion in cold water during various durations, storage in an ethanol solution with or without washing in water, and air drying with or without rehydration. The systematic and random errors induced by these storage methods are quantified. Storage in cold water is the best way to preserve wood native properties. Soaking in ethanol is a fair alternative regarding elastic properties, but induces a significant change in viscoelastic properties. Air drying causes important, and partly irreversible, changes in mechanical properties. However, regarding elastic properties, this change is a systematic bias so that the air-dried elastic modulus provides a good basis for comparative studies of green wood stiffness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3abiomechanics 3acold storage 3aethanol 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3arehydration 3asoaking 3astored wood 3atrees 3aviscoelasticity 3awashing 3awood 3awood properties1 aAlméras, Tancrède1 aClair, Bruno0 tTrees.g2012 June, v. 26, no. 3 p.695-703dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-011-0636-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009700168300001600265520158900281592002801870650002601898650002401924650002301948650000901971650001301980650001101993650001502004650001602019650001202035650002302047650001502070651001702085700002602102700001702128700002002145700001902165773012402184856008402308852000902392655001202401IND60123429820221120054911.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012342982DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2013.8478782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Tyler10aSpatial and Temporal Dynamics in Brook Trout Density: Implications for Population Monitoring  ap. 258-269.  aMany potential stressors to aquatic environments operate over large spatial scales, prompting the need to assess and monitor both site-specific and regional dynamics of fish populations. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability in density and capture probability of age-1 and older Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis from three-pass removal data collected at 291 sites over a 37-year time period (1975–2011) in Pennsylvania streams. There was high between-year variability in density, with annual posterior means ranging from 2.1 to 10.2 fish/100 m ²; however, there was no significant long-term linear trend. Brook Trout density was positively correlated with elevation and negatively correlated with percent developed land use in the network catchment. Probability of capture did not vary substantially across sites or years but was negatively correlated with mean stream width. Because of the low spatiotemporal variation in capture probability and a strong correlation between first-pass CPUE (catch/min) and three-pass removal density estimates, the use of an abundance index based on first-pass CPUE could represent a cost-effective alternative to conducting multiple-pass removal sampling for some Brook Trout monitoring and assessment objectives. Single-pass indices may be particularly relevant for monitoring objectives that do not require precise site-specific estimates, such as regional monitoring programs that are designed to detect long-term linear trends in density.

Baltergin metalloproteinase purified from the venom exerted a toxic effect on C2C12 myoblast cells (CC₅₀: 583.34 μg/mL) which involved morphological alterations compatible with apoptosis/anoikis. On the contrary, the most abundant PLA₂ isolated from this venom did not exhibit cytotoxicity at times and doses tested.

Neutralization of the venom with specific antibodies (IgG anti-baltergin and IgG anti-PLA₂) confirmed this synergism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBothrops 3aantibodies 3aapoptosis 3acytotoxicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ain vitro studies 3amuscles 3amyoblasts 3aphospholipase A2 3askeletal muscle 3asynergism 3avenoms1 aGay, Claudia C.1 aGarcía Denegri, María E.1 aPonce-Soto, Luis A.1 aBal de Kier Joffé, Elisa1 aAcosta, Ofelia1 aLeiva, Laura C.0 tToxicon.g2012 Feb., v. 59, no. 2 p.338-343dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016000169300001600329520137000345592002801715650001301743650001501756650001401771650002101785650001801806650001701824650001001841650001901851650001901870650001001889650001501899650000901914650001301923650001501936650001301951650001101964650001801975653002901993653002102022653002302043653002502066653001302091700001702104700001802121700001802139700001602157773011102173856008602284852000902370655001202379IND60761098620221123014620.0220124e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076109862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Jingwen10a“Attractive/adhesion force” dual-regulatory nanogels capable of CXCR4 antagonism and autophagy inhibition for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer  ap. 892-903.  aMetastasis is refractory systemic disease resulting in low survival rate of breast cancer patients, especially in the late stage. The processes of metastasis are mainly initiated by strong “attractive force” from distant organs and deteriorated by weak “adhesion force” in primary tumor. Here, we reported “attractive/adhesion force” dual-regulatory nanogels (CQ-HF/PTX) for the precise treatment of both primary and metastasis of metastatic breast cancer. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and hydrophobic Fmoc were grafted on hydrophilic hydroxyethyl starch (HES) to obtain amphiphilic CQ-HF polymer, which was assembly with chemotherapy drug paclitaxel (PTX) to form the nanogels for anti-primary tumor. Meanwhile, CQ-HF/PTX nanogels play two roles in anti-metastasis: i) For reducing the “attractive force”, it could block the CXCR4/SDF-1 pathway, preventing tumor cells metastasis to the lung; ii) For reinforcing “adhesion force”, it could inhibit the excessive autophagy for hindering the degradation of paxillin and enhancing the cell adhesion. As a result, dual-regulatory CQ-HF/PTX nanogels dramatically inhibited tumor and the lung metastasis of mouse breast cancer. Therefore, the fabricating of synergetic dual-regulatory nanogels uncovered the explicit mechanism and provided an efficient strategy for combating malignant metastatic tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aantagonism 3aautophagy 3abreast neoplasms 3acell adhesion 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alungs 3ametastasis 3amice 3ananogels 3apaclitaxel 3apolymers 3astarch 3asurvival rate 0aBreast cancer metastasis 0aCXCR4 antagonism 0aHydroxychloroquine 0aAutophagy inhibition 0aPaxillin1 aZhu, Chenfei1 aZhang, Feiran1 aZhou, Zhanwei1 aSun, Minjie0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Jan., v. 341 p.892-903dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008700167300001400254520157600268592002801844650001501872650001701887650001801904650002401922650002201946650001101968650001301979650001101992650001502003650002302018653002602041653001302067653003102080653002802111700001102139700001302150700001302163773011102176856008502287852000902372655001202381IND60634703120221118053802.0190325e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063470312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Y.C.10aCyber Physical System and Big Data enabled energy efficient machining optimisation  ap. 46-62.  aDue to increasingly customised manufacturing, unpredictable ambient working conditions in shop floors and stricter requirements on sustainability, it is challenging to achieve energy efficient optimisation for machining processes. This paper presents a novel Cyber Physical System (CPS) and Big Data enabled machining optimisation system to address the above challenge. The innovations and characteristics of the system include the following four aspects: (1) a novel process of “scheduling, monitoring/learning, rescheduling” is designed to enhance system adaptability during manufacturing lifecycles; (2) an innovative energy model to support energy efficient optimisation over manufacturing lifecycles is developed. The energy model, which is enabled by CPS, Big Data analytics and intelligent learning algorithms, considers dynamic and aging conditions of machine tool systems during manufacturing lifecycles; (3) an effective evolutional algorithm based on Fruit Fly Optimisation (FFO), is applied to generate an adaptive energy efficient schedule, and improve schedule when there are significantly varying working conditions and adjustments on the schedule are necessary (that is rescheduling); (4) the system has been successfully deployed into European machining companies to verify capabilities. According to the results, around 40% energy saving and 30% productivity improvement have been achieved in the companies. A practical case study presented in this paper demonstrates the effectiveness and great potential of applicability of the system in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3adata analysis 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3afloors 3alearning 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aworking conditions 0aCyber physical system 0aBig data 0aEnergy efficient machining 0aScheduling optimisation1 aLu, X.1 aLi, W.D.1 aWang, S.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 20, v. 187 p.46-62dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002300150245012100173300001600294520160900310592002801919650002001947650001501967650002501982650001402007650001502021650002402036650002102060650001302081650001502094650001102109650001002120650001002130650001802140650001902158650001802177650002202195700001602217700001802233700001402251773008602265856008602351852000902437655001202446IND4479327120221119202127.0141110e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447932712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKartika, I.

Two sets of sorption-isotherm experiment were performed to describe the relationship between EMC and FFA content with water activity, for both fresh and dried seeds. The seeds were conditioned in series of saturated salts having certain water activity and stored at different temperatures (20, 30, 40Â Â°C). The nested experimental design and ANOVA (F-test at pÂ =Â 0.05) were applied to study the effects of temperature and water activity on the EMC of jatropha seed. EMC increased generally with the increase in water activity and with the decrease in temperature at either desorption or adsorption. The EMC was significantly affected by water activity, but the temperature did not significantly affect the EMC. The hysteresis effect was more pronounced at lower temperatures. The FFA content of seed was relatively constant at low water activity (awÂ <Â 0.8), but it was high at higher water activity. The moisture sorption behaviour of jatropha seed revealed that like most product, it exhibited the sigmoid pattern. The BET, GAB, Harkins-Jura, Halsey and Henderson models were recommended as adequate models in predicting the amount of moisture adsorbed or desorbed at known humidity. The relationship between EMC and FFA content of jatropha seed showed that the polynomial equation was the best fitting for either fresh or dried seed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3aadsorption 3aanalysis of variance 3abiodiesel 3adesorption 3aexperimental design 3afree fatty acids 3ahumidity 3ahysteresis 3amodels 3asalts 3aseeds 3avegetable oil 3awater activity 3awater content 3awater temperature1 aYuliani, S.1 aKailaku, S.I.1 aRigal, L.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2012 Jan., v. 36 p.226-233dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01945naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001700157245006500174300001400239520088700253592002801140650002301168650001101191650002301202650000901225650001501234653001101249653001401260653001101274653002001285653002001305653002701325700001901352773011101371856009201482852000901574655001201583IND60536691820221119143707.0190412e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErbay, Zafer10aAdvanced exergoeconomic evaluation of a heat pump food dryer  ap. 29-39.  aIn this study, the results of conventional and advanced exergoeconomic analyses of the performance of a pilot scale air-source heat pump food dryer were compared for the first time. The contributions of the components of the drying system to the exergetic cost effectiveness of the dryer were evaluated, and the effects of changing the inlet drying temperature were determined. The most important system component was determined to be the heat recovery unit, followed by the condenser with respect to the reducing potentials for the total costs of the overall system. Decreasing temperature caused an increase in the cost performance of drying. The modification of the system components for improving the efficiency of the system can be effectively determined through advanced exergoeconomic approach by stating the realistic potential improvements and the priorities in the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adrying 3adrying temperature 3aheat 3aheat pumps 0aDrying 0aHeat pump 0aExergy 0aExergoeconomics 0aAdvanced exergy 0aAdvanced exergoeconomy1 aHepbasli, Arif0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Aug., v. 124 p.29-39dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015500164300001600319500001900335520101300354592002801367650001001395650001301405650001201418650001401430650001601444650001501460650002201475650001201497650001001509650001501519650001501534650001501549650001401564650001501578650001401593650002001607650001101627650001101638650000901649650001401658650001301672650001101685653000801696653001501704653001301719653002301732653001101755653002301766653000801789700001701797773013201814856007801946852000902024655001202033IND60723074520221122225753.0210112e20210106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072307452DNAL7 a10.7589/JWD-D-19-000102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Paulo C.10aSex and Age-Specific Hematology and Biochemistry Reference Intervals of Live Iberian Hares (Lepus granatensis) and Comparison with Postmortem Sampling  ap. 178-183.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHematology and serum biochemistry reference intervals were estimated for the Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis). Most parameters differed significantly between hunted and livetrapped Iberian hares. Significant differences were found for sex (red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, total protein, albumin, uric acid, triglycerides, cholesterol, chloride) and age classes (red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, glucose, calcium, and sodium). Sex- and age-specific reference intervals were estimated for these parameters. Red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, urea, and potassium show seasonal variations, with the lowest values in summer and the highest in winter. Creatinine, calcium, sodium, and phosphorus achieve their highest values in summer and stable baseline values throughout the rest of the year. These reference intervals can be used as baseline to monitor health, physiology, ecology, and nutrition of Iberian hare populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepus 3aalbumins 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3aerythrocyte count 3aglucose 3ahares 3ahematocrit 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3anutrition 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aprotein content 3asodium 3asummer 3aurea 3auric acid 3awildlife 3awinter 0aAge 0alagomorphs 0aleporids 0aphysical condition 0aseason 0aserum biochemistry 0asex1 aSantos, Nuno0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2021 Jan. 6, v. 57, no. 1 p.178-183dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/JWD-D-19-000103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001300159245010100172300001600273500000900289520165800298592002801956650001701984650001402001650001502015650002602030650001602056650002502072650001202097650001302109650001802122650002702140650003502167650002002202650002602222700001802248773014802266852000902414856009602423655001202519IND2045176620221118165652.0191125e199501  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204517662DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900010035x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeng, Y.10aRhizosphere Phosphorus Depletion Induced by Heavy Nitrogen Fertilization in Forest Nursery Soils  ap. 227-233.  aepub  aThe cause of N-induced P deficiency in white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] seedlings was investigated in a greenhouse pot trial testing factorial additions of ammonium nitrate (AN) and phosphoric acid (PA) to root zone and root-free compartmentalized soils. Plant growth was significantly improved by combined N and P topdressings during the growing season. However, N-only fertilization induced P deficiency symptoms and reduced biomass and P status in shoots, demonstrating an apparent N antagonism on P. Phosphorus availability in this treatment also was 35% lower in the rhizosphere soil than in the root-free bulk soil, reflecting rhizosphere P depletion. Soil acidity and Al activity were increased most by AN-only applications, probably contributing to reduced P availability. A diagnosis of induced Al toxicity by N fertilization based on plant analysis data was supported by symptoms of root injury. Phosphorus capture by ion-exchange resin bags at the base of the pots was lower than that of N with combined N-P applications, suggesting rapid fixation and low mobility of P in the soil compared with N. Nitrogen-induced rhizosphere P depletion in this nursery soil was attributed to restricted root development of seedlings due to Al toxicity, reduced P availability by Al-phosphate precipitation, and low P replenishment because of slow diffusion from the bulk soil. Topdressing with both PA and AN increased P availability in the rhizosphere (320 mg kg⁻¹), reduced soil extractable Al by 40% compared with AN-alone treatments, and increased plant uptake of N and P by 270%, resulting in positive N × P interactions on plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea glauca 3aseedlings 3aphosphorus 3anutrient availability 3arhizosphere 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil pH 3aaluminum 3aphytotoxicity 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient deficiencies1 aTimmer, V.

Patients reduced the number of physical clinic visits for regular follow-up care because of the pandemic. However, in developing countries, the scattered healthcare system hindered accessibility to clinical consultation, and poorly controlled chronic diseases resulted in numerous complications. Furthermore, the longer patients suffered from the chronic disease being treated, the more physical and psychological stress they experienced. “Diabetes Burnout,” as an example, is a term to describe the phenomenon of psychological reluctance in long-term glycemic control. A comprehensive, patient-centered, and automatic drug administration and delivery model may reduce patient stress and increase compliance. Potential next-generation medication platforms, consisting of internal regulation and external interaction, may conduct autonomous dose adjustment and continuous selfmonitoring with the assistance of artificial intelligence, telemedicine, and wireless technologies. Internal regulation forms a closed-loop system in which drug administration is optimized in an implanted drug-releasing device according to a patient's physiopathological response. The other feature, external interaction, creates an ecosystem among patients, healthcare providers, and pharmaceutical researchers to monitor and adjust post-market therapeutic efficacy and safety. These platforms may provide a solution for self-medication and self-care for a wide variety of patients but may be life-changing for patients who live in developing countries where the healthcare system is scattered, as they could effectively remove healthcare barriers. As the technology matures, these self-administrated platforms may become more available and increasingly affordable, offering considerable impact to health and wellness efforts worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3aartificial intelligence 3achronic diseases 3aclosed loop systems 3acompliance 3adiabetes 3adisease control 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aecosystems 3aglycemic control 3ahealth services 3amodels 3apandemic 3apatients 3apsychological stress 3atelemedicine1 aCheng, Chao-Min0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Feb., v. 342 p.26-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001600273520135300289592002801642650002201670650002401692650003801716650002101754650001601775650002201791650001901813650002201832650002101854650002401875650003201899650002101931700001601952700001801968773009101986856008102077852000902158655001202167IND60573985320221120150259.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057398532DNAL7 a10.1007/s12562-016-1036-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Hyun Ah10aIn vitro monoamine oxidase A and B inhibitory activity and molecular docking simulations of fucoxanthin  ap. 123-132.  aFucoxanthin is the primary carotenoid found in edible seaweeds, such as Eisenia bicyclis, Undaria pinnatifida, and others. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of fucoxanthin against Parkinson’s disease (PD) by inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B because MAO inhibitors are used in early management of PD. A sensitive enzyme-based chemiluminescent assay and kinetics methods were used to investigate the enzyme inhibitory activities and mode of inhibition. A molecular docking simulation was performed to clarify the binding characteristics of fucoxanthin to hMAO-A (2z5x) and hMAO-B (2v5z). Our results suggest that fucoxanthin shows significant inhibitory activity against hMAO-A and hMAO-B with IC₅₀ values of 197.41 ± 2.20 and 211.12 ± 1.17 μM, respectively. Selegiline was used as the positive control (IC₅₀: 10.54 ± 1.25 and 0.128 ± 0.01 μM for hMAO-A and hMAO-B, respectively). The enzyme-based kinetics results demonstrated that fucoxanthin inhibited both hMAOs in a reversible competitive manner. The molecular docking simulation predicted that fucoxanthin exhibits higher binding affinity towards hMAO-A and hMAO-B through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. These findings suggest that fucoxanthin is a reversible competitive hMAO inhibitor that could be used to manage PD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aUndaria pinnatifida 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3abinding capacity 3acarotenoids 3achemiluminescence 3aedible seaweed 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amolecular models1 aRoy, Anupom1 aChoi, Jae Sue0 tFisheries science.g2017 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.123-132dSpringer Japanx0919-92687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-016-1036-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015200157520170400309592002802013650002302041650001302064650001502077650001502092650002102107650000902128650001502137650002002152650002302172650002602195650001102221650002202232650002502254650001702279650001502296650002302311650002802334650001602362650001102378650002302389650002002412650002502432651001002457700001702467700001502484700001702499700001402516773011902530856007302649852000902722655001202731IND60653374320221119064515.0190714e20180709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337432DNAL7 a10.3390/w100709082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Shanshan13aAn Integrated Water-Saving and Quality-Guarantee Uncertain Programming Approach for the Optimal Irrigation Scheduling of Seed Maize in Arid Regions  aWith population growth and water scarcity, efficient crop production has drawn attention worldwide. In the Hexi Corridor, the largest production base of maize seed in China, it is desired to develop efficient irrigation strategies for seed maize. Considering the double criteria of yield and seed quality, an integrated water-saving and quality-guarantee uncertain programming approach (IWQUP) was developed in this study to help with agricultural sustainable development. The IWQUP combined deficit irrigation theory, soil-water balance, and multiple uncertainties. The water-flowering model (WFM) and kernel weight prediction model with water production functions were used to reflect the relationship among water consumption, crop yield, and seed quality. Meanwhile, to deal with the widespread existence of uncertainties in nature and the decision-making process, interval programming and fuzzy programming were integrated within the framework of IWQUP, along with the use of the genetic algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation. The results showed that when the climatic condition is moist, decision-makers may use a low tolerance level in order to reduce the water waste, enhance the water use efficiency, and guarantee a relatively high seed quality. When the climate is harsh, a high tolerance level to water use constraints is recommended in order to guarantee yield. In addition, optimistic decision-makers could choose a relatively high tolerance level, but in moist years they should be careful in order to avoid water waste. The established model was compared with three other models to represent its practicability for offering decision-makers various references under different scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aZea mays 3aalgorithms 3aarid zones 3aclimatic factors 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adecision making 3adeficit irrigation 3airrigation scheduling 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3aproduction functions 3aseed quality 3asoil water 3asoil water balance 3asustainable development 3auncertainty 3awastes 3awater conservation 3awater shortages 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aWang, Jintao1 aZhang, Fan1 aWang, Youzhi1 aGuo, Ping0 tWater.g2018 July 09, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100709083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002200167245010700189300001600296520177300312592002802085650001102113650002702124650002802151650001402179650002702193650002202220650000902242650002002251650003102271650001102302650001802313650001302331650002602344650001702370650001202387650004802399650004802447650002902495650000902524650001102533650005702544650000902601650003002610650003102640650006402671650003402735650003102769700002202800700001802822700002202840700002302862773012002885856008403005852000903089655001203098IND4470618820221116232811.0141111e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447061882DNAL7 a218898032pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantoro, Domenico10aExpression and distribution of canine antimicrobial peptides in the skin of healthy and atopic beagles  ap. 382-388.  aAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small immuno-modulatory proteins important in defense against pathogenic organisms. Defensins and cathelicidin are the most frequently studied human AMPs. An increase in AMPs in atopic humans has been reported recently. Our goals were to determine the distribution of AMPs and evaluate their mRNA and protein expression in non-lesional (Day 0), acute lesional skin (Day 3) and post-challenged skin after resolution of skin lesions (Day 10) using a canine model of atopic dermatitis (AD). All dogs were environmentally challenged for three consecutive days with house dust mite. Clinical evaluation of atopic beagles was performed using a CADESI score at each time point before and after environmental challenge. Skin biopsies were taken from six healthy and seven atopic beagles before and after allergen challenge (Day 0, Day 3 and Day 10). The transcription of canine cathelicidin (cCath) and beta-defensins (cBD)-1, -2 and -3 mRNA was quantified using quantitative-RT-PCR while the protein distribution of cBD2, cBD3 and cCath was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. A significant effect, over-time, was seen in CADESI score in AD beagles with an increase score after challenge (Day 3). Quantitative analysis showed a significant difference in mRNA transcript levels between groups (with atopic dogs having more than controls) for all AMPs but cBD2. No effect over time was evident for either group. No significant differences were seen for the AMP protein patterns of distribution (homogenous distribution). Although, these results showed no differences in AMP's localization after allergen exposure in each group; atopic dogs had a higher mRNA expression of AMPs when compared with healthy dogs, a similar finding to humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aGlycyphagus domesticus 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aallergens 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aatopic dermatitis 3adogs 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3aquantitative analysis 3askin lesions 2aAnimals 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxmetabolism 2aDermatitis, Atopicximmunologyxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesximmunology 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirectxveterinary 2aMale 2aPyroglyphidaeximmunology 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSkinximmunologyxmetabolism. 2abeta-Defensinsxmetabolism1 aMarsella, Rosanna1 aBunick, David1 aGraves, Thomas K.1 aCampbell, Karen L.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 144, no. 3-4 p.382-388dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245009600163300001400259520139600273592002801669650001801697650002801715650001001743650001701753650000901770650001701779650002201796650002201818650001401840650001401854650001301868653002501881653004001906653001901946700001801965700001801983700001402001700001802015700001502033700001702048700001802065700001802083773010902101856008602210852000902296655001202305IND60761098920221123014417.0220307e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076109892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, S.10aBiTE secretion from in situ-programmed myeloid cells results in tumor-retained pharmacology  ap. 14-25.  aBispecific T-Cell Engagers (BiTEs) are effective at inducing remission in hematologic cancers, but their use in solid tumors has been challenging due to their extreme potency and on-target, off-tumor toxicities in healthy tissue. Their deployment against solid tumors is further complicated by insufficient drug penetration, a hostile tumor microenvironment, and immune escape. To address these challenges, we developed targeted nanocarriers that can deliver in vitro-transcribed mRNA encoding BiTEs to host myeloid cells – a cell type that is actively recruited into the tumor microenvironment. We demonstrate in an immunocompetent mouse model of ovarian cancer, that infusion of these nanoparticles directs BiTE expression to tumor sites, which reshapes the microenvironment from suppressive to permissive and triggers disease regression without systemic toxicity. In contrast, conventional injections of recombinant BiTE protein at doses required to achieve anti-tumor activity, induced systemic inflammatory responses and severe tissue damage in all treated animals. Implemented in the clinic, this in situ gene therapy could enable physicians – with a single therapeutic – to safely target tumor antigen that would otherwise not be druggable due to the risks of on-target toxicity and, at the same time, reset the tumor milieu to boost key mediators of antitumor immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantineoplastic activity 3adrugs 3agene therapy 3amice 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasm antigens 3aovarian neoplasms 3aremission 3asecretion 3atoxicity 0aIn situ gene therapy 0aBi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) 0aNanotechnology1 aInamdar, V.V.1 aSigmund, E.C.1 aZhang, F.1 aStephan, S.B.1 aWatson, C.1 aWeaver, S.J.1 aNielsen, U.B.1 aStephan, M.T.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Feb., v. 342 p.14-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009000155520107000245592002801315650002501343650001801368650001401386650001001400650002301410650001401433650002101447650001801468651001001486700001901496700001401515700001701529700001801546700001501564773011901579856007301698852000901771655001201780IND60653374420221119064532.0190714e20180710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337442DNAL7 a10.3390/w100709092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Lingyan10aAssessing Aquatic Ecological Health for Lake Poyang, China: Part II Index Application  aAs one of the largest Yangtze river-connected lakes in China, Lake Poyang&rsquo;s heath status has increasingly become a cause for concern. This study evaluated Lake Poyang&rsquo;s heath status using a newly developed index (ecosystem health index for Lake Poyang, LP-EHI). The evaluation results revealed a declining tendency in the lake&rsquo;s health status from 2010 to 2014. The health conditions for Lake Poyang were &ldquo;good&rdquo;, &ldquo;fair&rdquo;, and &ldquo;fair&rdquo; in 2010, 2013, and 2014, respectively. The individual indices for water quality, nutrient conditions, and benthic macroinvertebrate showed a deteriorating trend from 2010 to 2014 mainly due to human activities, such as industrial pollution. Further analysis revealed that the health status of Lake Poyang was strongly affected by hydrological processes. This study demonstrated the potential of LP-EHI in evaluating the ecological health of Lake Poyang. Such a heath status evaluation can be applied to other lakes, and can benefit lake management, restoration, and conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental health 3ahealth status 3ahydrology 3alakes 3amacroinvertebrates 3apollution 3awater management 3awater quality 3aChina1 aHuang, Jiacong1 aHuang, Qi1 aGao, Junfeng1 aWang, Shigang1 aGuo, Yuyin0 tWater.g2018 July 10, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100709093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006700138245015400205500002000359520129600379592002801675596004701703650001601750650001101766650002201777650001101799650001201810650002201822650002601844650001801870700006201888773010701950856007302057852000902130655001202139IND60790664120221119182657.0220826e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079066412DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.3612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeslauriers, Stephen D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3861-476710aElectrophysiological study of Arabidopsis ABCB4 and PIN2 auxin transporters: Evidence of auxin activation and interaction enhancing auxin selectivity  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPolar auxin transport through plant tissue strictly requires polarly localized PIN proteins and uniformly distributed ABCB proteins. A functional synergy between the two types of membrane protein where their localizations overlap may create the degree of asymmetric auxin efflux required to produce polar auxin transport. We investigated this possibility by expressing ABCB4 and PIN2 in human embryonic kidney cells and measuring whole‐cell ionic currents with the patch‐clamp technique and CsCl‐based electrolytes. ABCB4 activity was 1.81‐fold more selective for Cl⁻ over Cs⁺ and for PIN2 the value was 2.95. We imposed auxin gradients and determined that ABCB4 and PIN2 were 12‐fold more permeable to the auxin anion (IAA⁻) than Cl⁻. This measure of the intrinsic selectivity of the transport pathway was 21‐fold when ABCB4 and PIN2 were co‐expressed. If this increase occurs in plants, it could explain why asymmetric PIN localization is not sufficient to create polar auxin flow. Some form of co‐action or synergy between ABCB4 and PIN2 that increases IAA⁻ selectivity at the cell face where both occur may be important. We also found that auxin stimulated ABCB4 activity, which may contribute to a self‐reinforcement of auxin transport known as canalization.  aPublisher supplied data  a1360751cNational Science Foundation (NSF) 3aArabidopsis 3aauxins 3aelectrophysiology 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amembrane proteins 3apatch-clamp technique 3aplant tissues1 aSpalding, Edgar P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6890-47650 tPlant direct.g2021 Nov., v. 5, no. 11 p.e361-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.3613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245011000210300001600320520123700336592002801573653002201601653001301623653002801636653003101664700001801695700002301713700001901736700002801755700001601783700001801799773010301817856008701920852000902007655001202016IND60594052020221118114555.0180510e20160820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059405202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianshe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4331-145310aPd on carbon nanotubes-supported Ag for formate oxidation: The effect of Ag on anti-poisoning performance  ap. 285-292.  aFor improving the utilization and anti-poisoning performance of Pd catalysts for formate oxidation, atomic layer deposition (ALD) method was used to deposit Pd on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and CNTs-supported Ag (Ag/CNTs). The structures of the as-prepared Pd/CNTs and Pd-on-Ag/CNTs catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Electrochemical characterization and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HADDF-STEM) confirmed the Pd-on-Ag structure. Pd utilization, activity, and anti-poisoning performance for Pd/CNTs and Pd-on-Ag/CNTs catalysts were compared, indicating that the overall performances of the Pd-on-Ag catalysts are superior to those of Pd on CNTs without Ag. Particularly, the mass specific chronoamperometric current (ICA) of the Pd-on-Ag/CNTs (171.8mAmgPd⁻¹) is two times greater compared to that of Pd/CNTs (70.0mAmgPd⁻¹). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to explain the improved anti-poisoning performance from the aspect of electronic Pd-Ag interaction. The results in this paper demonstrated the need for rationally engineered supports for improving the anti-poisoning performance of Pd-based anode catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFormate oxidation 0aPd-on-Ag 0aatomic layer deposition 0aanti-poisoning performance1 aLiu, Changhai1 aLushington, Andrew1 aCheng, Niancai1 aBanis, Mohammad Norouzi1 aRiese, Adam1 aSun, Xueliang0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.285-292dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245010800152520118600260592002801446650004101474650001201515650001901527650001901546650001301565650001601578650001601594650001501610700001401625700001701639700001801656700002001674773011901694856007301813852000901886655001201895IND60653374520221119064553.0190714e20180710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337452DNAL7 a10.3390/w100709102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Jun10aAddressing Climate Change Impacts on Streamflow in the Jinsha River Basin Based on CMIP5 Climate Models  aProjecting future changes of streamflow in the Jinsha River Basin (JRB) is important for the planning and management of the west route of South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP). This paper presented an analysis of the implications of CMIP5 climate models on the future streamflow in the JRB, using SWAT model. Results show that: (1) In the JRB, a 10% precipitation decrease might result in a streamflow increase of 15 to 18% and a 1 &deg;C increase in temperature might results in a 2 to 5% decrease in streamflow; (2) GFDL-ESM2M and NORESM1-M showed considerable skill in representing the observed precipitation and temperature, which can be chosen to analyze the changes in streamflow in the future; (3) The precipitation and temperature were projected to increase by 0.8 to 5.0% and 1.31 to 1.87 &deg;C. The streamflow was projected to decrease by 4.1 to 14.3% in the upper JRB. It was excepted to change by &minus;4.6 to 8.1% in the middle and lower JRB (MLJRB). The changes of low streamflow in the MLJRB were &minus;5.8 to 7.4%. Therefore, the potential impact of climate on streamflow will have little effect on the planning and management of the west route of SNWTP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aplanning 3astream flow 3atemperature 3awatersheds1 aYuan, Zhe1 aYan, Denghua1 aYang, Zhiyong1 aWang, Yongqiang0 tWater.g2018 July 10, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100709103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245017700165300001800342500002000360520120500380592002801585650001401613650001601627650001501643650002601658650002101684650002001705650001201725650001001737650001901747650001901766650001001785650001301795650000901808650001601817651001401833700002201847700002501869700002101894700002101915773012301936856007302059852000902132655001202141IND60587839220221120134504.0180102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058783922DNAL7 a10.1111/are.128272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇelik, Meryem Yeşim10aSettlement and growth of the mussels (Mytilusgalloprovincialis, Lamarck, 1819) on different collectors suspended from an offshore submerged longline system in the Black Sea  ap. 3765-3776.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA study of spat settlement of a submerged longline mussel culture system was carried out in Sinop area, Black Sea, between May 2008 and May 2009. The effects of six different types of collectors on spat settlement and growth were investigated. Six different types of spat settlement rope were used as polypropylene ropes with 18 mm diameter, 18 mm diameter timeworn silk rope, 22 mm diameter rope made from old hawser (OSR), 22 mm diameter ropes made from old anchovy net without pegs, 18 mm diameter old used nylon ropes and 18 mm diameter tasselled polypropylene ropes. Monthly temperature, salinity, chlorophyll‐a, total suspended matter, inorganic matter and organic matter were determined during the experimental period. The best settlement was observed on the OSR type when measured per metre (3450.00 ± 125.83 ind m⁻¹). Consequently, the findings showed that settlement preference of spat occurred according to rope structure, and if ropes are designed to combine numerous well‐fixed tassels, spat settlement can increase. Spat growth was affected by environmental factors and rope structure. In addition, the study revealed a negative relationship between density and growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanchovies 3achlorophyll 3acollectors 3aenvironmental factors 3ainorganic matter 3amollusc culture 3amussels 3anylon 3aorganic matter 3apolypropylenes 3aropes 3asalinity 3asilk 3atemperature 3aBlack Sea1 aKarayücel, Sedat1 aKarayücel, İsmihan1 aEyüboğlu, Bora1 aÖztürk, Recep,0 tAquaculture research.g2016 Dec., v. 47, no. 12 p.3765-3776dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.128273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001900157245010400176300001400280520148900294592002801783650002001811650001101831650001801842650001101860650003101871650001501902650001001917650001801927650002201945650002501967650002401992653002302016653003102039653002302070653002402093653002502117653001802142700002602160773011202186856009202298852000902390655001202399IND60536692120221119143912.0190412e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPosom, Jetsada10aEvaluation of the thermal properties of Jatropha curcas L. kernels using near-infrared spectroscopy  ap. 45-53.  aThe determination of the thermal properties, including thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat, of Jatropha curcas L. kernels was conducted using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. A total of 100 samples of whole kernels from green, yellow and black fruits and oven dried kernels were scanned using a Fourier transform NIR spectrometry over the range of 1,250,000–400,000 m−1. Models correlating the spectral data and the thermal properties measured by a reference method were developed by partial least squares regression and validated by test set validation. The results showed that for thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity at 40 °C and 100 °C and specific heat at 40 °C and 100 °C, the coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.5968, 0.7592, 0.7509, 0.4211 and 0.6396%, respectively; the root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) were 1.1 × 10−6 m2 s−1, 0.0169 W m−1 °C−1, 0.0685 W m−1 °C−1, 5.88 kJ kg−1 °C−1 and 15.8 kJ kg−1 °C−1; the biases were −2.52 × 10−7 m2 s−1, 2.85 × 10−3 W m−1 °C−1, 2.52 × 10−2 W m−1 °C−1, 1.83 kJ kg−1 °C−1 and 4.69 kJ kg−1 °C−1; and the ratios of prediction to deviation (RPD) were 1.57, 2.04, 1.98, 1.28 and 1.64, respectively. These show the possibility of using NIR spectroscopy as an alternative method to estimate the properties of Jatropha kernels, especially the thermal conductivity at 40 °C and 100 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3afruits 3aleast squares 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprediction 3aseeds 3aspecific heat 3aspectral analysis 3athermal conductivity 3athermal diffusivity 0aJatropha curcas L. 0aNear-infrared spectroscopy 0aThermal properties 0aThermal diffusivity 0aThermal conductivity 0aSpecific heat1 aSirisomboon, Panmanas0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Sept., v. 125 p.45-53dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012200161300001000283520108000293592002801373650002101401650001601422650001401438650001701452650002101469650000901490650001501499650000701514650001301521650001401534650001401548700001601562700001901578700001401597700001601611700002001627773014601647856008201793852000901875655001201884IND60573985820221120121126.0180619e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057398582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-017-0898-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yun10aInteractions between metal ions and the biopolymer in activated sludge: quantification and effects of system pH value  ap. 7.  aThe quantification and effects of system pH value on the interactions between Pb(II) and the biopolymer in activated sludge were investigated. The biopolymer had two protein-like fluorescence peaks (Ex/Em = 280 nm/326–338 nm for peak A; Ex/Em = 220–230 nm/324–338 nm for peak B). The fluorescence intensities of peak B were higher than those of peak A. The fluorophores of both peaks could be largely quenched by Pb(II), and the quencher dose for peak B was about half of that for peak A. The modified Stern-Volmer equation well depicted the fluorescence quenching titration. The quenching constant (Ka) values for both peaks decreased with rising system pH value, and then sharply decreased under alkaline conditions. It could be attributed to that the alkaline conditions caused the reduction of available Pb(II) due to the occurrence of Pb(OH)₂ sediments. The Ka values of peak B were bigger than those for peak A at the same system pH values. Accordingly, the aromatic proteins (peak B) played a key role in the interactions between metal ions and the biopolymer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abiopolymers 3aequations 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3alead 3ametal ions 3apH 3aproteins 3asediments 3atitration1 aXia, Siqing1 aNguyen, BinhT.1 aLong, Min1 aZhang, Jiao1 aZhang, Zhiqiang0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2017 Feb., v. 11, no. 1 p.7-7dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-017-0898-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100007000152245010100222520135200323592002801675650002301703650001801726650002201744650001901766650001101785650001301796650003001809650001601839653001801855653001601873653001901889653001101908653002501919700006601944700006002010700002702070700005802097700002302155700006102178700005802239773009802297856008702395852000902482655001202491IND60761099320221123014522.0220214e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076109932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1111622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerroud, Pierre-François,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7607-361810aPrime Editing in the model plant Physcomitrium patens and its potential in the tetraploid potato  aSince its discovery and first applications for genome editing in plants, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology has revolutionized plant research and precision crop breeding. Although the classical CRISPR-Cas9 system is a highly efficient tool for disruptive targeted mutagenesis, this system is mostly inefficient for the introduction of precise and predictable nucleotide substitutions. Recently, Prime Editing technology has been developed, allowing the simultaneous generation of nucleotide transitions and transversions but also short defined indels. In this study, we report on the successful use of Prime Editing in two plants of interest: the plant model Physcomitrium patens and the tetraploid and highly heterozygous potato (Solanum tuberosum). In both cases editing rates were lower than with other CRISPR-Cas9 based techniques, but we were able to successfully introduce nucleotide transversions into targeted genes, a unique feature of Prime Editing. Additionally, the analysis of potential off-target mutation sites in P. patens suggested very high targeting fidelity in this organism. The present work paves the way for the use Prime Editing in Physcomitrium patens and potato, however highlighting the limitations that need to be overcome for more efficient precision plant breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aPhyscomitrium 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aheterozygosity 3amodels 3apotatoes 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atetraploidy 0aPrime Editing 0aCRISPR-Cas9 0aGenome editing 0apegRNA 0aPhyscomitrium patens1 aGuyon-Debast, Anouchka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3489-10351 aVeillet, Florian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6892-68251 aKermarrec, Marie-Paule1 aChauvin, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5898-01341 aChauvin, Jean-Eric1 aGallois, Jean-Luc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0451-17401 aNogué, Fabien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0619-46380 tPlant science.g2022 Mar., v. 316 p.111162-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1111623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245014200159300001100301520125500312592002801567650003001595650002701625650001301652650000701665650001501672650001401687650002301701650001101724700001801735700001801753700001801771773014801789856008201937852000902019655001202028IND60573985920221120110907.0180619e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057398592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-017-0900-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Ran10aIsolation and application of predatory Bdellovibrio-and-like organisms for municipal waste sludge biolysis and dewaterability enhancement  ap. 10.  aBdellovibrio-and-like organisms (BALOs) are a group of ubiquitous and obligate predatory bacteria and commonly used as biocontrol agents. In this study, an efficient, environmental-friendly, and convenient BALOs encouraged municipal waste sludge biolysis pretreatment technique was developed and investigated for dewaterability enhancement of excess waste sludge. The indigenous predatory BALOs were successfully isolated from the sludge for biolysis treatment. Without any chemical addition or pH adjustment, the sludge specific resistance (SRF) and capillary suction time (CST) were significantly reduced by as high as 53.4% and 23.8%, respectively within 24 h’s treatment, which would further be lowered with the increase of BALOs input dosage. However, the continuous extension of reaction time would worsen the sludge dewaterability. The decreases of SRF and CST accompanied with the increases of sludge disintegration degree and soluble chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations all emphasized the contributions of BALOs’ predation activities to sludge disturbance, cell lysis, and consequently the release of sludge intracellular water to finally effectively improve the sludge dewaterability and disposal efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological control agents 3achemical oxygen demand 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apredation 3apredatory bacteria 3asludge1 aZhang, Shiwen1 aChen, Zhoukai1 aLi, Chuanyang0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2017 Feb., v. 11, no. 1 p.10-10dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-017-0900-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011500175300001600290520133300306592002801639650004401667650001501711650002501726650001101751650001901762650001801781650001401799650001101813650002601824650001301850650001101863650001701874650001701891650002201908650003301930650001601963650002101979653003602000653002602036653001902062653001702081653002602098700006002124700001802184700002702202700002002229773011202249856008502361852000902446655001202455IND60622859620221121170606.0181222e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062285962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.11.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Sandra C.10aPreparation of carbon molecular sieve membranes from an optimized ionic liquid-regenerated cellulose precursor  ap. 390-400.  aNovel carbon molecular sieve membranes with high separation performance and stability in the presence of humidified streams were prepared from an optimized ionic liquid-regenerated cellulose precursor, in a single carbonization step. Membranes prepared at two different carbonization end temperatures (550 °C and 600 °C) were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, carbon dioxide adsorption and permeation experiments. The prepared membranes exhibited uniform thickness of approximately 20 µm and a well-developed microporous structure. The permeation performance of these carbon molecular sieve membranes was above the Robeson upper bound curve for polymeric membranes. In particular, the membrane prepared at 550 °C end temperature exhibited permeability to oxygen of 5.16 barrer and O2/N2 ideal selectivity of 32.3 and permeability to helium of 126 barrer and He/N2 ideal selectivity of 788; besides, permeation experiments performed in the presence of ca. 80% relative humidity showed that humidity does not originate pore blockage. These results open the door for the preparation of tailor made precursors that originate carbon molecular sieve membranes with extraordinary separation performances, mechanical resistance and stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonization 3acellulose 3ahelium 3amechanical properties 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3aporous media 3arelative humidity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aCarbon molecular sieve membrane 0aWater vapor stability 0aGas separation 0aIonic liquid 0aRegenerated cellulose1 aAndrade, Marcia,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6654-81301 aMoffat, Jamie1 aMagalhães, Fernão D.1 aMendes, Adélio0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 572 p.390-400dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001700157245013800174300001300312520140400325592002801729650001801757650001701775650002601792650001701818650001301835650001101848650002901859650000901888650001801897650001501915650001901930650001501949650001401964653002501978653003302003653002502036653001602061700002002077700002702097700002202124773011102146856009202257852000902349655001202358IND60536692420221119143507.0190412e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoussef, Ali10aNon-contact, motion-tolerant measurements of chicken (Gallus gallus) embryo heart rate (HR) using video imaging and signal processing  ap. 9-16.  aThe chicken embryo provides an excellent model organism for physiological and developmental biology studies. The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is widely used to study angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in primary tumour growth. The cardiovascular system is the first organ system to form and function in the developing embryo. Heart rate (HR) is deemed to be an important physiological parameter in such studies. The heart rate of the developing embryo can be very informative in developmental studies of cardiac rhythm. Many studies have considered developing techniques to measure avian embryonic heart rate from incubated eggs. However, the existing techniques disturb the incubation process and/or are sensitive to embryonic motion. A novel non-contact, semi-invasive, and motion-tolerant technique to measuring embryonic heart rate from chicken eggs using video imaging and signal processing is described and implemented in this paper. The technique is based on videos captured from incubated eggs to recover heart rate signals. Heart rate is estimated using frequency analysis techniques and the values obtained are in agreement with results from the literature. The technique proposed in this paper provides a real-time approach to monitoring developmental embryonic heart rate. Also it can provide a promising technique for monitoring the developing vasculature in primary tumour growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallus gallus 3aangiogenesis 3acardiovascular system 3achicken eggs 3achickens 3achicks 3achorioallantoic membrane 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aheart rate 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 0aEmbryonic heart rate 0aDynamic activity index (DAI) 0aFrequency decoupling 0aVasculature1 aViazzi, Stefano1 aExadaktylos, Vasileios1 aBerckmans, Daniel0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Sept., v. 125 p.9-16dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002800158245011700186300001600303506002800319520186500347592002802212506003702240650001602277650002102293650001102314650001402325650002502339650001802364650001202382650001002394650001102404651001802415653001702433653002402450653001802474653002002492653002902512653001502541700003202556700002302588773018302611856009302794852000902887655001202896IND60785211220221207132543.0220621e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078521122DNAL7 a10.22363/2312-797X-2022-17-2-180-1922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrostenyuk, Nadezhda N.10aAssessment of introduction studies on far eastern Primula species in the polar-alpine botanical garden-institute  ap. 180-192.  aResource is Open Access  aSpecies of Primula genus are indispensable introducents for the Kola North, characterized by compact bushes, bright colors, tolerance to urban environments and predominantly early flowering. The Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden-Institute has been studying species of Primula genus since 1934. The results of introduction studies (from 1948 to present) of 6 Far Eastern species of Primula genus: P. borealis Duby, P. farinosa L., P. jesoana Miq., P. nutans Georgi, P. patens (Turcz.) E. Busch, P. saxatilis Kom. were analyzed in the article. The initial material was obtained by seed exchange with botanical gardens in Russia, the CIS and foreign countries. Phenological observations were carried out according to generally accepted methods, on the basis of which the phenological spectrum of seasonal development of plants were constructed, and survival points (SP) were assessed. The introduction coefficient (IC) was calculated, which reflected the introduction value of the considered group of plants. The method of ecological-geographical analysis was used to compile the introduction forecast. Among the studied species, Primula nutans (SP=11) obtained from the seeds of cultivated plants from Scandinavian countries and P. jesoana (SP=9) were most adapted to the conditions of the Kola Arctic. Two species (P. borealis, P. patens (SP = 4)) were poorly adapted to the conditions of the region, P. farinosa (SP = 1.0) and P. saxatilis (SP = 1.5) were not tested enough due to a short study period. The study showed that plants living from the tundra to the steppe zone (P. nutans - I C = 1.57) and, in some cases, plants of the taiga zone reaching the subalpine belt in the mountains (Primula jesoana - I C= 1.28) were adapted to local conditions. The plants of the tundra zone and the alpine zone in the mountains (P. borealis - IC = 0.57) were less adapted.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCola nitida 3aPrimula flaccida 3aRussia 3aphenology 3aseasonal development 3aseed exchange 3asteppes 3ataiga 3atundra 3aArctic region 0aintroduction 0afar eastern species 0aprimula genus 0asurvival points 0aintroduction coefficient 0akola north1 aSviatkovskaya, Ekaterina A.1 aSaltan, Natalia V.0 tVestnik Rossijskogo universiteta družby narodov.g2022 June, v. 17, no. 2 p.180-192dPeoples’ Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University)wJournal:27840x2312-79887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2312-797X-2022-17-2-180-1923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006200171300001600233520119900249592002801448650001401476650001801490650001401508650001501522653002401537653003501561653002101596653002501617653002701642653002101669700001701690773012801707856008501835852000901920655001201929IND60573716420221119032916.0170724e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371642DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2016.11661142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xianyang10aSimultaneous Inference for High-Dimensional Linear Models  ap. 757-768.  aThis article proposes a bootstrap-assisted procedure to conduct simultaneous inference for high-dimensional sparse linear models based on the recent desparsifying Lasso estimator. Our procedure allows the dimension of the parameter vector of interest to be exponentially larger than sample size, and it automatically accounts for the dependence within the desparsifying Lasso estimator. Moreover, our simultaneous testing method can be naturally coupled with the margin screening to enhance its power in sparse testing with a reduced computational cost, or with the step-down method to provide a strong control for the family-wise error rate. In theory, we prove that our simultaneous testing procedure asymptotically achieves the prespecified significance level, and enjoys certain optimality in terms of its power even when the model errors are non-Gaussian. Our general theory is also useful in studying the support recovery problem. To broaden the applicability, we further extend our main results to generalized linear models with convex loss functions. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated via simulation studies.

The results obtained, along with data gathered from a network of 68 plots, 48 trees felled for biomass estimations and 73 trees sampled for foliar area estimation were used to parameterize the 3-PG model for this species in Northern Spain. Most parameters associated with allometric relationships and partitioning (i.e. bark and branch fraction, basic density, age modifier and mortality) were derived from local data, and the remaining parameters were obtained from published studies on E. nitens or default values previously used for E. globulus. The parameterized model was validated with data from three trials measured from age 3years until age 8–14years, and performed better than the empirical model in terms of total stand under bark volume, mean diameter at breast height, basal area and foliar biomass. The process-based model was then used to forecast changes in plantations subjected to a clearwood regime, initializing the model at age 3years, considering 3 prunings, 2 thinnings and lengthening the rotation to 18years. This integrated regime was able to provide biomass for bioenergy, pulp or fibreboard wood and also solid wood, with thinning operations assisting the financial viability, and was a potentially good alternative for productive sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplantations 3apulpwood 3agrowth and development 3abioenergy 3aEucalyptus nitens 3astand basal area 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3apruning 3astatistical models 3abranches 3abiomass 3abark 3amortality 3aprediction 3aSpain 0abasal area1 aMuñoz-Sáez, Fernando1 aBasurco, Fernando1 aRiesco, Guillermo1 aRodríguez-Soalleiro, Roque0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 262, no. 6 p.1067-1077dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.05.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245009300165300001400258520176300272592002802035650002202063650001202085650001302097650001602110650002102126650002202147650001902169650001502188650001502203650003002218650001202248650001302260650001302273650001502286650002602301650001502327650001002342650001002352651001302362700001402375700001902389700001702408700002002425773010402445856008202549852000902631655001202640IND4471498420221121020832.0150812e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447149842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2011.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyswerda, S.P.10aLong-term nitrate loss along an agricultural intensity gradient in the Upper Midwest USA  ap. 10-19.  aNitrate (NOâ â») loss from intensively farmed cropland is a long-standing, recalcitrant environmental problem that contributes to surface and groundwater pollution and coastal zone hypoxia. Here nitrate leaching losses are reported from nine replicated cropped and unmanaged ecosystems in southwest Michigan, USA. Ecosystems include four annual cornâsoybeanâwinter wheat rotations under conventional, no-till, reduced-input, and organic/biologically-based management, two perennial cropping systems that include alfalfa and hybrid poplar trees, and three unmanaged successional communities including an early successional community analogous to a cellulosic biofuel system as well as a mature deciduous forest. The organic, alfalfa, and unmanaged systems received no synthetic, manure, or compost nitrogen. Measured nitrate concentrations were combined with modeled soil water drainage to provide estimates of nitrate lost by leaching over 11 years. Among annual crops, average nitrate losses differed significantly (p<0.05) and followed the order conventional (62.3Â±9.5kgNhaâ»Â¹yrâ»Â¹)>no-till (41.3Â±3.0)>reduced-input (24.3Â±0.7)>organic (19.0Â±0.8) management.

Findings suggest that nitrate loss in annual row crops could be significantly mitigated by the adoption of no-till, cover crops, and greater reliance on biologically based inputs, and in biofuel systems by the production of cellulosic rather than grain-based feedstocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aalfalfa 3acomposts 3acover crops 3acropping systems 3adeciduous forests 3adrainage water 3aecosystems 3afeedstocks 3agroundwater contamination 3ahypoxia 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3aproduction technology 3asoil water 3atrees 3awheat 3aMichigan1 aBasso, B.1 aHamilton, S.K.1 aTausig, J.B.1 aRobertson, G.P.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 149 p.10-19dElsevier B.V.x0167-88097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001800157245010700175300001400282520141500296592002801711650001501739650002801754650001201782650001001794650002001804650001101824650001301835650001601848650001101864650000901875650002501884650001501909653002801924653002201952653003201974653002802006700001602034700001302050700001802063700001202081700001802093700001402111773011202125856009202237852000902329655001202338IND60536692520221119143457.0190412e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Xiaodong10aVegetation segmentation robust to illumination variations based on clustering and morphology modelling  ap. 80-97.  aVegetation segmentation from images is an essential issue in the application of computer vision in agriculture. In this paper, we present a new vegetation segmentation method based on Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) clustering and morphology modelling in CIE L∗a∗b∗ colour space. At the off-line learning stage, a new method is put forward to determine the clustering number. Secondly, the tools of morphological dilation and erosion are employed to establish the vegetation colour model. At the online segmentation stage, the PSO-based k-means is used to cluster the vegetation image into vegetation classes and non-vegetation classes. Afterwards, the established colour model is used to distinguish the vegetation classes and give the segmentation result. In the experiments, the proposed method was applied to segment 200 smaller regions of the full camera images of rice and 100 smaller regions of the full camera images of cotton. The means of segmentation qualities reached 88.1% and 91.7% respectively. Moreover, the proposed method was compared with three well-known vegetation segmentation methods and two skin segmentation methods. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yielded the highest mean of segmentation qualities and lowest standard deviations of segmentation qualities. In addition, the vegetation colour models built with different structuring element types are analysed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acameras 3acolor 3acomputer vision 3acotton 3alighting 3amethodology 3amodels 3arice 3astatistical analysis 3avegetation 0aVegetation segmentation 0aClustering number 0aParticle Swarm Optimization 0aMathematical morphology1 aCao, Zhiguo1 aWang, Yu1 aYu, Zhenghong1 aHu, Zhu1 aZhang, Xuefen1 aLi, Cuina0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Sept., v. 125 p.80-97dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014400169520138500313592002801698650001601726650001101742650001501753650001801768650001601786650001401802650001401816650001001830650001501840650001101855650001601866650001701882650001101899653001701910653002501927653002101952653002201973700001701995700001102012700001702023700001702040700001802057700001802075700002002093700001802113700001502131773009802146856008702244852000902331655001202340IND60761099520221123014411.0220214e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076109952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1111642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiao-Mei10aMolecular cloning of cryptochrome 1 from Lilium×formolongi and the characterization of its photoperiodic flowering function in Arabidopsis  aLilium × formolongi is an important cut flower species that is able to flower within a year following seed propagation, with flower induction that is very sensitive to the photoperiod. Cryptochromes are blue/UV-A light receptors that regulate many important plant growth and development processes, including photoperiodic flowering. In this study, we isolated the cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) gene from L. × formolongi and analyzed its function in transgenic Arabidopsis. The predicted LfCRY1 protein was strongly homologous to other CRY1 proteins. The transcription of LfCRY1 was induced by blue light, with LfCRY1 exhibiting its highest expression and diurnal expression patterns during the flowering-induction stage under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) photoperiods. Overexpression of LfCRY1 in Arabidopsis promoted flowering under LDs but not SDs and inhibited hypocotyl elongation under blue light. The LfCRY1 protein was located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. LfCRY1 interacted with the important flowering activator LfCOL9 in both yeast and onion cells. These results provide functional evidence for the role of LfCRY1 in controlling photoperiodic flowering under LDs and indicate that LfCRY1 may be a counterpart of AtCRY1. Understanding the role of LfCRY1 in photoperiodic flowering is beneficial for the molecular breeding of lilies with shorter vegetative stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aLilium 3ablue light 3acryptochromes 3acut flowers 3acytoplasm 3aflowering 3agenes 3ahypocotyls 3aonions 3aphotoperiod 3aplant growth 3ayeasts 0aCryptochrome 0aLilium × formolongi 0aFlower induction 0aFunction analysis1 aWei, Xiao-Ru1 aLi, Ze1 aJia, Gui-Xia1 aChen, Ji-Ren1 aChen, Hai-Xia1 aCao, Fu-Xiang1 aZheng, Si-Xiang1 aLi, Jian-Hong1 aLi, Yu-Fan0 tPlant science.g2022 Mar., v. 316 p.111164-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1111643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245009000171300001600261506002800277520160900305592002801914506003701942650001901979650002101998650001402019650001002033650001602043650001602059650002902075650002302104650002402127650001002151650001802161651000902179700001902188700001902207700003302226773013502259856007702394852000902471655001202480IND60785211320221207132557.0101211e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078521132DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha38349772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGHASSEMI-GOLEZANI, Kazem10aSeed Vigor and Field Performance of Winter Oilseed Rape (Brassica napus L.) Cultivars  ap. 146-150.  aResource is Open Access  a<div>The effect of seed vigor on field performance of two oilseed rape cultivars (Licord and Okapi) was investigated in 2008 at the Research Farm of the University Tabriz, Iran. The experiment was arranged as factorial based on RCB design with three replications. A sub-sample of seeds of each cultivar was kept as control. The other two sub-samples of each cultivar with about 15% moisture content were artificially deteriorated at 40C for 9 and 12 days (Licord) and 7 and 10 days (Okapi). Consequently, three seed lots for each cultivar with different levels of vigor were provided. The results showed that the mean emergence time increased with decreasing seed vigor. However, the highest percentage of seedling emergence was obtained for the high quality seed lot and decreased with decreasing seed lot vigor. Decreasing seed vigor led to significant reduction in ground cover of both cultivars; mainly due to poor stand establishment. Ground cover of Licord was higher than that of Okapi. Plants from high vigor seed lots of both cultivars had higher leaf chlorophyll content index at early stages of growth, compared with those from low quality seed lots. Grains per plant, 1000 grain weight and grain yield per plant for plants from deteriorated seed lots were higher than those from high-vigor seed lot. However, these advantages in individual plant performance were not sufficient to compensate for low stand establishment. Consequently, grain yield per unit area significantly improved with increasing seed vigor of oilseed rape cultivars, even within the range of acceptable germination.</div>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica napus 3aOkapia johnstoni 3acultivars 3afarms 3agermination 3agrain yield 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3aseedling emergence 3astand establishment 3avigor 3awater content 3aIran1 aBAKHSHY, Javad1 aRAEY, Yaeghoob1 aHOSSAINZADEH-MAHOOTCHY, Ayda0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2010 Dec., v. 38, no. 3 p.146-150dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha38349773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245011100204300001600315500001500331520117600346592002801522650002501550650001701575650001901592650002501611650001301636650001901649650002201668650001601690650001401706650001701720653002601737653002301763653002501786653003601811653002601847653002001873700001401893700001401907700001101921700001401932700001501946773011201961856008502073852000902158655001202167IND60622859820221121170656.0181222e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062285982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Lihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0874-399810aAliphatic/aromatic sulfonated polyimide membranes with cross-linked structures for vanadium flow batteries  ap. 119-127.  a2019-12-06  aThe cross-linked sulfonated polyimide (CSPI-DMDA) membranes with microphase-separated structure are designed and prepared for vanadium flow battery (VFB) application. In main chains of CSPI-DMDA membranes, hydrophobic segment with aliphatic groups as well as hydrophilic segment with aromatic groups promote the formation of microphase-separated structures and thus enhance the ability of proton transfer. Meanwhile, the cross-linked structure in CSPI-DMDA membrane is beneficial to improve the mechanical strength and chemical stability, and decrease the vanadium-ion permeability. The optimized CSPI-DMDA membrane exhibits higher columbic efficiency (CE: 99.2%), voltage efficiency (VE: 76.0%) and energy efficiency (EE: 75.3%) than those of N115 membrane (CE: 96.9%, VE: 73.3%, EE: 71.1%) at a high current density of 200 mA cm−2. There is no obvious decay in the cycling of the VFB with the CSPI-DMDA (1:1) membrane over 1000 charge-discharge test under 160 mA cm−2. The VFB also remains stable on a broad temperature (−20 to 60 °C). The above results indicate CSPI-DMDA membrane a potential alternative for separator in all-climate VFB applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acrosslinking 3ahydrophilicity 3astrength (mechanics) 3avanadium 3ahydrophobicity 3aenergy efficiency 3atemperature 3abatteries 3apermeability 0aVanadium flow battery 0aelectric potential 0aSulfonated polyimide 0aMicrophase-separated structures 0aCross-linked membrane 0aAliphatic group1 aWang, Lie1 aYu, Liwei1 aMu, Di1 aWang, Lei1 aXi, Jingyu0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 572 p.119-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001900157245013500176300001400311520152400325592002801849650001701877650001301894650001701907650001801924650001301942650001201955650001001967650002201977650002601999650001702025650001002042650002702052653001702079653002602096653002402122653002902146653002202175700005202197700005402249700001802303773011202321856009202433852000902525655001202534IND60536692620221119143554.0190412e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jianfeng10aEffect of excitation position of a handheld shaker on fruit removal efficiency and damage in mechanical harvesting of sweet cherry  ap. 36-44.  aAs labour cost keeps rising and labour availability remains increasingly uncertain, growers are seeking mechanical harvesting solutions for fresh-market tree fruit production. To fulfil this need, this research aimed at assessing the effect of excitation position on fruit removal efficiency and fruit damage using a hand-held limb shaker for harvesting sweet cherry. In this study, four excitation positions were selected on each randomly selected limb of “Y” trellis cherry trees. The total number of fruit being removed from five fruiting zones of each limb and those remaining on the tree after harvesting was counted, and harvest-induced damage was assessed. Results showed that fruit removal efficiency from each zone was highly affected by the distance of the zone to the excitation position. The overall fruit removal efficiency was 84% when shaken at the lowest excitation position, and 77%, 51% and 72% respectively as the excitation position moved up the limbs. The fruit damage rates from low to high excitation positions were 20%, 28%, 20% and 23%, which was approximately 10% higher than that of handpicked fruit. No significant difference was found in the fruit damage rate when comparing different excitation positions. It was observed that the fruit removal efficiency may reach up to 97% when the limbs were excited at both the lowest and the highest excitation positions, and adopting such an excitation method could lead to a high fruit removal efficiency with not much increase in fruit damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus avium 3acherries 3afresh market 3afruit growing 3afruiting 3agrowers 3alabor 3amechanical damage 3amechanical harvesting 3aplant damage 3atrees 3awages and remuneration 0aSweet cherry 0aMechanical harvesting 0aExcitation position 0aFruit removal efficiency 0aFruit damage rate1 aHe, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1247-83891 aZhang, Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6121-65131 aKarkee, Manoj0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Sept., v. 125 p.36-44dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010900166300001100275520191900286592002802205650001402233650001402247650002002261650001602281650001102297650000902308650001302317651001602330700002302346773009902369856008102468852000902549655001202558IND60573986120221122050051.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057398612DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-016-3056-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuss, Garry R.10aRapid decline and decadal-scale recovery of corals and Chaetodon butterflyfish on Philippine coral reefs  ap. 29.  aEnvironmental disturbances to benthic habitat on coral reefs can affect fish assemblages, with dietary specialists like corallivorous Chaetodon butterflyfishes particularly sensitive to declines in hard coral cover. However, declines in density of corallivorous Chaetodon due to declines in hard coral cover are usually documented for individual environmental disturbances, often with limited quantification of post-disturbance recovery. Here, we documented effects of hard coral loss and recovery on the Chaetodon assemblage for 31 years at four sites in the Philippines. In this long-term “natural experiment”, we documented five environmental disturbance events (two typhoons, two mass coral bleaching events, and one period of destructive fishing) that reduced live branching hard coral cover on average by 61% and density of corallivorous butterflyfish by 47%, with an average duration of decline of 2 years. On average, these disturbance events resulted in an 8% annual decrease in absolute coral cover. We also monitored five periods of hard coral and butterflyfish recovery, with an average 202% increase in branching hard coral cover over 11 years, and a 196% increase in density of corallivorous butterflyfish over 12 years. On average, these recovery periods had a 2.4% annual rate of increase in absolute coral cover. The density of butterflyfish was not significantly affected by marine reserve protection, and thus, changes in butterflyfish density were most likely driven by change in benthic habitat. Assemblage structure of Chaetodon at each site was distinct and remained remarkably consistent for 31 years, despite substantial declines and recovery of coral cover. The difference in the rates of decline and recovery of butterflyfish raises concerns for the persistence of this iconic taxon in the face of increasing frequency and intensity of environmental disturbances to coral reefs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetodon 3abranching 3acoral bleaching 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3afish 3atyphoons 3aPhilippines1 aLeahy, Susannah M.0 tMarine biology.g2017 Jan., v. 164, no. 1 p.29-29dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-016-3056-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03885naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245010300205300001200308506007600320520206100396592002802457506003702485650002802522650002502550650001502575650003602590650003002626650001402656650001702670650001702687650002102704650004302725650001102768650002202779650001802801650001702819650002202836650002302858650002702881650001402908650002702922650001702949650002102966650002602987700001703013700001703030700002103047700001703068773013103085856008203216852000903298655001203307IND60623923620221207102803.0191108e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062392362DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-018-2361-z2doi7 aPMC62630642pmcid7 a304868792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYim, Nam-Hui10aEnhancement of neuroprotective activity of Sagunja-tang by fermentation with lactobacillus strains  ap. 312.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Sagunja-tang (SGT) is widely used in traditional herbal medicine to treat immune system and gastrointestinal disorders and reportedly has protective effects against inflammation, cancer, and osteoporosis. In this study, we fermented SGT with different Latobacillus strains and investigated the change in phytochemical compositions in SGT and enhancement of it neuroprotective effects in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma. METHODS: Marker components, including ginsenoside Rg₁, glycyrrhizin, liquiritin, liquiritigenin, atractylenolide I, atractylenolide II, atractylenolide III, and pachymic acid, in SGT, were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography–diode array detection and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. SGT was fermented with eight different Lactobacillus strains to yield eight fermented SGTs (FSGTs). The conversion efficiencies of SGT marker components were determined in each FSGT. To detect the protective effect of SGT and FSGT, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay and mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMPs) assay were performed in SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: Compared with the other FSGTs, SGT166, i.e., SGT fermented with L. plantarum 166, had high conversion efficiency, as indicated by increased amounts of glycyrrhizin, liquiritigenin, and atractylenolides I–III. In SH-SY5Y cells, protection against cell death induced by H₂O₂ and etoposide was high using SGT166 and very low using SGT. Furthermore, ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption in SH-SY5Y cells were markedly suppressed by SGT166 treatment, which demonstrated that inhibition of ROS generation may be one of the neuroprotective mechanisms of SGT166. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that fermentation of SGT with L. plantarum 166 enhanced suppression of oxidative stress and MMP loss. This enhanced neuroprotective effect was thought to be caused by the conversion of SGT phytochemicals by fermentation. SGT166 shows potential for treating neurological damage-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aalternative medicine 3acell death 3achemical constituents of plants 3adigestive system diseases 3aetoposide 3afermentation 3aglycyrrhizin 3aherbal medicines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasms 3aneuroprotective effect 3aosteoporosis 3aoxidative stress 3aquantitative analysis1 aGu, Min Jung1 aPark, Hee Ra1 aHwang, Youn-Hwan1 aMa, Jin Yeul0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.312-312dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2361-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245011500167300001600282500001900298520170700317592002802024650001902052650000802071650001102079650001802090650001902108650002102127650001102148650000902159650001902168650001802187650000902205650002002214650001202234700002002246773011202266856008502378852000902463655001202472IND6036563920221116193121.0141111e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603656392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOta, Masakazu10aDevelopment and validation of a dynamical atmosphere–vegetation–soil HTO transport and OBT formation model  ap. 813-823.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA numerical model simulating transport of tritiated water (HTO) in atmosphere-soil-vegetation system, and, accumulation of organically bound tritium (OBT) in vegetative leaves was developed. Characteristic of the model is, for calculating tritium transport, it incorporates a dynamical atmosphere-soil-vegetation model (SOLVEG-II) that calculates transport of heat and water, and, exchange of CO₂. The processes included for calculating tissue free water tritium (TFWT) in leaves are HTO exchange between canopy air and leaf cellular water, root uptake of aqueous HTO in soil, photosynthetic assimilation of TFWT into OBT, and, TFWT formation from OBT through respiration. Tritium fluxes at the last two processes are input to a carbohydrate compartment model in leaves that calculates OBT translocation from leaves and allocation in them, by using photosynthesis and respiration rate in leaves. The developed model was then validated through a simulation of an existing experiment of acute exposure of grape plants to atmospheric HTO. Calculated TFWT concentration in leaves increased soon after the start of HTO exposure, reaching to equilibrium with the atmospheric HTO within a few hours, and then rapidly decreased after the end of the exposure. Calculated non-exchangeable OBT amount in leaves linearly increased during the exposure, and after the exposure, rapidly decreased in daytime, and, moderately nighttime. These variations in the calculated TFWT concentrations and OBT amounts, each mainly controlled by HTO exchange between canopy air and leaf cellular water and by carbohydrates translocation from leaves, fairly agreed with the observations within average errors of a factor of two.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute exposure 3aair 3acanopy 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon dioxide 3acell respiration 3agrapes 3aheat 3aphotosynthesis 3aradioactivity 3asoil 3atritiated water 3atritium1 aNagai, Haruyasu0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2011 Sept., v. 102, no. 9 p.813-823dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002900185245010900214300001300323520126100336592002801597650001501625650002501640650002001665650001301685650001301698650001001711650001401721650001801735650002101753650002001774650000901794650001901803650001901822650001401841650001801855650000901873650002801882773012501910856008102035990002302116852000902139655001202148IND60085546120221117170024.0141101e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008554612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cis.2012.03.0022doi7 a10.1016/j.cis.2012.03.0022chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClements, David Julian10aCrystals and crystallization in oil-in-water emulsions: Implications for emulsion-based delivery systems  ap. 1-30.  aMany bioactive components intended for oral ingestion (pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals) are hydrophobic molecules with low water-solubilities and high melting points, which poses considerable challenges to the formulation of oral delivery systems. Oil-in-water emulsions are often suitable vehicles for the encapsulation and delivery of this type of bioactive component. The bioactive component is usually dissolved in a carrier lipid phase by either dilution and/or heating prior to homogenization, and then the carrier lipid and water phases are homogenized to form an emulsion consisting of small oil droplets dispersed in water. The successful development of this kind of emulsion-based delivery system depends on a good understanding of the influence of crystals on the formation, stability, and properties of emulsions. This review article addresses the physicochemical phenomena associated with the encapsulation, retention, crystallization, release, and absorption of hydrophobic bioactive components within emulsions. This knowledge will be useful for the rational formulation of effective emulsion-based delivery systems for oral delivery of crystalline hydrophobic bioactive components in the food, health care, and pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abioactive properties 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adroplets 3adrugs 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3afunctional foods 3ahealth services 3aheat 3ahomogenization 3ahydrophobicity 3aingestion 3amelting point 3aoils 3apharmaceutical industry0 tAdvances in colloid and interface science.g2012 June 15, v. 174 p.1-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl2874x0001-86867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cis.2012.03.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245015100175300001800326520130900344592002801653650001701681650001801698650001101716650002901727650002201756650001201778650000901790650001701799650001601816650003701832650001501869650002301884650001201907650004001919653001201959653001701971653003101988653002502019653001602044700001902060700002102079700001602100700002002116700001702136700001802153700001902171700001902190700002502209700001802234700001902252773010202271856009002373852000902463655001202472IND60603454020221118115036.0180716e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060345402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Thai-Yen10aDifferentiation of lung stem/progenitor cells into alveolar pneumocytes and induction of angiogenesis within a 3D gelatin – Microbubble scaffold  ap. 5660-5669.  aThe inability to adequately vascularize tissues in vitro or in vivo is a major challenge in lung tissue engineering. A method that integrates stem cell research with 3D-scaffold engineering may provide a solution. We have successfully isolated mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by a two-step procedure and fabricated mPSC-compatible gelatin/microbubble-scaffolds using a 2-channel fluid jacket microfluidic device. We then integrated the cells and the scaffold to construct alveoli-like structures. The mPSCs expressed pro-angiogenic factors (e.g., b-FGF and VEGF) and induced angiogenesis in vitro in an endothelial cell tube formation assay. In addition, the mPSCs were able to proliferate along the inside of the scaffolds and differentiate into type-II and type-I pneumocytes The mPSC-seeded microbubble-scaffolds showed the potential for blood vessel formation in both a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and in experiments for subcutaneous implantation in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Our results demonstrate that lung stem/progenitor cells together with gelatin microbubble-scaffolds promote angiogenesis as well as the differentiation of alveolar pneumocytes, resulting in an alveoli-like structure. These findings may help advance lung tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3ablood vessels 3achicks 3achorioallantoic membrane 3aendothelial cells 3agelatin 3amice 3amicrobubbles 3apneumocytes 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3atissues 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aAlveoli 0aAngiogenesis 0aLung stem/progenitor cells 0aMicrobubble-scaffold 0aPneumocytes1 aLiu, Yanliang,1 aHuang, Yung-Kang1 aGu, Sing-Yi1 aChen, Hung-Kuan1 aHo, Choa-Chi1 aTsao, Po-Nien1 aTung, Yi-Chung1 aChen, Huei-Wen1 aCheng, Chiung-Hsiang1 aLin, Keng-Hui1 aLin, Feng-Huei0 tBiomaterials.g2014 July, v. 35, no. 22 p.5660-5669dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009200167300001600259520122500275592002801500650001001528650001401538650001401552650001701566650002001583650000901603650002401612650002201636650001401658650002101672650002001693650001701713650002601730650001901756650003201775650002701807650001201834650002101846650002401867650002201891650001201913650001701925653001401942653001601956653002001972653003001992653001102022700001802033700002702051700003202078700003102110773011802141856008302259852000902342655001202351IND60611205020221120090030.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061120502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2018.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMármol, Inés12aA systematic review of the potential uses of pine bark in food industry and health care  ap. 558-566.  aA great number of plants have been studied in recent times in order to identify and isolate new components with nutraceutical properties.

Our earlier work has demonstrated the efficacy of a biodegradable macro-porous polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate (PCL-TCP) composite scaffold in promoting bony tissue ingrowth as well as its ability to sustain mechanical loads upon implantation into an orthotopic defect site. In this study, we investigated the use of PCL-TCP scaffold as an autograft-free spinal fusion cage in a preclinical sheep model over 12 months, and compared the fusion efficacy against Ti cages incorporated with autografts. Results showed that despite PCL-TCP scaffold as an autograft-free cage attaining a slower fusion rate at early stage (6 month), it achieved similar degree of spinal fusion efficacy as Ti cages aided with autograft at 12 month post-operation as evidenced by the radiographic and histological evaluation. PCL-TCP cages alone demonstrated better bone ingrowth with 2.6 fold higher bone/interspace ratio (B/I) and more homogeneous bone tissue distribution compared with that of the Ti cages (88.10 ± 3.63% vs. 33.74 ± 2.78%, p < 0.05) as seen from the histological and micro-CT analysis. Moreover, besides the bone tissue ingrowth, a quantitative approach was illustrated to accurately evaluate the osteointegration of fusion cage with surrounding bone tissue, and showed a 1.36 fold higher degree of osteointegration occurred in PCL-TCP cage group than Ti cage group (CS/PC: 79.31 ± 3.15% vs 58.44 ± 2.43%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, biomechanical analysis showed comparable mechanical strength of fused segments in both groups in terms of the range of motion and stiffness at 12 month (p > 0.05). The degradation profile of the PCL-TCP cages was noted to increase in tandem with new bone ingrowth into the pores, while maintaining good structural integrity necessary for supporting the spinal interbody segments. Therefore, with the better osteointegration, more bone tissue ingrowth as well as its favorable biodegradable and radiolucent properties, PCL-TCP cage has been demonstrated to be a promising candidate as an autograft-free fusion cage for clinical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aautografting 3abiodegradability 3abiomechanics 3abones 3ahistology 3amechanical loads 3amicro-computed tomography 3aphosphates 3aradiography 3astrength (mechanics) 3atissue distribution 3atitanium 0aPolycaprolactone 0aTricalcium phosphate 0aBiodegradable 0aTi6Al4V 0aFusion cage1 aWu, Zhi-gang1 aLi, Xiao-kang1 aGuo, Zheng1 aWu, Su-hua1 aZhang, Yong-quan1 aShi, Lei1 aTeoh, Swee Hin,1 aLiu, Yu-chun1 aZhang, Zhi-yong0 tBiomaterials.g2014 July, v. 35, no. 22 p.5647-5659dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008900167500001900256520244700275592002802722650001702750650001202767650002302779650001102802650001002813650002002823650001102843650001402854650002102868650001902889650001302908650001702921650000902938650002002947653002602967653001602993653001903009653001203028700005703040700001803097700001703115773011203132856008403244852000903328655001203337IND60710906820221120080457.0210121e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071090682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e012622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Weiwei14aThe growth and mortality of Pleioblastus pygmaeus under different light availability  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPleioblastus pygmaeus (Miq.) Nakai, as a dwarf bamboo, providing a high ornamental value in landscaping. Furthermore its well-developed and intricate root system lends its use for soil consolidation and slope protection. A pot experiment was performed to study the impact of different light intensity on the growth characteristics of P. pygmaeus seedlings. The light intensity was controlled by punching circular holes with different diameters in center of the plates cover the pots. The illuminance percentages of the pore diameter area to the inner diameter area of the pot in each treatment were 1.29% (A), 5.16% (B), 11.62% (C), 20.66% (D), 32.28% (E), and 100% (F). The average illumination intensity under treatment A, B, C, D and E is 3.87%, 11.25%, 20.25%, 38.76% and 60.70% of control F (100% of full sunlight), respectively. The results showed that the light intensity is a key factor influencing P. pygmaeus seedlings’ growth and mortality. Seedlings died when light is lower than 38.76%. As light intensity decreased, the mortality increased and the number of culms and total rhizomes, leaf-, aboveground- and underground-biomass significantly decreased, and the gap between the treatments and control significantly increased over the nine month growing period. The generalized additive model (GAM) explained the influence of illuminance and investigation time and indicated a lower determination coefficient on culm height, culm diameter, total rhizome length and total rhizome diameter compared with number of culms, number of total rhizomes and biomass. The diameter of culms showed a decreasing trend during the experiment while their lengths increased even under A treatment (3.87% of full sunlight), suggesting that nonstructural carbohydrates stored prior to the experiment was used for culm height growth under light/carbon limitation. In the case of the leaves, their growth was significantly inhibited under low light intensity (3.87–60.70% of full sunlight) as they are the primary component of the plant’s photosynthetic apparatus. As suppressed leaves could not independently provide enough carbon to the plant, P. pygmaeus seedlings adjust their plasticity to slow down rhizome growth, shoot emergence and biomass accumulation, eventually resulting in “Carbon starvation” and increased mortality. This study provides insights into how dwarf bamboos balance growth and survival under low light availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleioblastus 3abamboos 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3aculms 3alight intensity 3amodels 3amortality 3aornamental value 3aphotosynthesis 3arhizomes 3aroot systems 3asoil 3asolar radiation 0aPleioblastus pygmaeus 0aCulm growth 0aRhizome growth 0aBiomass1 aOlson, Edward1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3184-10831 aWang, Shucong1 aShi, Peijian0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2020 Dec., v. 24 p.e01262-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e012623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007600162300001300238520112400251592002801375650002201403650001801425650001901443650001901462650001501481650002201496650002001518650001601538700001701554700001701571700001701588700002001605773010801625856008101733990002301814852000901837655001201846IND60085546320221120023609.0141101e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008554632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cis.2012.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRioboo, R.10aSuperhydrophobicity and liquid repellency of solutions on polypropylene  ap. 1-10.  aThe sliding of drops of aqueous solutions of organic liquids over a superhydrophobic polypropylene (SH-PP) surface has been studied experimentally. The multi-scale roughness of this surface is intrinsically inhomogeneous. Careful analysis of the wettability of each solution enables us to establish the statistics of the advancing and receding contact angles. We consider a threshold value of the receding static contact angle, above which drop sliding and rebound are facilitated as the criterion for superhydrophobicity. The percentage of receding contact angles greater than this threshold is then used as a practical index of superhydrophobicity (SHI). The variation of the SHI is compared with surface tension of the solution and various wetting parameters. A linear correlation is found between the SHI and the work of wetting defined by γLGcosθ₀ where γLG is the surface tension of the solution and θ₀ is the static contact angle of the solution over the corresponding smooth surface. Such a correlation can be used as a predictive tool of the superhydrophobicity of a given surface with various liquids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acontact angle 3ahydrophobicity 3apolypropylenes 3astatistics 3asurface roughness 3asurface tension 3awettability1 aDelattre, B.1 aDuvivier, D.1 aVaillant, A.1 aConinck, J. de,0 tAdvances in colloid and interface science.g2012 July 15, v. 175 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.x0001-86867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cis.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245009700170520079300267592002801060650001601088650002101104650001601125650001801141650002301159650001101182650001701193650001001210700003501220700002201255700002201277700002301299700002801322700002301350773011901373856007701492852000901569655001201578IND60745422420221116155529.0210723e20210716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074542242DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100716502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Canito, Alessandra 14aThe Role of Yeasts as Biocontrol Agents for Pathogenic Fungi on Postharvest Grapes: A Review  aIn view of the growing concern about the impact of synthetic fungicides on human health and the environment, several government bodies have decided to ban them. As a result, a great number of studies have been carried out in recent decades with the aim of finding a biological alternative to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens. In order to avoid the large losses of fruit and vegetables that these pathogens cause every year, the biological alternative’s efficacy should be the same as that of a chemical pesticide. In this review, the main studies discussed concern Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts as potential antagonists against phytopathogenic fungi of the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus and the species Botrytis cinerea on table grapes, wine grapes, and raisins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aPenicillium 3aSaccharomyces 3abiological control 3afruits 3ahuman health 3awines1 aMateo-Vargas, María Alejandra1 aMazzieri, Monica 1 aCantoral, Jesús 1 aFoschino, Roberto 1 aCordero-Bueso, Gustavo 1 aVigentini, Ileana 0 tFoods.g2021 July 16, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100716503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001900186245014300205300001100348506007600359520156500435592002802000506003702028650001502065650001102080650001802091650001002109650001302119650001802132650001702150650001502167650003502182650001302217650001902230650001102249650000902260650002002269650001402289650001202303650001402315650002302329650001302352650001902365650001202384650002202396700002202418700001402440700002202454700002702476700001802503700001802521773010802539856008002647852000902727655001202736IND60120455320221207110355.0200625e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012045532DNAL7 a234530572pmid7 aPMC36052572pmcid7 a10.1186/1743-422X-10-672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGauvin, Lianne10aRespiratory infection of mice with mammalian reoviruses causes systemic infection with age and strain dependent pneumonia and encephalitis  ap. 67.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Because mammalian reoviruses are isolated from the respiratory tract we modeled the natural history of respiratory infection of adult and suckling mice with T1 Lang (T1L) and T3 Dearing (T3D) reoviruses. METHODS: Adult and suckling Balb/c mice were infected by the intranasal route and were assessed for dose response of disease as well as viral replication in the lung and other organs. Viral antigen was assessed by immunofluorescence and HRP staining of tissue sections and histopathology was assessed on formalin fixed, H + E stained tissue sections. RESULTS: Intranasal infection of adult mice resulted in fatal respiratory distress for high doses (10⁷ pfu) of T1L but not T3D. In contrast both T1L and T3D killed suckling mice at moderate viral dosages (10⁵ pfu) but differed in clinical symptoms where T1L induced respiratory failure and T3D caused encephalitis. Infections caused transient viremia that resulted in spread to peripheral tissues where disease correlated with virus replication, and pathology. Immunofluorescent staining of viral antigens in the lung showed reovirus infection was primarily associated with alveoli with lesser involvement of bronchiolar epithelium. Immunofluorescent and HRP staining of viral antigens in brain showed infection of neurons by T3D and glial cells by T1L. CONCLUSIONS: These mouse models of reovirus respiratory infection demonstrated age and strain dependent disease that are expected to be relevant to understanding and modulating natural and therapeutic reovirus infections in humans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aReoviridae 3aadults 3aanimal models 3abrain 3adistress 3adose response 3aencephalitis 3aepithelium 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aformalin 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3amice 3anatural history 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3apneumonia 3arespiratory system 3asuckling 3aviral antigens 3aviremia 3avirus replication1 aBennett, Steffany1 aLiu, Hong1 aHakimi, Mansoureh1 aSchlossmacher, Michael1 aMajithia, Jay1 aBrown, Earl G0 tVirology journal.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.67-67dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-10-673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245009600216500001900312520235200331592002802683650001802711650001202729650001602741650001402757650001202771650001602783650001002799650001702809650002102826650001702847650001302864650001102877653001802888653001602906653001402922653001302936700003302949700001902982773010103001856008603102852000903188655001203197IND60686179920221119213008.0200427e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068617992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1063122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamczuk, Małgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3599-200610aDo anthropogenic hydrological alterations in shallow lakes affect the dynamics of plankton?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnthropogenic and natural climate-impacted water level (WL) fluctuations are one of many environmental problems affecting natural ecosystems. The aim of this study was to explain differences in the development of autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton in two shallow, temperate, embanked lakes with different modes of WL regulation. Lake Mytycze has natural WL changes supplied exclusively by precipitation; a decrease in water level was predominantly due to more evaporation than precipitation. In this lake, nutrient concentration, particulate matter, growth of toxigenic cyanobacteria and contamination with microcystins correlated positively with decreases in WL. Lake Tomaszne has anthropogenic WL regulation, elevated values of nutrients and particulate matter, but they were caused by the periodic, abrupt entrance of river waters rich in allochthonous nutrients, organic and inorganic particles. In this lake, a higher biomass of cyanobacteria was observed than in the lake with natural WL changes; the concentrations of intracellular microcystins in water correlated positively with the biomass of toxigenic species. In both lakes, decreases in the biomass of algivorous crustaceans correlated with the occurrence of cyanobacterial biomass. Biomasses of algivorous crustaceans increased abruptly when concentration of microcystins diminished below 2 μg∙dm⁻³. These biomass peaks occurred due to rapid development of the cladocerans; Bosmina longirostris was found in the lake with natural WL changes and Daphnia cucullata was found in the lake with anthropogenic WL regulation. The development of predacious crustaceans was not related to the blooms of filamentous cyanobacteria or the biomass of algivorous crustaceans (as potential prey). In both lakes, Thermocyclops crassus and Mesocyclops leuckartii (Copepoda) contributed significantly to the biomass of predacious crustaceans; their abundance correlated positively with the amount of particulate matter, which was probably utilised as an alternative food source. These findings illustrate indirect influence of WL on plankton composition and biomass through alteration of environmental variables. The results indicate that the mode of WL regulation (natural vs anthropogenic) must be taken into consideration when estimating the influence of WL changes on plankton dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aDaphnia 3aMesocyclops 3aalgivores 3abiomass 3aevaporation 3alakes 3amicrocystins 3anutrient content 3aparticulates 3aplankton 3arivers 0aPhytoplankton 0aCrustaceans 0aCladocera 0aCopepoda1 aPawlik-Skowrońska, Barbara,1 aSolis, Michał0 tEcological indicators.g2020 July, v. 114 p.106312-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1063123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100002200163245013600185300001600321520140000337592002801737650001601765650002801781650001201809650002001821650002001841650001601861650002901877650002401906650002601930650002401956650001601980650000901996650000902005650002802014650002502042650001202067650004202079650003902121650003302160650003402193650005302227650003902280650002302319650000902342650003802351650006502389650002202454650003502476650002702511650005302538650000902591650002102600650003702621700001402658700002402672700002002696700001902716700002402735700002102759700002102780773012702801856004502928852000902973655001202982IND50072646720221121215443.0140204e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007264672DNAL7 a241059612pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2013003342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKontani, Noriyasu10aCharacterization of Ile‐His‐Arg‐Phe, a novel rice‐derived vasorelaxing peptide with hypotensive and anorexigenic activities  ap. 359-364.  aSCOPE: Recently, we found that dipeptide Arg‐Phe (RF) had cholecystokinin (CCK)‐dependent vasorelaxing activity. The RF sequence is often observed in the primary structure of natural food proteins. In the current study, we investigated enzymatic conditions for the release of RF‐related peptides from rice glutelin, a major storage protein, using gastrointestinal proteases. RF‐related peptides were then characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: It was found that RF and Ile‐His‐Arg‐Phe (IHRF) were released in the chymotrypsin digest of the partial structure of rice glutelin. We then focused on previously unidentified IHRF, corresponding to rice glutelin(155−158). IHRF had vasorelaxing activity in the mesenteric artery of spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs). Orally administered IHRF lowered systolic blood pressure in SHRs. The antihypertensive activity of IHRF was more potent and long‐lasting than that of RF. IHRF‐induced vasorelaxing activity was not blocked by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase, but by an antagonist for CCK₁ receptor. IHRF also had CCK‐like suppressive activities in food intake and gastrointestinal transit. IHRF increased intracellular Ca²⁺ flux and CCK release in the enteroendocrine cell STC‐1. CONCLUSION: IHRF, a novel CCK‐dependent vasorelaxing peptide, decreases both blood pressure and food intake in rodents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aantihypertensive effect 3acalcium 3acholecystokinin 3adietary protein 3afood intake 3agastrointestinal transit 3amesenteric arteries 3anitric oxide synthase 3aoral administration 3aproteinases 3arats 3arice 3asystolic blood pressure 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAntihypertensive Agentsxpharmacology 2aAppetite Depressantsxpharmacology 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aCholecystokininxpharmacology 2aEnteroendocrine Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGastrointestinal Tractxenzymology 2aGlutensxchemistry 2aMale 2aMesenteric Arteriesxdrug effects 2aNitric Oxide Synthasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPeptidesxpharmacology 2aProstaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthasesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred SHR 2aVasodilator Agentsxpharmacology1 aOmae, Ryo1 aKagebayashi, Tomomi1 aKaneko, Kentaro1 aYamada, Yūko,1 aMizushige, Takafumi1 aKanamoto, Ryuhei1 aOhinata, Kousaku0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2014 Feb., v. 58, no. 2 p.359-364dWiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We aimed to examine the association between maternal consumption of sprouted potatoes during periconceptional period and risks of NTDs or OFCs. METHODS: Subjects included 622 NTD cases, 135 OFC cases and 858 nonmalformed controls, were recruited from a case-control study in Shanxi Province of northern China between 2002 and 2007. Information on demographics, maternal sprouted potato consumption, lifestyle behaviors and folic acid supplementation was collected. RESULTS: Consumption of sprouted potatoes was associated with elevated odds of total NTDs (OR = 2.20; 95% CI, 1.12–4.32) and anencephaly (OR = 2.48; 95% CI, 1.10–5.58); no association for spina bifida or encephalocele. Sprouted potato consumption increased the risk of total OFCs (OR = 3.49; 95% CI, 1.29–9.49) and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL ± P) (OR = 4.03; 95% CI, 1.44–11.28). CONCLUSION: Maternal consumption of sprouted potatoes during periconceptional period may increase the risks of NTDs and OFCs. Given that potato is commonly consumed around the world, improper preservation and use should be a matter of concern in respect of the potential teratogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data  a81472987cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81773441cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a7162094cBeijing Natural Science Foundation  a2016YFC1000501cNational Key Research and Development Program, Ministry of Science and Technology, P.R.

We evaluate a low-cost method to assess urban habitat quality with relatively easy sampling and no need for complicated and expensive equipment. The method is based on quantifying gravimetric (leaf dry weight – LDW, oganic weight in leaves – LO, ash weight in leaves – LA) and physiological (leaf mineral content – LMC, leaf organic content – LOC, leaf organic content/leaf mineral content ratio – LOC/LMC, leaf mineral deposition in tissues – LTDM) parameters. These parameters are relatively simple, accurate, and inexpensive and can be quickly determined. Kruskal–Wallis tests were used in order to compare LDW, LA, LO, LMC, LOC, LTDM and LOC/LMC among the eight species (Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Tilia platyphyllos, Tilia tomentosa, Aesculus hippocastanum, Aesculus × carnea, Taxus baccata, Picea abies). All these species are considered as valuable forest and decorative ones recommended for planting in the green zones of the towns. These tree species are easily identified, widely distributed, and widely used in bioindication studies. The variable mineral content within leaves can be explained by environmental effects, as well as by the physiological differences between species. Species that exhibit phenotypic plasticity with respect to these parameters (Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Tilia platyphyllos, Tilia tomentosa) reflect changes in the urban environment. With a high mineral content, A. carnea is more suited for the urban environment than A. hippocastanum. Taking into account the existing conditions in Timisoara, we consider evergreen species (T. baccata, P. abies) to be inadequate for cultivation in areas with heavy road traffic because they show stability in leaf mineral content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer platanoides 3aAcer pseudoplatanus 3aAesculus hippocastanum 3aPicea abies 3aTaxus baccata 3aTilia platyphyllos 3aTilia tomentosa 3aequipment 3aevergreen trees 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aleaf development 3aleaf dry mass 3aleaves 3amineral content 3aphenotypic plasticity 3atraffic 3aurban areas 0aBiomarker 0aLeaf mineral content 0aUrban environment1 aBatalu, Alexandra1 aHriscu, Diana1 aDaniela Datcu, Adina0 tEcological indicators.g2020 July, v. 114 p.106313-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1063133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010600168300001400274520159600288592002801884650003701912650001801949650002201967650002601989650001002015650001802025650002202043650001402065650001202079650001602091700002302107700002402130773010902154856008102263990002302344852000902367655001202376IND60085546520221120023441.0141101e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008554652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cis.2012.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarvis, Karyn L.10aSurface chemistry of porous silicon and implications for drug encapsulation and delivery applications  ap. 25-38.  aPorous silicon (pSi) has a number of unique properties that appoint it as a potential drug delivery vehicle; high loading capacity, controllable surface chemistry and structure, and controlled release properties. The native SiySiHₓ terminated pSi surface is highly reactive and prone to spontaneous oxidation. Surface modification is used to stabilize the pSi surface but also to produce surfaces with desired drug delivery behavior, typically via oxidation, hydrosilylation or thermal carbonization. A number of advanced characterization techniques have been used to analyze pSi surface chemistry, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Surface modification not only stabilizes the pSi surface but determines its charge, wettability and dissolution properties. Manipulation of these parameters can impact drug encapsulation by altering drug–pSi interactions. pSi has shown to be a successful vehicle for the delivery of poorly soluble drugs and protein therapeutics. Surface modification influences drug pore penetration, crystallinity, loading level and dissolution rate. Surface modification of pSi shows great potential for drug delivery applications by controlling pSi–drug interactions. Controlling these interactions allows specific drug release behaviors to be engineered to aid in the delivery of previously challenging therapeutics. Within this review, different pSi modification techniques will be outlined followed by a summary of how pSi surface modification has been used to improve drug encapsulation and delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbonization 3acrystal structure 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3asilicon 3awettability1 aBarnes, Timothy J.1 aPrestidge, Clive A.0 tAdvances in colloid and interface science.g2012 July 15, v. 175 p.25-38dElsevier B.V.x0001-86867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cis.2012.03.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245005100180300001600231500001900247500000900266520073000275592002801005650002201033650002601055650001301081650001201094650002401106650001101130650001001141773012101151856009701272852000901369655001201378IND60663550520221122121358.0191122e198605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066355052DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1986.00021962007800030035x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCaig, T.

Leaf samples (up to 265) were clipped to holders suspended from hangers on a conveyor chain. The samples were then repetitively weighed (three samples per minute) throughout the day to determine individual water-loss rates. An inexpensive microcomputer controlled all operations including movement of the conveyor chain, transfer of samples to and from the balance, taring and weighing operations, and data storage. With minor modifications this weighing system can be easily applied to other types of routine weighing needed in agricultural research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagricultural research 3aagronomy 3adrought 3ainformation storage 3aleaves 3awheat0 tAgronomy journal.g1986 May, v. 78, no. 3 p.551-557dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1986.00021962007800030035x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245010600200300001600306520139900322592002801721650001101749650002301760650003001783650001101813650001501824650001101839650002401850650002201874650001101896653002501907653002701932653003401959653003301993653002302026700001302049700002002062773013702082856007902219852000902298655001202307IND60594956920221120125719.0180621e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059495692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b165582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Jinguang1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3641-508310aLaser Direct Writing and Selective Metallization of Metallic Circuits for Integrated Wireless Devices  ap. 915-924.  aPortable and wearable devices have attracted wide research attention due to their intimate relations with human daily life. As basic structures in the devices, the preparation of high-conductive metallic circuits or micro-circuits on flexible substrates should be facile, cost-effective, and easily integrated with other electronic units. In this work, high-conductive carbon/Ni composite structures were prepared by using a facile laser direct writing method, followed by an electroless Ni plating process, which exhibit a 3-order lower sheet resistance of less than 0.1 ohm/sq compared to original structures before plating, showing the potential for practical use. The carbon/Ni composite structures exhibited a certain flexibility and excellent anti-scratch property due to the tight deposition of Ni layers on carbon surfaces. On the basis of this approach, a wireless charging and storage device on a polyimide film was demonstrated by integrating an outer rectangle carbon/Ni composite coil for harvesting electromagnetic waves and an inner carbon micro-supercapacitor for energy storage, which can be fast charged wirelessly by a commercial wireless charger. Furthermore, a near-field communication (NFC) tag was prepared by combining a carbon/Ni composite coil for harvesting signals and a commercial IC chip for data storage, which can be used as an NFC tag for practical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3aenergy 3aharvesting 3ahumans 3ainformation storage 3amaterials science 3anickel 0alaser direct writing 0aelectroless Ni plating 0awireless charging and storage 0anear-field communication tag 0aintegrated devices1 aLv, Chao1 aWatanabe, Akira0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 10, no. 1 p.915-924dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b165583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245017500166506002800341520156300369592002801932506003701960650002501997650002302022650001202045650001302057650002502070650001202095650001002107650001202117650001202129650001002141650001302151650003502164650001102199653002502210653002002235653002302255653001802278653000802296700002602304700001702330700001502347700001202362700002402374700001402398773009202412856008002504852000902584655001202593IND60764456420221215143608.0211121e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076445642DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2101382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasrullah, Hasan10aShort Communication: Single nucleotide polymorphism in C-type lysozyme gene and its correlation with Aeromonas hydrophila resistance in African catfish Clarias gariepinus  aResource is Open Access  aAuthors. 2020. Short Communication: Single nucleotide polymorphism in C-type lysozyme gene and its correlation with Aeromonas hydrophila resistance in African catfish Clarias gariepinus. Biodiversitas 21: 311-317. The chicken-type lysozyme (LYSC) gene has been demonstrated to play important roles in the fish protection system against bacterial infection. In this present study, we aimed to identify the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the LYSC gene of African catfish Clarias gariepinus and its possible association with Aeromonas hydrophila resistance, a major pathogenic bacterium in African catfish. The gDNA of the African catfish LYSC coding sequence was 1559 bp long, comprising of four exons and three introns. Six SNPs were identified in African catfish LYSC, namely SNP1-6. After the A. hydrophila challenge, we regarded the surviving individuals after the infection as the resistant group and the dead fish as the susceptible group. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis on SNP2 revealed that the allele frequencies of TT, CC, and TC were of 27.78%, 5.55%, and 66.67% in the resistant group, while the frequencies of TT, CC, and TC were 16.67%, 27.78%, and 55.55% in the susceptible group, respectively. The expression of LYSC and other immune-genes in the resistant group was also higher in the liver, head kidney, and spleen. These results indicated that the LYSC gene might play an essential role in bacterial resistance, and the SNP2 within the LYSC gene may be associated with the resistance to A. hydrophila in African catfish.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aClarias gariepinus 3aalleles 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acatfish 3aexons 3aintrons 3akidneys 3aliver 3alysozyme 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspleen 0aaeromonas hydrophila 0aafrican catfish 0adisease resistance 0alysozyme gene 0asnp1 aNababan, Yanti Inneke1 aSafitri, Ika1 aYanti, Dwi1 aNuryati1 aMuhammad, Zairin Jr1 aAlimuddin0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Dec., v. 21, no. 1dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2101383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013600170300001800306520197700324592002802301650001902329650001202348650001202360650001702372650001302389650002702402650001702429650000902446650001302455650001902468650001802487650002602505650002302531650001102554650002002565650001502585650002502600650001602625650001202641650002102653650001402674650002002688650002702708700002002735700002602755700002202781700001902803700002502822773011902847856008102966852000903047655001203056IND60583666420221118203211.0171023e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058366642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-017-9581-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLapčík, Lubomír10aApplication of a vibration damping technique in characterizing mechanical properties of chicken meat batters modified with amaranth  ap. 1987-1994.  aThermal analysis, texture profile analysis, water holding capacity and dynamic mechanical testing methods were used for study of the physico-chemical and mechanical properties of the model chicken meat batters modified by the addition of amaranth flour. It was found that the addition of the amaranth effectively modified and improved their textural and nutritional properties. Further, the addition of calcium dihydrogen phosphate to the complex meat batter was shown to enhance formation of the creation of the three dimensional gel networks during protein denaturation, which resulted in increased tenderness of the product, as was demonstrated by decreased hardness, toughness and gumminess of the chicken batters with the increase of amaranth concentration. These findings were supported by dynamic mechanical vibration testing experiments and by increased water holding capacity. After amaranth flour addition, the observed frequency dependence of the measured damping transfer function of the tested samples showed typical viscoelastic behaviour rather than pure elastic behaviour. The first resonance peak frequency shifted from 200 Hz for unmodified chicken batter to 120 Hz for batter with 1 wt% amaranth concentration and 0.45 wt% calcium dihydrogen phosphate. Formation of a hydrocolloid gel structure was confirmed by thermal analysis experiments, which showed decreased DTA protein denaturation temperature peak position from 101.3 °C for the unmodified batter to 90.6 °C for batter with 2 wt% amaranth. Interestingly, after addition of a Ca²⁺ crosslinking agent into the matrix, thermal resistance of the gel phase increased, which was reflected by the increased latter denaturation peak position from 93.7 °C (for 1.5 wt% amaranth concentration chicken meat batters without calcium dihydrogen phosphate) to 108.8 °C for 0.45 wt% crosslinking agent calcium dihydrogen phosphate and 1.5 wt% amaranth concentration chicken meat batters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamaranth flour 3abatters 3acalcium 3achicken meat 3achickens 3across-linking reagents 3adenaturation 3agels 3ahardness 3aheat tolerance 3ahydrocolloids 3amechanical properties 3amechanical testing 3amodels 3anutritive value 3aphosphates 3aprotein denaturation 3atemperature 3atexture 3athermal analysis 3avibration 3aviscoelasticity 3awater holding capacity1 aVašina, Martin1 aLapčíková, Barbora1 aPlšková, Mária1 aGál, Róbert,1 aBrychtová, Michaela0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2017 Dec., v. 11, no. 4 p.1987-1994dSpringer USx2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-017-9581-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011900167300001600286520163000302592002801932650001201960650001901972650002601991650001802017650001402035650001202049650001302061650001902074653001602093653001202109653001602121653002402137653001802161653002302179653001902202653001302221700002302234700002502257773008702282856008102369852000902450655001202459IND60615073720221120141418.0181004s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061507372DNAL7 a10.1163/15685381-000030442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMogali, Santosh10aInfluence of desiccation, predatory cues, and density on metamorphic traits of the bronze frog Hylarana temporalis  ap. 199-205.  aWe conducted an experiment to understand the influence of ecological factors (desiccation, predation threat and density) on two major metamorphic traits, larval period and size at metamorphosis, in the Indian bronze frog, Hylarana temporalis. Tadpoles were reared in groups of 15 (low), 30 (medium) and 60 (high) densities. We created the threat of desiccation by removing 0.5 l water at 10 days intervals until the water quantity reached 0.5 l. Caged dragonfly larvae (Pantala flavescens) provided the predation threat. Results show that each ecological factor independently influenced metamorphic traits but not in an interactive way. Under desiccation threat the tadpoles metamorphosed earlier and at smaller sizes compared to those reared in constant water (at corresponding densities) regardless of presence/absence of predator. In contrast, under predation threat, tadpoles metamorphosed early and at a bigger size than those reared without predator regardless of density of rearing, and desiccation threat. Alternatively, an increase in density of rearing delayed metamorphosis with smaller metamorphic size in constant water and also under threat of desiccation regardless of whether predation threat existed or not. Thus, our study revealed that H. temporalis tadpoles can modify their response to each ecological factor regardless of what other factors operate simultaneously; the threat of desiccation shortens larval period at the cost of growth. Whereas, predator pressure shortens larval period along with increased growth; while greater density increases larval period and slows down growth in H. temporalis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPantala 3aRana clamitans 3aenvironmental factors 3ametamorphosis 3apredation 3arearing 3atadpoles 3awater quantity 0abronze frog 0adensity 0adesiccation 0aHylarana temporalis 0alarval period 0ametamorphic traits 0apredation risk 0atadpoles1 aSaidapur, Srinivas1 aShanbhag, Bhagyashri0 tAmphibia-reptilia.g, v. 37, no. 2 p.199-205dBrillwJournal:6284x0173-53737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685381-000030443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009700165500002000262520168900282592002801971650002201999650003002021650001802051650001202069650001302081650001202094650002602106650001402132650001702146650001502163650001302178650002102191650001602212700003202228700006802260773014302328856007402471852000902545655001202554IND60742898720221116181316.0210627e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074289872DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.154892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz‐Montes, Elsa10aDextran/chitosan blend film fabrication for bio‐packaging of mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus)  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAgaricus bisporus is likely the most worldwide consumed mushroom, however, its commercial acceptability requires an attractive visual appearance for the consumer. The storage is an essential stage in controlling the physical appearance and shelf‐life of the mushrooms. In this study, films based on commercial chitosan and a dextran produced by a Leuconostoc mesenteroides strain, were fabricated and then proposed to replace commercial packing materials. The dextran/chitosan blend films were evaluated according to the dextran concentration variation (from 0.0 up to 4.0% w/v dispersion), their physicochemical, mechanical and permeability characteristics, and their functionality in the bio‐packaging of mushrooms. The results showed that the lowest dextran concentration (0.5% w/v dispersion) presented the best properties for tensile strength (2.32 MPa), elastic modulus (~6.54 MPa), water vapor permeability (4.09 g mm kPa⁻¹ m⁻² hr⁻¹), and delayed spoilage time of mushrooms up to 28 days at 4°C. Our findings demonstrate that these biofilms can be a viable bio‐packaging alternative for preserving fresh mushrooms. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: In this work, we have developed new sustainable biopolymers‐based films using chitosan and dextran. The latter material was produced through biotechnological approaches using Leuconostoc mesenteroides SF3. The developed biofilms were fully characterized and later tested for the preservation of mushrooms over 28 days. Based on our findings, the application of the dextran/chitosan blend films can be viable as a bio‐packaging alternative for preserving fresh mushrooms, extending their storage and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3abio-packaging 3abiofilm 3achitosan 3adextran 3amodulus of elasticity 3amushrooms 3apermeability 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3atensile strength 3awater vapor1 aYáñez‐Fernández, Jorge1 aCastro‐Muñoz, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7657-33020 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.e15489-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.154893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005000155245017800205300001600383520126400399592002801663650002501691650002901716650002501745650002501770650000901795650000901804650001101813650001901824650001401843650004101857650003201898650001401930650000701944650002301951650001301974650001701987653001002004653001802014653001302032653002602045653001602071700001402087700001602101700001702117773009902134856009002233852000902323655001202332IND60617635620221121082014.0190318e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061763562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7336-841812aA novel superchilling storage-ice glazing (SS-IG) approach using anti-oxidative and antimicrobial essential oil (EO) for freshness-keeping of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)  ap. 243-249.  aWith high Aw, rich nutrients and suitable pH, aquatic products are generally perishable. It becomes a pivotal restriction in fishing and aquaculture industry. Aimed to this, a novel superchilling storage-ice glazing (SS-IG) approach with clove essential oil (EO) was established in this study. EO was obtained from dry clove buds. Its major components (99.26%) were identified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. Its antioxidant activity was revealed by DPPS (IC50 = 23.39 μg/mL) and ABTS (IC50 = 13.74 μg/mL) assays, while its antimicrobial activity (15 μL) was determined via inhibition zone towards different microbial species (17.8–22.9 mm). On this basis, 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% v/v of EO solutions were used to immerse fresh sea bass samples at ~0 °C to form IG layers. The resulting samples were stored at −1 ± 0.2 °C for 25 days and analyzed by a series of freshness assays. Results showed that the treatment was effective in keeping the storage freshness of fish samples by retarding the spoilage of preserved fish samples in electric, chemical, microbial, textural and sensory properties. It can indicate that this SS-IG approach will have promising applications in aquaculture industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaculture industry 3abass 3abuds 3acloves 3aessential oils 3afreshness 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3anutrients 3apH 3asensory properties 3aspoilage 3asupercooling 0aClove 0aEssential oil 0aSea bass 0aSuperchilling storage 0aIce glazing1 aGong, Bin1 aHe, Jiapeng1 aXiao, Kaijun0 tAquaculture.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 500 p.243-249dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008500176300001600261520124300277592002801520650001301548650002201561650002001583650001201603650003501615650001101650650001401661650001701675650001701692653001101709653001201720653000801732653002001740653000701760653001801767653001301785653001001798653002001808700002701828700001901855773012201874856008401996852000902080655001202089IND50087409820221118220647.0150325e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008740982DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2011.6274712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Reumont, Frederik10aVisualization of geologic geospatial datasets through X3D in the frame of WebGIS  ap. 483-503.  a3D geo spatial data have become the normal. However, to view the data, usually expert software is required, which have up to now hindered the wide spread use of 3D scenes for the display of geological data. The internet real time 3D rendering framework X3D is assessed regarding its suitability for building a geological GIS on the internet. Especially important for geological data, 3D rendering enhances the intuitive grasp of the data and enables the user to interactively explore it. It is often necessary to find a solution to distribute this data to a wide range of interested parties, experts and non-experts alike. According to the nature of 3D data, the best technique to display geo-data, the modeling of objects and unresolved issues have to be taken into consideration. The internet is the apparent tool for the public distribution and visualization of 3D data and it was found that through the open ISO-standardized format X3D it offers a multitude of possibilities. A 3D geological interactive map was created with these prerequisites to identify challenges and possibilities through this process. It was found that the use of lead to satisfactory results, that could probably not have been achieved with another technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aexperts 3ageographic information systems 3amodels 3arendering 3aspatial data 3astakeholders 0awebGIS 0ageology 0aX3D 0ainteractive map 0a3D 0avisualization 0ainternet 0ax3dom 0avirtual reality1 aArsanjani, Jamal Jokar1 aRiedl, Andreas0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 6, no. 5 p.483-503dTaylor & Francis Groupx1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2011.6274713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094024004200139040001800181100001800199245012700217506002800344506003600372506007600408506003100484520143400515592002801949596008301977596004502060506003702105650002002142650002602162650001302188650002402201650001402225650002302239650001602262650000902278650001502287650002702302650002002329650001002349650002102359650001602380650001802396650001802414650001702432650001102449650001702460650001702477650001002494650001002504650001102514653002602525653002702551653003402578653002002612700003502632700001902667700002302686700002502709773010202734856008902836903002402925852000902949655001202958IND60683071020221207092858.0200403e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068307102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.1041672chorus7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.1041672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Imtiaz10aEndophytic Metarhizium robertsii promotes maize growth, suppresses insect growth, and alters plant defense gene expression  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFungi in the genus Metarhizium (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) are entomopathogens that can establish as endophytes and benefit their host plant through growth promotion and suppression of insect pests. This study focuses on the Metarhizium-insect-plant interactions in greenhouse- and lab-based experiments. We inoculated seeds of maize (Zea mays L.) with spores of Metarhizium robertsii and evaluated V4 maize for endophytic colonization of leaves and roots, measured plant height, chlorophyll content and above-ground biomass, and relative growth rate of black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel). In addition, we studied the expression of selected plant defense genes. We recovered M. robertsii from 91% of plants grown from inoculated seeds. We detected M. robertsii more frequently in roots compared with leaves. Colonized plants were greater in plant height and above-ground biomass compared to control plants. Leaf tissue from colonized plants showed changes in the expression of genes involved in plant defense. In feeding bioassays, the relative growth rate of black cutworm was lower on leaves from endophytic plants compared to control plants. Few other studies have examined the defense response of plants to colonization by Metarhizium spp. Endophytic colonization of maize plants by M. robertsii promoted plant growth and altered defense gene expression in maize, and suppressed growth rate of black cutworm larvae.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrotis ipsilon 3aMetarhizium robertsii 3aZea mays 3aaboveground biomass 3abioassays 3abiological control 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3aendophytes 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth promotion 3ahost plants 3ainsect growth 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3aroots 3aseeds 3aspores 0aFungal entomopathogen 0aMaize growth promotion 0aPlant defense gene expression 0aPlant endophyte1 aJiménez-Gasco, María del Mar1 aLuthe, Dawn S.1 aShakeel, Samina N.1 aBarbercheck, Mary E.0 tBiological control.g2020 May, v. 144 p.104167-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.1041673Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009400174300001400268520179200282592002802074650001102102650002502113650002002138650001502158650000902173650001902182650002302201650001202224650001002236650001402246650001202260650001102272650000902283650001302292650001502305650001702320651001302337653001902350653001502369653002002384653002002404653002202424700002002446700005802466773010102524856008602625852000902711655001202720IND60535720320221119103207.0190318e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053572032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJessick, Ashley M.10aSandy sediment and the bioavailability of 17β-trenbolone to adult female fathead minnows  ap. 48-54.  aRecent studies have detected bioavailable steroids in sediment, however, the mechanism by which these compounds become bioavailable is not completely understood. In this study, two experiments were conducted using a double aquarium system that allowed female fathead minnows to be exposed to sandy sediments without direct contact. In the first experiment, natural sediment from the Elkhorn River (Nebraska, USA) was spiked with 17β-trenbolone. Both the fish in direct contact with the sediment as well as the fish excluded from direct contact experienced significant reductions in the hepatic expression of two estrogen-responsive genes, vitellogenin and estrogen receptor α, indicating molecular defeminization. The natural sediment contained particles ranging in size from sand to clay and it was possible that the fish in experiment 1 were being exposed to trenbolone associated with the very fine particles. The sandy sediment was sieved for experiment 2, and only the particles larger than 250μm were used. In addition, the experiment was conducted at two different Tb concentrations (1× and 10×). Furthermore nuptial tubercles, a biomarker of exposure to a masculinizing androgen, were also evaluated in the females used in experiment 2. For tubercle number and vtg expression, significant results were obtained from a two-way ANOVA due to Tb concentration, but not tank location or interaction term (location vs. concentration). For ERα expression, results were found in response to Tb concentration and tank location, but not the interaction term. Overall the results from these studies suggest that the primary route of exposure of sediment-associated trenbolone to fish is through ventilation of free compound, rather than ingestion or direct contact with the sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanalysis of variance 3abioavailability 3abiomarkers 3aclay 3adirect contact 3aestrogen receptors 3afemales 3agenes 3aingestion 3aminnows 3arivers 3asand 3asteroids 3atrenbolone 3avitellogenin 3aNebraska 0aSandy sediment 0aTrenbolone 0aGene expression 0aBioavailability 0aRoute of exposure1 aSkolness, Sarah1 aKolok, Alan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1585-60340 tAquatic toxicology.g2014 Mar., v. 148 p.48-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006500153245012500218520210300343592002802446650002902474650001202503650001102515650002802526650001102554650001302565650001502578650001802593650002202611650001902633650001502652650001602667651001102683651001802694653001802712653002002730653002302750653002202773700003202795700002502827700002802852773011102880856008802991852000903079655001203088IND60706861720221120142408.0200824e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070686172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1052272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenancio, Kelly Kawai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3595-663010aHydrodynamic modeling with scenario approach in the evaluation of dredging impacts on coastal erosion in Santos (Brazil)  aCoastal environments provide infrastructure and ecosystems that are key to modern human life and have long become a noticeably pleasant place to settle. Coastal zones are densely populated, and consequently one of the most urbanized areas around the world. However, coastlines are very dynamic and undergo constant changes that might be related to natural or anthropogenic sources. Hence, erosion has become one of the most alarming coastal hazards today, having caused serious damage to seaside infrastructure and properties. Santos is one of the most important cities in Brazilian Southeast region and home to the largest port of Latin America. Ponta da Praia, part of Santos' shoreline, has been suffering coastal erosion for the past few decades. The erosion became more severe after dredging activities were conducted to deepen and widen the port's navigation channel, having started in 2010 in order to expand the port activities. In this scenario, this study attempts to assess the dredging effects on the region hydromorphodynamics and analyze whether it represents a major cause for the rise of the erosion rate. To conduct the analyses, a hydrodynamic model and a spectral wave model with scenario approach were used, and three distinct scenarios were adopted: (1) before the dredging activities; (2) immediately after the dredging activities, but with an update of the port's channel bathymetry; (3) scenario 2 updating the bathymetry of beach profiles at Ponta da Praia and its surroundings. The resulting simulations and subsequent analyzes confirmed the hypothesis. The update of the bathymetric data of the port's channel allowed us to observe considerable changes on the hydrodynamic patterns. In addition, on the stretch where a recirculation zone was formed, the processed field data had already pointed to a more eroded area. Therefore, the beaches failed to achieve an equilibrium, which led to a continuous erosive process. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic modeling has proved effective to predict or detect changes and potential problems related to topobathymetric modifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abeaches 3acities 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3adredging 3aecosystems 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrologic models 3ainfrastructure 3ashorelines 3aurban areas 3aBrazil 3aLatin America 0aBeach erosion 0aCoastal erosion 0aHydrodynamic model 0aScenario approach1 aGarcia, Patrícia Dalsoglio1 aGireli, Tiago Zenker1 aCorrêa, Thiago Bezerra0 tOcean & coastal management.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 195 p.105227-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1052273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245014300201300001600344520192600360592002802286650002702314650002602341650002602367650002902393650001302422650002102435650001202456650001402468650001302482650002002495650002202515650003202537650001902569650003702588650002102625650001702646650002902663650001402692650001302706650001302719650001302732650001702745650001502762653002702777653002702804653001302831653001502844653002702859653003602886700002402922700002002946700002702966700002602993700002003019700006103039700006503100700002203165773013703187856007903324852000903403655001203412IND60594957120180622000000.0180621e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059495712DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b165732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauro, Nicolò1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0246-347410aBranched High Molecular Weight Glycopolypeptide With Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Activity for the Treatment of Biofilm Related Infections  ap. 318-331.  aThere are few therapeutic options to simultaneously tackle Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two of the most relevant nosocomial and antibiotic-resistant pathogens responsible for implant, catheters and wound severe infections. The design and synthesis of polymers with inherent antimicrobial activity have gained increasing attention as a safe strategy to treat multi-drug-resistant microbes. Here, we tested the activity of a new polymeric derivative with glycopolypeptide architecture (PAA-VC) bearing l-arginine, vancomycin, and colistin as side chains acting against multiple targets, which give rise to a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity favorably combining specific and nonspecific perturbation of the bacterial membrane. PAA-VC has been tested against planktonic and established biofilms of reference strains S. aureus ATCC 25923 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and susceptible or antibiotic resistant clinical isolates of the above-mentioned microorganisms. MIC values observed for the conjugate (48–190 and 95–190 nM for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus strains, respectively) showed higher efficacy if compared with the free vancomycin (MICs within 1.07–4.28 μM) and colistin (MICs within 0.63–1.33 μM). Additionally, being highly biocompatible (IC₅₀ > 1000, 430, and 250 μg mL–¹ for PAA-VC, vancomycin and colistin respectively) high-dosage can be adopted for the eradication of infections in patients. This positively influences the anti-biofilm activity of the conjugate leading to a quasi-total eradication of established clinically relevant biofilms (inhibition >90% at 500 μg mL–¹). We believe that the in vitro presented data, especially the activity against established biofilms of two relevant pathogens, the high biocompatibility and the good mucoadhesion properties, would allow the use of PAA-VC as promising candidate to successfully address emerging infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial properties 3aarginine 3abiocompatibility 3abiofilm 3acatheters 3acolistin 3across infection 3aemerging diseases 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amicroorganisms 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amolecular weight 3amucoadhesion 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogens 3apatients 3aplankton 3apolymers 3atherapeutics 3avancomycin 0aantimicrobial polymers 0asynthetic polypeptides 0acolistin 0avancomycin 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aStaphylococcus aureus, biofilms1 aSchillaci, Domenico1 aVarvarà, Paola1 aCusimano, Maria Grazia1 aGeraci, Daniela Maria1 aGiuffrè, Mario1 aCavallaro, Gennara1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0585-65641 aMaida, Carmelo Massimo1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6989-92591 aGiammona, Gaetano0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 10, no. 1 p.318-331dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b165733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245009500163500002000258520131500278592002801593596003501621650002601656650002501682650001701707650001201724650001401736650001301750650002001763650001401783650002001797650002701817651001301844700005601857700002101913700002201934700006001956700002002016700001702036700001902053773014302072856007402215852000902289655001202298IND60742898920221116181202.0210627e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074289892DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.155542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeong, Chia Choong10aAssessment of phylogenetic, growth, and antioxidant capacity of Pleurotus spp. in Malaysia  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGenus Pleurotus spp. contains many edible fungi with high nutritional value, medicinal value, and ease of growth. Cultivation of Pleurotus faces many problems including poor quality of mushroom spawn, low biological efficiency, and slow growth. In this study, we performed species identification using ITS marker and antioxidant capacity evaluation on 27 Pleurotus mycelia strains from MARDI's mushroom bank. Furthermore, important characteristics such as biological efficiency, complete growth, and antioxidant capacity were evaluated for 10 selected fruiting bodies of Pleurotus pulmonarius. Strain MP34 was the most suitable strain for commercial production, whereas mycelial strain MP42, MP52, and MP28 were suitable for the extraction of biologically active compounds. Our findings contributed and identified high‐quality strains for the local Malaysian mushroom farmers. Future studies will focus on parameters such as substrate and supplements selection and bag preparation for the improvement of Pleurotus cultivation. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: This study evaluated the potential of using ITS markers and antioxidant profiling to identify high‐quality Pleurotus strain, which can be subsequently used for the quality control of Pleurotus mycelia culture in the mushroom bank and even by the farmer.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAHD0001cMARDI internal grant 3aPleurotus pulmonarius 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3afarmers 3amushrooms 3amycelium 3anutritive value 3aphylogeny 3aquality control 3aspecies identification 3aMalaysia1 aHo, Wan Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5768-07381 aYeap, Swee Keong1 aKrishnen, Ganisan1 aChong, Zhi Xiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1695-76381 aHo, Jinn Shyuan1 aLim, Pei Tee1 aTen, Seng Teik0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.e15554-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.155543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245018300164300001600347520115600363592002801519650003201547650002601579650002501605650002201630650001701652650001001669650002201679650001101701650001501712650001201727650002501739650002001764650001901784650002201803650001101825650001301836700001801849700002401867700002001891773009101911856008102002852000902083655001202092IND60548974120221119002449.0160905e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054897412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-016-1089-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Toshio10aEffects of Homologous Expression of 1,4-Benzoquinone Reductase and Homogentisate 1,2-Dioxygenase Genes on Wood Decay in Hyper-Lignin-Degrading Fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624  ap. 512-518.  aWe investigated the function of 1,4-benzoquinone reductase (BQR)- and homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD)-like genes in wood degradation by Phanerochaete sordida YK-624, which exhibits high ligninolytic activity and selectivity. We determined homologous expression in the genomic and cDNA sequences of BQR- and HGD-like genes in P. sordida YK-624 (PsBQR and PsHGD). Both genes shared high homology (≥90 % amino acid sequence similarity) with the corresponding genes in Phanerochaete chrysosporium. These genes were co-transformed with a reporter gene into an uracil auxotrophic mutant of P. sordida YK-624. The PsBQR and PsHGD co-transformants exhibited lower holocellulolytic activity and higher ligninolytic selectivity than the control transformants. In liquid culture with vanillin, both co-transformants significantly accelerated vanillin degradation. Thus, we suggest that the rapid metabolism of low-molecular weight lignin fragments, due to the homologous expression of BQR- and HGD-like genes, affects quinone redox cycling to produce hydroxyl radicals, thereby decreasing holocellulose degradation and increasing ligninolytic selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aPhanerochaete sordida 3aamino acid sequences 3acomplementary DNA 3adecayed wood 3afungi 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alignin 3ametabolism 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3apolysaccharides 3areporter genes 3asequence homology 3auracil 3avanillin1 aKoyama, Genki1 aKawagishi, Hirokazu1 aHirai, Hirofumi0 tCurrent microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 73, no. 4 p.512-518dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-016-1089-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014100170300001400311520166000325592002801985650002202013650002002035650001002055650001402065650001302079650001502092650001602107650001302123650002402136650001902160650002102179650001402200650000902214650001402223653001602237653005102253653001502304653001502319653002302334653002602357653001502383700001802398700002002416700002302436773010102459856008602560852000902646655001202655IND60535720420221119103220.0190318e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053572042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Poi, Carole10aCryptic and biochemical responses of young cuttlefish Sepia officinalis exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of fluoxetine  ap. 36-45.  aAntidepressants released in the environment have the potential to generate neural disrupting effects in non-target organisms, yet their putative effects on behaviors have never been studied in cephalopod molluscs. This study assessed the impact of the antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) on the efficiency of cryptic behaviors (body patterns on uniform, checkerboard and sandy substrates), locomotor activity, and brain chemistry in young cuttlefish exposed to environmental concentrations (1 and 100ngL−1 of FLX) during the perinatal period. Behavioral responses of cuttlefish were monitored at hatching and two weeks later, and brain monoamine contents were quantified at one month of age. FLX significantly altered the camouflage efficiencies on uniform and sandy backgrounds only at the lowest concentration, but not at 100ngL−1. Hatchlings exposed to 1ngL−1 of FLX exhibited a duration exposure-dependent decrease in the uniform camouflage. They also showed a significant increase of the frequency of sand digging behaviors which might make them highly visible to predators in nature. When tested again two weeks later, cuttlefish seemed to have recovered and no more behavioral alterations were observed showing a transitory effect of the antidepressant. FLX did not affect the levels of serotonin, norepinephrine and their metabolites; however, it seemed to influence dopaminergic activity between the two FLX-exposed groups. The results show for the time that environmentally realistic concentrations of a single SSRI significantly impair the cryptic performances of newly hatched cuttlefish, and may ultimately reduce their chance for survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSepia officinalis 3aantidepressants 3abrain 3achemistry 3ahatching 3alocomotion 3ametabolites 3amolluscs 3anontarget organisms 3anorepinephrine 3aperinatal period 3apredators 3asand 3aserotonin 0aCephalopods 0aSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) 0aFluoxetine 0aCamouflage 0aLocomotor activity 0aSand digging behavior 0aMonoamines1 aBidel, Flavie1 aDickel, Ludovic1 aBellanger, Cécile0 tAquatic toxicology.g2014 June, v. 151 p.36-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245006700129300001600196520180700212592002802019650001602047650001802063650001102081650000902092650001202101650001402113651001002127653001002137653001402147653001402161700002202175773014202197852000902339655001202348IND60757417320221122032427.0211124e20201203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075741732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNath, Sabita10aStatus of Rice Blast in Sundarban Region of West Bengal, India  ap. 166-171.  aSundarbans, the southern-most part of West Bengal under ‘Coastal and Saline Agro-ecological Zone’ and the largest delta on the planet is one of the most unique regions. The agrarians economy of sundarbans was primarily donomated by rice based farming system, where generally rice-rice-follow system has been practiced year after year. For better understanding of the rice blast disease scenario, survey was conducted in farmers’ fields of selected ten blocks of Sundarbans viz.Kakdwip, Namkhana, PatharPratima, Kultali, Joynagar-I, Basanti, Gosaba, Hingalganj, Sandeshkali-I, and Sandeshkhali-II during Kharif, 2016 and 2017 (July to November) and Rabi 2016-17 and 2017-18 (December to May) at growth stage 2 (Tillering), 4 (Booting), and 8 (Flowering) for leaf blast, and 9 (mature grain) for neck blast. Maximum leaf blast severity during Kharif season was observed at Hingalganj (23.81%) followed by Namkhana (23.56%) and Kultali (23.46%). Minimum leafblast severity was observed at Sandeshkali-I (17.38%). The maximum neck blast incidence was found at Namkhana (4.82%) and least was found at Sandeshkali-I (1.62%). During Boro season, it has been found that the leafblast severity was maximum and the mean PDI was 45.02 in Kakdwip. Next in order was Basanti with a mean PDI of 42.96% followed by Gosaba (42.18%). Minimum leafblast severity with a mean PDI of 31.75% was recorded in Hingalganj. Maximum incidence of neck blast was observed at Gosaba (20.44%) followed by Kakdwip (18.80%) and Basanti (18.43), while least incidence of neck blast was observed at Hingalganj (12.12%). This is a comprehensive attempt to know the present scenario of the disease in Sundarban region of West Bengal that will help to the researchers and extension workers for further progress of the works in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecology 3ablast disease 3aleaves 3arice 3asurveys 3atillering 3aIndia 0aBlast 0aW. bengal 0aIncidence1 aMondal, Bholanath0 tJournal of plant disease sciences.g2020 Dec. 03, v. 15, no. 2 p.166-171dAssociation of Plant PathologistwJournal:2104x0976-23887nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009900165300001600264520116300280592002801443650002501471650002101496650002701517650002701544650002901571650002601600650002601626650001401652650001001666650002001676650001901696650002101715650002301736650002901759650001301788650001501801650001901816700001701835700001701852700001801869700001801887700001801905773009101923856008102014852000902095655001202104IND60548974220221119001955.0160905e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054897422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-016-1092-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Heejeong10aAntibacterial Activity of Hibicuslide C on Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates  ap. 519-526.  aPseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium that is frequently related to natural resistance to many drugs. In this work, the inhibition of growth against P. aeruginosa and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA) isolated from patients at Kyungpook National University was confirmed for hibicuslide C, essential oil components from Abutilon theophrasti. Hibicuslide C has antifungal activity with membrane disruption and apoptotic response against Candida albicans. However, its antibacterial activity was not reported yet. Cells treated with hibicuslide C was showed that its antipseudomonal activity is related to gDNA fragmentation and damage by TUNEL and gDNA electrophoresis. Furthermore, hibicuslide C worked synergistically with fluoroquinolones and rifampicin against MDRPA regardless of the ATP-associated mechanism. The antibiofilm activity possessed sole-resulting tissue culture plate method; besides that, the antibiofilm activity of other antibiotics was supported in particular MDRPA. The essential oil components like hibicuslide C may have antipseudomonal activity and, furthermore, increase in bacterial antibiotic susceptibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbutilon theophrasti 3aCandida albicans 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantifungal properties 3aapoptosis 3adrugs 3aelectrophoresis 3aessential oils 3afluoroquinolones 3agrowth retardation 3amultiple drug resistance 3apatients 3arifampicin 3atissue culture1 aChoi, Hyemin1 aLee, Je Chul1 aLee, Yoo Chul1 aWoo, Eun-Rhan1 aLee, Dong Gun0 tCurrent microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 73, no. 4 p.519-526dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-016-1092-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008100172300001600253520129800269592002801567650002601595650002001621650001401641650001301655650001801668650002501686650002101711650001101732650001501743650002401758650001201782651001101794651001401805653001401819653002101833653002401854653002101878700001701899700002101916700002701937700002401964773008901988856008402077852000902161655001202170IND60603617420221119013900.0180716e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060361742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.01.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZingre, Kishor T.10aModelling of cool roof performance for double-skin roofs in tropical climate  ap. 813-826.  aDouble-skin roof is a popular passive cooling solution to curb heat gain into buildings and cool roof is another emerging solution. This study proposed a novel CRHT (cool roof heat transfer) model for double-skin roof which is able to model the heat transfers for a double-skin roof combined with cool roof. The CRHT model was validated against experiments performed in two identically-configured, naturally ventilated apartments in Singapore. CRHT predictions match with experimental measurements with reasonable accuracy. White-color cool coating on a flat double-skin roof reduces the daily heat gain by 0.21 kWh/m² (or 51%), resulting peak indoor air temperature reduction by 2.4 °C on a sunny day. Furthermore, thermal performance of cool roof is compared with double-skin roof using the CRHT model. In the roof setup of the current study, double-skin roof is about 6% more effective than cool roof in reducing annual heat gain into the apartment during day time. However, the extra insulation of double-skin roof hinders the heat loss during night time, ensuing cool roof is almost equally effective in reducing net annual heat gain. The proposed CRHT model is generally applicable to any climate conditions as demonstrated by applying it for Mediterranean climate of Athens, Greece.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aair temperature 3abuildings 3acoatings 3aheat transfer 3ainsulating materials 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aprediction 3aresidential housing 3atropics 3aGreece 3aSingapore 0aCool roof 0aDouble-skin roof 0aHeat transfer model 0aTropical climate1 aWan, Man Pun1 aWong, Swee Khian1 aToh, Winston Boo Thian1 aLee, Irene Yen Leng0 tEnergy.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 82 p.813-826dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.01.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245013200177300001400309520140800323592002801731650002401759650001301783650003201796650001701828650002001845650002001865650001901885650001301904650001401917650001101931650002301942650001101965650001201976650001201988650001302000653002402013653001402037653002302051653001402074653002302088700001902111700006202130700002502192773009702217856009002314852000902404655001202413IND60617635920221121082029.0210118e20190225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061763592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlveal, Katherine10aMorphofunctional characterization of the digestive system in the palm ruff larvae, Seriolella violacea under culture conditions  ap. 51-61.  aIn the present study, the histological changes and digestive enzymatic activity patterns are described during the larval development of palm ruff, Seriolella violacea from hatching up to 50 days after hatching (DAH). At hatching, the digestive tract consisted of an undifferentiated straight tube dorsal to the yolk-sac, which presented alkaline protease activity (trypsin and chymotrypsin) as well as amylase and lipase activities with similar patterns during larval development. At 20 and 23 DAH, histology of the stomach revealed a sac-like shaped organ, with an epithelium that began to differentiate in a cardiac and a pyloric region. Typical histological structures of a stomach were visible at 33 DAH with a concomitant pepsin activity. Gastric glands were clearly visible at 35 DAH, increasing in numbers up to 37 DAH, suggesting a functional stomach at this age. A significant increase in the specific activity of all enzymes including pepsin (except amylase) was observed between days 33–35 DAH, which suggests a complete maturation of the digestive system in S. violacea larvae. Total activity from all the different enzyme activities followed the same trend as the specific activity. Based on the results from this study it might be feasible to begin weaning this species at 35 DAH, thereby reducing the amount of live food in the current protocol used which initiates weaning 45 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSeriolella violacea 3aamylases 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3achymotrypsin 3adigestive tract 3aenzyme activity 3agastric mucosa 3ahatching 3ahistology 3alarvae 3alarval development 3apepsin 3atrypsin 3aweaning 3ayolk sac 0aSeriolella violacea 0aPalm ruff 0aEnzymatic activity 0aHistology 0aLarval development1 aSilva, Alfonso1 aLohrmann, Karin B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8781-56721 aViana, María Teresa0 tAquaculture.g2019 Feb. 25, v. 501 p.51-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245007700127300001600204520098700220592002801207650001101235650002801246650000901274650001401283650001001297650001101307650001301318650001201331651001001343653001701353653001301370653001401383653001301397653002101410700001601431700001501447773014201462852000901604655001201613IND60757417420221120171857.0211124e20201203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075741742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLad, R.

The marine spatial planning policies for mariculture in China since 1988 were divided into three periods: the production period, the integrated management period and the sustainable development period. The experience was analyzed accordingly and listed as follows: focusing on environmental issues, improving production quality and sustainable development in mariculture, application of diverse policy tools, and pre-event monitoring and post-event evaluation. Finally, we proposed prospects based on the formulation and implementation of MSP policies in the long run, such as improving policy implementation and regulations, supporting more stakeholders to engage in activities and developing long-term planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3aissues and policy 3amariculture 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aEvolution 0aMarine spatial planning policies1 aLi, Yu-Han0 tOcean & coastal management.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 196 p.105293-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1052933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245008400199300001800283520057500301592002800876650001600904650001400920650002000934650001400954650002200968650002200990650002101012650001501033650001701048653002201065653001501087653001201102653001601114653003001130700006001160773013901220856007801359852000901437655001201446IND60594957320221120110732.0180525e20180207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059495732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b165752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Weiqi1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4315-680910aLysosome Enlargement Enhanced Photochemotherapy Using a Multifunctional Nanogel  ap. 4343-4348.  aLarge lysosomes are susceptible toward rupture because of an increased membrane tension.

This research applied the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change vulnerability framework (LVI-IPCC) to estimate the climate vulnerability of small-scale fisheries in the Tam Giang – Cau Hai lagoon, Central Vietnam - recognised as the biggest brackish water lagoon in South East Asia. Mixed methods, including key informant interviews, group discussions and questionnaire surveys (N = 181), were applied to collect empirical data in two estuarine fishery communities of Loc Binh and Huong Phong communes, Thua Thien Hue province. Two important findings emerge from this analysis, (1) the overall results of this study indicate that livelihood strategies and availability of food are the most critical factors in determining livelihood vulnerability for the two surveyed communes in the TG-CH lagoon and (2) the LVI and LVI-IPCC are effective tools to assessing vulnerability at the community level. It is expected that the lessons learnt from this study will assist in designing future studies and help devise intervention strategies to reduce the vulnerability of small-scale fishery communities in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3abrackish water 3aclimate 3acoastal zone management 3adeveloping countries 3aestuaries 3afisheries 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3aquestionnaires 3arisk assessment 3asurveys 3aVietnam 0aEstuarine fisheries 0aClimate variability 0aLivelihood vulnerability index 0aEstuarine area 0aTam Giang 0aCau Hai lagoon1 aMomtaz, Salim1 aSchreider, Maria0 tOcean & coastal management.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 196 p.105302-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1053023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245014800163300001600311520087600327592002801203650002801231650002101259650001701280650001601297650001701313650002101330650001301351650001401364650001401378650001401392700002401406700002201430700002501452700002001477773013801497856007401635852000901709655001201718IND60671017420221119030429.0191002e20141203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067101742DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb01562b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalamà, Ilaria E.10aBiocompatible and biodegradable fluorescent microfibers physiologically secreted by live cells upon spontaneous uptake of thiophene fluorophore  ap. 151-158.  aLive cells can form multifunctional and environmentally responsive multiscale assemblies of living and non-living components. We recently reported the results of a unique approach to introduce supplementary properties, fluorescence in particular, into fibrillar proteins produced by live fibroblasts and extruded into the ECM. In this work, we demonstrate that the physiological secretion of fluorescent nanostructured microfibers upon the spontaneous uptake of the appropriate fluorophore extends to living cells derived by different tissue contexts. We also show that live cells seeded on fluorescent microfibers have a different fate in terms of the cellular morphology, cytoskeleton rearrangement and viability. These results suggest that the microfibers, which are biocompatible and biodegradable, can be used as multiscale biomaterials to direct the cell behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3acytoskeleton 3afibroblasts 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aproteins 3asecretion 3athiophene 3aviability1 aDi Maria, Francesca1 aD'Amone, Stefania1 aBarbarella, Giovanna1 aGigli, Giuseppe0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Dec. 3, v. 3, no. 1 p.151-158dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb01562b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024003200112040001800144100001900162245009000181300001600271500000900287520164200296592002801938650001301966650002001979650002501999650001902024650001902043650002002062650002702082650002502109650001302134650001802147650002202165650002302187650002302210650001402233700001902247773013602266852000902402856011102411856007902522961001302601655001202614IND4394515720221118221648.0191228e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439451572DNAL7 a10113/34202hdl7 a10.2136/sssaj2006.02442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallory, E.

We conducted an aerobic incubation to explore how soil amendment history affects the transformation and availability of recently added N. Soil was collected from plots under contrasting amended and nonamended soil management systems in a 13-yr cropping systems experiment. Nitrogen source treatments were: no added N (control), NH₄ ⁺ fertilizer (Fert), a net mineralizing manure (MManure), and a net immobilizing manure (IManure). Soil NH₄ ⁺ and NO₃ ⁻ concentrations were monitored for 282 d. A two-pool, first-order model with fixed rate parameters was fitted to the NO₃ ⁻ accumulation data. When no N was added, net mineralization in the historically amended soil was twice that in the historically nonamended soil, mostly due to differences in soil total N stocks. When N sources were added, NH₄ ⁺ consumption, net N mineralization, and estimated N pools were affected by both soil amendment history and N source, with a significant interaction between the two factors. Historically amended soil reduced the availability of recently added N relative to the nonamended soil. This reduction occurred in the active pool (N₁) for MManure and in the slow pool (N₂) for Fert. It appeared to be related to the timing of C availability. Future work modeling N availability should consider soil amendment history not only for its effects on soil N supply capacity, but also for its effects on the availability of recently added N sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3anitrogen 3asoil amendments 3anitrogen fertilizers 3amineralization 3aanimal manures 3asoil properties 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3acarbon sequestration 3acomposts 3agreen manures 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aagricultural soils 3astatistical models 3aequations1 aGriffin, T.

These data were used calculate three optical constants: absorption coefficient, k; scattering coefficient, s; and infinite reflectance, R∞. Youngest leaves had approximately 10% lower single leaf reflectance over the 750- to 1,350-nm WLI than the older lower leaves. Reflectance of the older leaves slowly but progressively increased 2 to 3% going from nodes 3 down to 6. Leaves were stacked to measure R∞. Youngest leaves had the lowest R∞ particularly over the 750- to 1,350-nm WLI. R∞ increased approximately 5% for older leaves from the 3rd node. R∞ increased at a slower rate for leaves from the 4th, 5th, and 6th nodes. Second-node leaves gave the lowest s over the entire 500- to 2,500-nm WLI; then s greatly increased for leaves from the 3rd node, followed by a smaller but progressive increase in s for leaves from nodes 4 to 6. Youngest leaves had the lowest k over the 500- to 750-nm visible range, the highest k over the 750- to 1,350-nmn earinfrared range and the lowest k above 1,350 nm. Absorption progressively increased in the visible range as leaves aged (nodes 3 to 6), and generally did so above 1,350 nm, but this pattern was inconsistent over the 750- to 1,350-nm WLI. Leaf water contents were positively correlated with thicknesses (r² = 95%), and each increased with aging going from node 2 down to 6. The absorption coefficient k was positively correlated with leaf water content over the 1,350- to 2,500-nm WLI. These results show that leaf age affects the interaction of light with cotton leaves (Gossypium hirsutum L.). As investigations of light interactions within plant canopies advance, more attention will need to be given to optical properties of leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3aPlant Science and Plant Products 0aplants1 aAllen, W.

Therefore, a field inventory, including 10 affected broiler flocks, nine corresponding broiler breeder flocks and five hatcheries, was carried out. The onset of clinical signs (lameness and increased mortality) started at about 2 weeks of age. The flock mortality varied from 3.1 to 8.1% at slaughter. Post-mortem lesions of broiler flocks were characterized by the occurrence of pericarditis/hydropericardium, arthritis and femoral head necrosis. Enterococcus cecorum was isolated from approximately 30% of the lesions. In the broiler breeders, E. cecorum was not isolated from any of the lesions. However, it was isolated from 31 out of 65 (47%) cloacal swabs, from two out of 65 (3%) oviduct samples, from one out 65 (1.5%) bone marrow samples and from two out of 25 (8%) blood samples. E. cecorum was not isolated from the air samples or dead-in-shell originating from the hatcheries involved. In total, 78 isolates were subjected to further typing by means of tRNA intergenic spacer PCR and confirmed as E. cecorum. The genetic relatedness of these cocci was subsequently studied using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The banding patterns of approximately 68% of E. cecorum isolates originating from parent stock flocks were clonal to one or more isolates of the same or other parent flocks. In contrast, isolates originating from their diseased offspring showed much greater genetic variation. Therefore, the vertical transmission of E. cecorum could not be demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus cecorum 3aair 3aarthritis 3ablood 3abone marrow 3abroiler breeders 3afemur 3aflocks 3agenetic variation 3ahatcheries 3aintergenic DNA 3ainventories 3alameness 3amolecular epidemiology 3amortality 3anecrosis 3apericarditis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aslaughter 3atransfer RNA1 aLandman, W.

Camouflage against predators seems to be the most relevant function of dynamic changes in skin colour of frogs, but key aspects such as the rate at which these changes occur, or the specific colour components involved are not completely clear. Whereas most research on the topic has been reported on tree frogs in laboratory conditions, studies in other anurans or in the field are much scarcer. Here we show a potentially plastic, adaptive response in coloration of common midwife toads, Alytes obstetricans, from a population of central Portugal, whose pigmentation varied with their natural backgrounds. Using quantitative image analysis, we compared hue, saturation and brightness of dorsal skin coloration of toads and the colour of the area of ground immediately around them. We found a positive correlation between coloration of toads and background colour for the three components of the colour. As well as other anuran species, A. obstetricans might adjust skin coloration to match the surrounding environment, thus benefitting from short-term reversible crypsis strategies against predators. A less supported hypothesis would be that toads accurately select matching backgrounds to improve concealment as an antipredatory strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlytes 3aHylidae 3aantipredatory behavior 3acolor 3afrogs 3aimage analysis 3alaboratory experimentation 3amimicry (behavior) 3apigmentation 3apredators 3atoads 3aPortugal 0aAlytes obstetricans 0aamphibians 0abackground matching 0acoloration 0acrypsis 0aphenotypic plasticity1 aOliveira, José Miguel1 aRedondo Villa, Alberto José1 aMárquez, Rafael,0 tAmphibia-reptilia.g, v. 37, no. 3 p.253-260dBrillwJournal:6284x0173-53737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685381-000030503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013000164300001800294520098800312592002801300650001401328650002001342650001701362650001501379650001501394650002601409650002201435650002001457653003801477653004501515653002201560653003901582653002301621700001801644700001801662700001301680700001801693700005401711773013901765856007801904852000901982655001201991IND60594957620180622000000.0180525e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059495762DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b165792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying-Nan10aEfficient Quantum-Dot Light-Emitting Diodes Employing Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters as Exciton Harvesters  ap. 7435-7441.  aUtilization of triplet excitons plays a key role in obtaining highly efficient quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs). However, to date, only phosphorescent materials have been implemented to harvest triplet excitons in QD-LEDs. In this work, we introduced a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter, 4,5-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phthalonitrile (2CzPN), doped into poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) as an exciton harvester in red QD-LEDs by solution processing. As a result, electrons leaking to the PVK layer will be trapped by 2CzPN to form long-lifetime TADF excitons in the 2CzPN:PVK layer, and then this harvested exciton energy can be effectively transferred to the adjacent QDs by the Förster resonance energy-transfer process. The fabricated red CdSe/CdS core/shell QD-LEDs show a maximum luminescence efficiency of 17.33 cd/A and longer lifetime. Our results demonstrate that the TADF sensitizer would be a promising candidate to develop highly efficient QD-LEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrons 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aharvesters 3aharvesting 3alight emitting diodes 3amaterials science 3aphosphorescence 0aquantum-dot light-emitting diodes 0athermally activated delayed fluorescence 0aexciton harvester 0aFörster resonance energy transfer 0asolution-processed1 aLiu, Yusheng,1 aYan, Min-Ming1 aWei, You1 aZhang, Qi-Lun1 aZhang, Yong1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7718-59450 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 28, v. 10, no. 8 p.7435-7441dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b165793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04083naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245014500213300001600358520232600374592002802700650001202728650002102740650001902761650002002780650002502800650002602825650001902851650002602870650001402896650001802910650001402928650001802942650001202960650001002972650001002982650001902992653002403011653001203035653002103047653003203068653003203100700002203132700006003154700005803214700002203272700002303294700002603317773009903343856009003442852000903532655001203541IND60617636220221121082005.0190318e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061763622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis, Diana B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1373-481810aEffect of Artemia inherent fatty acid metabolism on the bioavailability of essential fatty acids for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae development  ap. 264-271.  aThe aim of the present study was to determine the effect of Artemia metanauplii endogenous fatty acid (FA) metabolism in the actual availability of dietary essential fatty acids (EFA) for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae development. To this end, both Artemia metanauplii inherent radiolabelled FA metabolism and the Octopus vulgaris paralarvae FA metabolism, after being fed with Artemia metanauplii incubated with radiolabelled FAs, were determined. Metanauplii were incubated in tissue culture plates during 12 h, with 0.3 μM of a [1-14C]FA, including either 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6 (ARA), 20:5n-3 (EPA) or 22:6n-3 (DHA), added individually to separate wells as their potassium salts bound to bovine serum albumin. A total of 3600 one-day-old paralarvae were reared up to 24 h in order to ensure the ingestion of a minimum amount of the labelled Artemia. Paralarvae rearing was performed in 4 L cylinder conical tanks at a density of 25 paralarvae L−1. Labelled Artemia metanauplii were added to each paralarvae rearing tank according to a specific [1-14C]FA treatment. Artemia in vivo metabolism results showed a preferential catabolism of DHA, which was translated into (1) the lower incorporation of this FA into Artemia total lipids (TL); (2) the highest amount of de novo synthesis of shorter chain-length FAs, as a result of the β-oxidation of the original DHA substrate. The registered amounts of radiolabelled substrates incorporated into O. vulgaris paralarvae TL fed with labelled Artemia metanauplii were extremely low. Nonetheless, certain amount of intact [1-14C]ARA and [1-14C]EPA was recovered into octopus paralarvae TL and particularly into polar lipid classes, suggesting the possibility of using Artemia as a vehicle to provide ARA and EPA to octopus paralarvae without interfering their bioavailability for the de novo synthesis of phospholipids. On the other hand, and despite of the high amount of [1-14C]18:3n-3 incorporated into Artemia TL, the FAs with the highest esterification rate into Artemia TAG (18:3n-3 and DHA) were also the lowest incorporated into paralarvae TL. Therefore, the present results suggest that O. vulgaris paralarvae may have a potentially low capacity to metabolise dietary TAG, and so, Artemia may not be the most appropriate vehicle to provide DHA to paralarvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aOctopus vulgaris 3abeta oxidation 3abioavailability 3abovine serum albumin 3aessential fatty acids 3aesterification 3afatty acid metabolism 3aingestion 3aphospholipids 3apotassium 3aradiolabeling 3arearing 3asalts 3atanks 3atissue culture 0aArtemia metanauplii 0aIn vivo 0aLipid metabolism 0aOctopus vulgaris paralarvae 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aAcosta, Nieves G.1 aAlmansa, Eduardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1015-13341 aGarrido, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1592-48771 aAndrade, José P.1 aSykes, António V.1 aRodríguez, Covadonga0 tAquaculture.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 500 p.264-271dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245016700164300001400331520127200345592002801617650001901645650001801664650002401682650002501706650001601731650002901747650002201776650001501798650001201813650001801825650002001843650001001863650001801873650001901891650002201910650001301932650001601945650002101961650001501982650004301997650002802040650002502068653001502093653001802108653002102126653002002147653001402167700001602181700001402197700001602211700001502227773010102242856008602343852000902429655001202438IND60535720920221119103312.0190318e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053572092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Kai10aMolecular cloning of manganese superoxide dismutase gene in the cladoceran Daphnia magna: Effects of microcystin, nitrite, and cadmium on gene expression profiles  ap. 55-64.  aSuperoxide dismutases (SODs) are metalloenzymes that represent one important line of defense against oxidative stress produced by reactive oxygen species in aerobic organisms. Generally, waterborne pollutants caused by irregular anthropogenic activities often result in oxidative damage in aquatic organisms. The aim of this study was to molecularly characterize the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (Dm-MnSOD) in the waterflea, Daphnia magna, and evaluate the mRNA expression patterns quantified by real-time PCR after exposure to three common waterborne pollutants (microcystin-LR, nitrite, and cadmium). The results showed that the full-length Dm-MnSOD sequence consists of 954bp nucleotides, encoding 215 amino acids, showing well-conserved domains that are required for metal binding and several common characteristics, such as two MnSOD domains. The deduced amino acid sequence of Dm-MnSOD shared over 70% similarity with homologues from Bythograea thermydron, Dromia personata, Cancer pagurus, and Scylla paramamosain. Dm-MnSOD gene expression was up-regulated in response to exposure to the three chemicals tested. The overall results indicated that Dm-MnSOD gene is an inducible gene and potential biomarker indicating these pollutants in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCancer pagurus 3aDaphnia magna 3aScylla paramamosain 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic organisms 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3adose response 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amicrocystin-LR 3amolecular cloning 3anitrites 3anucleotides 3aoxidative stress 3apollutants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aCladoceran 0aAntioxidation 0aOxidative stress 0aEnzyme activity 0aBiomarker1 aZhu, Xuexia1 aChen, Rui1 aChen, Yafen1 aYang, Zhou0 tAquatic toxicology.g2014 Mar., v. 148 p.55-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245010700207300001600314520143700330592002801767650001301795650002301808650001501831650001901846700006401865773013301929856008102062852000902143655001202152IND60763326620221120045212.0220120e20220105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076332662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c087372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaman, Abhinav S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8472-092610aProviding Atomistic Insights into the Dissolution of Rutile Oxides in Electrocatalytic Water Splitting  ap. 922-932.  aThe stability and dissolution of rutile oxides such as RuO₂ and IrO₂ which are used as electrocatalysts for water splitting have long been the Achilles’ heel in the long-term operation of electrolyzers for sustainable production of hydrogen from water. In this study, using a combination of ab initio steered molecular dynamics, enhanced sampling, and ab initio thermodynamics, we investigate the surface stability and dissolution of three prominent electro(photo)catalysts for water splitting: RuO₂, IrO₂, and TiO₂ in the rutile phase. We provide an atomistic understanding of the dissolution process and establish possible dissolution paths for different oxides using the (110) surface as a prototype. Interestingly, we identify a distinct surface site specificity in the dissolution of the RuO₂(110) surface, with the coordinately undersaturated sites more prone to dissolution, whereas no such surface site specificity exists for the IrO₂(110) surface. In addition, our investigation of more complex dissolution mechanisms involving codissolution of the different surface sites on the RuO₂(110) surface reveals a hitherto unseen suppression of the dissolution of Ru from the bridge sites caused by the codissolving coordinately undersaturated sites. These findings provide routes to improving the stability and a path toward understanding the activity–stability conundrum in electrocatalytic water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen 3amolecular dynamics 3aprototypes 3athermodynamics1 aVojvodic, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5584-67110 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Jan. 05, v. 126, no. 2 p.922-932dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c087373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001400141245016000155506002800315520146200343592002801805506003701833650001501870650001101885650001001896650001001906650001301916650001201929650001501941650001801956650001901974650002101993650002602014651001402040653002102054653002402075653001202099700002102111700002302132773013002155856007602285852000902361655001202370IND60764457420221207082453.0200928e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076445742DNAL7 a10.5994/jei.17.1.332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasmiatun10aKeanekaragaman dan komposisi kumbang elaterid (Coleoptera: Elateridae) di kawasan hutan hujan tropis Taman Nasional Bukit Duabelas dan Hutan Harapan, Jambi  aResource is Open Access  a<p>Jambi province is one of the regions in Indonesia that has tropical rainforests with different landscape characteristics in each region. Tropical rainforests contain the highest biodiversity in the world and as a habitat for various types of flora and fauna, including elaterid beetles. Elaterid beetles have an important role as ecological bioindicators. The aim of this research was to study the diversity and species composition of elaterid beetle in two different landscape types. Insect sampling was carried out in Jambi Province on two tropical rainforest landscape, i.e. Bukit Duabelas National Park (TNBD) and Harapan Rainforest. Elaterid beetles were collected by canopy fogging method in the morning. Each landscape consists of four core plots and each core plot consist of three as subplot, total subplots observed in both landscape were 24 subplots. A total of 2069 individuals of elaterid beetles were collected, belonging to 6 subfamilies, 23 genera, and 59 morphospecies. The abundance of elaterid beetles was higher in Harapan Rainforest, while species richness was higher in TNBD landscape. Species dominant in two landscape consist to subfamily Agrypninae, belonging to genera <em>Adelocera </em>with morphospecies <em>Adelocera </em>sp.01.

Different parameters of various aspects including 6 linear, 12 areal and 7 relief parameters were found out in the environment of GIS. Standard methodology and formulae were applied as suggested by previous research workers in this study. Total area of the Mand river catchment is 5332.07 sq.km. in which WS7 has the maximum area of 943.68 sq.km. and WS2 has the minimum area of 179.56 sq.km. The stream order of watershed ranges from first to fourth order showing dendritic to sub-dendritic type drainage. High stream frequency values are observed in sub-watershed 6, 7, 9 and 11 which are accompanied with high relief and impermeable lithology. In sub-watershed 1, 2 and 4 the slope is relatively lesser and therefore yields less stream frequency value. In the study area, the values of mean bifurcation ratio vary from 2.25 to 6.44. Catchment with high form factors (sub-watershed 9, 10 and 12) experience higher peak flows of lesser duration, whereas elongated catchment with low form factors (sub-watershed 2, 6, 7 and 8) experiences lower peak flows of longer duration. Sub-watershed 7 (Re = 0.585) is most elongated among all sub-watersheds. High relief ratio in sub-watersheds 3 and 8 demonstrates quick time of concentration, more stream flow velocity and was highly prone to erosion than other subwatersheds. The present study shows that hydrological assessment based on SRTM DEM is more precise compared to other available techniques. This morphometric research analyse the watershed characteristics and helps to explain the Mand river catchment's hydrological behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigital elevation models 3adrainage 3alatitude 3alithology 3alongitude 3amorphometry 3arivers 3asoil 3astream flow 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3awater conservation 3aIndia 0aMorphometric analysis 0aSub- watersheds 0aRemote sensing 0aGeographic information system 0aWatershed delineation 0aSRTM-DEM1 aTripathi, Mahendra Prasad1 aKhalkho, Dhiraj1 aKumar, Aekesh0 tJournal of soil and water conservation in India.g2021 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.269-278dSoil Conservation Society of IndiawJournal:13627x2455-71457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2455-7145.2021.00035.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245012700168300001600295520212800311592002802439650004402467650001902511650002002530650002102550650001402571650002402585650001402609650001002623650001902633650001902652650001302671650002102684650002302705650001902728650002002747650001302767650001602780650001702796650001402813650002002827650002302847700001702870700002002887700002202907700001602929700002202945700001602967773009902983852000903082856005103091655001203142IND4462747920221119204626.0140410e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446274792DNAL7 a10.1080/03079457.2011.6260172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlkowski, A. A.10aBiochemical and physiological weaknesses associated with the pathogenesis of femoral bone degeneration in broiler chickens  ap. 639-650.  aFemoral bone degeneration has been recognized as an important cause of lameness in broiler chickens for many years, but the pathogenesis of this condition has not been completely elucidated. The current work presents comprehensive analyses of changes associated with femoral bone degeneration based on findings from gross pathology, histopathology, biochemistry, and synchrotron-based imaging techniques. Gross lesions were predominantly seen in epiphysis and metaphysis of the proximal femur, and infrequently in distal femur, but we did not observe gross lesions in the diaphysis. Bone fractures were observed occasionally, but the most common lesions involved separation of articular cartilage of the femoral bone head, with progressive erosions of the subchondral bone. In advanced cases, on histopathological examination, changes in femoral bone were indicative of chondronecrosis and osteonecrosis. Computed tomography revealed that the degenerative process involves loss of trabecular bone. The course of the lesion development in the mineralized matrix appears to be coupled with increased bone resorption associated with excessive proliferation of pathologically altered osteoclasts. Light microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and biochemical analysis provided consistent evidence that lowered protein content of the bone organic matrix is an integral component of femoral bone pathology, but these changes do not appear to be associated with excessive activity of matrix metalloproteinases. Taken together, our findings indicate that femoral bone degeneration is associated with structural changes occurring in both inorganic and organic matrix of the bone, but insufficiency in protein metabolism is most probably a primary aetiological factor in the natural history of femoral bone degeneration. However, it is important to stress that our findings do not negate the importance of bacterial infection in the evolution of this condition. Pathogens play a critical role in the progressive pathogenesis of this condition, which ultimately is manifested, in most instances, as femoral head necrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abone fractures 3abone resorption 3abroiler chickens 3acartilage 3acomputed tomography 3aepiphyses 3afemur 3ahistopathology 3aimage analysis 3alameness 3alight microscopy 3ametalloproteinases 3amineralization 3anatural history 3anecrosis 3aosteoclasts 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aprotein content 3aprotein metabolism1 aLaarveld, B.1 aWojnarowicz, C.1 aChirino-Trejo, M.1 aChapman, D.1 aWysokinski, T.

Three wild edible mushrooms species (Tricholoma equestre, Hydnum repandum, Lactarius deliciosus) are very abundant in the forests of Bizerte, North of Tunisia. The present work aims to evaluate the nutritional value of the mentioned mushrooms. Chemical composition (dry matter, crude protein, crude fats, total carbohydrates and ash), non volatile components content (soluble sugars, free amino acids) and minerals and trace elements (Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cu, Fe, Zn) were determined. A comparative essay with Agaricus bisporus (commercial species) was investigated. All studied wild edible mushrooms revealed that these species are rich sources of proteins (14.10–18.09 g/100 g dry weight) and low content of fats (3.35–8.35 g/100 g dry weight). The highest energetic contribution was observed by H. repandum (1615.40 kJ/100 g dry matter). However, L. deliciosus showed the highest concentration of essential amino acids (21.20 mg/g dry weight) and revealed the highest concentrations of carbohydrates (67.46 g/100 g dry weight). Mannitol and trehalose were the most abundant polyol and sugar. Potassium (K) and sodium (Na) are the most abundant minerals in analyzed samples. H. repandum showed the highest concentrations of K and Na (28052.05 and 5365.99 µg/g dry weight, respectively). The wild Tunisian mushroom species showed a high nutritional quality and prove to be excellent foods for low caloric diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aHydnum repandum 3aLactarius deliciosus 3aTricholoma 3acalcium 3acopper 3acrude fat 3acrude protein 3aessential amino acids 3aforests 3afree amino acids 3airon 3alipids 3amagnesium 3amannitol 3aminerals 3anutritive value 3apotassium 3aproteins 3asodium 3atrehalose 3avolatile compounds 3awild edible mushrooms 3azinc 3aTunisia1 aAyoub, Imen Kacem1 aPhilippe, Thonart1 aBouzouita, Nabiha0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2017 Dec., v. 11, no. 4 p.2069-2075dSpringer USx2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-017-9590-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245010800181300001400289520134600303592002801649650002101677650001301698650001301711650001001724650001001734650003001744650002101774650002101795650001401816650001401830651001701844651001301861700001701874773009701891856005101988852000902039655001202048IND50074967920221123013011.0140410e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007496792DNAL7 a10.1080/03079457.2011.6319822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan der Westhuizen, W.

These E. coli strains contain various virulence genes which grant the bacteria the ability to proliferate in the poultry host and cause disease. Many genes which can contribute to virulence have been identified and can be used to screen E. coli strains to infer pathogenicity and aid in the identification and classification of APEC. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction methods were designed and optimized to rapidly detect 18 different virulence genes in E. coli strains that were isolated in South Africa and Zimbabwe from various sources, including from chickens showing signs of colibacillosis. Virulence gene profiles were constructed for each E. coli isolate from the multiplex data for the comparison of the colibacillosis isolates with the other isolates. The South African E. coli isolated from chickens with signs of colibacillosis showed higher virulence gene prevalence in comparison with the Zimbabwean and other samples except those isolated from chicken faeces. The multiplex polymerase chain reaction designed in the present study successfully screened E. coli isolates for various APEC-related virulence genes, including genes recently described in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3achickens 3afeces 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apoultry diseases 3apoultry industry 3ascreening 3avirulence 3aSouth Africa 3aZimbabwe1 aBragg, R.

Moisture stress at any stage of growth lowered wheat pastry flour quality. Moistures tress at the jointing stage resulted in a decrease in flour yield and an increase in flour protein, viscosity, and mixing curve area. Moisture stress at flowering resuited in an increase in flour protein, viscosity, and mixing curve area. Moisture stress at the dough stage decreased flour yield and increased flour protein, mixing curve peak, and mixing curve area. Increases in viscosities and mixing curve areas of flour from grain from stressed plants were due to the increases in flour protein content. Changes in the alkaline water retention capacity and mixing curve peak values were not related to changes in protein content and must be due to other factors resulting from moisture stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3aPlant Science and Plant Products 0aplants1 aBarmore, M.

A corporate house (SRF LTD) established their chemical plant in this block and adopted 35 villages around the plant and funded a natural resources management project with the help of an NGO. In the period from 2006–07 to 2015–16, 206 earthen dams were constructed across gullies emerging from the nearby Aravali hills for rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge. As the water crises deepened in spite of water harvesting, the long term hydrological data generated was reviewed and formed the basis of this paper. A decreasing trend in the yearly rainfall was observed. The cumulative groundwater recharge by 206 dams localy called Paals was 2832.51ha.m from 2006–07 to 2020–21, while the cumulative extraction by the SRF plant was 2307.15 ha.m. However, the data of 44 observation wells selected in the vicinity of dams revealed a consistent drop varying from 3 to 8 meters in all the wells and fifty percent study wells went dry in this period in spite of intensive rainwater harvesting. Out of 2006 reservoirs, 65 fed by smaller catchments stopped storing any water as the private lands above the dams were leveled and only 141 reservoirs were receiving variable amount of runoff. As a result, the runoff contributing area of 8942.33ha in 200607 was reduced to7480.45ha. This situation raised a question mark on the sustainability of irrigated agriculture with no other source of recharge except rains. From the analysis of emerging issues of ground water depletion, it emerged that there is no scope of constructing more dams as suitable sites have been exhausted. Secondly, the reversion from wheat, cotton and vegetable crops to traditional Pearl Millet-Mustard looked improbable because of their better economic returns. As regards the option of efficient use of available water, more than 85 percent of best lands were already sprinkler irrigated. The deposition of fine silt layer on the surface choked the reservoirs resulting in prolonged storage with more loss of water as evaporation and reduced share of percolation which recharged the aquifer. At the end of the day, it was decided that Paals should be de-silted to augment the ground water recharge. Nine typical reservoirs were de-silted in last two years. The percolation rates varied from 2.77 to 13.71cm/day before and increased from 10.0 to 25.14cm/day after de-siltation with overall mean increasing from 7.08 to 16.29 cm/day across the nine de-silted Paals. The ground water recharge increased from 7.721 to 9.311 ha.m but the overall evaporation loss decreased from 12.23 to 5.36 percent after de-siltation. As a result of these positive results, a regular program of reservoir de-siltation has been initiated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aclimate 3acotton 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aevaporation 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrologic data 3airrigated farming 3arain 3arunoff 3asilt 3astorage time 3avegetables 3awater shortages 3awater table 3awheat 3aIndia 0aAravali hills 0aHydrological studies 0aRainwater harvesting 0aGroundwater depletion 0aDesiltation of reservoirs0 tJournal of soil and water conservation in India.g2021 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.301-311dSoil Conservation Society of IndiawJournal:13627x2455-71457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2455-7145.2021.00040.03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014000169300001600309520191600325592002802241650001802269650001102287650001202298650001802310650001302328650001102341650001702352650001502369650001602384653003402400653002902434653002402463653002302487653002202510700001702532700002102549700001402570700001302584773008902597856008402686852000902770655001202779IND60603618420221119013650.0180716e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060361842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.01.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorabi, Mohsen10aHeat transfer and entropy generation analyses in a channel partially filled with porous media using local thermal non-equilibrium model  ap. 922-938.  aPrecise prediction of thermal processes is one of the major concerns in the field of heat transfer and within energy research communities. It has been proven that using LTE (local thermal equilibrium) conditions within a porous medium may give researchers erroneous data. From another point of view, the entropy generation which is directly related to the loss of available work within a system, is in the core of energy associated analyses. This work investigates temperature distribution, Nusselt number, and local and total entropy generation rates within a channel partially filled with porous medium using LTNE (local thermal non-equilibrium) conditions. The lower wall of the channel is exposed to a constant heat flux and the upper wall is assumed in the adiabatic condition. Viscous dissipation effects are incorporated into the energy equations. Rigorous analytical solutions are obtained for the velocity and temperature fields. Incorporating the achieved formulas into certain formulations, Nusselt number, and local and total entropy generation rates are obtained and plotted. Similar to previous publications [Int. J. Heat Mass Transf. 2011;54:5286–97. Transp. Porous Media 2012;96:169–72. J. Heat Trans. 2011;133:052602], some bifurcation phenomena for temperature field and Nusselt number are reported. Moreover, for the first time, a bifurcation phenomenon regarding the entropy generation rate is reported. Comprehensive discussion regarding effects of some thermophysical parameters such as porous thickness, Biot number, Brinkman number, Peclet number and some other parameters on the velocity, temperature, Nusselt number and entropy generation rates is provided. Due to the broad applications of the fundamental studied geometry in this work and, more importantly, the importance of LTNE model in a porous medium, these findings are useful for both industries and scientific researches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPeclet number 3aenergy 3aentropy 3aheat transfer 3aindustry 3amodels 3aporous media 3aprediction 3atemperature 0aLocal thermal non-equilibrium 0aPorous–fluid interface 0aViscous dissipation 0aEntropy generation 0aForced convection1 aZhang, Kaili1 aYang, Guangcheng1 aWang, Jun1 aWu, Peng0 tEnergy.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 82 p.922-938dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.01.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024003700112040001800149100001700167245012000184300001800304500000900322520172100331592002802052650001602080650001302096650001602109650001402125650002302139650002302162650002302185650002702208650001302235650002202248650001502270650002502285650001002310650001102320650002802331650002102359650002202380650001502402650001902417650002602436651001302462700001602475700001702491700001902508773012302527852000902650856011102659856008402770961001302854655001202867IND4388406220221123045245.0191228e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438840622DNAL7 a10113/74282hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2005.11.04292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerro, C.

Merr.] plants. Partial resistance and field tolerance in 14 commercial glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] tolerant soybean cultivars with the Rps1k resistance gene were studied. Partial resistance to compatible P. sojae races 28 and 30 was evaluated by the agar layer technique. Relative to the percentage of the control, all of the commercial cultivars with the Rps1k had reductions in top mass and plant height that were not significantly different from the partial resistant check ‘Conrad’ that had 83% top mass and 77% plant height reduction; two of the 14 commercial cultivars had significantly lower root mass (28 and 31% lower) than Conrad (84%). In addition, there was no significant difference in disease ratings (root or whole plant) of the 14 commercial cultivars with the Rps1k compared with Conrad. Field tolerance, studied in six field experiments at Urbana, IL, during 2002–2004, was identified when there were no significant differences between the yield of inoculated treatments with or without mefenoxam [methyl N-(methoxyacetyl)-N-(2,6-xylyl)-d-alaninate] fungicide seed treatment or between inoculated and noninoculated treatments. There were no significant cultivar × inoculation × fungicide treatment interactions found in any of the field experiments, and a significant cultivar × inoculation treatment interaction was found in only one field experiment. Therefore, most of the cultivars appeared to be tolerant to P. sojae It should be noted that field tolerance was not distinguished from partial resistance in the field component of this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3afield crops 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aPhytophthora sojae 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aroot rot 3agenetic variation 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3agenes 3aheight 3adry matter accumulation 3adisease severity 3adisease incidence 3afungicides 3aseed treatment 3afield experimentation 3aIllinois1 aHill, C.

The crop water requirements to irrigate 5.196 ha area was 9596.94 m³ during the crop period. Therefore, with the available resources to attain maximum yields operation schedules are planned according to the available water. So the rest of the water which is being pumped every day can be shared by the group of farmers so that their crop yields can be improved in an area of 31.575 ha.

We demonstrate protic ionic liquids (PILs) as effective p-dopant in both polymeric and small molecule OSs. In particular, we show that PILs promote single electron oxidation, which increases the hole concentration in the semiconducting film. The illustrated PIL-doping mechanism is compatible with materials processed by solution and is stable in air. We report the use of PIL-doping in hybrid solar cells based on triarylamine hole transporting materials, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). We show improved power conversion efficiency by replacing lithium salts, typical p-dopants for spiro-OMeTAD, with PILs. We use photovoltage–photocurrent decay and photoinduced absorption spectroscopy to establish that significantly improved device performance is mainly due to reduced charge transport resistance in the hole-transporting layer, as potentiated by PIL-doping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aionic liquids 3alithium 3aoxidation 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asalts 3asemiconductors 3aspectroscopy1 aHollman, Derek

EFA is a crucial phenomenon in terms of electricity production and sustaining river integrity simultaneously. The novelty of this study is that it consists both a comparison of widely used preferred EFA methods and a detailed investigation of the river with pre and post-dam flow regimes. The research shows that by expanding the content and scope of the methods, their relative reliabilities increase. However, this situation requires much more expert, money, and time. Apart from most of the relevant literature, pre and post-dam situations are investigated with a flow duration curve (FDC). It is concluded that the dramatic difference between the flow characteristics of pre and post-dam situations affects long-term aquatic life. Furthermore, a case study is conducted using the selected hydrological flow assessment methods, Tennant and Tessman methods, and comparisons are made. The calculated flows are compared with monthly average flow values before dam construction, projected environmental flow data, and the current situation. Accordingly, Tennant’s “good classification” is proposed to determine the environmental flow (EF) for the considered case study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aelectricity generation 3arivers 3arunoff 3awater power1 aDönmez, Aydın Hacı1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2764-56561 aYumurtacı, Zehra0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Dec., v. 190, no. 12 p.722-722dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-7107-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009200169520154700261592002801808650001601836650001801852650001701870650002201887650002201909650001601931653000801947653001001955653001101965653002201976653001301998653001602011653001702027700001502044700001402059700001502073700001502088773009602103856008502199852000902284655001202293IND60651090320221120180940.0190718e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065109032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2019.1013092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xuemeng10aLack of conflict during food choice is associated with the failure of restrained eating  aRestrained eaters tend to sustain a restriction in caloric intake to lose or maintain body weight; however, only a few restrained eaters can achieve the goal of restricting their caloric intake to lose or maintain body weight. Those who are effective restrained eaters habitually adhere to their intentions to avoid eating certain palatable foods, whereas those who are ineffective restrained eaters are generally unable to translate their intentions into behavior. To restrain eating regardless of temptation, an individual must first identify potential conflicts between achieving restrained eating and temptation to eat. Regarding food selections, the association between a lack of conflict between temptation, eating enjoyment, and weight loss or maintenance goals and the failure of restriction of caloric intake remains unknown. The present study used an eye-tracking technique to assess the degree of conflict experienced by effective and ineffective restrained eaters during food choice. Participants were required to choose between pairs of high- and low-calorie foods. The results showed that choosing the low-calorie food was associated with the experience of more conflict, measured by longer response times and more gaze switches, than choosing the high-calorie food. Ineffective restrained eaters experienced less conflict, exhibiting shorter response times and fewer gaze switches, than did effective restrained eaters, which suggests that a failure to restrain eating might be associated with a lack of experience of conflict.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3aenergy intake 3afood choices 3ahigh energy foods 3alow calorie foods 3aweight loss 0aREs 0aE-REs 0aIE-REs 0aRestrained eaters 0aConflict 0aFood choice 0aEye movement1 aLuo, Yijun1 aLiu, Yong1 aYang, Chao1 aChen, Hong0 tEating behaviors.g2019 Aug., v. 34 p.101309-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2019.1013093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013100164300001400295500001500309520076700324592002801091650001401119650002801133650002001161650004201181650001901223650002301242650002201265650003101287650002001318653003401338653001601372653004201388653001001430653001901440700001501459700001501474700001401489700001801503773013501521856008301656852000901739655001201748IND60542726720221122053952.0190405e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054272672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2014.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, ZhiGuo10aIdentification of genes associated with phytoplasma resistance through suppressive subtraction hybridization in Chinese jujube  ap. 43-48.  a2019-12-06  aJujube witches' broom (JWB) is a destructive disease for Chinese jujube caused by phytoplasma.

Reversing this trend is a primary management objective but doing so depends on understanding what keeps reefs in desirable states (ie “functional”). Although there is evidence that coral reefs thrive under certain conditions (eg moderate water temperatures, limited fishing pressure), the dynamic processes that promote ecosystem functioning and its internal drivers (ie community structure) are poorly defined and explored. Specifically, despite decades of research suggesting a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across biomes, few studies have explored this relationship in coral reef systems. We propose a practical definition of coral reef functioning, centered on eight complementary ecological processes: calcium carbonate production and bioerosion, primary production and herbivory, secondary production and predation, and nutrient uptake and release. Connecting research on species niches, functional diversity of communities, and rates of the eight key processes can provide a novel, quantitative understanding of reef functioning and its dependence on coral reef communities that will chart the transition of coral reefs in the Anthropocene. This will contribute urgently needed guidance for the management of these important ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthropocene epoch 3abioerosion 3acalcium carbonate 3acommunity structure 3acoral reefs 3aecological footprint 3aecosystems 3afunctional diversity 3aherbivores 3aniches 3anutrient uptake 3apredation 3aprimary productivity 3asecondary productivity 3awater temperature1 aRasher, Douglas B.,1 aCôté, Isabelle M1 aCasey, Jordan M1 aDarling, Emily S1 aLefcheck, Jonathan S1 aDuffy, J Emmett0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2019 Oct., v. 17, no. 8 p.445-454dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.20883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245008200207300001600289520131800305592002801623650001701651650001401668650001101682650001301693650001101706650002601717650001001743773013001753856008201883852000901965655001201974IND60623921420221121053059.0200331e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062392142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10739-018-9539-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovember, Joseph1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7896-864X10aMore than Moore’s Mores: Computers, Genomics, and the Embrace of Innovation  ap. 807-840.  aThe genomics community has frequently compared advances in sequencing to advances in microelectronics. Lately there have been many claims, including by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), that genomics is outpacing developments in computing as measured by Moore's law – the notion that computers double in processing capability per dollar spent every 18-24 months. Celebrations of the “$1000 genome” and other speed-related sequencing milestones might be dismissed as a distraction from genomics' slowness in delivering clinical breakthroughs, but the fact that such celebrations have been persistently encouraged by the NHGRI reveals a great deal about the priorities and expectations of the American general public, the intended audience of the genomics–computing comparison. By delving into the history of speculative thinking about sequencing and computing, this article demonstrates just how much more receptive to high-risk/high-payoff ventures the NIH and the general public have become. The article also provides access to some of the roots and consequences of the association of “innovation talk” with genomics, and the means to look past that association to the less glamorous (but arguably much more important) contributions of the NHGRI to building the field of genomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acelebrations 3acomputers 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aresearch institutions 3aroots0 tJournal of the history of biology.g2018 Dec., v. 51, no. 4 p.807-840dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3996x0022-50107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10739-018-9539-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245015300177520147400330592002801804650001101832650001201843650001401855650002101869650001201890650001301902650002401915653002401939653002701963700002701990700001802017700001802035700002402053773009602077856008502173852000902258655001202267IND60651090420221120180941.0190725e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065109042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2019.1013082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspel-Huynh, Hallie M.10aMediating role of experiential avoidance in the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and eating disorder psychopathology: A clinical replication  aThis study sought to examine whether anxiety sensitivity was associated with eating disorder (ED) symptom severity among patients with severe EDs, and to determine whether this relationship was mediated by experiential avoidance.Adolescent and adult females (N = 625) seeking residential ED treatment completed self-report measures of anxiety sensitivity, experiential avoidance, and ED psychopathology. Linear regression evaluated the cross-sectional association between ED symptom severity and three dimensions of anxiety sensitivity (social, physical, and cognitive). Regression-based mediation analysis with bootstrapping tested the associations among the three dimensions of anxiety sensitivity and ED symptom severity through experiential avoidance.The social dimension of anxiety sensitivity was positively associated with severity of ED psychopathology. Experiential avoidance mediated this association.ED symptoms in this sample were more severe among patients who endorsed greater concern about appearing nervous or anxious to others. The current results indicate that this relationship was driven by a tendency to avoid experiences that evoke emotional discomfort. If replicated, these findings suggest that targeting both social anxiety sensitivity and experiential avoidance may improve ED treatment outcomes. Further study of the mechanistic relationships among social anxiety sensitivity, experiential avoidance, and ED psychopathology, is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanxiety 3acognition 3aeating disorders 3afemales 3apatients 3aregression analysis 0aAnxiety sensitivity 0aExperiential avoidance1 aMuratore, Alexandra F.1 aVirzi, Nicole1 aBrooks, Gayle1 aZandberg, Laurie J.0 tEating behaviors.g2019 Aug., v. 34 p.101308-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2019.1013083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012400169300001400293520067900307592002800986650002301014650001901037650001301056650001401069650001401083650001001097650001801107650001401125650001101139650001601150653002101166653001601187653002801203653001501231700005901246773013501305856008301440852000901523655001201532IND60542726820221122053946.0190405e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054272682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2014.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOszmiański, Jan10aInfluence of cherry leaf-spot on changes in the content of phenolic compounds in sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) leaves  ap. 28-34.  aCherry leaf spot, caused by the fungus Blumeriella jaapi (Rehm) var.

Their intra- and inter-subtype neutralization sensitivity to autologous and heterologous plasmas has not been well studied. RESULTS: Twelve HIV-1 B’ clinical isolates obtained from patients were tested for their intra- and inter-subtype neutralization sensitivity to the neutralization antibodies in the plasmas from patients infected by HIV-1 B’ and CRF07_BC subtypes, respectively. We found that the plasmas from the HIV-1 B’-infected patients could potently neutralize heterologous viruses of subtype B’ with mean ID50 titer (1/x) of about 67, but they were not effective in neutralizing autologous viruses of subtype B’ with mean ID50 titer (1/x) of about 8. The plasmas from HIV-1 CRF07_BC-infected patients exhibited weak inter-subtype neutralization activity against subtype B’ viruses with ID50 titer (1/x) is about 22. The neutralization sensitivity of HIV-1 B’ isolates was inversely correlated with the neutralizing activity of plasmas from HIV-1 B’-infected patients (Spearman’s r = −0.657, P = 0.020), and with the number of potential N-glycosylation site (PNGS) in V1-V5 region (Spearman’s r = −0.493, P = 0.034), but positively correlated with the viral load (Spearman’s r = 0.629, P = 0.028). It had no correlation with the length of V1-V5 regions or the CD4+ T cell count. Virus AH259V has low intra-subtype neutralization sensitivity, it can be neutralized by 17b (IC₅₀: 10μg/ml) and 447-52D (IC₅₀: 1.6μg/ml), and the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in plasma AH259P are effective in neutralizing infection by the primary HIV-1 isolates with different subtypes with ID50 titers (1/x) in the range of 32–396. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the HIV-1 subtype B’ viruses may mutate under the immune pressure, thus becoming resistant to the autologous nAbs, possibly by changing the number of PNGS in the V1-V5 region of the viral gp120. Some of primary HIV-1 isolates are able to induce both intra- and inter-subtype cross-neutralizing antibody responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3acorrelation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apatients 3aviral load 3aviruses 3aChina1 aSun, Jianping1 aHuang, Yang1 aLu, Lu1 aXu, Weisi1 aHu, Xintao1 aHong, Kunxue1 aJiang, Shibo1 aShao, Yiming1 aMa, Liying0 tVirology journal.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.10-10dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-10-103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011500166300001800281500001900299520161500318592002801933650002901961650002001990650001402010650002002024650001802044650001402062650001702076650001302093650001102106650001402117650001102131650002102142700002002163700002202183700002102205773013602226856004802362852000902410655001202419IND6036560720221120181823.0210726e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603656072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-011-0497-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitt, Claudia10aSediment contact test with Potamopyrgus antipodarum in effect-directed analyses—challenges and opportunities  ap. 1398-1404.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND AND SCOPE: Effect-directed analysis is increasingly used for the identification of key toxicants in environmental samples and there is a growing need for in vivo biotests as diagnostic tools. Within this study, we performed an in vivo sediment contact test, applicable on both native field samples and their extracts or fractions, in order to be able to compare the results from both field and laboratory studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sediment contact test with the prosobranch snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, was carried out on extracts and fractions of field sediments from three European river basins. The results were compared with previous results of the native field samples. RESULTS: In contrast to the native sediments, the extracts of the samples led to an overall decrease in reproduction. Even the chosen reference sites had an adverse effect on the snails' reproduction. It appeared that a higher bioavailability in the organic extracts, together with a changing composition of compounds could have lead to this change in effects. The fractionation of the extracts partly led to a more differentiated picture, but the resolution was not high enough to see any distinct effects on the snails' reproduction. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the importance of the use of in vivo biotests and point out the relevance of bioavailability in native sediments. For further fractionation studies, a more realistic extraction procedure, together with a higher resolution fractionation, would be appropriate in order to separate individual bioavailable compounds more efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotamopyrgus antipodarum 3aadverse effects 3abioassays 3abioavailability 3afractionation 3apollution 3areproduction 3aresearch 3arivers 3asediments 3asnails 3atoxic substances1 aVogt, Christian1 aMachala, Miroslav1 ade Deckere, Eric0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2011 Sept., v. 18, no. 8 p.1398-1404dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-011-0497-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245008000152300002000232520091700252592002801169650002201197650002201219650001601241650001101257650001301268650000901281650002101290650001901311650002501330700001101355700001301366700001501379700001501394700001901409700001601428700001901444700001601463700001701479700001801496773013501514856007501649852000901724655001201733IND60538939620221122041346.0160815e20130911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053893962DNAL7 a10.1021/ja406351u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Min10aControlled Growth of Atomically Thin In2Se3 Flakes by van der Waals Epitaxy  ap. 13274-13277.  aThe controlled production of high-quality atomically thin III–VI semiconductors poses a challenge for practical applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy science. Here, we exploit a controlled synthesis of single- and few-layer In₂Se₃ flakes on different substrates, such as graphene and mica, by van der Waals epitaxy. The thickness, orientation, nucleation site, and crystal phase of In₂Se₃ flakes were well-controlled by tuning the growth condition. The obtained In₂Se₃ flakes exhibit either semiconducting or metallic behavior depending on the crystal structures. Meanwhile, field-effect transistors based on the semiconducting In₂Se₃ flakes showed an efficient photoresponse. The controlled growth of atomically thin In₂Se₃ flakes with diverse conductivity and efficient photoresponsivity could lead to new applications in photodetectors and phase change memory devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer hardware 3acrystal structure 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amica 3aphase transition 3asemiconductors 3avan der Waals forces1 aWu, Di1 aZhou, Yu1 aHuang, Wei1 aJiang, Wei1 aZheng, Wenshan1 aZhao, Shuli1 aJin, Chuanhong1 aGuo, Yunfan1 aPeng, Hailin1 aLiu, Zhongfan0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Sept. 11, v. 135, no. 36 p.13274-13277dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja406351u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03868naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245004600206300001400252500001500266506007600281520248200357592002802839506003702867650001402904650001002918650002502928650001302953650001502966650001102981650001102992650001403003650002203017650001203039650002403051650001303075650001503088650002503103650002003128650001403148650001203162653001803174773009203192856008103284852000903365655001203374IND4482976920221207123159.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448297692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbr.2011.01.0032doi7 aPMC30815902pmcid7 a215280152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeitman, Joseph10aMicrobial pathogens in the fungal kingdom  ap. 48-60.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe fungal kingdom is vast, spanning â¼1.5 to as many as 5 million species diverse as unicellular yeasts, filamentous fungi, mushrooms, lichens, and both plant and animal pathogens. The fungi are closely aligned with animals in one of the six to eight supergroups of eukaryotes, the opisthokonts. The animal and fungal kingdoms last shared a common ancestor â¼1 billion years ago, more recently than other groups of eukaryotes. As a consequence of their close evolutionary history and shared cellular machinery with metazoans, fungi are exceptional models for mammalian biology, but prove more difficult to treat in infected animals. The last common ancestor to the fungal/metazoan lineages is thought to have been unicellular, aquatic, and motile with a posterior flagellum, and certain extant species closely resemble this hypothesized ancestor. Species within the fungal kingdom were traditionally assigned to four phyla, including the basal fungi (Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota) and the more recently derived monophyletic lineage, the dikarya (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota). The fungal tree of life project has revealed that the basal lineages are polyphyletic, and thus there are as many as eight to ten fungal phyla. Fungi that infect vertebrates are found in all of the major lineages, and virulence arose multiple times independently. A sobering recent development involves the species Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis from the basal fungal phylum, the Chytridiomycota, which has emerged to cause global amphibian declines and extinctions. Genomics is revolutionizing our view of the fungal kingdom, and genome sequences for zygomycete pathogens (Rhizopus, Mucor), skin-associated fungi (dermatophytes, Malassezia), and the Candida pathogenic species clade promise to provide insights into the origins of virulence. Here we survey the diversity of fungal pathogens and illustrate key principles revealed by genomics involving sexual reproduction and sex determination, loss of conserved pathways in derived fungal lineages that are retained in basal fungi, and shared and divergent virulence strategies of successful human pathogens, including dimorphic and trimorphic transitions in form. The overarching conclusion is that fungal pathogens of animals have arisen repeatedly and independently throughout the fungal tree of life, and while they share general properties, there are also unique features to the virulence strategies of each successful microbial pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amushrooms 3aMucor 3akeratinophilic fungi 3aRhizopus 3aamphibians 3ayeasts 3amodels 3aflagellum 3asex determination 3aCandida 3asexual reproduction 3agenomics 3aMalassezia 3anucleotide sequences 3aChytridiomycota 3avirulence 3alichens 0aBasidiomycota0 tFungal biology reviews.g2011 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.48-60dElsevier Ltdx1749-46137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbr.2011.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002200186245015700208300001100365506007600376520203300452592002802485506003702513650001702550650001902567650001802586650002002604650001002624650002602634650001702660650001102677650002002688650001502708650002602723650001402749650001202763700002802775700002102803773010802824856008002932852000903012655001203021IND60120453020221207104626.0200625e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012045302DNAL7 a234252542pmid7 aPMC35990722pmcid7 a10.1186/1743-422X-10-612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourquain, Daniel10aComparison of host cell gene expression in cowpox, monkeypox or vaccinia virus-infected cells reveals virus-specific regulation of immune response genes  ap. 61.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Animal-borne orthopoxviruses, like monkeypox, vaccinia and the closely related cowpox virus, are all capable of causing zoonotic infections in humans, representing a potential threat to human health. The disease caused by each virus differs in terms of symptoms and severity, but little is yet know about the reasons for these varying phenotypes. They may be explained by the unique repertoire of immune and host cell modulating factors encoded by each virus. In this study, we analysed the specific modulation of the host cell’s gene expression profile by cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia virus infection. We aimed to identify mechanisms that are either common to orthopoxvirus infection or specific to certain orthopoxvirus species, allowing a more detailed description of differences in virus-host cell interactions between individual orthopoxviruses. To this end, we analysed changes in host cell gene expression of HeLa cells in response to infection with cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia virus, using whole-genome gene expression microarrays, and compared these to each other and to non-infected cells. RESULTS: Despite a dominating non-responsiveness of cellular transcription towards orthopoxvirus infection, we could identify several clusters of infection-modulated genes. These clusters are either commonly regulated by orthopoxvirus infection or are uniquely regulated by infection with a specific orthopoxvirus, with major differences being observed in immune response genes. Most noticeable was an induction of genes involved in leukocyte migration and activation in cowpox and monkeypox virus-infected cells, which was not observed following vaccinia virus infection. CONCLUSION: Despite their close genetic relationship, the expression profiles induced by infection with different orthopoxviruses vary significantly. It may be speculated that these differences at the cellular level contribute to the individual characteristics of cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia virus infections in certain host species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCowpox virus 3aVaccinia virus 3acell movement 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aleukocytes 3amicroarray technology 3aphenotype 3aviruses1 aDabrowski, Piotr Wojtek1 aNitsche, Andreas0 tVirology journal.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.61-61dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-10-613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01748naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245006400207300001600271500001900287520069800306592002801004650002301032650002501055650001001080650001701090650001601107650001801123700002001141700005801161773011101219856008301330852000901413655001201422IND60710904120221120122310.0210112e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071090412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2020.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParaiso, Ines L1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8796-670210aPotential use of polyphenols in the battle against COVID-19  ap. 149-155.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern.

Of the collision, attachment and aggregate stability aspects to the bubble-particle interaction, the crucial attachment process is least understood. This is especially true of hydrophilic solids. We review the current literature regarding each component of the bubble-particle attachment process, from the free-rise of a small, clean single bubble, to the collision, film drainage and interactions which dominate the attachment rate. There is a particular focus on recent studies which employ single, very small bubbles as analysis probes, enabling the dynamic bubble–hydrophilic particle interaction to be investigated, avoiding complications which arise from fluid inertia, deformation of the liquid–vapour interface and the possibility of surfactant contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3aaqueous solutions 3abubbles 3adeformation 3adrainage 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophilicity 3asurfactants1 aRalston, John0 tAdvances in colloid and interface science.g2011 Oct. 14, v. 168, no. 1-2 p.198-209dElsevier B.V.x0001-86867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cis.2011.08.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245010200165520139200267592002801659650001901687650002101706650002501727650001701752650001601769650001401785650000901799650001401808650004301822650001501865650001201880650002101892650001101913650003601924650002101960650001201981650003601993651001002029700002402039700002202063700001902085700003102104700003002135700002102165773011902186856007702305852000902382655001202391IND60745420020221116155941.0210723e20210714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074542002DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100716292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiberal, Ângela 10aPhytochemical and Antioxidant Profile of Pardina Lentil Cultivars from Different Regions of Spain  aLentils (Lens culinaris spp.) are an important food consumed worldwide given their high protein, fiber, mineral, and phytochemical contents, and can be used as a potential source of good nutrition for many people. With the purpose of valuing the Pardina variety, the quality brand from a protected geographical indication “Lenteja de Tierra de Campos”, a full assessment of the nutritional, chemical, and antioxidant properties of 34 samples from this variety was carried out. Besides its actual rich nutritional profile, three phenolic compounds by high performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array detection-mass (HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS) were identified (kaempferol derivatives) with slight differences between them in all extracts. Sucrose by high-performance liquid chromatography with a refraction index detector (HPLC-RI) and citric acid by ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode array detector (UFLC-PDA) were the major identified sugar and organic acid components, respectively, as well as α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol isoforms (HPLC-fluorescence). Additionally, all the extracts presented excellent antioxidant activity by the oxidative hemolysis inhibition assay (OxHLIA/TBARS). Briefly, Pardina lentils from this quality brand are a good source of nutritional and chemical components and should therefore be included in a balanced diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLens culinaris 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acitric acid 3acultivars 3adiet 3ahemolysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akaempferol 3alentils 3anutrient content 3apeople 3aprotected designation of origin 3arefractive index 3asucrose 3aultrafast liquid chromatography 3aSpain1 aFernandes, Ângela 1 aDias, Maria Inês1 aPinela, José 1 aVivar-Quintana, Ana María1 aFerreira, Isabel C.

These inhibitors of animal Na⁺, K⁺-ATPases also have medical uses in treating congestive heart failure and other diseases. However, despite extensive ecological research and centuries of use in both traditional and modern medicine, the complete cardiac glycoside biosynthesis pathway has yet to be elucidated in any plant species. To a large extent, this research deficit results from the fact that cardiac glycosides are produced exclusively by non-model plant species such as Digitalis that have not been amenable to the development of mutagenesis, cloning, and genetic mapping approaches. Recent advances in genome sequencing, transcript profiling, plant transformation, transient expression assays, and plant metabolite analysis have provided new opportunities for the investigation and elucidation of cardiac glycoside biosynthesis pathways. The genetic tools that have been developed for Brassicaceae, in particular Arabidopsis thaliana, may be directly applicable to Erysimum, a Brassicaceae genus that characteristically produces cardiac glycosides as defensive metabolites. We propose that Erysimum cheiranthoides (wormseed wallflower), a rapid-cycling, self-pollinating species with a relatively small, diploid genome, would be a suitable model system to advance research on the biosynthesis of cardiac glycosides in plants.  aPublisher supplied data  aPZ00P3-161472cSwiss National Science Foundation  aIOS-1645256cNational Science Foundation 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDigitalis 3aErysimum cheiranthoides 3aanimals 3abiosynthesis 3acardiac glycosides 3achromosome mapping 3adiploidy 3agenome 3agenomics 3aheart failure 3aherbivores 3amedicine 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3aself-pollination 3asequence analysis 3asodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase 3atranscriptomics1 aMirzaei, Mahdieh1 aJander, Georg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9675-934X0 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2018 Dec., v. 17, no. 6 p.1239-1251dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870073x1568-77677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-018-9562-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01250naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245006800155300001800223520031800241592002800559650002500587650002300612650002300635650000900658650001300667650001300680650002200693700001800715773011900733856007500852852000900927655001200936IND60550255520221118160413.0160910e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055025552DNAL7 a10.1021/jo50095422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVints, Inna10aFluorination of Flavones and Chromones Using Elemental Fluorine  ap. 7261-7265.  aFlavonoids are abundant micronutrients in our diet, possessing various biological activities.

In addition, there are several biotic and abiotic stresses which frequently encounter crop plants during various stages of life cycle, resulting in considerable yield losses. Environmental stresses, including drought, flooding, salinity, temperature (both low and high), high radiation, and xenobiotics induce toxicity, membrane damage, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced photosynthesis, and altered nutrient acquisition. Several indigenous defence mechanisms (physiological and molecular) are triggered in plants on exposure to environmental cues. Enhancement of resistance of crop plants to environmental stresses has been the topic of prime interest for agriculturalists and plant scientists since long. Development of water and salinity stress-tolerant crops through genetic engineering provides an avenue towards the reclamation of farmlands that have been lost due to salinity and lack of irrigation water/rainfall.

Here, the aim is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of industrial trans fatty acids. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hepa1‐6 hepatoma cells were incubated with elaidate, oleate, or palmitate. C57Bl/6 mice were fed diets rich in trans‐unsaturated, cis‐unsaturated, or saturated fatty acids. Transcriptomics analysis of Hepa1‐6 cells shows that elaidate but not oleate or palmitate induces expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Induction of cholesterogenesis by elaidate is mediated by increased sterol regulatory element‐binding protein 2 (SREBP2) activity and is dependent on SREBP cleavage–activating protein (SCAP), yet independent of liver‐X receptor and ubiquitin regulatory X domain‐containing protein 8. Elaidate decreases intracellular free cholesterol levels and represses the anticholesterogenic effect of exogenous cholesterol. In mice, the trans‐unsaturated diet increases the ratio of liver to gonadal fat mass, steatosis, hepatic cholesterol levels, alanine aminotransferase activity, and fibrosis markers, suggesting enhanced NAFLD, compared to the cis‐unsaturated and saturated diets. CONCLUSION: Elaidate induces cholesterogenesis in vitro by activating the SCAP–SREBP2 axis, likely by lowering intracellular free cholesterol and attenuating cholesterol‐dependent repression of SCAP. This pathway potentially underlies the increase in liver cholesterol and NAFLD by industrial trans fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data  cWageningen University  a2013T111cDutch Heart Foundation  a617376cERC  a016.176.643cNWO0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalanine transaminase 3abiosynthesis 3acholesterol 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3afatty liver 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3agonads 3ahepatoma 3aliver 3amechanism of action 3amice 3aoleic acid 3apalmitates 3asaturated fatty acids 3atrans fatty acids 3atranscriptomics 3aubiquitin1 aLoregger, Anke1 avan Weeghel, Michel1 aZelcer, Noam1 aKersten, Sander0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2019 Oct., v. 63, no. 19 p.e1900385-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2019003853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03578naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013700165300001400302520163800316592002801954650003701982650002002019650001002039650001502049650001202064650001602076650002102092650002302113650001002136650001002146650002202156650002802178650001102206650001902217650001102236650001902247650001402266650004302280650005202323650001302375653002302388653002402411653001802435653002802453653000802481653000802489653000802497653000802505653000802513653000902521653000802530653000702538653000802545700001502553700001402568700001102582700001902593700001202612700001602624700001302640773013502653856008302788852000902871655001202880IND60542727220221122204012.0190405e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054272722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2014.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Xinyuan10aActin dynamic polymerization is required for the expression of nonhost resistance in pepper against Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici  ap. 64-72.  aThe roles of the actin cytoskeleton in nonhost resistance of pepper inoculated with the non-pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) was studied at molecular and histological levels in a detailed time-course experiment. The expression patterns of three actin remodeling associated genes, Profilin, Actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) and Rho, were detected in inoculated pepper leaves by qRT-PCR. The actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin B was then applied to demonstrate the effects of actin depolymerization on different defense reactions. The results showed that the expression of Rho and Profilin was up-regulated significantly after the inoculation of Bgt. After the treatment with latrunculin B, the frequency of whole-cell H2O2 and papilla accumulation was significantly reduced, and the produce of H2O2 in infected cells and the deposition of papilla at fungal penetration sites were also suppressed. In addition, hypersensitive-response-like cell death (showing weak trypan blue staining and without visible epidermal cell deformation) was stimulated in the early stage of the incubation period and thereafter normal hypersensitive-response was suppressed. Moreover, the percentage of haustorial formation also had a dramatic increase in the early stage of the incubation period, and up to 53% germinating Bgt conidia were able to successfully penetrate the epidermis to form central haustorial bodies. These results strongly indicate that actin cytoskeleton is closely related to the nonhost resistance in pepper against Bgt, and actin polymerization is necessary for the expression of pepper nonhost resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3aCapsicum annuum 3aactin 3acell death 3aconidia 3adeformation 3adepolymerization 3adisease resistance 3afungi 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 3amicrofilaments 3apepper 3apolymerization 3aprofilins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 0aActin cytoskeleton 0aNonhost interaction 0aLatrunculin B 0aHypersensitive-response 0aADF 0aBgh 0aBgt 0aCAP 0aDAB 0aDMSO 0ahai 0aHR 0aPGT1 aLi, Hongli1 aHua, Yuan1 aYu, Ke1 aWalter, Monika1 aQi, Tuo1 aZhang, Bing1 aMa, Qing0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2014 Apr., v. 86 p.64-72dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2014.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011200164300001600276520110600292592002801398650000901426650002501435650001201460650001101472650001601483650002201499650001201521650001001533650002701543650001501570650001101585650002501596650000901621650004301630650001001673650001901683650002201702650002401724650001601748650001201764651001001776700001601786700001501802773009901817856008101916852000901997655001202006IND60574772820221120165134.0170728e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057477282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-016-0682-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.

In this study, six MsRan gene cDNA sequences were isolated from wild banana (Musa spp. AB group) from Sanming City, China. Sequence analysis reveals that MsRan3A, MsRan3A-1a, and MsRan3C contained Ran protein domains including a GTP hydrolysis domain, a RanGAP-binding domain, and an acidic tail, whereas two G boxes (G4 and G5) were absent in MsRan3A-6a. The physicochemical property of MsRan3A, MsRan3A-1a, MsRan3A-6a, and MsRan3C appeared to differ significantly. Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis indicates that MsRan3A-1, MsRan3A-5, MsRan3A-6, MsRan3A-6a, and MsRan3C-1 were expressed in roots, leaves, peduncles, bracts, flowers, peels, and pulp of the wild banana. MsRan3A-1a was expressed at extremely low levels in these tissues and was undetectable by qPCR. The MsRan genes were found to be involved in responses to a low temperature stress but with different response patterns. Furthermore, salicylic acid significantly enhanced MsRan gene expressions suggesting the involvement of these genes in salicylic acid signal transduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusa 3aalternative splicing 3abananas 3abracts 3acold stress 3acomplementary DNA 3aflowers 3agenes 3aguanosine triphosphate 3ahydrolysis 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3apulp 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atemperature 3atissues 3aChina1 aFang, Z.

Luchistaya) under adaptation to increasing water deficit. The duration of drought was 2, 3, 5, and 6 days. Withholding water from maize plants caused gradual increase in the intensity of water deficit: from mild (2 or 3 days) to moderate (5 days) and nearly severe (6 days) water stress. After 6 days, relative leaf water content decreased by 19.8% as compared to the control. On the second day after the onset of drought, slight reduction in the photosynthetic CO₂/H₂O gas exchange intensity of the treated plants was observed. After 6 days, photosynthesis and transpiration of leaves synchronously reduced almost threefold due to stomatal closure. The progressive soil drought had substantial impact on the carbohydrate metabolism. After 2 days of water deficit, the content of reducing sugars and sucrose increased slightly, whereas after 6 days, it increased ten and four times, respectively. After 2, 3, and 5 days of drought, the starch content declined slightly; however, under severe drought (6 days), it increased by 30% as compared to the control. Simultaneously with the increase in the content of soluble sugars, proline content increased significantly and it was the highest on the sixth day of drought. At all stages of water deficit, the proline content increased more significantly than the content of reducing carbohydrates and sucrose. Under increasing water deficit (5 and 6 days), the content of MDA was found to rise. At the initial drought stage (2 or 3 days) and under severe water deficit (6 days), no significant changes in the pigment content were observed. Thus, at the initial stages of progressive drought, in the leaves of this maize cultivar, a decline in photosynthetic activity proceeded simultaneously with accumulation of reducing sugars, sucrose, and proline. The results obtained showed that, at the first stages of adaptation of maize seedlings to drought, the changes in carbohydrate and proline metabolism have been observed, which have increased upon further plant dehydration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acultivars 3adrought 3agas exchange 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3aproline 3areducing sugars 3aseedlings 3asoil 3astarch 3astomatal movement 3asucrose 3atranspiration 3awater content 3awater stress1 aMaevskaya, S.

PPO-I was purified to 124-fold with 1.3% yield, while PPO-II was purified to 142-fold with a yield of 1.2%. The molecular mass of each isozyme was estimated to be 81 and 64 kDa for PPO-I and PPO-II, respectively, by SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH and temperature for both isozymes was pH 7.0 and 25 °C, respectively. Using catechol as a substrate, Km for PPO-I and PPO-II were 5 mM and 2.5 mM, respectively, while Vmax for PPO-I and PPO-II were 250 U and 500 U, respectively. In addition, induced PPO-II was found to possess laccase activity. Salicylic acid (1–10 μM) had no effect on PPO-I activity, whereas PPO-II/laccase activity increased by 20%. Differential inhibition of both the enzymes was observed by kojic acid, CTAB and sodium azide. Among the various PPO inhibitors tested, l-ascorbic acid, citric acid, l-cysteine, and sodium bisulphite were found to be potent inhibitors of PPO-II but not PPO-I. PPO-I is a constitutive isozyme, whereas PPO-II is a novel bifunctional isozyme associated with laccase activity and induced upon infection with Foc or treatment with SA. The role of these isozymes is discussed in the context of chickpea infected with Foc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri 3aascorbic acid 3acatechol 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3achickpeas 3acitric acid 3acysteine 3afungal diseases of plants 3agenotype 3aisozymes 3akojic acid 3alaccase 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolyphenols 3asalicylic acid 3asodium azide 3asodium bisulfite 3atemperature 0aChickpea 0aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri 0aLaccase 0aPolyphenol oxidase 0aSalicylic acid 0aABTS 0aPPO-I 0aCTAB 0aPPO-II 0aFoc 0aSA1 aJayalakshmi, S.K.1 aMulimani, V.H.1 aSreeramulu, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8773-15560 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2014 Apr., v. 86 p.73-80dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2014.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009300161300001600254520136500270592002801635650001601663650002001679650001601699650001601715650001001731650003101741650001401772650001201786650001401798650000901812650002101821650002101842650001301863700001401876700001101890700001401901700001601915700001401931700001501945773011401960856008102074852000902155655001202164IND60574911620221119041526.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057491162DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437170400452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, L.10aConstitutive down-regulation of SiSGR gene is related to green millet in Setaria italica  ap. 608-615.  aMillet colour is an important index to evaluate the quality of dehulled foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) Beauv.). Most varieties are yellow, due to the accumulation of carotenoids. However, there are some foxtail millet germplasms producing dark green millet. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the chlorophyll retention phenotype, Daqinggu with green millet colour and Jingu 21 with yellow millet colour were selected as research material in this study. The total carotenoid level in dehulled millet of Daqinggu was about 0.024 mg/g, and 0.038 mg/g in Jingu 21. The transcript levels of carotenoid structural genes were investigated at three stages of grain development in both millet varieties. The expression levels of carotenoid biosysnthesis-related genes SiPSY3, SiPDS, SiZ-ISO, SiLCYB and SiCYP97C were significantly higher in Daqinggu than in Jingu 21, which was not consistent with the difference in the carotenoid levels between these two varieties. Interestingly, SiSGR, a homologue to the STAY-GREEN gene in Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice, was constitutively down-regulated during maturation in Daqinggu. In addition, the total chlorophyll content was consistently higher in Daqinggu than in Jingu21 during grain maturation. These evidences suggest that SiSGR is a key gene in regulating chlorophyll retention for dark green foxtail millet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aSetaria italica 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3agene expression regulation 3agermplasm 3amillets 3aphenotype 3arice 3aseed development 3astructural genes 3atomatoes1 aZhang, B.1 aHe, L.1 aMa, F.

In a search for a biocontrol agent for V. parahaemolyticus and other pathogenic Vibrio species, a lytic phage VP06 was isolated from oyster using V. parahaemolyticus as the host. VP06 is a Siphoviridae phage with a polyhedral head and a long tail. The genome sequence of VP06 was 75,893 nucleotides in length and the G + C content was 49%; a total of 101 CDSs were identified in VP06, of which 39 exhibited functional domains/motifs. The genomic sequence of VP06 is similar to those of a lytic Vibrio vulnificus phage SSP002 and a temperate V. parahaemolyticus phage vB_VpaS_MAR10, although VP06 has distinct features in the CDS arrangement and 14 unique CDSs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that VP06, SSP002 and vB_VpaS_MAR10 belong to a novel genus cluster of Siphoviridae phages. This phage lysed 28.1% of various Vibrio strains, and the efficiency of plating method revealed that VP06 was highly effective in lysing strains of Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio azureus, Vibrio harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus. The properties of VP06, including its broad range of hosts and resistance to environmental stresses, indicate that it may be a candidate biocontrol agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiphoviridae 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3abacteriophages 3abiological control agents 3ahosts 3anew genus 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3aoysters 3aphylogeny 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0aLytic phage 0aGenome 0aSiphoviridae 0aBiocontrol1 aWang, Tzu-Yun1 aYang, Chu-Wen1 aTang, Chung-Tao1 aYing, Chingwen1 aWang, Junxiong,1 aChang, Wei-Hau0 tResearch in microbiology.g2019 Jan.,  Feb., v. 170, no. 1 p.13-23dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:11932x0923-25087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2018.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245007500180300001600255500001900271500000900290520159800299592002801897650001601925650001601941650001701957650001801974650002801992650001302020650001202033650001602045650002202061650001802083650002102101650002202122700002002144700001902164773012202183856009702305852000902402655001202411IND60663548520221123002910.0191122e197903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066354852DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1979.00021962007100020029x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahler, R.

The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of soil slope on yield and N₂ fixation by dry peas (Pisum sativum L.) in the field and to determine the effectiveness of isolates of Rhizobium leguminosarum taken from various slopes on N₂ fixation by peas in the greenhouse. From N₂(C₂H₂)-fixation rates conducted weekly in three positions of a Palouse catena; bottomland (Xeric Argialbolls) south slope, (Ultic Argixerolls), and ridgetop (Pachic Haploxerolls), total seasonal N₂(C₂H₂) fixed was estimated at 69, 22, and 17 kg/ha of N, respectively. For peas growing on the bottomland, south slope and ridgetop, plant N uptake was 210, 99, and 75 kg/ha of N, respectively. Pea seed yields of 2,106, and 480 kg/ha on the bottomland and ridgetop, respectively, were related to the amount of water depleted in the soil profile of 21.6 and 8.9 cm, respectively. Higher yield and greater N₂ fixation by peas growing on the bottom slope were apparently related to greater root penetration and removal of water. Greater plant N and dry matter were obtained in the greenhouse when peas were inoculated with isolates from the north slope when compared with isolates from other slopes. No differences were noted in pea growth and N2 fixation between isolates from the bottomland, south slope and ridgetop, which suggested that differences in N₂ fixation and yield observed in the field were not related to efficiency of the microsymbiot  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgialbolls 3aArgixerolls 3aHaploxerolls 3aPisum sativum 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aagronomy 3acatenas 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen fixation 3asoil profiles 3asoil temperature 3atopographic slope1 aBezdicek, D.

Tropical and subtropical regions are particularly conducive to the evolution of allelopathic survival strategies as the relatively constant temperatures and mild frost-free winters produce a hospitable year-round growing season. This allows for the proliferation of a large variety of species and leads to fierce competition for sunlight, nutrients, water and other resources. Allelopathy provides an advantage to invasive species allowing for increased competitiveness and fitness over native and agricultural species in a variety of different habitats. Herein, the diversity and known action mechanisms of allelopathic compounds with a focus on tropical and subtropical communities is reviewed. Furthermore, the current and future prospect of utilizing and developing these allelopathic chemicals as weed control options is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aHAW05033-HcUSDA-NIFA-Hatch 3aallelochemicals 3aallelopathy 3aevolution 3agermination 3agrowing season 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3anutrients 3areproduction 3asolar radiation 3asubtropics 3atemperature 3aweed control 3awinter1 aOwens, Daniel K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0745-78660 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2018 Dec., v. 17, no. 6 p.1225-1237dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870073x1568-77677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-018-9596-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245011700196300002000313506007600333520166100409592002802070506003702098650002902135650002102164650001402185650002202199650001602221700002402237700002302261700002002284700001902304773013502323856007502458852000902533655001202542IND60538940120221207122838.0160815e20130911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053894012DNAL7 a10.1021/ja406731f2doi7 aPMC42382832pmcid7 a239808502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Honglan10aSynthesis, Electrochemistry, and Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence of Two BODIPY-Appended Bipyridine Homologues  ap. 13558-13566.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo new 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) derivatives containing ancillary BODIPY chromophores attached at the 5- and 5′-positions (BB3) or 6- and 6′-positions (BB4) were prepared and characterized. In this work, the basic photophysics, electrochemistry, and electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) of BB3 and BB4 are compared with those previously reported for a related bpy-BODIPY derivative (BB2) (J. Phys. Chem. C 2011, 115, 17993–18001). Cyclic voltammetry revealed that BB3 and BB4 display reversible 2e– oxidation and reduction waves, which consist of two closely spaced (50–70 mV) 1e– events. This redox behavior is consistent with the frontier molecular orbitals calculated for BB3 and BB4 and indicates that the 2,2′-bipyridine spacer of each bpy-BODIPY homologue does not facilitate efficient electronic communication between the tethered indacene units. In the presence of a coreactant such as tri-n-propylamine (TPA) or benzoyl peroxide (BPO), BB3 and BB4 exhibit strong ECL and produce spectra that are very similar to their corresponding photoluminescence profiles. The ECL signal obtained under annihilation conditions, however, is significantly different and is characterized by two distinct bands. One of these bands is centered at ∼570 nm and is attributed to emission via an S- or T-route. The second band occurs at longer wavelengths and is centered around ∼740 nm. The shape and concentration dependence of this long-wavelength ECL signal is not indicative of emission from an excimer or aggregate, but rather it suggests that a new emissive species is formed from the bpy-BODIPY luminophores during the annihilation process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3aoxidation 3aphotoluminescence 3awavelengths1 aTeesdale, Justin J.1 aPupillo, Rachel

The objective of this study is to employ AtPAP1 (Production of Anthocyanin Pigmentation) and SmCCR1 (cinnamoyl CoA reductase) for improving the phenolic acids of S. miltiorrhiza. First, results showed that AtPAP1 significantly increased the promoter activities of SmCCR1 by transient transformation of tobacco. To enrich the precursors available for phenolic acid biosynthesis, we present a strategy of combinational genetic manipulation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer that simultaneously over-expressed AtPAP1 and down-regulated SmCCR1. Compared with the control, the amount of lignin was significantly reduced and its composition was changed in transgenic plants. While, the main phenolic acids, including salvianolic acid B and rosmarinic acid, were induced 2.0- and 1.8-fold compared with control lines in two-month-old plants. Meanwhile, the contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids were significantly improved in transformed plants. Expression of related genes throughout the phenylpropanoid pathways were altered, following the same trends as shown for their products, i.e., phenolic acids accumulation and lignin reduction. These results demonstrate that such methods for genetic modification, which increase the expression of transcription factors while suppressing that of branch genes, are of great value when genetically engineering plants for other secondary products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acardiovascular diseases 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3alignin 3apigmentation 3arosmarinic acid 3asalvianolic acid 3atobacco 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants1 aGe, Q.1 aWang, Z.0 tRussian journal of plant physiology.g2017 July, v. 64, no. 4 p.553-559dPleiades Publishingx1021-44377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10214437170401973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245010100210500001900311520094100330592002801271650002601299650001401325650001501339651001401354651001101368651001801379653001901397653002501416653001501441653001801456653001901474700005801493700002201551700001701573700002201590700001901612700002001631700006101651700002201712773011501734856008601849852000901935655001201944IND60686177520221119212647.0200427e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068617752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1062802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKefford, Ben J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6789-425413aAn integrated database of stream macroinvertebrate traits for Australia: concept and application  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTraits provide key ecological information that can be applied to understanding the mechanisms which drive community assembly and persistence. In recent years, trait information has provided important insights into the responses of communities to stressors including pollutants and climatic extremes. Outside of Europe and North America, the use of stream macroinvertebrate traits has generally been hindered by the lack of a national database assigning traits to taxa. Here, we present an integrated database for Australian stream macroinvertebrates, which for the first time brings together data from multiple jurisdictions to facilitate the use of traits in both theoretical and applied studies. We describe the database and discuss its applications as well as challenges and limitations of this and other trait databases. The Australian trait database provides new opportunities for research and application in freshwater management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic invertebrates 3adatabases 3afreshwater 3aAustralia 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aStream benthos 0aStream invertebrates 0aAttributes 0aBiomonitoring 0aStream ecology1 aBotwe, Paul K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0300-27361 aBrooks, Andrew J.1 aKunz, Stefan1 aMarchant, Richard1 aMaxwell, Sally1 aMetzeling, Leon1 aSchäfer, Ralf B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3510-17011 aThompson, Ross M.0 tEcological indicators.g2020 July, v. 114 p.106280-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1062803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010400166300001600270520109500286592002801381650003701409650001301446650001201459650000901471650001401480650003301494650001401527650001201541650001601553650003701569700001901606700001501625773010001640856008101740852000901821655001201830IND60574773220221120144915.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057477322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-017-9316-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ronghua10aDissolution Rates of Actinolite in Water and Its Modified Mineral Surface Across the Critical State  ap. 165-183.  aDissolution kinetic experiments of actinolite in water were performed using a flow-through reactor at temperatures from 20 to 400 °C and 23.5±0.5 MPa. The results indicate that the steady-state release rates of the different elements of actinolite vary with temperature. Generally, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Al dissolve more quickly than Si at temperatures from 20 °C to near 300 °C, but slower from 300 to 400 °C. The Si release rate increases with temperatures from 20 to 300 °C and then decreases from 300 to 400 °C. Si release rate reaches the maximum at 300 °C. Amorphous Si-rich surface layers occur at temperature <300 °C. Hydrations of actinolite are relatively faster, and proton–metal exchange reactions are weakening across the critical point. Mᵢ-rich (Fe, Ca, Mg) and Si-deficient surface layers form at temperatures ≥300 °C. XPS, TEM, and SEM observations indicate that the hydrated silicate occurred at surface as temperature >300 °C. Water property variations within the critical region strongly affect the dissolution rates and the modification of surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3airon 3amagnesium 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicates 3asilicon 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Xuetong1 aHu, Shumin0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2017 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.165-183dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-017-9316-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245014900165500002000314520126700334592002801601596005901629596005901688596004201747650001801789650001901807650001701826650001601843650001501859650001401874650001201888650001601900650001101916650001001927650001801937650001701955650002301972650003001995650001102025650002102036650000902057650001102066650005302077650001502130650001102145700002002156700001402176700002302190700002102213700002202234700001702256700001802273700002102291700005902312773014002371856007802511852000902589655001202598IND60671388020221123001207.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067138802DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2019002492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Chao‐Yue10aDiet Consisting of Balanced Yogurt, Fruit, and Vegetables Modifies the Gut Microbiota and Protects Mice against Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Calorie restriction (CR) is a therapeutically effective method for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the compliance of the CR method is relatively poor. New CR methods are needed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Each week, mice are given a 5‐day high‐fat diet (HFD) ad libitum plus 2 days of an intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) diet (50% calorie restriction) consisting of yogurt, fruit, and vegetables, for 16 weeks. The effect of the ICR diet model on the fatty liver of mice is examined. Compared with continuous HFD‐fed mice, the mice feeding HFD+ICR have lower body weight and hepatic steatosis, reduced serum lipid and transaminase levels, increased fatty acid oxidation gene of Cpt1a, and decreased hepatic lipid synthesis gene of Pparγ and Srebf‐1c, as well as improved insulin resistance and lower level of inflammation. Moreover, ICR reverses the dysbacteriosis in HFD group, including the lower Shannon diversity indexes and lower abundance of Lactobacillus. CONCLUSION: An ICR diet consisting of yogurt, fruit, and vegetables attenuates the development of HFD‐induced hepatic steatosis in mice. Furthermore, HFD+ICR diet is associated with a different fecal microbiota that tends to be more similar to normal diet controls.  aPublisher supplied data  a81872245cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81803601cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a17YF1416700cShanghai Sailing Program 3aLactobacillus 3abeta oxidation 3ablood lipids 3abody weight 3acompliance 3adysbiosis 3aenzymes 3afatty liver 3afruits 3agenes 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipids 3alow calorie diet 3amice 3amodels 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3avegetables 3ayogurt1 aLi, Zhan‐Ming1 aHan, Bing1 aZhang, Zheng‐Yan1 aChen, Hui‐Ling1 aZhang, Shi‐Long1 aXu, Jia‐Qi1 aMao, Yu‐Qin1 aZhao, Yan‐Ping1 aWang, Li‐Shun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3972-683X0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2019 Oct., v. 63, no. 19 p.e1900249-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2019002493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245011800204500001900322520183900341592002802180650001702208650001202225650001902237650001302256650001502269650002402284650002002308650002402328650001702352650002902369650001602398650001502414650001202429650001502441651001002456653001902466653002502485653001902510653002802529700001602557700001402573700001802587700001802605700005802623773010102681856008602782852000902868655001202877IND60686177720221119213021.0200427e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068617772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1062882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1216-070910aMapping soil organic carbon content using multi-source remote sensing variables in the Heihe River Basin in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil organic carbon (SOC) has a large impact on soil quality and global climate change. It is therefore important to be able to predict SOC accurately to promote sustainable soil management. Although the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has many advantages and has been widely used in soil science research, it has rarely been used in previous SOC mapping studies based on remote sensing images. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data in SOC prediction, by comparing the predictive performance of random forest (RF) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models in the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China. A set of 162 topsoil (0–20 cm) samples were taken and 15 environmental variables were obtained including land use, topography, climate, and remote sensing images (optical and SAR data). Using a cross-validation procedure to evaluate the performance of the models, three statistical indices were calculated. Overall, both RF and BRT models effectively predicted SOC content, exhibiting similar performance and producing similar spatial distribution patterns of SOC. The results showed that the addition of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A images improved prediction accuracy, with the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R²) improving by 9.0%, 8.3% and 13.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of all environmental variables had the best prediction performance explaining 75% of SOC variation. The most important environmental variables explaining SOC variation were precipitation, elevation, and temperature. The multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data in RF and BRT models explained 9% and 7%, respectively. The results from our case study highlight the usefulness of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data in SOC mapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aland use 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoil management 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atemperature 3atopography 3atopsoil 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aRemote sensing 0aDigital soil mapping 0aRandom forests 0aBoosted regression tree1 aGeng, Yajun1 aChen, Jie1 aLiu, Mengmeng1 aHaase, Dagmar1 aLausch, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4490-72320 tEcological indicators.g2020 July, v. 114 p.106288-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1062883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007200148245010700220300001200327520163100339592002801970650001901998650001702017650002502034650002302059650002802082650002002110650001602130650001302146650002602159650002002185650002702205650001702232650001802249650001402267650001602281650000902297650001002306651001002316653002302326653002602349653002102375653002302396653002602419653001102445653002202456700002802478700006902506773011402575856008302689852000902772655001202781IND60611203620221122220217.0190405e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061120362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2018.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarayanankutty, Arunaksharan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6232-166510aHealth impacts of different edible oils prepared from coconut (Cocos nucifera): A comprehensive review  ap. 1-7.  aEdible oils, preferably plant origin are rich sources of fatty acids and other lipophilic antioxidants to the body. Among these, oils derived from the coconut kernel (Cocos nucifera) are widely used in India and the Asia Pacific, which includes copra oil (CO), virgin coconut oil (VCO) and refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) oil. Based on the mode of preparation, their composition and biological effects vary.This review compares the physicochemical and biological properties of coconut oils prepared by different methods. The metabolism of coconut oil and its predominant content lauric acid is also explained. This review emphasizes the use of VCO in the prevention and amelioration of several degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancers, over CO or RBD oils.There are no evident differences in the fatty acid profiles of CO, VCO and RBD oils. However, they differ in their polyphenol contents, which are reported to be high in VCO, possibly due to less harsh treatment during its preparation. Various epidemiological and clinical reports indicating the health risk of coconut oils could be pertinent to the data on the individuals consumed CO/RBD oil, which lacks polyphenols. Whereas, VCO have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering and cytoprotective efficacies, which may be attributed to its higher polyphenolics. Further, emerging studies have indicated that hot-extracted VCO (H-VCO) have a pharmacological advantage over VCO prepared by fermentation. At this juncture, further explorations on the biopharmaceutical potential of VCO have to be undertaken through clinical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCocos nucifera 3aantioxidants 3abioactive properties 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acardiovascular diseases 3aclinical trials 3acoconut oil 3acoconuts 3acooking fats and oils 3adodecanoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afermentation 3alipophilicity 3aneoplasms 3apolyphenols 3arisk 3aseeds 3aIndia 0aVirgin coconut oil 0aPhenolic antioxidants 0aLipid metabolism 0aGlucose metabolism 0aCardiovascular health 0aCancer 0aNeurodegeneration1 aIllam, Soorya Parathodi1 aRaghavamenon, Achuthan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8760-359X0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2018 Oct., v. 80 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2018.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01640naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002000162245008100182300001600263500001900279500000900298520068300307592002800990650001301018650001301031650000801044650001301052650001701065700001701082773012101099856009701220852000901317655001201326IND60663548920221123002908.0191122e198605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066354892DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1986.00021962007800030033x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallahan, L.

Standard national accounts treat natural resource rents as a positive contribution to income without adjusting for the value of depleted natural resource stock. This treatment often leads to a positive bias in the national income computations of resource-rich economies. Unlike previous studies, we test the robustness of the curse in the predominantly used measures of national income, GDP, by investigating the theme in genuine income measures of economic output as well. Also, the paper deviates from most empirical studies in the literature by using the Arellano–Bond difference GMM method in investigating the oil curse in OECD and Non-OECD oil-exporting economies. Additionally, we employ two alternative measures of resource intensity in our explorations; the share of oil rents in GDP and per-capita oil reserves. Our results provide evidence of the curse in Non-OECD countries employing aggregate and per-capita measures of genuine income.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3aincome 3anational income 3aoils0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2018 Dec., v. 20, no. 6 p.2725-2745dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-017-0013-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245017200181300001400353500001500367520118700382592002801569650001401597650002701611650004101638650002201679650001401701650002101715650001401736650001301750650003001763650002201793650001601815650002501831650001001856650001401866650001801880653002201898653001201920653001701932653001301949653002101962700002601983700002502009700002802034773013502062856008302197852000902280655001202289IND60542727920221122204057.0190405e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054272792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaría Teresa, Romero-Correa14aThe avocado defense compound phenol-2,4-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl) is induced by arachidonic acid and acts via the inhibition of hydrogen peroxide production by pathogens  ap. 32-41.  a2019-12-06  aThe induction of defense compounds with arachidonic acid (AA) in avocado roots was analyzed in 6-month-old avocado seedlings. One organic extract was obtained 24 h after AA treatment that showed anti-oomycete activity. Two major regions of inhibition by TLC bioassay with Aspergillus were observed. One region had a high inhibitory effect on Aspergillus spore germination. This region was purified and analyzed by GC/MS spectrometry and the major compound was identified as phenol-2,4-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl) (PD). The antimicrobial activity of PD appeared to correlate with the antioxidative activity reported to this compound, because it was able to inhibit the ROS production in both Aspergillus and Phytophthora cinnamomi. This possibility was supported by an increase in the production of sporangia in Aspergillus in response to H2O2, also because the antioxidant ascorbic acid affects the Aspergillus growth concomitantly with a decrease in sporangia production. It is argued that the production of PD in avocado roots could be one of the mechanisms induced by AA that play an active role in the resistance against P. cinnamomi probably by regulating the production of H2O2.  aPublisher supplied data 3asporangia 3aPhytophthora cinnamomi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aseedlings 3aarachidonic acid 3abioassays 3aavocados 3aanti-infective properties 3aspore germination 3aAspergillus 3aantioxidant activity 3aroots 3apathogens 3aascorbic acid 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aAvocado 0aantioxidants 0aElicitor 0aArachidonic acid1 aRosaura, Villa-Gómez1 aElda, Castro-Mercado1 aErnesto, García-Pineda0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2014 July, v. 87 p.32-41dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015000157300002000307520130800327592002801635650001301663650001601676650001901692650001401711650001001725650001001735650002101745650001201766650004401778650002001822650001601842650001301858650000901871700001501880700002001895700001701915700001301932700002101945700001501966700001501981700001401996773013502010856007502145852000902220655001202229IND60538940520221121014910.0160815e20130911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053894052DNAL7 a10.1021/ja406978q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jianfeng,10aMechanistic Insight into the Formation of Acetic Acid from the Direct Conversion of Methane and Carbon Dioxide on Zinc-Modified H–ZSM-5 Zeolite  ap. 13567-13573.  aMethane and carbon dioxide are known greenhouse gases, and the conversion of these two C₁-building blocks into useful fuels and chemicals is a subject of great importance. By solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we found that methane and carbon dioxide can be co-converted on a zinc-modified H–ZSM-5 zeolite (denoted as Zn/H–ZSM-5) to form acetic acid at a low temperature range of 523–773 K. Solid-state ¹³C and ¹H MAS NMR investigation indicates that the unique nature of the bifunctional Zn/H–ZSM-5 catalyst is responsible for this highly selective transformation. The zinc sites efficiently activate CH₄ to form zinc methyl species (−Zn–CH₃), the Zn–C bond of which is further subject to the CO₂ insertion to produce surface acetate species (−Zn–OOCCH₃). Moreover, the Brønsted acid sites play an important role for the final formation of acetic acid by the proton transfer to the surface acetate species. The results disclosed herein may offer the new possibility for the efficient activation and selective transformation of methane at low temperatures through the co-conversion strategy. Also, the mechanistic understanding of this process will help to the rational design of robust catalytic systems for the practical conversion of greenhouse gases into useful chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3afuels 3agases 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3azeolites 3azinc1 aYu, Si-Min1 aWang, Wei David1 aFan, Yan-Xin1 aBai, Shi1 aZhang, Chuan-Wei1 aGao, Qiang1 aHuang, Jun1 aWang, Wei0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Sept. 11, v. 135, no. 36 p.13567-13573dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja406978q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003200129040001800161100002300179245015800202500002000360506002800380506003000408520149200438592002801930596010701958596004502065596008202110596003302192596007302225596003502298506003702333650002102370650001302391650002002404650001502424650002802439650001402467650001402481650003602495650001702531650001902548650001802567650001602585650001702601650001402618650001902632650002202651650002002673650002802693650001402721650003602735650003202771700003602803700006902839773014002908856007803048903002203126852000903148655001203157IND60671388220221207121959.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067138822DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2019000212chorus7 a10.1002/mnfr.2019000212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrancieri, Mariana10aChia (Salvia hispanica L.)

METHODS AND RESULTS: Total protein and protein fractions (albumin, globulin, glutelin, and prolamin) are isolated from chia seed and digested using simulated gastrointestinal conditions, resulting in digested total protein (DTP) and digested protein fractions (DPF). DTP and DPF are applied (1.0 mg mL⁻¹) in RAW 264.4 macrophages stimulated with LPS (1 µg mL⁻¹) for inflammation or ox‐LDL (80 µg mL⁻¹) for atherosclerosis. In the inflammatory process, DTP and DPF reduce p‐NF‐κB, iNOS, p‐JNK, and AP‐1. Digested glutelin reduces the secretion of nitric oxide (65.1%), reactive oxygen species (19.7%), prostaglandins (34.6%), TNF‐α (24.1%), MCP‐1 (18.9%), IL‐6 (39.6%), and IL‐10 (68.7%). DTP and DPF reduce the NF‐κB translocation to nuclei. DTP and digested glutelin reduce iCAM expression (86.4%, 80.8%), LOX‐1 (37.3%, 35.7%), iNOS (67.0%, 42.2%), and NF‐κB (57.5%, 71.1%). DTP is effective in reducing secretion of nitric oxide (43.4%), lipid accumulation (41.9%), prostaglandins (41.9%), TNF‐α (43.3%), MCP‐1 (47.6%), and IL‐6 (50.5%). Peptides from chia DTP and DPF are also characterized. CONCLUSION: DTP and digested glutelin from chia seed reduce expression and secretion of markers related to inflammation and atherosclerosis pathways.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  a200739/2017‐4cConselho Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia Brasileira (CNPq)  a1014457cUSDA‐NIFA‐HATCH  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  cU.S. Department of Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalvia hispanica 3aalbumins 3aatherosclerosis 3abiomarkers 3agastrointestinal system 3aglobulins 3aglutelins 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3anitric oxide 3aprolamins 3aprostaglandins 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3areactive oxygen species 3asecretion 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aMartino, Hercia Stampini Duarte1 aGonzalez de Mejia, Elvira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7426-90350 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2019 Oct., v. 63, no. 19 p.e1900021-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2019000213Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001900167245011500186300001600301500002400317500002400341520139200365650001501757650000801772650002801780650001801808650002501826650002301851650001301874650002401887650002501911650001701936650003101953650001701984650001002001650001502011650001302026650002202039650001402061650001202075700001802087773009502105852000902200856011102209655001202320IND4463878020221120155259.0120816s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446387802DNAL7 a10.1637/0005-2086(2003)047[0247:RAPADI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, B.W.10aReducing Airborne Pathogens and Dust in Commercial Hatching Cabinets with an Electrostatic Space Charge System  ap. 247-253.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aCommercial hatcheries typically infuse hydrogen peroxide or formaldehyde gas into hatching cabinets to reduce airborne pathogens that may lead to disease transmission during the hatch. A nonchemical option, an electrostatic space charge system (ESCS), was customized for full-sized commercial hatching cabinets and was tested extensively in broiler hatcheries. The ESCS cleans air by transferring a strong negative electrostatic charge to dust and microorganisms that are aerosolized during the hatch and collecting the charged particles on grounded plates or surfaces. In studies with three poultry companies, the ESCS resulted in significant (P < 0.0001) reductions of airborne dust of 77%-79%, in Enterobacteriaceae and fungus levels not significantly different (P ≥ 0.05) from those with formaldehyde, and in 93%-96% lower Enterobacteriaceae than with no treatment or with hydrogen peroxide treatment (P < 0.01). The ESCS significantly (P < 0.05) reduced airborne Salmonella by 33%-83% compared with no treatment or hydrogen peroxide treatment. Results of this study suggest that the ESCS is a viable alternative to chemical treatment for reducing airborne pathogens in full-sized commercial hatchers, and it also provides dust control and containment, which should be helpful in reducing cross contamination and loading of ventilation ducts within different areas of the hatchery. 3aSalmonella 3aair 3aairborne microorganisms 3abird diseases 3abusiness enterprises 3achemical treatment 3acleaning 3across contamination 3adisease transmission 3adust control 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aformaldehyde 3afungi 3ahatcheries 3ahatching 3ahydrogen peroxide 3apathogens 3apoultry1 aWaltman, W.D.0 tAvian diseases.g2003 , v. 47, no. 2 p.247-253dCornell Veterinarian, Incx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086(2003)047%5B0247:RAPADI%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02657naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245012900181300001600310520103300326592002801359650002001387650001401407650002301421650001701444650001301461650000901474650002101483650001901504650001701523650001601540653001401556653002701570653001601597653001801613653002901631653001301660700001901673700002301692700001601715700002701731700001701758700002101775700001801796700003001814700002401844700002801868773013501896856008702031852000902118655001202127IND60622700920221123014937.0190131e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062270092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.2172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrasugh, Jonathan Tersur10aEffect of cellulose nanocrystals on the performance of drug loaded in situ gelling thermo-responsive ophthalmic formulations  ap. 235-245.  aTriblock poloxamer copolymer (PM) has been extensively utilized to deliver various ophthalmic pharmaceutical compounds. The aim of efficient ophthalmic drug delivery strategy is to attain the longer precorneal resident time and good bioavailability of drugs. In this pursuit, the influence of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) on the in situ gelation behavior of PM and in vitro release of pilocarpine hydrochloride from the nanocomposites formulations was studied. The critical concentration of gelation of PM being 18% (wt/v) was dropped to 16.6% (wt/v) by the addition of a very low percentage of CNC. The reinforcing nature of CNC via H-bonding in the in situ nanocomposite gel also led to an increase in gel strength along with the sustained release of loaded drugs when compared with the pure PM gel. All formulations revealed that the drug release mechanism is controlled by the Fickian diffusion. Thus, the CNC has a significant effect on the gelation behavior, gel strength, and drug release kinetics of PM-CNC formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acellulose 3acomposite polymers 3agel strength 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3apilocarpine 0aPoloxamer 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aIn situ gel 0aNanocomposite 0aOphthalmic drug delivery 0aToxicity1 aSarkar, Gunjan1 aSaha, Nayan Ranjan1 aDas, Beauty1 aBhattacharyya, Amartya1 aDas, Sreyasi1 aMishra, Roshnara1 aRoy, Indranil1 aChattoapadhyay, Atiskumar1 aGhosh, Swapan Kumar1 aChattopadhyay, Dipankar0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 124 p.235-245dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.2173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01437naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012900157300001800286520037500304592002800679650001400707650001600721650002300737650002300760700002300783700002100806700002000827700002400847700002000871700001800891773010600909856007501015852000901090655001201099IND60578766620180316000000.0170814e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057876662DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502177m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkiredj, Adam12aA Unified Bioinspired “Aplysinopsin Cascade”: Total Synthesis of (±)-Tubastrindole B and Related Biosynthetic Congeners  ap. 4980-4983.  aApplying a biomimetic approach, the first total synthesis of (±)-tubastrindole B is reported herein.

The helical magnetic structure of this ternary dichalcogenide was shown to be stabilized by phonons. The dynamical properties of the TlCo₂Se₂ lattice conform with the quasi-2D layered structure of this compound. The intensities of the Raman and infrared active phonon modes of TlCo₂Se₂ remained sensitive to magnetic interactions, suggesting a rather strong spin–phonon coupling within the Co–Se layers. A detailed analysis of the calculated phonon, Raman and infrared absorption spectra of TlCo₂Se₂ which was carried out with respect to the spectra of its ferromagnetic (KCo₂Se₂) and paramagnetic (KNi₂Se₂) counterparts enabled the essential differences between the dynamical properties of the quasi-2D layered transition-metal dichalcogenides to be elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adensity functional theory 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amagnetism 3avibrational properties1 aWdowik, Urszula D.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 19, v. 6, no. 82 p.79121-79127dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra18990c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001800144245015800162300001800320520175600338650003102094650002302125650003102148650002502179650001202204650001002216650001702226650001902243650001902262650002202281650001902303650003002322650001602352650000902368650003702377650002002414650001702434650001402451650002402465650001902489650002002508650003602528650002702564700001802591700002802609700001802637700002702655700002102682700002102703773016202724856004702886852000902933655001202942IND4535031320221119230248.0151207e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453503132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b021832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sang-Yun10aOcotillol, a Majonoside R2 Metabolite, Ameliorates 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid-Induced Colitis in Mice by Restoring the Balance of Th17/Treg Cells  ap. 7024-7031.  aIn a preliminary experiment, majonoside R2 (MR2), isolated from Vietnamese ginseng (Panax vietnamensis Ha et Grushv.), inhibited differentiation to Th17 cells and was metabolized to ocotillol via pseudoginsenoside RT4 (PRT4) by gut microbiota. Therefore, we examined the inhibitory effects of MR2 and its metabolites PRT4 and ocotillol against Th17 cell differentiation. These ginsenosides significantly suppressed interleukin (IL)-6/tumor growth factor beta-induced differentiation of splenic CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells and expression of IL-17 in vitro. Among these ginsenosides, ocotillol showed the highest inhibitory effect. We also examined the anti-inflammatory effect of ocotillol in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Oral administration of ocotillol significantly suppressed TNBS-induced colon shortening, macroscopic score, myeloperoxidase activity, and production of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2. Ocotillol treatment increased TNBS-suppressed expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 in the colon. Treatment with ocotillol inhibited TNBS-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and IL-1Î², as well as activation of NF-ÎºB and MAPKs. Moreover, treatment with ocotillol inhibited TNBS- induced differentiation to Th17 cells in the lamina propria of colon, as well as expression of T-bet, RORÎ³t, IL-17, and IL-23. Ocotillol treatment also increased Treg cell differentiation and Foxp3 and IL-10 expression. These findings suggest that orally administered MR2 may be metabolized to ocotillol in the intestine by gut microbiota and the transformed ocotillol may ameliorate inflammatory diseases such as colitis by restoring the balance of Th17/Treg cells. 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aPanax vietnamensis 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acell differentiation 3acolitis 3acolon 3aginsenosides 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-23 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amyeloperoxidase 3anitric oxide 3aoccludins 3aoral administration 3aprostaglandins 3atight junctions 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factors1 aJeong, Jin-Ju1 aLê, Thị Hồng Vân,1 aEun, Su-Hyeon1 aNguyễn, Minh Đức,1 aPark, Jeong Hill1 aKim, Tong-hyŏn,0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Aug. 12, v. 63, no. 31 p.7024-7031dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02183  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245007400175300001800249520140800267592002801675650001601703650001601719650001301735650001601748650001401764650001401778650001901792650001901811650001201830650001501842650001301857650001301870650001301883650001301896650001801909650001701927650001601944653001601960653001301976653001701989700002302006773013702029856008702166852000902253655001202262IND60622701020221123014858.0220214e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062270102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToledo, Paulo V.O.10aHydrophilic, hydrophobic, Janus and multilayer xanthan based cryogels  ap. 1180-1188.  aXanthan gum (XG) was applied for the creation of hydrophilic, hydrophobic and layered cryogels. Firstly, the correlation among synthesis parameters, such as solvent composition and polymer concentration (Cₚ) in the precursor gel and mold diameter (Φ), with physicochemical properties and morphological parameters of resulting hydrophilic XG cryogels was investigated. The addition of acetic acid to the precursor led to stiffer XG cryogels. The reduction of Cₚ and Φ promoted the increase in the cryogels surface area and porosity. Then, XG cryogels were silanized in order to produce hydrophobic cryogels, which presented sorption capacities for diesel, mineral and sunflower oils of 28 ± 2 g/g, 16 ± 2 g/g and 5.2 ± 0.3 g/g, respectively. The hydrophobic XG cryogels were considerably more efficient to remove ethinyl estradiol, an estrogenic pollutant, from liquid media than the hydrophilic cryogels. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic XG cryogels presented similar capacity to remove bisphenol A, another estrogenic pollutant, from liquid media. A new family of alternated hydrophobic/hydrophilic “Janus” like and multilayered cryogels was created and applied in mixtures of diesel oil and water or oil/water emulsions. The “Janus” like and multilayered cryogels remained at the interface, where the hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers adsorbed oil and water selectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3abisphenol A 3acryogels 3adiesel fuel 3aemulsions 3aestradiol 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3apollutants 3apolymers 3aporosity 3asolvents 3asorption 3asunflower oil 3asurface area 3axanthan gum 0aXanthan gum 0aCryogels 0aSilanization1 aPetri, Denise F.S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 123 p.1180-1188dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002000162245008400182300001600266520121300282592002801495650002101523650000901544650001301553650001801566650001101584650001401595650001401609650001601623650006501639650001301704650001001717650002301727650001601750650007101766650006801837650001601905650001701921650001001938700002201948773009801970856004602068852000902114655001202123IND4478330320221119063442.0120503e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447833032DNAL7 a223910092pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tps0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunttila, Olavi14aThe minimum temperature for budburst in Betula depends on the state of dormancy  ap. 337-345.  aVegis has put forward the theory that the range of growth-promoting temperatures changes during the induction and the release of dormancy. We have tested the response of buds of Betula pubescens Ehrh. and B. pendula Roth. on temperature during the induction and release of dormancy. Betula seedlings were exposed to dormancy-inducing high-temperature and short-day conditions and subsequently to dormancy-releasing chilling conditions in darkness. To monitor the dormancy status of the seedlings, subsets of them were transferred to five forcing temperatures and their budburst was observed. The results show that the expression of dormancy was temperature dependent, so that the minimum temperature for 100% budburst rose during the induction and dropped during the release of dormancy. These responses may explain previous contradictions between experimental and modelling studies, but that needs to be verified with more extensive experiments, some of which are identified in this study. The results provide further evidence for the concept of gradual change in bud dormancy. They also suggest that global change studies modelling budburst phenology should address the changing expression of bud dormancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pubescens 3abuds 3adormancy 3aglobal change 3amodels 3aphenology 3aseedlings 3atemperature 2aBetulaxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aDarkness 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aPhotoperiod 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aTrees1 aHanninen, Heikki,0 tTree physiology.g2012 Mar., v. 32, no. 3 p.337-345dOxford University Pressx0829-318X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tps010  aDNAL 7aarticle01612naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245018200157300001600339520048000355592002800835650002300863650001200886650001100898650001900909650001400928650001600942650001100958700001500969700001600984700001601000700001601016700001701032700001501049773009101064856007401155852000901229655001201238IND60439191020221120035104.0151024e199709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043919102DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024963212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, L. -M.10aSynergistic effects in mixed gas chromatographic stationary phases containing hepatkis(2.3.6-tri-O-pentyl)-β-cyclodextrin and AgNO3 or TINO3 in the separation of xylene isomers  ap. 291-294.  aThe gas chromatographic separation of xylene isomers using special mixed stationary phases consisting of heptakis(2.3.6-tri-O-pentyl)-β-CD-AgNO₃, heptakis (2.3.6-tri-O-pentyl)-β-CD-TINO₃ or bentone-34-AgNO₃ is investigated.

A study was undertaken with 58 specimens of H. litoralle taken from Batalha River in the state of São Paulo. The fish were collected and examined searching for lesions and/or myxosporean plasmodia. The prevalence of infection was 9.31% in the gills and 5.17% in the intestine. The mature spores had elongated bodies with polar capsules of inequal size and a caudal length greater than body length. Morphological characteristics identified the parasite as H. guanduensis. Molecular analysis of the SSU rDNA partials sequences resulted in a 1796 bp and 1712 bp for gills and intestine repectively, demonstrating significant genetic differences with previously described species of Henneguya and 99.7% similarity to each other when aligned. Phylogenetic analysis comparing the SSU rDNA sequence of H. guanduensis with closest species as indicated by BLASTn Max Score showed H. guanduensis as sister species of H. loretoensis in a subclade compose by species that parasites fishes from Amazon basin.

These agreements form the backbone of the European Union's (EU) external forest governance. The data-driven literature review of the current scholarship on the VPAs shows a preoccupation with either the design of the VPAs or their (adverse) impact. What remains in the margins however is an inquiry into the political characteristics that drive both. More specifically, the politics of the EU continue to be a black box. We propose a research agenda that looks at the VPAs from a political angle with a focus on meaning- making in the VPA processes and on the power of the EU in steering dominant views and interpretations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aforests 3agovernance 3apolitics1 aVerhaeghe, Elke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6589-36690 tForest policy and economics.g2019 Apr., v. 101 p.81-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2019.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012200166300001600288520165300304592002801957650001401985650002101999650001802020650002502038650002102063650001702084650001402101650004602115650004002161650001202201650001502213650002102228650002102249650001202270650002902282650002602311650002702337653001002364653001702374653001502391653001802406653001902424700001302443700001602456700001302472700001302485773011902498856008502617852000902702655001202711IND60562663920221116213612.0180829e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056266392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lulu10aInvestigation of G-quadruplex formation in the FGFR2 promoter region and its transcriptional regulation by liensinine  ap. 884-891.  aFibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cells, and has been shown to be a susceptibility factor for breast cancer. In this study, we found that the G-rich sequences in the FGFR2 promoter region can form G-quadruplexes, which could be the target and inhibitor of the FGFR2 gene.Initially, the formation of G-quadruplexes was confirmed by ESI-MS and CD, and DMS footprinting experiments gave the folding pattern of the G-quadruplexes. After luciferase reporter assays revealed that the G-quadruplex could inhibit the activity of the FGFR2 promoter, MS and SPR showed binding affinity and selectivity of the ligand. Then cell culture experiments and ChIP assay showed the bioactivity of the ligand.We found that three G-rich sequences (S1–S3) in the FGFR2 promoter region can form G-quadruplex structures. And a natural alkaloid, liensinine, was found to bind to the S1 G-quadruplex with relative high affinity and selectivity. Cell culture experiments showed that liensinine inhibits FGFR2 activity at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) results showed that liensinine blocks the binding of E2F1 at the transcription factor binding site (TFBS) in the S1 sequence, which is the mechanism through which liensinine inhibits the FGFR2 gene.A natural alkaloid was discovered to selectively bind to the S1 G-quadruplex with relative high affinity, and therefore inhibited FGFR2 transcription and translation.Our discovery offers a useful strategy to inhibit FGFR2 transcription, i.e., targeting the G-quadruplex with a natural alkaloid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3abinding capacity 3abinding sites 3abioactive properties 3abreast neoplasms 3acell culture 3achromatin 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afibroblast growth factor receptor 2 3aligands 3aluciferase 3aprecipitin tests 3apromoter regions 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranslation (genetics) 0aFGFR2 0aG-quadruplex 0aLiensinine 0aBreast cancer 0aGene inhibitor1 aTan, Wei1 aZhou, Jiang1 aXu, Ming1 aYuan, Gu0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Apr., v. 1861, no. 4 p.884-891dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245008900173300001800262520099700280592002801277650001701305650002001322650001301342650001101355650001401366650001701380650003701397653001401434653002001448653001101468653002201479653002501501700002501526700002401551700002201575700002701597773012301624856008701747852000901834655001201843IND50067983920221117020445.0190402e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006798392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.05.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraicu, Cornelia14aThe relationship between the structure and biological actions of green tea catechins  ap. 3282-3289.  aCatechins and their gallate esters are a class of polyphenolic compounds. The catechin subclass known as flavan-3-ols have recently attracted much attention with regards to their beneficial effect on human health. Their biological actions are dependent on the structure of the compounds and vary according to cell type. They are best known as powerful antioxidants; however depending on the doses they also exhibit prooxidant effects. The anti- or prooxidant effects of green tea catechins have been implicated in the modulation of several cellular functions often associated with strong chemoprotective properties. This review summarises the benefit catechins to human health, the main molecular pathways modulated by catechins. The relationship between the structure and activity of the catechins needs to be studied further. In the future, the structure of catechins could be modified so as to synthesise novel compounds with more specific beneficial properties and higher bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3acatechin 3aesters 3agreen tea 3ahuman health 3astructure-activity relationships 0aCatechins 0aPro/antioxidant 0aCancer 0aMolecular targets 0aAlternative splicing1 aLadomery, Michael R.1 aChedea, Veronica S.1 aIrimie, Alexandru1 aBerindan-Neagoe, Ioana0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 141, no. 3 p.3282-3289dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.05.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003800147245013700185300001600322520162600338592002801964650001801992650000902010650001802019650001502037650001202052650001102064650001202075650001402087650000902101650002102110650001502131650001302146650001802159650001102177650001002188651001102198700003102209700002902240700004402269700003202313700003002345700003502375773011202410856008102522852000902603655001202612IND60120235920221123014029.0150131e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012023592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-014-0724-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-García, Carlos Galdino10aPerformance of small-scale dairy farms in the highlands of central Mexico during the dry season under traditional feeding strategies  ap. 331-337.  aIn Mexico, small-scale dairy systems (SSDS) represent over 78 % of dairy farms and contribute with 37 % of national milk production; however, they face high feeding costs. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of SSDS during the dry season in terms of milk yields, milk composition and feeding costs under traditional feeding strategies, to identify areas of opportunity for improving their profitability. The information was collected from 22 SSDS every month during dry season. Feeds were classified in quality forages (QF), supplements (SU) and straws (ST). Two factors were identified: factor 1—a positive relationship among QF, SU, milk yield and ration cost and factor 2—represented straw usage. Four feeding strategies were identified: (1) low-cost feeding strategy; (2) home-grown feeding strategy; (3) high-cost feeding strategy; and (4) straw-based feeding strategy. There were differences (P < 0.001) among feeding strategies for QF, SU, ST, total dry matter offered (TDMO), ration cost (RC), external inputs, home-grown inputs and milk yield. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences among feeding strategies for fat and protein contents in milk. It is concluded that to improve performance and profitability and enhance sustainability in SSDS, farmers should base feeding strategies on home-grown quality forages, as it was the case in group 2 which showed lower feeding cost and better milk yield. It is also recommended to increase the inclusion of quality forages like grazing pastures and maize silages during the dry season and to avoid the inclusion of straws.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3acorn 3adairy farming 3adry season 3afarmers 3aforage 3agrazing 3ahighlands 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk yield 3apastures 3aprofitability 3asilage 3astraw 3aMexico1 aRayas-Amor, Adolfo Armando1 aAnaya-Ortega, Juan Pablo1 aMartínez-Castañeda, Francisco Ernesto1 aEspinoza Ortega, Angélica,1 aProspero-Bernal, Fernando1 aArriaga-Jordán, Carlos Manuel0 tTropical animal health and production.g2015 Feb., v. 47, no. 2 p.331-337dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-014-0724-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011800164300001600282500001900298520132200317592002801639650001601667650001201683650001501695650001301710650001501723650002101738650001401759650001501773650001201788650003301800650001301833653000901846653001601855653002201871700001501893700001601908700001601924700005501940773014601995856008302141852000902224655001202233IND60685094420221119162746.0200405e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068509442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.02.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Guohua10aCholine transporter-like 1 (CTL1) positively regulates apical hook development in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings  ap. 491-497.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEthylene is a gaseous phytohormone that is perceived by two-component histidine kinase-type receptors. Recent studies identified choline transporter-like 1 (CTL1) essential for Arabidopsis growth and development, including apical hook development in the etiolated seedlings. Here, we report that CTL1 contributes to apical hook development by enhancing ethylene response. The expression of CTL1 was highly correlated with the intensity of ethylene response and was enriched in the apical hook, cotyledon tip and hypocotyl. Genetic analysis showed that the dark-grown ctl1 mutant displayed a defect in ethylene-induced apical hook development as compared with the wild type. Accordingly, the expression of ethylene signaling reporter EBS::GUS in ctl1 mutant was greatly reduced in leaves, apical hook, hypocotyl and root, suggesting that the disruption of CTL1 impairs the ethylene signaling. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that CTL1 may interact with ethylene receptors, including ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2. Importantly, the abundance of CTL1 was diminished when ETR1 was disrupted upon ethylene response. Taken together, our results suggest that CTL1 functions as a positive regulator in ethylene signaling which in turn contributes to apical hook development of etiolated plant seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acholine 3acotyledons 3aethylene 3aetiolation 3agenetic analysis 3ahistidine 3ahypocotyls 3amutants 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aresearch 0aCTL1 0aApical hook 0aEthylene receptor1 aWang, Yuan1 aYan, Wenwen1 aLuan, Sheng1 aLan, Wenzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9207-79150 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Apr. 30, v. 525, no. 2 p.491-497dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.02.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04346naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245014900204500002200353506011700375506007600492520222200568592002802790506003702818650002002855650001802875650001802893650000902911650001702920650001702937650001602954650001602970650001002986650002402996650001903020650002603039650002003065650003003085650004003115650001403155650001503169650002803184650002203212650001003234650002103244650002803265653002303293653002103316653001903337653001603356700001903372700005703391700005503448773014803503856008403651852000903735655001203744IND60788728220221207141604.0220824e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078872822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aninu.2022.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bowen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3557-681410aDietary supplementation of porcine bile acids improves laying performance, serum lipid metabolism and cecal microbiota in late-phase laying hens  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDue to the exceptional laying performance of hens, the demand on lipid metabolism and oxidation in vivo is vigorous, resulting in excessive lipid accumulation in late-phase hens, which lowers the production performance. Bile acids regulate lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in humans and animals. However, the effect of porcine bile acids on lipid metabolism and cecal microbiota in laying hens in the late phase is still unclear. A total of 360 healthy 45-week-old laying hens were chosen for a 24-week feeding trial, where 0, 30, 60 and 90 mg/kg porcine bile acids were added to a basal diet, respectively. The results showed that dietary supplementation of 60 mg/kg bile acids increased egg production and feed conversion (P < 0.05). Also, 60 and 90 mg/kg porcine bile acids reduced abdominal fat percentage and body weight (P < 0.05). The levels of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of hens decreased (P < 0.05) in bile acids supplement groups. As for cecal microbiota, bile acids supplementation did not affect the alpha diversity of cecal microbiota at the genus level. Moreover, dietary supplementation of 90 mg/kg bile acids resulted in an increase in the abundance of beneficial bacteria in the cecum, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Turicibacter. The changes in the cecal microbiota caused by bile acids supplementation correlated with serum lipid indexes. According to KEGG pathway analysis, dietary supplementation of 60 and 90 mg/kg bile acids promoted structural transformation of the cecal microbiota to down-regulate steroid biosynthesis, up-regulate fatty acid degradation and up-regulate unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Meanwhile, bile acids bio-isomerization function of cecal microbiota was enhanced in 60 and 90 mg/kg bile acids treatment, and the short-chain fatty acid metabolism was also affected. In conclusion, the present study revealed dietary supplementation of porcine bile acids enriched probiotics in the gut and improved serum lipid metabolism of laying hens. A follow-up study may be required to examine porcine bile acids as a gut beneficial promoter to regulate lipid metabolism in late-phase laying hens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBifidobacterium 3aLactobacillus 3aabdominal fat 3abile 3abiosynthesis 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acecum 3adietary supplements 3aegg production 3afatty acid metabolism 3afeed conversion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aoxidation 3aprobiotics 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aspecies diversity 3aswine 3atriacylglycerols 3aunsaturated fatty acids 0aPorcine bile acids 0aLipid metabolism 0aGut microbiota 0aLaying hens1 aHuang, Shimeng1 aZhao, Guoxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6795-47121 aMa, Qiugang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7260-37650 tAnimal nutrition.g2022 Aug. 04, dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-65457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2022.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245016500168300001800333520128400351592002801635650001701663650001401680650002001694650001601714650001301730650001301743650002001756650001601776650001401792650002801806650002501834650002201859650002301881650001501904650001301919650002501932700001901957700001901976700001801995700001702013700001702030700002002047700001902067700001902086773012402105856007402229852000902303655001202312IND60617735720221123035934.0181026e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061773572DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01449j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkatakrishnan, Kamesh10aComparative studies on the hypolipidemic, antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities of catechin-enriched green and oolong tea in a double-blind clinical trial  ap. 1205-1213.  aThis study aimed to compare the beneficial effect of catechin-enriched green tea and oolong tea on mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects. Sixty mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects (180–220 mg dL⁻¹) were enrolled and divided into three groups as catechin-enriched green tea (CEGT), catechin-enriched oolong tea (CEOT) or placebo. The subjects were instructed to drink 2 × 300 mL of CEGT (780.6 mg of catechin), CEOT (640.4 mg of catechin) or placebo beverage for 12 weeks. Drinking CEGT and CEOT significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the body weight, fat, and BMI, lipid peroxidation as well as lipid profile (TC, LDL-c, HDL-c, and TG). Also, intervention with CEGT and CEOT significantly improved (p < 0.05) the oxidative indices (TEAC and GSH) and antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR). Moreover, ultrasound examination endorsed the hepatoprotective activity of CEGT and CEOT by reverting mild fatty liver to the normal hepatic condition because of antioxidant and hypolipidemic activities. To summarize, both CEGT and CEOT showed similar antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities. However, CEOT displayed superior lipid-lowering activity compared to CEGT or placebo, and hence it could be used to amend the wellness condition of mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3abody mass index 3abody weight 3acatalase 3acatechin 3aclinical trials 3afatty liver 3agreen tea 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alipid composition 3alipid peroxidation 3aoolong tea 3aplacebos 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aChiu, Hui-Fang1 aCheng, Ju-Chun1 aChang, Ya-Hui1 aLu, Yan-Ying1 aHan, Yi-Chun1 aShen, You-Cheng1 aTsai, Kun-Shun1 aWang, Chin-Kun0 tFood & function.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 9, no. 2 p.1205-1213dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01449j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245006400178300001600242520106300258536005901321592002801380596000901408596001001417596001101427650002501438650002301463650002301486650001401509650002001523650001501543650003101558650002501589650002301614650002201637650001701659653002301676653002401699653002601723700004201749700002901791700002801820700004201848700003301890700002701923700002801950700003901978700002802017700004002045773012202085856008502207852000902292655001202301IND60685703820221119095425.0200306e20200303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068570382DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.14935882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJucá, Mércia Marques10aFlavonoids: biological activities and therapeutic potential  ap. 692-705.  aFlavonoids have aroused much interest in research, since they present a great diversity of biological activities observed in vitro, such as: antioxidant effect, modulation of the enzymatic activity and inhibition of cellular proliferation, exerting beneficial effects on the organism, as well as the use of its therapeutic potential. With wide distribution in the plant kingdom represent a class of phenolic compounds that differ in their chemical structure and particular characteristics. The objective of this review was to describe the relevant aspects of flavonoids, reporting the different known groups, the probable mechanisms by which they act, their pharmacological properties and to gain a better understanding of the reported beneficial health effects of these substances. This systematic review consisted of research using scientific databases such as Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, SciVerse and SciELO, without time limitation. Some pharmacological properties of some flavonoids and their health benefits have been confirmed by previous studies.  aThis study was supported by the CNPq, CAPES and FUNCAP  aPublisher supplied data  cCNPq  cCAPES  cFUNCAP 3aantioxidant activity 3acell proliferation 3achemical structure 3adatabases 3aenzyme activity 3aflavonoids 3ahealth effects assessments 3amedicinal properties 3aphenolic compounds 3asystematic review 3atherapeutics 0aantioxidant effect 0abiological activity 0atherapeutic potential1 aCysne Filho, Francisco Mauricio Sales1 ade Almeida, Jamily Cunha1 aMesquita, Dara da Silva1 aBarriga, Jéssica Rodrigues de Moraes1 aDias, Kátia Cilene Ferreira1 aBarbosa, Talita Matias1 aVasconcelos, Luna Costa1 aLeal, Luzia Kalyne Almeida Moreira1 aRibeiro, José Eduardo,1 aVasconcelos, Silvânia Maria Mendes0 tNatural product research.g2020 Mar. 3, v. 34, no. 5 p.692-705dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2018.14935883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245013200174300001600306520131000322592002801632650001101660650002901671650002201700650002001722650001501742650002001757650001501777650000901792650001401801650002201815650001001837651001501847700002801862700001401890700003101904700002701935773010901962856008202071852000902153655001202162IND60621493020221121204928.0181117s1998    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062149302DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826598019003042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoltzfus, Rebecca J.10aPlausible Evidence of Effectiveness of An Iron-Supplementation Programme for Pregnant and Post-Partum Women in Rural Bangladesh  ap. 197-204.  aSince 1978 iron and folic acid pills have been distributed, along with other family-planning and health services, to women in Matlab subdistrict, Bangladesh, through fortnightly visits of community health workers. in 1986 the iron dose was set at three pills daily (198 mg of iron) during pregnancy and two pills daily for 6 months post-partum. Haemoglobin concentrations were determined in a representative sample of 218 women who gave birth from June through August 1994 and who were followed prospectively from 0.5 to 9 months post-partum. At 0.5 months post-partum, 88% of women reported that they had taken iron pills on the previous day. the prevalence of anaemia declined from 36% at 0.5 months to 9% at 9 months post-partum, with an overall average prevalence of 23% in this period. to estimate the impact of the programme, these results were compared to anaemia results from representative samples of non-pregnant women in Matlab in 1975 and 1976 and in three other rural communities in Bangladesh in 1996. the estimated reduction in the prevalence of anaemia resulting from the programme ranged from 48% to 70%, and the estimated increase in haemoglobin concentration ranged from 0.9 to 2.1 g/dl. This evidence suggests that the Matlab programme has been highly effective in controlling anaemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3acommunity health workers 3acomputer software 3afamily planning 3afolic acid 3ahealth services 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3apregnancy 3arural communities 3awomen 3aBangladesh1 aChakraborty, Jyatsnamoy1 aRice, Amy1 ade la Brière, Bénédicte1 aFrancisco, Andrés de,0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 19, no. 3 p.197-204dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826598019003043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04086naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012500183300001600308520204800324592002802372650002002400650001802420650002502438650002402463650001602487650002602503650001902529650003902548650002502587650001202612650002602624650001402650650001102664650001302675650001902688650001502707650006102722650003802783650005002821650005502871650005502926650006102981650002403042650002703066650002703093651001903120651001503139651001903154651001603173700002103189700002103210700002203231700002303253700002303276773009203299856004803391852000903439655001203448IND4469168520221118032758.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446916852DNAL7 a219940332pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-011-9952-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Polly G.10aInternal and External Influences on Near-Surface Microbial Community Structure in the Vicinity of the Cape Verde Islands  ap. 139-148.  aMicrobial community structure in the subtropical north-east Atlantic Ocean was compared between 2 years and variation attributed to environmental variables. Surface seawater communities were analysed by flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Probes specific to Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes identified 67–100% of cells. Due to natural variation in the study region due to the occurrence of major currents and islands, data could not be pooled but were instead divided between distinct water masses. Community structure did not differ greatly around the Cape Verde Islands between sampling periods but varied substantially in the open ocean, suggesting different environmental perturbations favour specific bacterial groups. Wind speed varied significantly between years, with moderate to strong breeze in winter 2008 and gales in winter 2006 (8.9 ± 0.2 ms−1 and 16.0 ± 0.4 ms−1, respectively). Enhanced wind-driven turbulence was associated with domination by the SAR11 clade of Alphaproteobacteria, which were present at 2.4-fold in the abundance of Prochlorococcus (41.8 ± 1.6% cells, compared to 17.7 ± 7.1%). Conversely, the calmer conditions of 2008 seemed to favour Prochlorococcus (40.0 ± 1.2% cells). Prochlorococcus high-light adapted clade HLI were only numerous during wind-driven turbulence, whereas oligotrophic-adapted clade HLII dominated under calm conditions. Bacteroidetes were most prominent in turbulent conditions (9.5 ± 1.3% cells as opposed to 4.7 ± 0.3%), as were Synechococcus. In 2008, a considerable dust deposition event occurred in the region, which may have led to the substantial Gammaproteobacteria population (22.5 ± 4.0% cells compared to 4.6 ± 0.6% in 2006). Wind-driven turbulence may have a significant impact on microbial community structure in the surface ocean. Therefore, community change following dust storm events may be linked to associated wind in addition to dust-derived nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProchlorococcus 3aSynechococcus 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3acommunity structure 3adust storms 3aenvironmental factors 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3aislands 3amicrobial communities 3anutrients 3aoceans 3aseawater 3aturbulent flow 3awind speed 2aAlphaproteobacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aAquatic Organismsxclassification 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBacteroidetesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCyanobacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGammaproteobacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMicrobial Consortia 2aPlanktonxmicrobiology 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aCape Verde 0aAtlantic Ocean 0aCabo Verde.1 aHeywood, Jane L.1 aHolland, Ross J.1 aPurdie, Duncan A.1 aFuchs, Bernhard M.1 aZubkov, Mikhail V.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2012 Jan., v. 63, no. 1 p.139-148dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-011-9952-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245007500173300001600248500001900264520088200283592002801165650001201193650001201205650001401217650001401231650001601245653001901261653002401280653001701304653002501321653002401346653002201370700002201392700002601414700002201440700002501462700002201487773012801509856008301637852000901720655001201729IND60688232920221118135945.0200427e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068823292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tree.2020.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuckerberg, Benjamin10aClimate Dipoles as Continental Drivers of Plant and Animal Populations  ap. 440-453.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEcological processes, such as migration and phenology, are strongly influenced by climate variability. Studying these processes often relies on associating observations of animals and plants with climate indices, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A common characteristic of climate indices is the simultaneous emergence of opposite extremes of temperature and precipitation across continental scales, known as climate dipoles. The role of climate dipoles in shaping ecological and evolutionary processes has been largely overlooked. We review emerging evidence that climate dipoles can entrain species dynamics and offer a framework for identifying ecological dipoles using broad-scale biological data. Given future changes in climatic and atmospheric processes, climate and ecological dipoles are likely to shift in their intensity, distribution, and timing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aclimate 3aevolution 3aphenology 3atemperature 0aclimate change 0aclimate variability 0amacroecology 0amacrosystems ecology 0apopulation dynamics 0aspatial synchrony1 aStrong, Courtenay1 aLaMontagne, Jalene M.1 aSt. George, Scott1 aBetancourt, Julio L.1 aKoenig, Walter D.0 tTrends in ecology & evolution.g2020 May, v. 35, no. 5 p.440-453dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:1990x0169-53477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2020.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008600176300001600262520104800278592002801326650004401354650002801398650000901426650001801435650004401453650001301497650003301510650001601543650002501559653002001584653002201604653001601626653002301642653002401665700002101689700002301710700002301733700005801756700002301814700002201837700001901859773010801878856008601986852000902072655001202081IND60525299520221122224438.0190318e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChejara, Dharmesh R.12aA bio-injectable algin-aminocaproic acid thixogel with tri-stimuli responsiveness  ap. 324-333.  aIn this article a novel bio-injectable algin-aminocaproic acid (Alg-ACA) tri-stimuli responsive thixogel system is reported. The designed soft thixotrophic hydrogel (thixogel) was characterized using various analytical techniques such as FT-IR, NMR, SEM, AFM and DSC. The soft thixogel system was further investigated for stress responsiveness using different rheological studies which confirmed the thixotropic nature of the gel [Thixotropic area (Ar) of Alg-ACA (1:0.5), Alg-ACA (1:1) and Alg-ACA (1:2), were 23.5%, 43.1%, and 27.59%, respectively, which were higher than that of Na-Alg (2.08%)]. The thixogel also demonstrated temperature and ultrasonication responsiveness. This tri-stimuli responsive soft thixogel system was rendered flowable (fluid) on applying the described physical stimuli and recovered its “rigid” gel structure upon removal of the applied stimuli. This approach of synthesizing a thixogels may be applicable to a broad variety of other natural polymers and has the potential for use in biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 0aSodium alginate 0aAminocaproic acid 0aThixothropy 0aStimuli-responsive 0aInjectable hydrogel1 aMabrouk, Mostafa1 aBadhe, Ravindra V.1 aMulla, Jameel A.S.1 aKumar, Pradeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8640-43501 aChoonara, Yahya E.1 aDu Toit, Lisa C.,1 aPillay, Viness0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 135 p.324-333dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245015700166300001600323500001500339520138800354592002801742650001301770650000901783650002301792650001201815650001401827650001501841650000901856650001401865650001201879650001401891650001401905650002001919650001001939653001501949700001901964773009201983856004802075852000902123655001202132IND4473799320221118032926.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447379932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-011-0945-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Sophie M.12aA mesocosm study of the role of the sedge Eriophorum angustifolium in the efflux of methane—including that due to episodic ebullition—from peatlands  ap. 207-218.  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND & AIM: Vascular plants may reduce episodic ebullition losses of methane (CH4) from peatlands. They transport CH4 to the atmosphere, which may lead to a reduction in pore-water [CH4], bubble formation and release. This effect may be compounded by rhizospheric oxidation and associated methanotrophy. However, any reduction in pore-water [CH4] may be countered by root exudation (substrate for methanogens). The aim of this study was to determine how the presence of sedges affects CH4 emissions from peatlands. METHODS: Five pairs of peat cores were collected from a raised bog. One of each pair contained Sphagnum cuspidatum and Eriophorum angustifolium (‘sedge’ cores); the other was dominated by S. cuspidatum (‘no-sedge’). From these the total CH4 efflux—including that due to episodic ebullition—were measured. A partial-shading treatment helped isolate the potential effect of root exudation. RESULTS: Sedge samples had significantly higher CH4 fluxes than no-sedge samples, but episodic-ebullition fluxes were not significantly different. Between full-light and partially-shaded conditions, there was a significant increase in the difference in CH4 fluxes between the sedge and no-sedge cores. CONCLUSION: The higher rates of CH4 flux from the sedge cores cannot be explained simply by higher rates of CH4 production due to rapid utilisation of exudates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3apeat 3amethane production 3abubbles 3apeatlands 3aEriophorum 3abogs 3aexudation 3amethane 3aoxidation 3aemissions 3avascular plants 3aroots 0aatmosphere1 aBaird, Andy J.0 tPlant and soil.g2012 Feb., v. 351, no. 1-2 p.207-218dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-011-0945-1  aDNAL 7aarticle01496naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245008000163300001800243520048500261592002800746650001100774650002100785650002300806650002300829650002200852650001200874700001500886700001800901700001500919700001700934773011700951856008101068852000901149655001201158IND60568309420221119201547.0170505e20170505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056830942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b003082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Xiaodong10aThermal Rearrangement of Sulfamoyl Azides: Reactivity and Mechanistic Study  ap. 4677-4688.  aThe rearrangement of sulfamoyl azides under thermal conditions to form a C–C bond while breaking two C–N bonds is reported.

We examined the time-course bioaccumulation of natural versus synthetic αT in tissues of young, marginally vitamin E-deficient mice using ¹³C-RRR-αT or ¹³C-all rac-αT tracers. In experiment 1, 3-week old male wild-type mice were fed a vitamin E-deficient diet for 0, 1, 2, or 3 weeks (n = 5/time point). Tissue αT levels were analyzed by HPLC-PDA. Feeding a vitamin E-deficient diet for up to 3 weeks decreased total αT concentrations in all analyzed tissues except the brain, which maintained its αT level. In experiment 2, a 2-week αT-depletion period was followed by administration of a single oral dose of 0.5 mg of ¹³C-RRR-αT or ¹³C-all rac-αT. At 12 hr, 1, 2, and 4 days post-dose, serum and multiple tissues were collected (n = 3/time point). αT was quantified by HPLC-PDA, and ¹³C-αT enrichment was determined by LC-MS. Both sources of ¹³C-αT reached maximum serum levels at 12 hr post-dose. ¹³C-RRR-αT levels were significantly higher than ¹³C-all rac-αT in serum at 1 d post-dose, and in heart, lungs, and kidney at 2d post-dose. In brain, ¹³C-RRR-αT concentrations were significantly higher than ¹³C-all rac-αT at 2 and 4 d post-dose. At 4 d post-dose, ¹³C-αT levels were similar between the 2 sources in examined tissues except for brain and adipose tissue where ¹³C-RRR-αT was higher. In conclusion, αT bioaccumulation over time varied substantially depending on αT source and tissue type.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abioaccumulation 3ablood serum 3abrain 3adiet 3aheart 3akidneys 3anutrition research 3aoral administration 0aVitamin E 0aRRR-α-tocopherol 0aAll rac-α-tocopherol 0aIsotopic tracer 0aMass spectrometry 0aα-CEHC 0aAPCI 0aall rac 0aαT 0aα-TTP 0aHPLC 0aPDA 0aQ-TOF-MS 0aVLDL1 aLi, Qiyao1 aRanard, Katherine M1 aRubakhin, Stanislav S.,1 aSweedler, Jonathan V.,1 aKuchan, Matthew J1 aErdman, John W.,0 tNutrition research.g2021 Sept., v. 93 p.79-86dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2021.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012400166520098700290592002801277650001401305650001401319650002501333650001201358650001301370650001501383650001101398650001001409650002501419650001101444653001201455653002001467653002501487653002001512653002501532700001301557700001801570773010801588856008601696852000901782655001201791IND60766313120221122233719.0220423e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076631312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1192172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Xixun10aEffect of pretreatments on production of xylooligosaccharides and monosaccharides from corncob by a two-step hydrolysis  aXylan extraction by alkali is usually a prerequisite for traditional xylooligosaccharide (XOS) production from corncob. In this study, to avoid xylan isolation before XOS production, corncob was delignified by hydrogen peroxide-acetic acid (HPAA), followed by a two-step enzymatic hydrolysis for XOS and monosaccharide production. High lignin removal (55.5%–82.6%) was observed upon pretreatment with 75%–100% HPAA and using 50–100 mM H₂SO₄ as a catalyst. A high XOS yield of 27.8% was obtained from 75% HPAA-pretreated corncob with 75 mM H₂SO₄, and the xylose/XOS ratio was only 0.09, indicating that the purity of XOS was relatively high. The highest glucose yield (79.1%) was obtained from 100% HPAA-pretreated corncob with 50 mM H₂SO₄. Finally, 58.3 g of XOS, 186.9 g of glucose, and 56.4 g of xylose were obtained from 1 kg of corncob. This study provides a promising approach for XOS and monosaccharide production from corncob without xylan isolation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acorn cobs 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aglucose 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3axylan 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylose 0aCorncob 0aDelignification 0aXylooligosaccharides 0aMonosaccharides 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis1 aXu, Feng1 aZhang, Junhua0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 June 01, v. 285 p.119217-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1192173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100003000157245010700187300001400294506002800308520161400336592002801950506003701978650000802015650001102023650001402034650001102048650001002059650001502069650003302084650001002117650001602127650001902143653004202162653001402204653001302218653001402231653001402245700001202259700001402271773014902285856009202434852000902526655001202535IND60784522220221207090521.0180807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078452222DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.industria.2016.005.02.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulungan, Maimunah Hindun10aPenentuan Umur Simpan Pia Apel dengan Metode ASLT (Studi Kasus Di UMKM Permata Agro Mandiri Kota Batu)  ap. 61-66.  aResource is Open Access  aAbstrak Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui umur simpan pia apel dengan metode Accelerated Shelf Life Testing berdasarkan persamaan Arrhenius.

This study design aimed to characterize the BNC produced by three different bacterial strains and compare their effectiveness for wound healing applications. The results demonstrated that the upper surfaces of the BNC membranes were clearly denser and more compact than the lower surfaces, while all varieties were capable of serving as a physical barrier to the invasion of bacteria. The growth of fibroblasts demonstrated that the lower surfaces of BNC membranes exhibited biocompatibility superior to that of the upper surfaces. In vivo analysis indicated that, of all samples, wounds treated with the BNC membrane synthesized by DHU-WX-1 displayed the greatest wound repair efficacy. The results indicate that BNC biosynthesized by different strains displayed different wound healing effectiveness. Placing the lower surface of BNC membranes in contact with wounds, with the denser upper surface outward, satisfied the clinical requirements of a wound repair biomaterial.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acellulose 3aexperimental design 3afibroblasts 0aBacterial nanocellulose 0aBiomaterial 0aWound dressing 0aStrain effect 0aWound healing1 aChen, Lin1 aHong, Feng F.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 June 01, v. 285 p.119218-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1192183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013000166300001600296520109200312592002801404650001201432650001801444650001601462651001301478653001601491653003001507653001901537653001301556653000801569653000801577653000801585653000801593700001701601773009101618856005101709852000901760655001201769IND50086629420221116175005.0140412e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008662942DNAL7 a10.1080/03031853.2012.7412102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZikhali, P.10aExplaining productivity differences between beneficiaries of Zimbabwe's Fast Track Land Reform Programme and communal farmers  ap. 144-166.  aIn the year 2000 the government of Zimbabwe launched the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) as part of its on-going land reform and resettlement programme. The main premise of the programme is to address the racially skewed land distribution pattern inherited at independence in 1980. While the programme has been accompanied by an overall reduction in agricultural production which has created widespread food insecurity throughout the country, empirical research on the impact of the programme on the agricultural productivity of its beneficiaries has been limited. This paper uses data on beneficiaries of the programme and a control group of communal farmers to (i) investigate the presence of agricultural productivity differences between beneficiaries and communal farmers, and (ii) examine differences in chemical fertiliser use as a possible source of these differences. The results suggest that FTLRP beneficiaries gain a productivity advantage not only from the fact that they use more fertiliser per hectare, but also from attaining a higher rate of return from its use.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarmers 3afood security 3aland reform 3aZimbabwe 0aLand reform 0aagricultural productivity 0afertiliser use 0aZimbabwe 0aD24 0aQ12 0aQ15 0aQ181 aChilonda, P.0 tAgrekon.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 51, no. 4 p.144-166dTaylor & Francis Groupx2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2012.741210  aDNAL 7aarticle03843naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245009700181300001600278520236900294592002802663650001102691650003202702650001602734650001802750650001602768650001402784650002202798650001702820650001502837650001502852650000902867650002302876650001302899650001502912650001502927650002002942650001202962650001602974650001402990650000903004700001803013700002003031700002403051700002603075700002403101773010903125856008203234852000903316655001203325IND60621493620221121223854.0181117s1998    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062149362DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826598019004042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuzina-Suboticanec, Kornelia10aEffects of Iron Supplementation on Iron Nutrition Status and Cognitive Functions in Children  ap. 298-306.  aThis study examined the effect of iron supplementation on cognitive function by a double-blind intervention trial in nine-year-old mildly anaemic schoolchildren. Their nutritional status was assessed by anthropometric measurements and the following biochemical values: haemoglobin, haematocrit, red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation. in addition, biochemical values of vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, and zinc were measured. the cognitive assessment was performed using an abbreviated Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) containing six subtests: arithmetic, similarities, digit span, picture completion, block design, and digit symbol (coding), in order to obtain information on both verbal and non-verbal aspects of intelligence. There were highly significant correlations of the WISC-R scores with initial height-for-age, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and transferrin saturation, and a correlation with MCHC. After completion of the baseline examination, one group of children was given a supplement containing 100 mg of iron for 10 weeks while the other group received a placebo. Iron supplementation had a positive effect on the biochemical measures of iron status, with haemoglobin, haematocrit, transferrin saturation, RBC, MCH, and MCHC all showing statistically significant increases (p< .05). Iron supplementation also resulted in a statistically significant improvement in total WISC-R score (p < .01). This effect was primarily the result of improved performance on non-verbal subtests, of which improvements in block design and coding were statistically significant (p < .01). the small increase in the sum of scaled scores from the verbal subtest was not significant (p > .05), but within the verbal subtest there was a significant improvement on the similarities part of the test (p < .05). the effects of iron supplementation were more pronounced in children with initially lower haemoglobin values. It is concluded that iron supplementation in nine-year-old schoolchildren with haemoglobin levels between 110 and 119 g/L will result in an improvement of cognitive functions, even though they are not otherwise malnourished.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3aanthropometric measurements 3aarithmetics 3aascorbic acid 3ablood serum 3acognition 3aerythrocyte count 3aerythrocytes 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3anutritional status 3aplacebos 3apyridoxine 3ariboflavin 3aschool children 3athiamin 3atransferrin 3avitamin A 3azinc1 aBuzina, Ratko1 aStavljenic, Ana1 aTadinac-Babic, Meri1 aJuhovic-Markus, Vesna1 aScrimshaw, Nevin S.0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 19, no. 4 p.298-306dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826598019004043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245017300174300001800347520062200365592002800987650001901015650001201034650001601046650001101062650001201073650001201085650002901097650001201126651001901138653002601157653002301183653001301206653002001219653002301239773010001262856008701362852000901449655001201458IND60564931920221122114016.0180830e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056493192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewbery, David M.10aTowards a green energy economy?

We demonstrated that methotrexate (MTX) clearly induced EMT through the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-related signaling pathway in human alveolar epithelial cell line, A549. However, critical factors associated with MTX-induced EMT have not yet been identified. In our study, we attempted to identify factors playing a crucial role in MTX-induced EMT in A549 cells. We focused on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as the possible target for the prevention of MTX-induced EMT-related lung injury. Comprehensive gene expression analysis by microarray revealed that mRNA expression level of PAI-1 was clearly increased by MTX treatment. In addition, using several cloned A549 cells, we found a good correlation between MTX-induced increase in mRNA expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), a representative EMT marker, and PAI-1. Furthermore, MTX upregulated mRNA and protein expression levels of PAI-1 in A549 cells; this upregulation was canceled by co-treatment with SB431542, a TGF-β-related signaling pathway inhibitor. Notably, tiplaxtinin, a PAI-1 inhibitor, and knockdown of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) prevented MTX-induced EMT in A549 cells. These findings indicate that MTX may induce EMT via upregulation of PAI-1 expression and interaction of PAI-1 with uPAR in A549 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3ahumans 3alungs 3amethotrexate 3amicroarray technology 3amuscles 3aplasminogen activator inhibitors 3aprotein synthesis 3aresearch 3au-plasminogen activator 0aEpithelial-mesenchymal transition 0aPlasminogen activator inhibitor-1 0aPulmonary fibrosis 0aUrokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor 0aepithelial-mesenchymal transition 0aplasminogen activator inhibitor-1 0aα-smooth muscle actin 0aurokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor1 aKawami, Masashi1 aOjima, Takamichi1 aFutatsugi, Sorahito1 aYumoto, Ryoko1 aTakano, Mikihisa0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 May 07, v. 525, no. 3 p.543-548dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.02.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010000162300001600262520075100278592002801029650002401057650001801081650002201099650001901121650001501140650001301155650003001168650002201198650001001220650001301230650001201243651001101255700002301266700002101289700002001310700002301330700002501353700003101378700001501409700002801424700002701452700002001479700002501499700002501524700001801549700001901567700001801586700002101604700003001625773011201655856008101767852000901848655001201857IND60120236720221122225919.0150131e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012023672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-014-0732-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYabe, John10aPathological and molecular diagnosis of the 2013 African swine fever outbreak in Lusaka, Zambia  ap. 459-463.  aAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious and fatal hemorrhagic viral disease of domestic pigs.

The current study describes the diagnostic investigations of a hemorrhagic disease that was reported in pigs in Lusaka (October 2013), Zambia. Necropsy, histopathology, and molecular diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis confirmed the disease to be ASF. The sequences obtained showed high similarity to previously isolated ASF viruses. Consistent surveillance and rapid diagnosis of the disease is recommended to prevent future outbreaks and economic losses as there is currently no vaccine against the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican swine fever 3aanimal health 3adisease diagnosis 3ahistopathology 3amonitoring 3anecropsy 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aZambia1 aHamambulu, Pharaoh1 aSimulundu, Edgar1 aOgawa, Hirohito1 aKajihara, Masahiro1 aMori-Kajihara, Akina1 aChangula-Chitanga, Katendi1 aMwase, Max1 aMweemba-Muwowo, Mutinta1 aChambaro, Herman Moses1 aMataa, Liywalii1 aHang’ombe, Bernard1 aNamangala, Bonniface1 aFandamu, Paul1 aSawa, Hirofumi1 aTakada, Ayato1 aHigashi, Hideaki1 aMweene, Aaron Simanyengwe0 tTropical animal health and production.g2015 Feb., v. 47, no. 2 p.459-463dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-014-0732-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04481naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002200183245012600205300001800331506007600349520156700425592002801992506003702020650003002057650001502087650001702102650001602119650001302135650002902148650001402177650002702191650001702218650002402235650001502259650001502274650001202289650001802301650001302319650001202332650001402344650001102358650001502369650001702384650006902401650006302470650005002533650001402583650003302597650002502630650002802655650001002683650004502693650002402738650002302762650004602785650007102831650004202902650003302944650003602977650001203013650002303025700001803048700001603066700002503082700002203107700002103129700001803150700002103168700002303189700001803212700002103230700001603251700002003267700001903287700002103306700002103327700002003348773010803368856008203476852000903558655001203567IND4473409620221207101407.0120502e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447340962DNAL7 a217649922pmid7 aPMC32262022pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.111.0868762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolleter, Dimitri10aControl of Hydrogen Photoproduction by the Proton Gradient Generated by Cyclic Electron Flow in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 2619-2630.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHydrogen photoproduction by eukaryotic microalgae results from a connection between the photosynthetic electron transport chain and a plastidial hydrogenase. Algal H2 production is a transitory phenomenon under most natural conditions, often viewed as a safety valve protecting the photosynthetic electron transport chain from overreduction. From the colony screening of an insertion mutant library of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii based on the analysis of dark-light chlorophyll fluorescence transients, we isolated a mutant impaired in cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF) due to a defect in the Proton Gradient Regulation Like1 (PGRL1) protein. Under aerobiosis, nonphotochemical quenching of fluorescence (NPQ) is strongly decreased in pgrl1. Under anaerobiosis, H2 photoproduction is strongly enhanced in the pgrl1 mutant, both during short-term and long-term measurements (in conditions of sulfur deprivation). Based on the light dependence of NPQ and hydrogen production, as well as on the enhanced hydrogen production observed in the wild-type strain in the presence of the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, we conclude that the proton gradient generated by CEF provokes a strong inhibition of electron supply to the hydrogenase in the wild-type strain, which is released in the pgrl1 mutant. Regulation of the trans-thylakoidal proton gradient by monitoring pgrl1 expression opens new perspectives toward reprogramming the cellular metabolism of microalgae for enhanced H2 production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aaerobiosis 3aanaerobiosis 3achlorophyll 3acyanides 3aelectron transport chain 3aelectrons 3aferredoxin hydrogenase 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen production 3amicroalgae 3amonitoring 3amutants 3aphotosystem I 3aproteins 3aprotons 3ascreening 3asulfur 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aCarbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazonexpharmacology 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aElectron Transportxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aElectrons 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHydrogenxmetabolism 2aHydrogenasexmetabolism 2aLight 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complexxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProton Ionophoresxpharmacology 2aProtons 2aSulfurxmetabolism1 aGhysels, Bart1 aAlric, Jean1 aPetroutsos, Dimitris1 aTolstygina, Irina1 aKrawietz, Danuta1 aHappe, Thomas1 aAuroy, Pascaline1 aAdriano, Jean-Marc1 aBeyly, Audrey1 aCuiné, Stéphan1 aPlet, Julie1 aReiter, Ilja M.1 aGenty, Bernard1 aCournac, Laurent1 aHippler, Michael1 aPeltier, Gilles0 tplant cell.g2011 July, v. 23, no. 7 p.2619-2630dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.0868763Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle04679naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002800188245015300216300001200369506007600381520218600457592002802643596002902671596004802700596004902748506003702797650002302834650001702857650001702874650001202891650001002903650002002913650002102933650001602954650001102970650001502981650001902996650002103015650002103036650002503057650002403082650001703106650001403123650001303137650001403150650001503164650001703179650003003196650001203226650002503238650001903263650001703282650002003299650001603319650002103335650001503356650001503371700002503386700002203411700002503433700002003458700002803478700001903506700003403525700002103559700003303580700002903613700002703642773011303669856008203782852000903864655001203873IND60685386020221207131037.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068538602DNAL7 a321223802pmid7 aPMC70531522pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-020-3959-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Barrio, David10aVascular wall injury and inflammation are key pathogenic mechanisms responsible for early testicular degeneration during acute besnoitiosis in bulls  ap. 113.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Bovine besnoitiosis, caused by the apicomplexan parasite Besnoitia besnoiti, is a chronic and debilitating cattle disease that notably impairs fertility. Acutely infected bulls may develop respiratory signs and orchitis, and sterility has been reported in chronic infections. However, the pathogenesis of acute disease and its impact on reproductive function remain unknown. METHODS: Herein, we studied the microscopic lesions as well as parasite presence and load in the testis (pampiniform plexus, testicular parenchyma and scrotal skin) of seven bulls with an acute B. besnoiti infection. Acute infection was confirmed by serological techniques (IgM seropositive results and IgG seronegative results) and subsequent parasite detection by PCR and histological techniques. RESULTS: The most parasitized tissue was the scrotal skin. Moreover, the presence of tachyzoites, as shown by immunohistochemistry, was associated with vasculitis, and three bulls had already developed juvenile tissue cysts. In all animals, severe endothelial injury was evidenced by marked congestion, thrombosis, necrotizing vasculitis and angiogenesis, among others, in the pampiniform plexus, testicular parenchyma and scrotal skin. Vascular lesions coexisted with lesions characteristic of a chronic infection in the majority of bulls: hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and a marked diffuse fibroplasia in the dermis of the scrotum. An intense inflammatory infiltrate was also observed in the testicular parenchyma accompanied by different degrees of germline atrophy in the seminiferous tubules with the disappearance of various strata of germ cells in four bulls. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that severe acute besnoitiosis leads to early sterility that might be permanent, which is supported by the severe lesions observed. Consequently, we hypothesized that testicular degeneration might be a consequence of (i) thermoregulation failure induced by vascular lesions in pampiniform plexus and scrotal skin lesions; (ii) severe vascular wall injury induced by the inflammatory response in the testis; and (iii) blood-testis barrier damage and alteration of spermatogenesis by immunoresponse.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL-2016-75202-RcMINECO  aPLATESA P2018/BAA-4370cCommunity of Madrid  aFJCI-2016-27875cSpanish Ministry of Science0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBesnoitia besnoiti 3aacute course 3aangiogenesis 3aatrophy 3abulls 3acattle diseases 3achronic diseases 3acoccidiosis 3adermis 3agerm cells 3ahyperkeratosis 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainfectious diseases 3ainflammation 3ajuveniles 3aorchitis 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3apathogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascrotum 3aseminiferous tubules 3aseroprevalence 3askin lesions 3aspermatogenesis 3atachyzoites 3athermoregulation 3athrombosis 3avasculitis1 aDiezma-Díaz, Carlos1 aTabanera, Enrique1 aAguado-Criado, Elena1 aPizarro, Manuel1 aGonzález-Huecas, Marta1 aFerre, Ignacio1 aJiménez-Meléndez, Alejandro1 aCriado, Fernando1 aGutiérrez-Expósito, Daniel1 aOrtega-Mora, Luis Miguel1 aÁlvarez-García, Gema0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.113-113dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-3959-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014900174300001400323520148300337592002801820650002501848650002601873650002401899650002501923650001201948650001901960650001501979650002101994650001102015650002102026650001702047651001702064653001802081653001802099653001802117653001702135653000802152653000802160700001302168773008902181856005102270852000902321655001202330IND50086629820221116174618.0140412e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008662982DNAL7 a10.1080/03031853.2013.7784662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeijden, T. van der10aGood for whom? Supermarkets and small farmers in south africa – a critical review of current approaches to increasing access to modern markets  ap. 68-86.  aSmall-scale agriculture is one of the few tools available to support improved rural livelihoods on a significant scale in South Africa. Access to output markets is a key factor in generating higher incomes. The rise of modern markets (supermarkets in particular) is generally viewed as positive for the rural poor, although most commentators accede that there are challenges to be overcome in obtaining access to such markets. These challenges are generally perceived as supply-side issues: That is, the “fault” for market exclusion lies largely with small producers – their production methods, their business organisation and their location – rather than with these markets themselves. This study asserts that much of the research that has been undertaken in this area is in fact incomplete, because it has excluded two key issues: The likely impact of the dominant supermarket business model on small farmers; and the actual position of small farmers in those countries with high levels of supermarket concentration. A closer examination of the supermarket model suggests it is inherently hostile towards smaller producers. The South African food retail market structure resembles that of industrialised countries rather than developing countries. Therefore, we should expect that the position of South African small farmers vis-à-vis supermarkets is similar to that of small farmers in industrialised countries, who are increasingly excluded from these value chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3abusiness organization 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3afarmers 3afood retailing 3alivelihood 3amarket structure 3amodels 3aretail marketing 3asupermarkets 3aSouth Africa 0amarket access 0asmall farmers 0asupply chains 0aSouth Africa 0aD11 0aQ131 aVink, N.0 tAgrekon.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 52, no. 1 p.68-86dTaylor & Francis Groupx2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2013.778466  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015800168300001600326520198400342592002802326596005102354596006102405650001602466650001702482650002002499650001602519650002302535650001302558650002602571650001802597650001402615650001302629700001902642700005802661773012802719856008302847852000902930655001202939IND60771502520221117222359.0220325e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077150252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-021-02674-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Young Kyun10aPotential influence of the proliferation of sediment-based diatoms on blooms of a harmful dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides: a microcosm approach  ap. 953-964.  aTyphoons cause significant environmental damage in coastal areas and one of their effects is the suspension of the resting stage cells of diatoms from the surface sediment. We performed microcosm experiments in 10-L containers using natural sediments from three different sites of southern Korean coastal waters (Geoje, Goheung, and Tongyeong) to simulate the effect of suspension of sediment-based diatoms by a typhoon on blooms of the harmful dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides. This dinoflagellate grew well under control conditions and exhibited a maximum abundance of 985 cells mL⁻¹ on day 10, but all treatment groups (Geoje, Goheung, and Tongyeong) had decreased abundances by day 4 and fewer than 50 cells mL⁻¹ on day 10. As C. polykrikoides declined, two diatoms (Skeletonema spp. and Chaetoceros spp.) dominated in the three treatment groups. In particular, these diatoms increased to 2.9 × 10⁴ cells mL⁻¹ on day 5 and 2.3 × 10⁴ cells mL⁻¹ on day 7 in the Geoje group. A multivariate redundancy analysis indicated a negative correlation between the abundances of C. polykrikoides and Chaetoceros spp., and this corresponded to the sharpest decrease of C. polykrikoides in the Geoje group. There were also changes in the bacterial community associated with changes in phytoplankton. During the early phase, when C. polykrikoides was dominant, Rhodobacterales prevailed (> 50%) in all treatment groups, and the proportion of these bacteria in the Geoje group decreased earlier than in the other groups. At the end of the experiment, there was a high proportion of Verrucomicrobiales, suggesting that sediment addition led to changes in the bacterial community. Overall, our microcosm experiments suggest that the significant environmental changes following the passage of a typhoon, especially the suspension and proliferation of sediment-based diatoms, directly affects the bacterial community and decreases blooms of C. polykrikoides.  aPublisher supplied data  a20163MFDS641cMinistry of Food and Drug Safety  aPE99912cKorea institute of ocean science and technology 3aChaetoceros 3aCochlodinium 3aRhodobacterales 3aSkeletonema 3aVerrucomicrobiales 3aalgology 3abacterial communities 3aphytoplankton 3asediments 3atyphoons1 aHong, Seongjin1 aBaek, Seung Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5402-25180 tJournal of applied phycology.g2022 Apr., v. 34, no. 2 p.953-964dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02674-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04095naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245016500205520200700370592002802377650001902405650001402424650001602438650001602454650001802470650001102488650001802499650002502517650001402542650001802556650000902574650002102583650001502604650002602619653000702645653000702652653000802659653000802667653000902675653000902684653000902693653000802702653000802710653001002718653001002728653000702738653001002745653000702755653000902762653000902771653000902780653001102789653000802800653001102808653001102819653001102830653000902841653000702850653000802857653002302865653001702888653002202905700006202927700001902989700001803008700005703026700005903083773009203142856008203234852000903316655001203325IND60746029920221119193346.0210904e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2021.1528722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHering, Henrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3951-673610aPhototoxic versus photoprotective effects of tattoo pigments in reconstructed human skin models: In vitro phototoxicity testing of tattoo pigments: 3D versus 2D  aThe increasing number of tattooed persons urges the development of reliable test systems to assess tattoo associated risks. The alarming prevalence of 60 % phototoxic reactions in tattoos ask for a more comprehensive investigation of phototoxic reactions in tattooed skin.Here, we aimed to compare the cellular responses of human skin cells to ultraviolet (UV)A and UVB irradiation in doses of short to intermitted sun exposure (3–48 J/cm² and 0.05–5 J/cm², respectively) in the presence of tattoo pigments. Therefore, we used fibroblast monolayer culture (2D), our recently developed three dimensional full-thickness skin model with dermal-located tattoo pigments (TatSFT) and its dermal equivalents (TatSDE) that lack keratinocytes. We tested the most frequently used tattoo pigments carbon black, titanium dioxide (TiO₂) anatase and rutile as well as Pigment Orange (P.O.)13 in ranges from 0.067 to 2.7 ng/cell in 2D. For TatSDE and TatSFT, concentrations were 1.3 ng/cell for TiO₂, 0.67 ng/cell for P.O.13 and 0.067 ng/cell for carbon black. We assessed cell viability and cytokine release in all systems, and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation in TatSFT.Phototoxicity of tattoo pigments was exclusively observed in 2D, where especially TiO₂ anatase induced phototoxic effects in all concentrations (0.067–2.7 ng/cell). In contrast, fibroblasts were protected from UV irradiation in TatSDE by TiO₂ and carbon black. Neither toxic nor protective effects were recorded in TatSFT. P.O.13 showed altered cytokine secretion in 2D (0.067–1.3 ng/cell) and TatSDE, despite the absence of significant effects on viability in all systems. All pigments reduced the number of CPDs in TatSFT compared to the pigment-free controls.In conclusion, our study shows that within a 3D arrangement, intradermal tattoo pigments may act photoprotective despite intrinsic phototoxic properties in 2D. Thus, dermal 3D equivalents should be considered to evaluate acute tattoo pigment toxicology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3acytokines 3afibroblasts 3airradiation 3akeratinocytes 3amodels 3aphototoxicity 3aradiation resistance 3asecretion 3askin (animal) 3asoot 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicology 3aultraviolet radiation 0a2D 0a3D 0aBSA 0aCPD 0aDMEM 0aDPBS 0aED50 0aEGF 0aFBS 0aG-CSF 0aHEPES 0aIL 0aMCP-1 0aMM 0aNaOH 0aNHDF 0aPAHs 0aP.O.13 0aROS 0aTatSDE 0aTatSFT 0aTGF-α 0aTiO2 0aUV 0avis 0aTissue engineering 0aCarbon black 0aPigment Orange 131 aZoschke, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2535-36061 aKönig, Frank,1 aKühn, Markus1 aLuch, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5866-901X1 aSchreiver, Ines1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9313-71930 tToxicology.g2021 Aug., v. 460 p.152872-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.1528723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245017500164300001600339520180400355592002802159650000902187650001702196650002802213650001802241650001602259650002002275650001002295650002302305650001102328650001002339650002302349650001902372650002002391650001202411650001602423651001002439700001902449700001802468700001902486773010902505856008202614852000902696655001202705IND60621494020221121223836.0181117s1998    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062149402DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826598019004082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeme, M.

Daily caloric consumption in the group with a feeding programme was significantly higher than in the group without a feeding programme: 1,590 kcal, or 86% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA), versus 1,457 kcal, or 76% of the RDA (p < .05). the protein intake was mainly of plant origin. Although not significantly different between the two groups, it was higher for children without a feeding programme (62 g; 238% of the RDA) than for those with a feeding programme (56 g; 216% of the RDA). the prevalence of wasting among children with a feeding programme (9%) was significantly higher than among those without a feeding programme (2%) (p < .05). the level of stunting was about the same in both groups: 24% in the group with a feeding programme and 25% in the group without a feeding programme. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of underweight between the two groups. Overall, the nutritional status of girls was better than that of boys, although the difference was not statistically significant. It is evident that children participating in the feeding programme did not have a nutritional advantage over non-participants. Thus, there is need to evaluate school feeding programmes in Kenya to identify and address the weaknesses that curtail their impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboys 3achild growth 3adietary recommendations 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3afood purchasing 3agirls 3agrowth retardation 3aincome 3alunch 3anutritional status 3aprotein intake 3aschool children 3aschools 3aunderweight 3aKenya1 aKogi-Makau, W.1 aMuroki, N.

Although many reported PCCs have high thermal conductivity, the stability during thermal cycling endurance is often too low for practical use. This paper describes the development of a PCC with both high thermal conductivity and high cyclic durability. The PCCs were prepared by a hot-pressing method. Erythritol (melting point: 118°C, thermal conductivity: 0.73Wm⁻¹K⁻¹) was used as a PCM, and carbon fiber (thermal conductivity: 900Wm⁻¹K⁻¹ in the fiber direction) and indium particles (thermal conductivity: 82.8Wm⁻¹K⁻¹) were used as the high thermal conductivity fillers. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCC was measured using the laser flash method and the network structures were analyzed using energy dispersive spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Thermal cycling tests through the melting and solidification phases of the erythritol were performed to investigate the cyclic durability of the PCCs. We found that the indium particles melted during hot pressing, welding together the carbon fiber to produce a stable percolating network, which significantly enhanced the thermal conductivity and cyclic endurance of the PCCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3adurability 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aerythritol 3aindium 3amelting 3amelting point 3apressing 3asalts 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolidification 3athermal conductivity 3awelding 0aPhase change material 0aNetwork structure 0aLatent heat storage 0aThermal conductivity1 aZhu, Chunyu1 aNan, Sheng1 aTabuchi, Kazuki1 aWang, Shuangfeng1 aAkiyama, Tomohiro0 tApplied energy.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 179 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245021600168300001600384500001500400520172100415592002802136650002002164650001002184650002002194650001102214650001502225650001102240650001302251650001302264650001102277650001602288650001502304650001202319650001502331653000902346700002402355773009702379856004802476852000902524655001202533IND50063932720221118032635.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006393272DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-012-9449-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhani, Rouhollah10aSimultaneous Determination of Trace Amounts of Cobalt and Nickel in Water and Food Samples Using a Combination of Partial Least Squares Method and Dispersive Liquid–Liquid Microextraction Based on Ionic Liquid  ap. 386-394.  a2019-12-06  aA new, sensitive, and simple combined method including ionic liquid (IL)-based dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction and partial least squares method (PLS) was developed for simultaneous preconcentration and determination of cobalt and nickel in water and food samples. In this work, a small amount of an IL 1-hexyl-3-methylimmidazolium bis (trifluormethylsulfonyl)imid ([Hmim][Tf₂N]) as an extraction solvent was dissolved in ethanol as a disperser solvent and then the binary solution was rapidly injected by a syringe into the water sample containing Co²⁺ and Ni²⁺, which were complexed by 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol. After preconcentration, the absorbance of the extracted ions was measured in the wavelength range of 200–700 nm. The partial least squares method was then applied for simultaneous determination of each individual ion. The parameters controlling the behavior of the system were investigated and optimum conditions were selected. Eleven binary mixtures of cobalt and nickel were selected as the calibration set. The calibration models were validated with four synthetic mixtures containing the metal ions in different proportions, which were randomly designed. The best calibration model was obtained by using PLS-1 regression. Calibration graphs were linear in the range of 2.0–20.0 and 2.0–15.0 ng mL⁻¹ with a limit of detection of 0.65 and 0.32 ng mL⁻¹ for cobalt and nickel, respectively. The root mean square errors of prediction for cobalt and nickel were 0.4032 and 0.2980, respectively. Satisfactory results were reported for simultaneous determination of trace levels of cobalt and nickel in water, food, and geological certified reference material samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicroextraction 3afoods 3adetection limit 3acobalt 3aabsorbance 3amodels 3asolvents 3asyringes 3anickel 3awavelengths 3ametal ions 3aethanol 3aprediction 0aions1 aShemirani, Farzaneh0 tFood analytical methods.g2013 Apr., v. 6, no. 2 p.386-394dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-012-9449-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016100160300001600321520177500337592002802112650001802140650002402158650001702182650001202199650002002211650001702231650002302248650001802271650000902289650001402298650004302312650001302355650002002368650001802388650002202406650001402428650002602442650003602468700002102504700002502525700001802550700002102568773012202589856007402711852000902785655001202794IND60617736820221122225608.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061773682DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01491k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDihingia, Anjum10aProphylactic role of vitamin K supplementation on vascular inflammation in type 2 diabetes by regulating the NF-κB/Nrf2 pathway via activating Gla proteins  ap. 450-462.  aThere is no previous study that has examined the relationship between circulating vitamin K1 (VK1) and vascular inflammation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aims to examine the hypothesis that circulating VK1 deficiency may be associated with higher inflammation and insulin resistance in T2D patients and that VK1 supplementation regulates the NF-κB/Nrf2 pathway via activating VK-dependent Gla proteins and reduces vascular inflammation. The results showed that plasma VK1 levels were significantly lower and MCP-1, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly higher in T2D patients compared to those in the controls. The lower levels of VK1 in T2D patients were significantly and inversely correlated with MCP-1 and HOMA-IR, which suggests that VK1 supplementation may reduce the vascular inflammation and insulin resistance in T2D. Using a high fat diet-fed T2D mice model this study further demonstrated that VK1 supplementation (1, 3, 5 μg per kg BW, 8 weeks) dose-dependently decreased the body weight gain, glucose intolerance, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, HOMA-IR, and cytokine secretion (MCP-1 and IL-6) in T2D mice. Further cell culture studies showed that VK1 supplementation (1, 5, or 10 nM) decreased NF-κB phosphorylation and MCP-1 secretion and increased Nrf2 protein expression in high glucose (HG, 25 mM)-treated monocytes. Signal silencing studies with GGCX siRNA again depicted the role of VK-dependent Gla proteins in mediating the effect of VK1 on vascular inflammation in HG-treated cells. In conclusion, this study suggests that circulating VK1 has a positive effect in lowering vascular inflammation in T2D by regulating NF-κB/Nrf2 transcription factors via activating VK-dependent Gla proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abody weight changes 3acell culture 3aglucose 3aglycohemoglobin 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3amonocytes 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3aphylloquinone 3aprotein synthesis 3asecretion 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aOzah, Dibyajyoti1 aBaruah, Pranab Kumar1 aKalita, Jatin1 aManna, Prasenjit0 tFood & function.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 9, no. 1 p.450-462dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01491k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137024004700177040001800224100002600242245012700268300001600395506002800411506003600439506007600475506003100551520098800582592002801570596004501598506003701643650001401680650001501694650001901709650001601728650001101744650001501755650000901770650001601779650001401795650001701809650001501826650001501841651001301856653001701869653001201886653001601898653002001914700002801934700002301962773009801985856008702083903002402170852000902194655001202203IND60564932520221207134542.0180830e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056493252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.1212chorus7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.1212doi7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.1212chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParkhurst, Kristen M.13aAn energy analysis comparing biomass torrefaction in depots to wind with natural gas combustion for electricity generation  ap. 171-181.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aBiomass torrefaction and wind power with natural gas are compared to determine which renewable energy system to adopt when both plant biomass and wind are available. The renewability of both systems was compared in terms of energy return on investment (EROI) by quantifying the fossil energy input and renewable energy output. On the basis of a functionally equivalent amount of electrical power (100MWe) and heat (50MWth), a breakeven wind velocity of 9.875m/s resulted in both systems having the same EROI. In regions with available biomass feedstock, facilities suitable for biomass power and wind velocities below 9m/s, torrefaction is a more renewable approach. Conversely, regions with velocities greater than 10m/s or little access to biomass sources and facilities, wind combined with natural gas is superior. Due to average wind speeds below 10m/s and the wide availability of biomass in Michigan, the torrefaction bioenergy system outperforms the wind–natural gas system.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioenergy 3acombustion 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3anatural gas 3aphytomass 3atorrefaction 3awind power 3awind speed 3aMichigan 0aTorrefaction 0aBiomass 0aWind energy 0aEnergy analysis1 aSaffron, Christopher M.1 aMiller, Raymond O.0 tApplied energy.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 179 p.171-181dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.1213Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011800170300001800288520178700306592002802093650001402121650001302135650001402148650002002162650001302182650001002195650001402205650001502219650002602234650001602260650001302276651001202289653001402301653002602315653001902341653001102360653002602371653001602397700001702413700001902430773009802449856008602547852000902633655001202642IND60688234120221118134740.0200626e20200506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068823412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolastie, Anna10aSuccess of rotavirus vaccination in Finland, a register based study measuring impact beyond overall effectiveness  ap. 3766-3772.  aEven with vaccines available since 2006, rotavirus continues to be a major cause of acute gastroenteritis globally in children under 5 years old. Finland introduced the rotavirus vaccine to its national vaccination programme in 2009. Since then hospitalizations due to gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus (RVGE) and of all causes (AGE) have been reduced significantly in young children.We performed a retrospective analysis of data from register databases consisting of over 200 000 children aged 0.5-2 years. Children born before rotavirus vaccines were available (2002, 2003) and after the implementation of rotavirus vaccination programme (2014, 2015) were followed for episodes of acute infectious gastroenteritis. We calculated the incidences of hospital outpatient and inpatient episodes and used individual vaccination records to estimate the overall, total, direct and indirect vaccine effect (VE %).Among children born in 2014 and 2015, there was a 96% reduction in inpatient RVGE episodes and a 78% reduction in episodes of inpatient AGE compared to the pre-vaccination era, comprising the overall VE. Direct effectiveness was 96% and 53% for RVGE and AGE respectively. Herd effect i.e. indirect protection was estimated to be 67% against inpatient RVGE and 56% against inpatient AGE. Protection acquired by the vaccinated children when compared to pre vaccination era i.e. the total VE was 99% for inpatient RVGE and 79% for inpatient AGE.Although overall incidences for every disease type studied were reduced, rotavirus is still circulating with seasonality and there is a slight shift of disease towards the older age groups. Together with changes observed in the distribution of rotavirus genotypes, our results indicate that continuous monitoring is still necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3achildren 3adatabases 3agastroenteritis 3agenotype 3aherds 3ahospitals 3amonitoring 3aretrospective studies 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aFinland 0aRotavirus 0aAcute gastroenteritis 0aVaccine effect 0aImpact 0aVaccination programme 0aHerd effect1 aLeino, Tuija1 aOllgren, Jukka0 tVaccine.g2020 May 06, v. 38, no. 21 p.3766-3772dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245017300167300001600340520111900356592002801475650002201503650003701525650001501562650002401577650002201601650002201623650001301645650000901658650003701667650001601704650001801720650001901738650001901757650001601776650003301792650002001825653003401845653001501879653002001894653001801914653002001932700001701952700001801969700001201987700001601999700001802015773010802033856008602141852000902227655001202236IND60525300620221116153519.0190318e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052530062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zidan10aElectrospun cellulose acetate supported Ag@AgCl composites with facet-dependent photocatalytic properties on degradation of organic dyes under visible-light irradiation  ap. 322-328.  aElectrospun cellulose acetate (CA) membrane was employed as a support that provided sites for AgCl crystals in situ growth.

Almost 69% of industrial electricity use emanates from motor systems. IEE has traditionally been explained with technology-diffusion models. According to these models, increased diffusion of more effective motors and drives onto the market leads to improved efficiency. Electric motor systems are represented by three levels: electric motor, core motor system, and total motor system. The first and second levels are related to stand-alone technology measures while the third has a more operational character. Based on a unique dataset of implemented energy-efficiency motor system measures from the 100 most electricity-intensive industrial companies in Sweden, the aim of this paper is to study whether technology diffusion is a valid model for understanding improved energy efficiency in electricity-intensive industries. Results show that 59% of the implemented EEMs from the dataset go beyond technology diffusion models, implying a need for revised models to understand how energy efficiency and technology diffusion occur in energy-intensive industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aelectric motors 3aelectricity 3aempirical research 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy policy 3aindustry 3amarkets 3amodels 3atechnological change 3aSweden 0aIndustrial energy efficiency 0aEnergy efficiency potential 0aElectrical motor system levels 0aEnergy-intensive industry 0aEnergy policies 0aTechnology diffusion 0aAbsorptive capacity1 aNehler, Therese1 aThollander, Patrik0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Sept., v. 156 p.112433-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1124333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014900174300001600323520070100339592002801040650002301068650001401091650003201105650001801137650001501155650003201170650001601202650004401218650001001262650001801272653002301290653002101313653001401334653001501348653002401363653001701387653001201404653003001416700001801446700001901464700002401483700002501507700001701532773012201549856008501671852000901756655001201765IND60685705120221119095535.0200306e20200303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068570512DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.14970312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsman, Ahmed Galal10aGlycosides of ursane-type triterpenoid, benzophenone, and iridoid from Vangueria agrestis (Fadogia agrestis) and their anti-infective activities  ap. 683-691.  aFour ursane-type triterpenoid glycosides (1-4), two benzophenone glycosides (5 and 6), and one iridoid glucoside (7) were isolated and characterized from the dried roots of Vangueria agrestis.

We assessed long term HBV antibody persistence 10–11 years after primary vaccination in infancy.Antibody persistence and immune memory were assessed post-primary vaccination at 3, 5, 11–12 months with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib, or monovalent HBV vaccine (Engerix™ B, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines) co-administered with DTPa-IPV/Hib (Infanrix™-IPV/Hib, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines) in 185 children aged 11–12 years. Blood samples were collected before and 1 month after a challenge dose of Engerix™ B (10μg dose).10–11 years after primary vaccination the percentage of subjects with persisting anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥10mIU/ml was 48.4% in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group and 58.4% in the DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV group. After the HBV challenge dose, the percentage with anti-HBs ≥100mIU/ml increased from 14.7% to 93.6% in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group and 19.1% to 94.4% in the DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV group. Anti-HBs GMCs increased by at least 187-fold in each group. An anamnestic response (≥4-fold increase in initially seropositive or anti-HBs concentration ≥10mIU/ml in initially seronegative subjects) was observed in 96.8% and 96.6% of subjects in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV groups, respectively. No serious adverse events occurred that were considered related to challenge vaccination.Administration of HBV as part of a combination vaccine or as a monovalent vaccine induced long lasting immune memory against HBV in children primed at 3, 5 and 11 months of age. Antibody persistence and immune memory were similar, suggesting that protection afforded by DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and monovalent HBV vaccines, is likely to be of similar duration. The administration of HBV challenge dose 10–11 years after the 3, 5, 11–12 months primary schedule induced strong anamnestic responses and was well tolerated.This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.govNCT01138098.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aantibodies 3ablood sampling 3achildren 3ahepatitis B 3aimmunologic memory 3aseroprevalence 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aanti-HBs 0aATP 0aCI 0aCLIA 0aDTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib 0aDTPa-IPV/Hib 0aGMC 0aHBV 0aHBsAg 0aSAE 0aSD 0aWHO 0aHepatitis B 0aVaccine 0aImmune memory 0aPersistence 0aDTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib1 aCrasta, Priya D.1 aHardt, Karin1 aKovac, Martina0 tVaccine.g2015 May 28, v. 33, no. 23 p.2727-2733dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.06.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245013700182300001500319520151700334592002801851650001101879650001201890650001601902650001801918650001501936650001101951650001801962650001201980650002101992650001602013651001102029653001102040653001102051653001702062653001102079653001802090653003002108653000802138653000802146653000802154700002202162773009002184856005102274852000902325655001202334IND50086630420221116174710.0140412e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008663042DNAL7 a10.1080/03031853.2013.7980662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatchaya, Greenwell Collins14aThe impact of cooperative patronage: The case of National Small Holder Farmers’ Association (NASFAM) of Malawi in Kasungu District  ap. 75-103.  aThis paper analyses the impact of individual farmers’ participation in the National Smallholder Farmers’ Association of Malawi (NASFAM). Precisely the paper analyses the effect of participation on credit market access, fertilizer use and total incomes of its participants in the Kasungu district of Malawi. NASFAM is a form of producer cooperative with a number of socio-economic functions. Using data on income per capita, fertilizer expenditure and access to credit, this paper tests the hypothesis that participation in NASFAM positively impacted incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition. Employing Propensity Score Matching methodology to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATT) on programme members, this paper finds evidence that participation in NASFAM had a positive effect on all the endogenous variables. Membership enhances household level incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition and is hence in line with national goals of poverty reduction, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) principles, the SADC's Regional Indicative Strategy Development Plan (RISDP) and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on these findings and the fact that credit and fertilizer access are still problematic in Malawi's rural areas, it appears that there is great need for NASFAM to expand to areas where it currently does not have activities. Such expansion would ensure food security over a wider range of rural households through improved input access.  aPublisher supplied data 3acredit 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3amarket access 3apoverty 3aprogram planning 3arural areas 3aMalawi 0aNASFAM 0aimpact 0acooperatives 0aMalawi 0aparticipation 0apropensity score matching 0aQ12 0aQ13 0aQ181 aPerotin, Virginie0 tAgrekon.g2013 June 1, v. 52, no. 2 p.75-103dTaylor & Francis Groupx2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2013.798066  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008300174300001600257520079600273592002801069650001001097650001001107650000901117650000901126650001001135650002501145650001201170650000801182650001201190650000901202650001101211650001101222650001001233650001301243650001001256651001301266700002201279700001901301773010901320856008201429852000901511655001201520IND60621494420221121223845.0181117s1998    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062149442DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826598019004122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomnasang, Prapimporn10aIndigenous Knowledge of Wild Food Hunting and Gathering in North-East Thailand  ap. 359-365.  aRural people in north-east Thailand depend on locally gathered or hunted wild food, such as fish, crabs, snails, shrimps, birds, red ants’ eggs, frogs, toads, rabbits, rats, insects, and many kinds of plants.

In case of the Rhizophoraceae mangrove species, propagules are elongated cylinder-shaped seedlings that have an initial ability to float upon abscission from the parent tree. During the hydrochoric dispersal period, propagule traits (e.g. volume and density) change over time, which in parallel influences propagule buoyancy behaviour. Recently abscised, mature propagules of three rhizophoracean mangrove species (Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Sav., Ceriops tagal (Perr.) C.B. Rob., Rhizophora mucronata Lam.) were submitted to a three-month floating experiment to investigate the timing and pattern in their buoyancy behaviour linked to changes in propagule density. Anatomical analyses of the aerenchymatous tissues complemented the floatation data. Initial propagule density (between 0.96 (C. tagal) and 0.99gcm−3 (B. gymnorrhiza and R. mucronata)) was on slightly lower than that of seawater and increased over time in all species but at dissimilar rates. Intra-individual density increased from the plumule- towards the radicle end, and corresponded with a decrease in proportion of intercellular surface area per unit area. The interplay between propagule traits and surface water conditions determine the fate of each propagule and its capacity to escape the local forest and reach open water. The combination of techniques used and hence combination of data obtained in this study, contribute to an increased understanding of mangrove forest dynamics: the potential and the limits therein to expand the species range or to replenish existing populations with new recruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscission 3asurface area 3aseedlings 3aBruguiera gymnorhiza 3aRhizophora mucronata 3amangrove forests 3atrees 3aseawater 3asurface water 3aCeriops tagal 0aBuoyancy 0aIntercellular space 0aBruguiera gymnorrhiza 0aLight microscopy 0aecosystems 0aVivipary 0aHydrochory1 aBeeckman, Hans1 aRobert, Elisabeth M.R.1 aKoedam, Nico0 tAquatic botany.g2017 May, v. 140 p.23-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012400166300001400290520099600304592002801300650002201328650002001350650002401370650002301394650001301417650002501430650000901455650002101464650001201485650001701497650003101514650001801545650001301563650001601576650002101592650002501613650001601638653003001654653003201684653002101716653001601737700001701753700001201770700001701782700001201799773013301811856008701944852000902031655001202040IND60622698620221119141834.0190131e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062269862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.2072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rui10aEffects of different treatment methods on properties of potato starch-lauric acid complex and potato starch-based films  ap. 34-40.  aThe effects of different treatment methods on the physicochemical properties of potato starch (PS) and PS-based films were studied. The complexing indices of PS-lauric acid (LA) complexes followed the order: pullulanase debranching (PD) > ultrasound treatment (UT) > dimethyl sulfoxide heating (DSH) > Control. Light microscopy showed that PS-LA complexes exhibited irregularly shaped fragments. X-ray diffraction indicated that the diffraction intensity of the PD sample was stronger than that of the other samples. The melting enthalpies (△H) of the DSH, UT and PD samples were higher than that of the Control. PD sample had the lowest enzymatic-hydrolysis rate among all of the tested samples. PS-LA composite films showed higher tensile strength, lower elongation at break, and lower moisture permeability than native starch-based film, and the films prepared by PD method had the highest tensile strength and lowest water vapour permeability among all of the tested films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aenthalpy 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aheat 3alight microscopy 3amelting 3apermeability 3aphysicochemical properties 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3apullulanase 3atensile strength 3aultrasonic treatment 3awater vapor 0aPotato starch-based films 0aDifferent treatment methods 0aV-type complexes 0aLauric acid1 aLiu, Pengfei1 aCui, Bo1 aKang, Xuemin1 aYu, Bin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 124 p.34-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.2073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013500166520146300301592002801764650001501792650000801807650001901815650001401834650002301848650002101871650003001892650001701922650001401939650001401953650001601967650002701983650003102010653003002041653003402071653001902105653000902124653002502133700001802158700001402176700001802190700001402208700001702222773011402239856008602353852000902439655001202448IND60783418120221122230502.0220914e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Deqiao10aSelective catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde on single V- and Cr-atom decorated magnetic C4N3 substrate: A first principles study  aFormaldehyde (HCHO) is the most common indoor hazardous pollutant and has attracted great concern because its long-term exposure has adverse health effects on humans. Retention and catalytic oxidation of highly hazardous HCHO is an efficient and environmentally friendly method to use for air remediation, but a major obstacle to this procedure is the lack of an appropriate catalyst. Herein, two-dimensional magnetic C₄N₃ material with a 3d-transition metal as activate sites was systemically investigated in HCHO oxidation using density functional theory calculations. The results show that V-C₄N₃ and Cr-C₄N₃ have high structural stability and shallow activation barriers for O₂ decomposition; these characteristics provide the necessary precursors for the subsequent oxidation reaction. Moreover, the V-C₄N₃ and Cr-C₄N₃ catalysts have unique selective adsorption and catalysis toward HCHO in a mixture of some typical in-door volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and air. The corresponding dynamic barrier for each reaction step was investigated and the mechanism involved in HCHO oxidation was revealed in detail. Aggregation of metal atoms in the V-C₄N₃ and Cr-C₄N₃ catalysts is prevented by enormous diffusion resistance, and this is further confirmed by AIMD simulations. These results provide insightful guidance for developing advanced magnetic catalysts for HCHO oxidation to improve the remediation of air contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aair pollutants 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achronic exposure 3adensity functional theory 3aformaldehyde 3amagnetism 3aoxidation 3aremediation 3asustainable technology 3avolatile organic compounds 0aTwo-dimensional materials 0aFirst-principles calculations 0aHCHO oxidation 0aC4N3 0aSingle-atom catalyst1 aChen, Xianfei1 aHuang, Yi1 aZhang, Guanru1 aZhou, Dan1 aXiao, Beibei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 439 p.129608-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001800186245007400204300001100278506007600289520202700365592002802392506003702420650000802457650003502465650001602500650001402516650001002530650001302540650001102553650001302564650000902577650002502586650003502611650001402646651001202660651001902672700002302691700001902714700002002733773009702753856007902850852000902929655001202938IND50067072920221207060541.0150207e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006707292DNAL7 a237316282pmid7 aPMC36798752pmcid7 a10.1186/2046-0481-66-102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoloney, Emma10aLineages of Streptococcus equi ssp. equi in the Irish equine industry  ap. 44.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Streptococcus equi ssp. equi is the causative agent of ‘Strangles’ in horses. This is a debilitating condition leading to economic loss, yard closures and cancellation of equestrian events. There are multiple genotypes of S. equi ssp. equi which can cause disease, but to date there has been no systematic study of strains which are prevalent in Ireland. This study identified and classified Streptococcus equi ssp. equi strains isolated from within the Irish equine industry. RESULTS: Two hundred veterinary isolates were subjected to SLST (single locus sequence typing) based on an internal sequence from the seM gene of Streptococcus equi ssp equi. Of the 171 samples which successfully gave an amplicon, 162 samples (137 Irish and 24 UK strains) gave robust DNA sequence information. Analysis of the sequences allowed division of the isolates into 19 groups, 13 of which contain at least 2 isolates and 6 groups containing single isolates. There were 19 positions where a DNA SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) occurs, and one 3 bp insertion. All groups had multiple (2–8) SNPs. Of the SNPs 17 would result in an amino acid change in the encoded protein. Interestingly, the single isolate EI8, which has 6 SNPs, has the three base pair insertion which is not seen in any other isolate, this would result in the insertion of an Ile residue at position 62 in that protein sequence. Comparison of the relevant region in the determined sequences with the UK Streptococcus equi seM MLST database showed that Group B (15 isolates) and Group I (2 isolates), as well as the individual isolates EI3 and EI8, are unique to Ireland, and some groups are most likely of UK origin (Groups F and M), but many more probably passed back and forth between the two countries. CONCLUSIONS: The strains occurring in Ireland are not clonal and there is a considerable degree of sequence variation seen in the seM gene. There are two major clades causing infection in Ireland and these strains are also common in the UK.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aStreptococcus equi subsp. equi 3aamino acids 3adatabases 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahorses 3aindustry 3aloci 3anucleotide sequences 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astrangles 3aIreland 3aUnited Kingdom1 aKavanagh, Kerrie S1 aBuckley, Tom C1 aCooney, Jakki C0 tIrish veterinary journal.g2013 Dec., v. 66, no. 1 p.44-44dSpringer-Verlagx2046-04817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2046-0481-66-103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011100163300001600274500002000290520139400310592002801704650001301732650002301745650001301768650002201781650000901803650001801812650002401830650003201854650001201886650002301898650001901921650001901940650002301959650001301982650001201995650002502007700001902032700002202051700002402073773010602097856007302203852000902276655001202285IND60522645820221119151144.0160603e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052264582DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.124942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnantasook, Nirawan10aReducing methane production by supplementation of Terminalia chebula RETZ. containing tannins and saponins  ap. 783-790.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study investigates the effects of Terminalia chebula Retz. meal supplementation on rumen fermentation and methane (CH₄) production by using an in vitro gas technique. The experimental design was a completely randomized design (CRD) and the dietary treatments were T. chebula supplementation at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 mg with 0.5 g of roughage and concentrate ratio at 60:40. The results revealed that cumulative gas production (96 h of incubation) were higher (P < 0.01) with T. chebula supplementation at 12, 16 and 20 mg than other treatments. However, in vitro dry matter degradability (IVDMD) and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) were not significantly different among treatments (P > 0.05). The NH₃‐N concentrations tended to quadratically increase with increasing levels of T. chebula in the diet. In addition, total volatile fatty acids (VFA) and propionate concentrations were increased (P < 0.01), while acetate concentration, acetate‐to‐propionate ratio, CH₄ production and protozoal populations were decreased (P < 0.01) when supplemented with T. chebula at 8, 12 and 16 mg, respectively. Based on this study, it could be concluded that supplementation of T. chebula at 12 mg could improve rumen fermentation by reducing CH₄ production and protozoa populations, thus improving in vitro gas production and VFA profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aTerminalia chebula 3aacetates 3aammonium nitrogen 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aexperimental design 3agas production (biological) 3amethane 3amethane production 3aorganic matter 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3asaponins 3atannins 3avolatile fatty acids1 aWanapat, Metha1 aGunun, Pongsatorn1 aCherdthong, Anusorn0 tAnimal science journal =.g2016 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.783-790dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.124943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007700163300002000240520100400260592002801264650002101292650002601313650001001339650002501349650001301374773012501387856007401512852000901586655001201595IND60641173020221120133954.0190505e20160916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064117302DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra18911c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaidi, Shabi Abbas10aLatest trends in molecular imprinted polymer based drug delivery systems  ap. 88807-88819.  aMolecular imprinted polymers (MIP) are promising and versatile materials that have been used for the determination of many different analytes. In the last few years, MIPs have been substantially employed for various biomedical applications, especially drug delivery systems (DDS), owing to some of their unique features such as specific recognition by imprinting the desired analyte, suitability in rough experimental conditions, and targeted and sustained drug release. Hence, this review is focused on the development of strategies undertaken for their application to drug delivery systems involving several different administration routes (i.e. transdermal, ocular and oral routes) published between 2014 and now. Herein, we have also highlighted the summaries of published works, in order to gain a better understanding of the synthetic strategies employed and the analytical performances of the reported MIPs, in addition to pointing out the challenges and future perspectives of MIP based DDS.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical species 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymers0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 16, v. 6, no. 91 p.88807-88819dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra18911c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04048naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245014000165300001500305520237100320592002802691650001902719650001802738650001602756650001102772650001402783650001602797650001102813650001502824650001302839650001302852650001002865650001702875650001702892650002302909650002202932650001302954650001102967650001102978650001902989650001103008651001003019651001803029653001003047653000703057653002303064653002503087653002403112700001703136700001303153700001703166700001503183700001603198700001803214773010603232856008703338852000903425655001203434IND60629816820221122065739.0190325e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062981682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Lei10aEpisode study of fine particle and ozone during the CAPUM-YRD over Yangtze River Delta of China: Characteristics and source attribution  ap. 87-101.  aFine particle (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) are major air pollutants in China, especially in developed city clusters. A comprehensive field campaign, the Campaign on Air Pollution and Urban Meteorology in Yangtze River Delta (CAPUM-YRD), eastern China is carried out in 2016 to enhance the understanding of regional PM2.5 and O3 pollution. Two super sites in Shanghai, one in Hangzhou, as well as nineteen national monitoring stations in Nanjing and Hefei jointly participate in the campaign. In this study, regional PM2.5 and O3 pollution episodes are characterized based on summer and winter experiments during the CAPUM-YRD. Further, trajectory simulation and source apportionment technology in Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) are applied to explore the source of the pollution episodes. We find that regional synchronous PM2.5 pollution episodes (over 120 μg/m3) occur frequently in YRD. Secondary inorganic and carbonaceous components account for a major proportion (70–80%) in PM2.5. Nitrate concentration is significantly higher (lower) than sulfate in winter (summer). The secondary conversion of sulfur and nitrogen increases alongside elevated PM2.5 levels, with a maximum ratio of 0.28 and 0.18 in winter, respectively. Source apportionment results suggest that the contribution of emissions within YRD dominates in PM2.5 (over 60%) compared to other regions. The inter-regional transport from the north-northwest in eastern China can contribute over 20% to PM2.5 in YRD, with a maximum of 28.4% in Nanjing. Under the transport by enhanced northerly winds, PM2.5 concentrations may increase explosively, with observed peak values in Hefei (312.6 μg/m3) and Nanjing (255.7 μg/m3). Moreover, high levels and remarkable spatial heterogeneity of O3 are observed over YRD in summer, with daily maximum 8-h average O3 above 300 μg/m3 in Nanjing. The occurrence of O3 pollution episodes is significantly impacted by favorable weather conditions and transport at multiple spatial scales. Regional contribution results demonstrate that super-regional transport is prominent (29.4–50.7%) in O3 pollution, especially in coastal cities like Shanghai (30.3–63.0%). Our results suggest that enhanced regional collaboration and efforts are of extreme necessity in long-term and optimized control of severe PM2.5 and O3 pollution in YRD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acities 3aemissions 3ameteorology 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aozone 3aparticulates 3ariver deltas 3asource attribution 3aspatial variation 3asulfates 3asulfur 3asummer 3awind direction 3awinter 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aPM2.5 0aO3 0aRegional transport 0aSource apportionment 0aYangtze River Delta1 aWang, Tijian1 aXie, Min1 aLi, Mengmeng1 aZhao, Ming1 aZhang, Ming1 aZhao, Xiuyong0 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 203 p.87-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01596naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012100164300001800285520056200303592002800865650001500893650002000908650002300928650001600951650001200967650001500979650001400994650001901008650001601027700002401043773010701067856007501174852000901249655001201258IND60578764320180316000000.0170814e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057876432DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502395k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfister, Hélène

In addition, the Mokelumne River Fish Hatchery (Hatchery) contributes hatchery produced O. mykiss to the system annually. We conducted a 3 year acoustic tagging study to evaluate the migratory characteristics of LMR hatchery and natural-origin O. mykiss to the Pacific Ocean. Specifically, we analyzed downstream movement and migration rates, routes, and success of acoustically tagged O. mykiss of hatchery and natural origin under variable release locations in non-tidal and tidal habitats. Results from our study suggest there are significant differences in the proportion of hatchery and natural O. mykiss that demonstrate downstream movement. Fish origin, size, and release location all had a significant effect on whether an individual demonstrated downstream movement. Mokelumne origin O. mykiss that initiated downstream movement utilized numerous migration routes throughout the Delta during their migration towards the Pacific Ocean. We identified four primary migration pathways from the lower Mokelumne River through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta while the Delta Cross Channel was closed. However, several other pathways were utilized. Origin had a significant effect on O. mykiss success in reaching key points in the Delta and through the Estuary. Fish size had a significant effect on whether an individual reached the marine environment. Of the 467 O. mykiss tagged, 34 successfully reached the Pacific Ocean (Golden Gate Bridge), and of these, 33 were hatchery-origin and 1 was natural-origin. A higher proportion of hatchery-origin fish (10% of tagged) migrated to the ocean compared to natural-origin fish (<1%). Our study provides valuable information on the differences between hatchery and natural-origin O. mykiss migration characteristics as well as unique insight into the migratory behavior of little studied non-Sacramento River origin salmonids.  aPublisher supplied data 3arivers 3amarine environment 3aoceans 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afish 3ahabitats 3aestuaries 3ahatcheries 3aCentral Valley of California 3aPacific Ocean 0aCalifornia1 aWorkman, Michelle1 aMerz, Joseph0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2012 June, v. 94, no. 2 p.363-375dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9967-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01463naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016100158300001800319520041500337592002800752650001900780650001600799650002300815650002300838650001100861650002900872650001100901700001400912700002000926773010700946856007501053852000901128655001201137IND60578764420221116212554.0170814e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057876442DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502402s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhi-Qiang10aDehydrogenative Cross-Coupling Reaction by Cooperative Transition-Metal and Brønsted Acid Catalysis for the Synthesis of β-Quinolinyl α-Amino Acid Esters  ap. 4881-4883.  aA novel dehydrogenative cross-coupling (DCC) reaction between methylquinoline derivatives and N-aryl glycine esters was developed by a cooperative catalysis of copper salt and Brønsted acid, affording an efficient synthesis of β-quinolinyl α-amino acid esters.

The molecular basis of how females keep non-own cells alive is largely unknown, but since sperm cells are reported to be transcriptionally silenced and, therefore, limited in their ability to maintain their own function, it is likely that females actively participate in sperm maintenance. Because female contributions are likely to be of central importance for sperm survival, molecular insights into the process offer opportunities to observe mechanisms through which females manipulate sperm. RESULTS: We used the honeybee, Apis mellifera, in which queens are highly polyandrous and able to maintain sperm viable for several years. We identified over a hundred proteins representing the major constituents of the spermathecal fluid, which females contribute to sperm in storage. We found that the gel profile of proteins from spermathecal fluid is very similar to the secretions of the spermathecal gland and concluded that the spermathecal glands are the main contributors to the spermathecal fluid proteome. A detailed analysis of the spermathecal fluid proteins indicate that they fall into a range of different functional groups, most notably enzymes of energy metabolism and antioxidant defense. A metabolic network analysis comparing the proteins detected in seminal fluid and spermathecal fluid showed a more integrated network is present in the spermathecal fluid that could facilitate long-term storage of sperm. CONCLUSIONS: We present a large-scale identification of proteins in the spermathecal fluid of honeybee queens and provide insights into the molecular regulation of female sperm storage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApis mellifera 3aantioxidant activity 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzymes 3afemales 3agels 3apolyandry 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aqueen honey bees 3aspermatozoa 3astorage 3atranscription (genetics)1 aEubel, Holger1 aTaylor, Nicolas L.,1 aO'Toole, Nicholas1 aMillar, A.

However, aerosol optical depth (AOD) always has low spatial coverage, which not only affects the analysis of AOD but also harms many relevant applications of the data, such as utilization to estimate PM2.5. In our study, we utilize the random forest model, which is an effective ensemble learning method, to estimate the gaps of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD data with a spatial resolution of 0.01° × 0.01° in a typical contaminated region of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei during 2010–2016. Our model performs accurately in that the results of R2 testing exceed 0.9 and the final estimated AOD coverage achieves 100%. The average value of the AOD is 0.44 (0.41–0.47 by year) over the study period. The simulation values of AOD have an obvious seasonal distribution, with the highest AOD in summer. The AOD estimations in the southern region are higher than those in the northern region. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD observations are compared with MODIS AOD (R2 = 0.44) and AOD estimations (R2 = 0.36). We analyze and screen each of the variables to compute their contributions. Specifically, the elevation and 2-m dew point are the most important in modeling the AOD, while road data, snowfall depth and snowfall have the least impact on modeling the AOD. Practical applications of AOD data include estimating the various impacts of PM2.5 concentrations on health based on the AOD observations in China's typically polluted areas that have cloud influence. We compare two measurement ranges that will most accurately model and fill the AOD data missing in areas. After careful consideration, we determine that our preferred range is 0–2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3aclimate change 3adewpoint 3agovernmental programs and projects 3ahuman health 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aparticulates 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3asummer 3aChina 0aMODIS 0aRandom forest 0aMissing AOD data 0aEstimation1 aLiu, Zhaorong1 aWang, Qing1 aBan, Jie1 aChen, Nancy Xi1 aLi, Tiantian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2938-39170 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 203 p.70-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.01.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010900167520133800276592002801614650001901642650001701661650001001678650001601688650001401704650000701718650001901725650001301744650000901757650002001766653001901786653001801805653003101823653001701854653002701871700001201898700001401910700001801924700001601942700001701958700001901975700001401994773011402008856008602122852000902208655001202217IND60783418420221123001113.0220914e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yangfan10aInactivation of fungal spores in water by CuO-activated peracetic acid: Kinetics, mechanism and regrowth  aThe disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms in water treatment by peracetic acid (PAA)-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) has been gaining increasing concern. In this work, the inactivation mechanism, influencing factors and regrowth of two pathogenic Aspergillus species in the system of CuO-activated PAA were studied for the first time. The k values of A. niger and A. flavus inactivated by PAA/CuO system were 3.9 and 2.1-fold higher than those inactivated by PAA alone. PAA concentration and CuO dose were positively correlated with the inactivation efficiency, while humic acid and pH were negatively correlated. The main active species that contributed to the inactivation of fungal spores in PAA/CuO system were •OH, CH₃C(O)OO• and ¹O₂. PAA/CuO system had more intense oxidative stimulation and more serious damage to fungal spores according to the analysis of cell membrane integrity and intracellular ROS levels. In addition, the PAA/CuO system was less impacted by the water matrix and kept a good inactivation efficiency in real water samples. The regrowth potential of fungal spores after disinfection was also reduced in PAA/CuO system so as to avoid the risk of biological regrowth. This study provides a feasible PAA-based advanced oxidation method for activating PAA and inactivating fungal spores.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3adisinfection 3afungi 3ahumic acids 3aoxidation 3apH 3aperacetic acid 3aregrowth 3arisk 3awater treatment 0aPeracetic acid 0aFungal spores 0aAdvanced oxidation process 0aCopper oxide 0aInactivation mechanism1 aLi, Kai1 aWan, Qiqi1 aXu, Xiangqian1 aCao, Ruihua1 aWang, Jingyi1 aHuang, Tinglin1 aWen, Gang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 439 p.129611-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001600187245008300203300001300286506007600299520184100375592002802216506003702244650001402281650002202295650001402317650002002331650002502351650002602376650000902402650002802411650002102439650001602460650001002476650001302486650001202499650001302511650002502524650003602549650000902585700001502594700001702609700002102626700002002647700002302667773010602690856008002796852000902876655001202885IND60119392120221207125103.0141214e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011939212DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-6-r682doi7 aPMC27185022pmcid7 a195493092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiyin10aComparative genomic analysis of C4 photosynthetic pathway evolution in grasses  ap. 2218.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Sorghum is the first C4 plant and the second grass with a full genome sequence available. This makes it possible to perform a whole-genome-level exploration of C4 pathway evolution by comparing key photosynthetic enzyme genes in sorghum, maize (C4) and rice (C3), and to investigate a long-standing hypothesis that a reservoir of duplicated genes is a prerequisite for the evolution of C4 photosynthesis from a C3 progenitor. RESULTS: We show that both whole-genome and individual gene duplication have contributed to the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. The C4 gene isoforms show differential duplicability, with some C4 genes being recruited from whole genome duplication duplicates by multiple modes of functional innovation. The sorghum and maize carbonic anhydrase genes display a novel mode of new gene formation, with recursive tandem duplication and gene fusion accompanied by adaptive evolution to produce C4 genes with one to three functional units. Other C4 enzymes in sorghum and maize also show evidence of adaptive evolution, though differing in level and mode. Intriguingly, a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene in the C3 plant rice has also been evolving rapidly and shows evidence of adaptive evolution, although lacking key mutations that are characteristic of C4 metabolism. We also found evidence that both gene redundancy and alternative splicing may have sheltered the evolution of new function. CONCLUSIONS: Gene duplication followed by functional innovation is common to evolution of most but not all C4 genes. The apparently long time-lag between the availability of duplicates for recruitment into C4 and the appearance of C4 grasses, together with the heterogeneity of origins of C4 genes, suggests that there may have been a long transition process before the establishment of C4 photosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC3 plants 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aC4 plants 3aSorghum bicolor 3aalternative splicing 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acorn 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agene duplication 3agene fusion 3agenes 3agenomics 3agrasses 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3arice1 aGowik, Udo1 aTang, Haibao1 aBowers, John E.,1 aWesthoff, Peter1 aPaterson, Andrew H0 tGenome biology.g2009 June, v. 10, no. 6 p.2218-2218dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2009-10-6-r683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014900167300001400316520161500330592002801945650001201973650001701985650002802002650002002030650002902050650001502079650002502094650001502119650001102134650001402145650001502159650001302174650001902187650001502206650001202221650001202233650001602245651001702261700003802278773010902316856008102425852000902506655001202515IND60515205120221119030550.0170831e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051520512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-015-0419-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucrezi, Serena10aBeachgoers’ perceptions of sandy beach conditions: demographic and attitudinal influences, and the implications for beach ecosystem management  ap. 81-96.  aSandy beaches represent typical venues for recreation and tourism worldwide, as well as part of the lifestyle and identity of coastal communities. Their overexploitation, however, threatens their survival. Especially in urban areas, beach management requires balancing needs by different users and obligations to protect beach functions, including conservation. In light of this, research about the human dimension of beach ecosystems has been advanced as a way to assist planning and decision making in beach management. This study assessed beachgoers' perceptions of sandy beach conditions in South Africa, by means of a questionnaire survey. The effects of demographic profile, travelling habits, motivations to visit, and recreational preferences on beachgoers' perceptions of beach conditions were tested. Beachgoers shared a general concern for the wellbeing of sandy beaches, with particular reference to the state of biodiversity and conservation. They also gave great importance to the values underlying beach ecosystems. Three motivations to visit groups and four recreational preferences types were identified. Demography, travelling habits, motivations to visit, and recreational preferences all influenced perceptions of beach conditions. The results from this study were used to draw management recommendations, with particular attention towards the promotion of conservation while also maintaining the recreational quality of urban sandy beaches. The results also highlighted the relevance of considering users' views as a tool in decision-making processes in Integrated Coastal Zone Management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3abiodiversity 3acoastal zone management 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3ademography 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3amotivation 3aplanning 3aquestionnaires 3arecreation 3asurveys 3atourism 3aurban areas 3aSouth Africa1 avan der Walt, Marthienus Frederik0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2016 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.81-96dSpringer Netherlandsx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-015-0419-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245008500210300001400295506007600309520099600385592002801381506003701409650001601446650002201462650002301484650001701507650001401524650001501538650001001553650001501563650001001578650000901588650003001597650002201627650002301649651001101672700002101683700001901704700002101723700001801744700002001762773008901782856008101871852000901952655001201961IND60119105320221207090521.0141130e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011910532DNAL7 a254039692pmid7 aPMC42359362pmcid7 a10.1007/s13280-014-0561-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyberg, Elisabeth10aSpatio-temporal trends of PCBs in the Swedish freshwater environment 1981–2012  ap. 45-57.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been monitored in perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike (Esox lucius), and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) in reference lakes since the late 1960s. Temporal trends and spatial patterns are currently monitored in nine and 32 lakes, respectively. Overall, PCB concentrations are decreasing. However, this is not consistent for all congeners across all lakes and species. Perch has comparatively low PCB concentrations relative to suggested target levels, but individual congener concentrations in some lakes are concerningly high. No temporal trend is seen for CB-118 and CB-153 in perch, but significant decreasing trends exist for Arctic char and pike, for which monitoring started earlier than for perch. The lower/higher chlorinated congener ratio decreased over time in most lakes, indicating fewer new emissions. CB-118 and CB-153 concentrations in perch show spatial gradients across Sweden, with higher concentrations found near urban/industrial areas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEsox lucius 3aPerca fluviatilis 3aSalvelinus alpinus 3achlorination 3aemissions 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aperch 3apike 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aSweden1 aDanielsson, Sara1 aEriksson, Ulla1 aFaxneld, Suzanne1 aMiller, Aroha1 aBignert, Anders0 tAmbio.g2014 Dec., v. 43, no.

It occurs south of the Amazon River, and is distinguished within the genus by a dark red upper tail and black under tail, as well as by having wider rectrices. The aim of this paper was to describe the morphological variation present in these taxa, and to revise their taxonomy and geographic distribution. Morphometric data revealed the absence of sexual dimorphism and did not allow the diagnosis of any taxon. Furthermore, morphological analysis, according to patterns of plumage of 174 specimens, resulted in the recognition of only three valid taxa that should be treated as full species: P. perlata, P. anerythra and P. coerulescens. A small hybrid zone between the latter two species was detected west of the mouth of the Tocantins River, and its establishment seems to be related to an already known geological shift in the course of the Tocantins River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsittacidae 3ageographical distribution 3ahybrids 3amorphometry 3amouth 3aplumage 3arivers 3asexual dimorphism 3atail 3ataxonomy 3aAmazon River 3aBrazil1 aSilveira, Luís Fábio0 tJournal of ornithology.g2015 Oct., v. 156, no. 4 p.1049-1060dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-015-1216-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147242009800176245009200274300001400366520109300380592002801473650003001501650001401531650002001545650001501565650001601580650001701596650001201613651001201625773008901637856004801726852000901774655001201783IND50067078620221118031839.0130614e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND5006707862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10343-013-0297-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinmann, Horst-Henning10aGlyphosat – ein Herbizid in der Diskussion und die Suche nach dem „Notwendigen Maß“ 10a Glyphosate: A Herbicide in Discussion and the Quest for the “Necessary Extent”    ap. 47-56.  aGlyphosate is the most widely used herbicidal active ingredient in the world. In Germany, the distributed amounts have been doubled during the last ten years. There is public concern and criticism on this extensive use and use limitations are claimed. However, also loss of efficacy as reported from countries with high use intensity of glyphosate reduces long term use of these herbicides. Recently, scientific studies aimed to quantify the economic benefits of glyphosate to estimate the costs of losing or banning this herbicide.In this text, possibilities of reductions of glyphosate use in arable farming are discussed to obtain a necessary extent. It is pointed out, that those uses are preferential, that enable minimum soil cultivation that minimize soil erosion. Post-harvest applications have the potential for use reductions, due to replacement techniques such as soil cultivation that are available. Pre-harvest applications, which are targeted for crop maturation only, should not be used as a routine. It is suggested to seek for best management practices of glyphosate use.  aPublisher supplied data 3abest management practices 3aeconomics 3afarming systems 3aglyphosate 3aingredients 3asoil erosion 3atillage 3aGermany0 tGesunde Pflanzen.g2013 June, v. 65, no. 2 p.47-56dSpringer-Verlagx0367-42237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10343-013-0297-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002700187245009600214300001300310506007600323520170700399592002802106506003702134650002202171650002202193650001302215650002002228650001002248650002802258650001502286650001102301650001502312650002402327700002202351700002202373700002202395773010602417856008002523852000902603655001202612IND60119392220221207125105.0141214e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011939222DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-6-r692doi7 aPMC27185032pmcid7 a195555102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenry, Christopher S.,10aiBsu1103: a new genome-scale metabolic model of Bacillus subtilis based on SEED annotations  ap. 2219.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Bacillus subtilis is an organism of interest because of its extensive industrial applications, its similarity to pathogenic organisms, and its role as the model organism for Gram-positive, sporulating bacteria. In this work, we introduce a new genome-scale metabolic model of B. subtilis 168 called iBsu1103. This new model is based on the annotated B. subtilis 168 genome generated by the SEED, one of the most up-to-date and accurate annotations of B. subtilis 168 available. RESULTS: The iBsu1103 model includes 1,437 reactions associated with 1,103 genes, making it the most complete model of B. subtilis available. The model also includes Gibbs free energy change (Δ ᵣ G'°) values for 1,403 (97%) of the model reactions estimated by using the group contribution method. These data were used with an improved reaction reversibility prediction method to identify 653 (45%) irreversible reactions in the model. The model was validated against an experimental dataset consisting of 1,500 distinct conditions and was optimized by using an improved model optimization method to increase model accuracy from 89.7% to 93.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Basing the iBsu1103 model on the annotations generated by the SEED significantly improved the model completeness and accuracy compared with the most recent previously published model. The enhanced accuracy of the iBsu1103 model also demonstrates the efficacy of the improved reaction directionality prediction method in accurately identifying irreversible reactions in the B. subtilis metabolism. The proposed improved model optimization methodology was also demonstrated to be effective in minimally adjusting model content to improve model accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aGibbs free energy 3abacteria 3adata collection 3agenes 3aindustrial applications 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aprediction 3asystem optimization1 aZinner, Jenifer F1 aCohoon, Matthew P1 aStevens, Rick L.,0 tGenome biology.g2009 June, v. 10, no. 6 p.2219-2219dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2009-10-6-r693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010200157300001800259500001900277520110700296592002801403650005201431650002001483650001701503650002101520650004301541650001601584700001401600700002001614700001401634700001501648700001401663700001701677773012901694856007401823852000901897655001201906IND60718153120221121120619.0201120e20201119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071815312DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay01661f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhang10aMultiplex real-time PCR using double-strand primers and probes for the detection of nucleic acids  ap. 5392-5396.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMultiplex PCR encounters difficulties in primer designing with all the primer pairs working at the same annealing temperature. In this study, we have developed a double-strand primer-mediated multiple strand displacement reaction for the detection of SARS-COV-2 ORF, N and E genes (as examples). The double primer is composed of a 5′-modified fluorophore strand, which does not impact polymerase extension and a 3′-modified quencher strand, which cannot impact elongation. At the annealing temperature, the fluorophore strand combined with the template, extended and resulted in fluorescence signal release. Results showed that the double-strand primer relatively exhibits a wide annealing temperature range and good compatibility between three pairs of primers and probes. These merits allow the simple and multiplex real-time fluorescence quantification of nucleic acids. The detection limit was 400 copies/mL, and the detection time was approximately 2 h. In addition to its extreme specificity and simplicity, this method has a wide range of applications such as multiple PCR and SNP detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atemperature1 aYao, Juan1 aHuang, Xiaoling1 aZhang, Li1 aWang, Ting1 aWeng, Zhi1 aXie, Guoming0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 Nov. 19, v. 12, no. 44 p.5392-5396dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay01661f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010500208300001600313500001100329520171800340592002802058650001402086650000902100650001902109650000902128650001702137650001402154650001402168650001302182651001802195651002002213651002202233700002302255700001502278700001802293700002802311773015002339856008302489852000902572655001202581IND60774597120221117025155.0220421e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077459712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-021-09695-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillagra, Damian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9707-619610aLife-history traits of batoids (Superorder Batoidea) in the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean  ap. 473-495.  aReview  aLife-history traits provide a way to estimate the vulnerability of both individuals and populations of a species to disturbance (e.g., overexploitation, climate change). Life-history traits compilations for species of batoids in the Northeast Atlantic (NEA) and the Mediterranean Sea (MED) are scarce, outdated, and generally limited to a local or a regional scale. A literature review compiling values of 10 life-history traits describing the growth, reproductive and feeding strategies of 14 batoids in the NEA and the MED was performed. Via a principal components analysis (PCA) the main drivers of variance and (groups of) similar species were identified. Significant data gaps were revealed for natural mortality and lifespan, for most of the life-history traits of small-eyed (Raja microocellata), shagreen (Leucoraja fullonica), and sandy (Leucoraja circularis) ray, and specifically for the English Channel and Bay of Biscay. The common skate complex (Dipturus batis complex) and white (Rostroraja alba) skate were found to be different from the rest of the species due to their larger sizes, relatively slow growth, and late maturity, which may make them more vulnerable to overexploitation, while the Raja spp. and Leucoraja spp. rays tend to be smaller species growing at faster rates. Growth and reproductive life-history should be considered as vulnerability to disturbance proxies, be used to update/establish management measures (i.e. minimum size) and enhance the stock assessment predictive ability (i.e. length based-indicators). Future research should be directed towards filling important regional data gaps and providing robust estimation for unreported parameters, such as natural mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeucoraja 3aRaja 3aclimate change 3afish 3alife history 3alongevity 3amortality 3avariance 3aBay of Biscay 3aEnglish Channel 3aMediterranean Sea1 aVan Bogaert, Noemi1 aAmpe, Bart1 aWalker, Paddy1 aUhlmann, Sven Sebastian0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2022 June, v. 32, no. 2 p.473-495dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3871702x0960-31667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-021-09695-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015000168520152500318592002801843650003701871650001801908650001501926650001401941650002301955650004901978650001402027650002202041650001102063650001402074650001102088650002302099653000902122653002202131653001802153653002102171653002602192700001802218700001602236700001602252700001402268700001602282700001602298700001402314700001602328773011402344856008602458852000902544655001202553IND60783418620221123001129.0220914e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Shitai10aUnderstanding the nonradical activation of peroxymonosulfate by different crystallographic MnO2: The pivotal role of MnIII content on the surface  aManganese oxide-activated persulfate plays a critical role in water purification and in situ chemical oxidation processes, but the underlying mechanism needs to be further revealed. Herein, the detailed mechanism of MnO₂ with various crystallographic structures (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-MnO₂) towards peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation was investigated. PMS activated by tunnel structured α-, β-, and γ-MnO₂ showed higher acetaminophen (ACE) removal than layer structured δ-MnO₂ with the removal efficiency following an order of α-MnO₂ (85%) ≈ γ-MnO₂ (84%) > β-MnO₂ (65%) > δ-MnO₂ (31%). Integrated with chemical quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance, Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Langmuir-Hinshelwood model on kinetic data, both surface-bound PMS complexes and direct oxidation by surface manganese species (Mn⁽Ⅳ, Ⅲ⁾₍ₛ₎) were disclosed as the dominant oxidation mechanism for ACE degradation in α-, β-, and γ-MnO₂/PMS, which were rarely observed in previous reports. Moreover, the catalytic activity of α-, β-, and γ-MnO₂ was positively correlated to the Mnᴵᴵᴵ₍ₛ₎ content on the catalyst surface. Higher content of Mnᴵᴵᴵ₍ₛ₎ would stimulate the generation of more oxygen vacancies, which was conducive to the adsorption of PMS and the formation of reactive complexes. Overall, this study might provide deeper insight into the nonradical activation mechanism of PMS over different crystallographic MnO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetaminophen 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amanganese 3amanganese dioxide 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3awater purification 0aMnO2 0aPeroxymonosulfate 0aAcetaminophen 0aOxygen vacancies 0aNon-radical mechanism1 aZhou, Xinquan1 aZhao, Qindi1 aJiang, Wang1 aWang, Jia1 aHe, Liuyang1 aMa, Yongfei1 aYang, Lie1 aChen, Zhuqi0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 439 p.129613-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01773naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011100160520072800271592002800999650001101027650002001038650001301058650001301071650001601084653002401100653001801124653001501142700001701157700001901174700005701193773009401250856008201344852000901426655001201435IND60725115420221120050049.0210926e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072511542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zi10aHardness data related to pre-ageing, natural secondary ageing, and paint bake hardening in Al-Mg-Si alloys  aThe effect of pre-ageing (PA) time and temperature on subsequent natural secondary ageing (NSA) and paint bake (PB) hardening of an AA6014 Al–Mg–Si alloy was systematically investigated, especially when both parameters change.

Apple represents the most important fruit in the Albanian average consumer basket. There is an increasing tendency of both domestic production and consumption. Despite the growth in production and the local customer preferences for the domestic apple, apple imports remain significant. The food demand of emerging middle-class consumers is resulting in increased consumption and production requirement for high quality apples. On the other hand, gradual consolidation of the retail sector and the recent establishment and expansion of the first supermarket chains has strong implications for agriculture—imposing more restrictions for quality and quantity of supplied apples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acrop production 3aimports 3asocioeconomic status 3asupermarkets 3asupply chain 3aAlbania1 aVuksani, Gjok1 aGruda, N.q(Nazim),0 tGesunde Pflanzen.g2013 June, v. 65, no. 2 p.65-71dSpringer-Verlagx0367-42237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10343-013-0299-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016600164300001800330520168000348592002802028650002202056650001002078650001002088650001102098650001302109650001402122650001202136650000902148650001902157650001002176650001402186650001402200650000902214651001602223700002102239700002002260700002302280700002302303700001802326700001702344773011102361856008102472852000902553655001202562IND60439188820221120150857.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043918882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-015-1220-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenni, Lukas14aThe frequency distribution of lead concentration in feathers, blood, bone, kidney and liver of golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos: insights into the modes of uptake  ap. 1095-1103.  aSeveral cases of acute lead poisoning of golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos have been documented in the Alps. The question, however, remains how often golden eagles take up lead (once, chronically or episodically) and whether this uptake is in fatal or sublethal amounts. We approached this question by examining the level and frequency distribution of lead concentration in different tissues and in three segments of flight feathers in 41 golden eagles found dead, injured or moribund in the Swiss Alps. The frequency distribution of lead concentration in the blood, liver, kidney, wing coverts and shaft of flight feathers were all right-skewed. The highest values in blood, kidney and liver reached levels typical for acute fatal poisoning. In contrast, the frequency distribution of lead in bones was more symmetrical, but 71 % had bone lead concentrations >10 µg/g, which are considered elevated, and 29 % >20 µg/g, values often observed in cases of lethal poisoning. In 22 % of individuals, only one segment of a flight feather had a high lead concentration, while the other two segments had a low concentration. These findings indicate an episodic intake of lead of various amounts that may be immediately fatal (generating high blood levels) or sublethal. The patterns of lead in flight feathers and in bone suggest a repeated sublethal lead intake by the same individual. Such an episodic lead uptake seems only possible through ingestion of lead particles from carcasses or offal left behind by hunters. This also constitutes a risk to other scavengers, notably to the bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus for which several high bone lead values have been found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAquila chrysaetos 3ablood 3abones 3aeagles 3afeathers 3aingestion 3akidneys 3alead 3alead poisoning 3aliver 3aparticles 3apredators 3arisk 3aAlps region1 aMadry, Milena M.1 aKraemer, Thomas1 aKupper, Jacqueline1 aNaegeli, Hanspeter1 aJenny, Hannes1 aJenny, David0 tJournal of ornithology.g2015 Oct., v. 156, no. 4 p.1095-1103dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-015-1220-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012200162520082100284592002801105650001901133650001901152650001501171650002101186650001301207650001401220650001401234653001801248653001701266653002901283653002601312700002601338773009401364856008101458852000901539655001201548IND60725115520221120050047.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072511552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEid, Kamel10aData on the catalytic CO oxidation and CO2 reduction durability on gC3N4 nanotubes Co-doped atomically with Pd and Cu  aUnderstanding the fabrication mechanism of graphitic carbon nitride (gC₃N₄) nanostructures is critical for tailoring their physicochemical properties for various catalytic applications.

A key consideration is the fraction of the ECs that is volatilized. This study is designed to provide a mechanistic model framework for estimating emissions of an aromatic hydrocarbon fluid used in ECs based on the results of spray chamber experiments that simulate fate as the fluids become subject to volatilization, sorption to soil, and biodegradation. The results indicate the need to treat the volatilization losses in three stages: (i) losses during spraying, (ii) losses up to 12 h after spraying in which the soil is coated with the ECs, and (iii) subsequent longer term losses in which the ECs become increasingly sorbed and subject to biodegradation. A mass balance model, the agrochemical derived volatile organic compound air transfer evaluation (ADVOCATE) tool, is developed, treating the ECs as seven hydrocarbon component groups, to estimate the volatilization and biodegradation losses using parameters fitted to empirical data. This enables losses to be estimated for each hydrocarbon component under field conditions, thereby providing a basis for improved estimation of ozone formation potential and for designing ECs that have lower emissions. 3aagrochemicals 3aair 3abiodegradation 3aemissions 3aemulsifiable concentrates 3amechanistic models 3aozone 3apesticide formulations 3asoil 3asorption 3aspraying 3avolatile organic compounds 3avolatilization1 aWarren, Christopher1 aMackay, Donald1 aPakerton, Thomas1 aLetinski, Daniel1 aManning, Ryan1 aConnelly, Martin1 aRohde, Arlean1 aFritz, Brad1 aHoffmann, W.

Good intrinsic magnetic properties including a high saturation magnetization of 90.9–182.5 A m² kg⁻¹ and a high coercivity of 192–510 Oe are achieved for these CoFe@C nanocomposites. Excellent wave absorbing properties, including a minimum reflection loss value of −43.5 dB at 9.92 GHz with a sample thickness of 2.5 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth of 4.3 GHz (below −10 dB), are obtained for the CoFe@C nanocomposites, which can be ascribed to the good magnetic properties originating from CoFe as the core and the good electrical conductivity from the graphite carbon layers.

This study aimed to evaluate the swimming behavior of zebrafish larvae under light–dark transitions after exposure to four PS-MP sizes (i.e., 1, 6, 10, and 25 μm) at concentrations of 500, 5,000, and 50,000 particles/mL. Changes in electroencephalographic signals, seizure-related gene expression, and neurochemical concentrations were measured. Locomotor activity was inhibited only by 10-μm PS-MPs. According to electroencephalographic signals, the number and total duration of seizure-like events significantly increased by 10-μm PS-MPs, which was confirmed by the altered expression of seizure-related genes c-fos and pvalb5. Additionally, an increase in the levels of neurochemicals choline, betaine, dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid indicated that the observed hypoactivity and seizure-like behavior were associated with the dysregulation of the cholinergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic systems. Overall, these findings demonstrate that exposure to PS-MPs can potentially cause seizurogenic effects in developing zebrafish embryos, and we highlight that PS-MPs 10 µm in size dominantly affect neurotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3abetaine 3acholine 3adopamine 3aelectroencephalography 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agene expression 3alocomotion 3amicroplastics 3aneurotoxicity 3apolystyrenes 0aMicroplastics 0aNeurotoxicity 0aHypoactivity 0aElectroencephalogram 0aNeurotransmitter1 aJang, Soogyeong1 aKim, Seong Soon1 aBae, Myung Ae1 aShin, Junnyung1 aLee, Ki Baek,1 aKim, Ki-Tae0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 439 p.129616-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011000166520141800276592002801694650002001722650002101742650001901763650001601782650001701798650001501815650000901830650001801839650001301857650002201870650001301892651001101905653002101916653001901937653001801956653001701974653001401991700001702005700001402022700001202036700001502048773011402063856008602177852000902263655001202272IND60783418920221123001117.0220914e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xing10aShrimp-waste based dispersant as oil spill treating agent: Biodegradation of dispersant and dispersed oil  aThe emerging demand for the enhancement of biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants from marine oil spills using oil-treating agents to minimize the environmental impacts promotes the development of green dispersants. Shrimp waste is a potential raw material to generate green dispersants. The biodegradability of dispersed oil and dispersants themselves are key factors for the national consideration of the approval, stockpile, and usage of dispersants. However, it is unknown whether shrimp-waste-based dispersant (SWD) has high bioavailability or facilitates the biodegradation of dispersed oil. In this study, we tackled the biodegradation of oil dispersed by a purified SWD. Furthermore, the SWD biodegradability was evaluated by exploring the degradation genes via metagenomic sequencing, analyzing the enzymatic activities for dispersant biodegradation by molecular docking, and discussing the SWD toxicity. We discovered that the SWD facilitated the biodegradation of two crude oils (Alaska North Slope and Marine Fuel-No.6). The metagenomic analysis with molecular docking showed that fresh seawater had feasible enzymes to degrade the SWD to safety components. Additionally, the SWD was low toxic and high bioactive. The findings helped confirm that the purified SWD is an effective and eco-sustainable marine oil spill treating agent and tracked the biodegradation of dispersed oil and the SWD.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3adispersants 3ametagenomics 3aoil spills 3aoils 3araw materials 3aseawater 3atopographic slope 3atoxicity 3aAlaska 0aGreen dispersant 0aBiodegradation 0aDispersed oil 0aMetagenomics 0aOil spill1 aZhang, Baiyu1 aCao, Yiqi1 aLiu, Bo1 aChen, Bing0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 439 p.129617-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009400163300001600257500002000273520112100293592002801414650002001442650001001462650002601472650000901498650001201507650001101519700001901530700002001549773010601569856007301675852000901748655001201757IND60522646620221119145532.0160603e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052264662DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.124892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnokidani, Masafumi10aAnalysis of factors affecting milking claw vacuum levels using a simulated milking device  ap. 848-854.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBovine mastitis is typically caused by microbial infection of the udder, but the factors responsible for this condition are varied. One potential cause is the milking system, and although previous studies have investigated various methods for inspecting these devices, most have not assessed methods for evaluating the milking units. With this in mind, we analyzed the factors that affect the vacuum inside the milking claw by using a simulated milking device and by measuring milking claw vacuum when adjusting the flow rate in five stages. The factors analyzed in each milking system were the vacuum pressure settings (high and low line system) , milk tube length (200‐328 cm), aperture diameter (14‐22.2 mm), constricted aperture diameter (12 mm), tubing configurations, lift formation (0‐80 cm), claw type (bottom and top flow) and use or non‐use of a milk sampler. The study findings demonstrated that all of these variables had a significant impact on claw vacuum and suggest that a diagnostic method using a simulated milking device should be considered when inspecting modern milking systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine mastitis 3aclaws 3adiagnostic techniques 3amilk 3amilking 3audders1 aKuruhara, Kana1 aKawai, Kazuhiro0 tAnimal science journal =.g2016 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.848-854dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.124893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04248naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245011100205300001200316500001900328520273500347592002803082650002603110650001503136650001403151650001403165650001403179650001203193650000903205650001003214650001403224650001303238650001203251650002503263650001703288650001703305651003103322700006103353700002603414700006003440700005903500773013903559856008303698852000903781655001203790IND60718153520221121085732.0201208e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071815352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-020-02933-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Seoghyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3273-059610aBehavior outweighs body size in mediating male reproductive success in a nest-building fish, bluehead chub  ap. 148.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn polygamy, individuals interact in a non-random manner to shape reproductive networks. However, relative importance of behavior versus individual physical traits (e.g., body size) in determining access to partners and reproductive success varies by species and is poorly understood in small-bodied aquatic species for which direct observations are challenging in the wild. Here, we coupled automated individual tracking and genetic parentage techniques to characterize reproductive networks and their consequences on reproductive success in bluehead chub (Nocomis leptocephalus), a nest-building stream fish native to the southeastern USA. Fish were marked with 12-mm passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, and loop-shaped PIT antennas were deployed around 18 nests to monitor behavioral encounters of 311 individuals (34 males and 277 females and immature males) during the spawning season in 2017. After spawning, genetic samples of 326 young-of-the-year fish (i.e., offspring) were collected. The mating system was polygynandrous, and factors affecting access to partners and reproductive success differed between males and females. Male body size did not affect number of encounters with females and reproductive success, instead behavior indexing reproductive effort (number and size of nests occupied) explained variation in reproductive success. On the contrary, body size was a key determinant of female reproductive success. Fecundity (i.e., number of eggs) increased with body size, and higher encounters rates with males did not result in higher reproductive success. In males and females, mating with more partners led to higher reproductive success, which may have contributed to the evolution and maintenance of polygynandry in this species. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Is bigger better? This question has been investigated with respect to animal mating behavior and reproductive success, and the answer appears to vary by species. Using an intensive individual-based approach with PIT antenna and molecular markers, we show that behavior outweighed body size in mediating reproductive success of males but not females of a nest-building stream fish. Males increased access to females and ultimately number of offspring by occupying larger and more nests, which are proxies of reproductive effort. In females, body size was more important than behavior in determining reproductive success, and behavior explained much less of variation in reproductive success. Diverse and complex reproductive patterns of males may explain why behavior outweighed body size in mediating reproductive success, a hypothesis that warrants further research across species with a gradient of mating systems and behavioral complexities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNocomis leptocephalus 3aautomation 3abody size 3aevolution 3afecundity 3afemales 3afish 3amales 3aparentage 3apolygamy 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3asociobiology 3atransponders 3aSoutheastern United States1 aPregler, Kasey C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0664-95941 aCushman, Elizabeth L.1 aDarden, Tanya L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7295-73601 aKanno, Yoichiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8452-51000 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2020 Dec., v. 74, no. 12 p.148-148dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-020-02933-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245009300175300001400268520152900282592002801811650002201839650002601861650001401887650000901901650002101910650002201931650002101953650001501974650002201989650002202011653002402033653003202057653002602089653003102115700002202146700002502168700001602193773010502209856008802314852000902402655001202411IND60562661720221116214040.0190319e20170410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056266172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohanson, Arne N.10aSPRAT: A spatially-explicit marine ecosystem model based on population balance equations  ap. 11-25.  aTo successfully manage marine fisheries using an ecosystem-based approach, long-term predictions of fish stock development considering changing environmental conditions are necessary. Such predictions can be provided by end-to-end ecosystem models, which couple existing physical and biogeochemical ocean models with newly developed spatially-explicit fish stock models. Typically, individual-based models (IBMs) and models based on advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equations are employed for the fish stock models. In this paper, we present a novel fish stock model called SPRAT for end-to-end ecosystem modeling based on population balance equations (PBEs) that combines the advantages of IBMs and ADR models while avoiding their main drawbacks. SPRAT accomplishes this by describing the modeled ecosystem processes from the perspective of individuals while still being based on partial differential equations.We apply the SPRAT model to explore a well-documented regime shift observed on the eastern Scotian Shelf in the 1990s from a cod-dominated to a herring-dominated ecosystem. Model simulations are able to reconcile the observed multitrophic dynamics with documented changes in both fishing pressure and water temperature, followed by a predator–prey reversal that may have impeded recovery of depleted cod stocks.We conclude that our model can be used to generate new hypotheses and test ideas about spatially interacting fish populations, and their joint responses to both environmental and fisheries forcing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontinental shelf 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3afish 3afish communities 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine fisheries 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3awater temperature 0aEnd-to-end modeling 0aPopulation balance equation 0aFish stock prediction 0aEcosystem-based management1 aOschlies, Andreas1 aHasselbring, Wilhelm1 aWorm, Boris0 tEcological modelling.g2017 Apr. 10, v. 349 p.11-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001800290520126500308592002801573650002401601650001801625650002501643650001401668650001501682650001301697650002301710650002001733650002001753650002101773650002001794650002101814650001901835650001801854650000901872650002401881650003201905650002401937650001301961653002001974653002701994653002002021653002002041653000902061653000902070653000802079653000902087653000902096700001302105700001402118700001402132700001702146700001802163700001402181773009802195856008602293852000902379655001202388IND60561844820221121030212.0190319e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056184482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ailian10aAdjuvant-active aqueous extracts from Artemisia rupestris L. improve immune responses through TLR4 signaling pathway  ap. 1037-1045.  aActivating innate immunity by an adjuvant is required in vaccine development. The study aims to investigate adjuvant effects of aqueous extracts of Artemisia rupestris L. (AEAR) in vivo and in vitro. ICR mice were subcutaneously administered with antigen and AEAR at various doses to evaluate their immune responses of antibodies, dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (Treg), splenic lymphocyte, and cytokine. The evaluation results showed that AEAR could largely increase titers of antigen-specific antibodies (IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) and T cell proliferation. AEAR also increased expression of IFN-γ in CD8+T cells as well as IL-4 and INF-γ expression in CD4+T cells. Expression levels of MHC-II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 on DCs were significantly elevated, whereas the Treg frequency was significantly decreased. AEAR (200μg) showed remarkable adjuvant activity. Furthermore, AEAR enhanced MHC-II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 expression as well as the yields of TNF-α and IL-12 on DCs through toll-like receptor4 (TLR4) in vitro. Those results indicated that AEAR could serve as an efficacious immune stimulator for vaccines because it significantly enhanced specific immune responses by promoting DCs maturation and reduced Treg through TLR4 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia rupestris 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3acell proliferation 3adendritic cells 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-4 3amice 3asignal transduction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccine development 3avaccines 0aAqueous extract 0aArtemisia rupestris L. 0aAdjuvant effect 0aDendritic cells 0aTLR4 0aAEAR 0aDCs 0aTreg 0aFACs1 aYang, Yu1 aWang, Yan1 aZhao, Gan1 aYang, Xiumei1 aWang, Danyang1 aWang, Bin0 tVaccine.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 35, no. 7 p.1037-1045dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245020300170300001600373520214600389592002802535650001702563650001902580650000902599650002302608650002202631650001502653650002202668650001602690650001602706650001602722650001302738650002202751651002802773700001602801700001602817700002102833773010902854856008102963852000903044655001203053IND60439189120221120155237.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043918912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-015-1223-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusilová, Zuzana,10aLong-term trends, total numbers and species richness of increasing waterbird populations at sites on the edge of their winter range: cold-weather refuge sites are more important than protected sites  ap. 923-932.  aRecent climate changes are most likely the major determining factor for the increasing importance of Central Europe for wintering waterbirds, given that most of the region is located on the edge of these species’ wintering ranges. A few recent large-scale studies have demonstrated changes in species distribution at the flyway level, but detailed studies at the site level are still scarce. Using mid-January wintering waterbird counts from 532 sites taken over a 48-year period (1966–2013), we have assessed the role of ‘cold-weather refuges’, i.e. sites where the selective pressures of winter harshness are reduced (e.g. sites with ample sources of running water, urban areas, warmer sites, sites with a relatively higher proportion of wetlands), and a site’s protection status on species richness, total numbers and trends at the site level. We found prevailing increasing trends in total numbers and species richness at the site level, which are in line with the area’s increasing importance as wintering grounds. However, some sites have likely been affected by density-dependent regulation as mean total numbers per site have not increased since the 1990s. Density dependence may also be a reflection of an increasing number of sites with running water in traditionally cold areas. Factors affecting trends in species richness at the site level are however less predictable. We demonstrate the great importance of cold-weather refuges, where running water has an effect on total numbers, species richness and trend affect total numbers, warmer areas and higher proportions of wetlands in the surroundings affect total numbers and species richness and urban areas affect total numbers. However, we found that legislative safeguards for sites, such as the establishment of Nature Reserves and Special Protection Areas, have no significant effects. Our findings therefore suggest that the effect of temperature and presence of cold-weather refuges (as defined here) are more relevant to this observed increasing trend of wintering waterbirds on the edge of wintering ranges than a reduction in human developmental pressures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3acold 3aconservation areas 3ahuman development 3apopulation 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3awater birds 3awetlands 3awintering grounds 3aCentral European region1 aMusil, Petr1 aZouhar, Jan1 aRomportl, Dušan0 tJournal of ornithology.g2015 Oct., v. 156, no. 4 p.923-932dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-015-1223-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002100144245010700165300001800272520101500290650002101305650002601326650002301352650001201375650001901387650001501406650001301421650002601434650002401460700001501484700002001499700002301519700002101542700002301563700001901586773016201605856004701767852000901814655001201823IND4535029820221119230104.0151207e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453502982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b019202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaborga, Lautaro10aEffect of Polymer Micelles on Antifungal Activity of Geranylorcinol Compounds against Botrytis cinerea  ap. 6890-6896.  aHerein, we explore the potential use of two micelle-forming block copolymers, i.e., Pluronic F-127 and poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(caprolactone), for application of fungicide agents. The polymer effect on the in vitro fungicide activity of a series of geranyl orcinol derivatives against Botrytis cinerea has been assessed. The results show that, for all test compounds, the incorporation into micelles, formed by Pluronic F-127, produces a great enhancement of the inhibitory effect on the growth of B. cinerea. For some compounds, at the lowest tested concentration (50 ppm), the percentage of inhibition increases significantly (from 0â10 to 80â90%) when the application is made using a polymer solution instead of an ethanol/water mixture. The synthesis and structural determination of a series of eight geranylphenols/diacetates, which were used as fungicide agents, are also discussed. These results suggest that polymer micelles are promising systems for application of crop-protecting agents. 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aantifungal properties 3acomposite polymers 3aethanol 3aethylene oxide 3afungicides 3amicelles 3apesticide application 3apolyethylene glycol1 aDiaz, Katy1 aOlea, Andres F.1 aReyes-Bravo, Paula1 aFlores, Mario E.1 aPenna-Cortes, Hugo1 aEspinoza, Luis0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Aug. 12, v. 63, no. 31 p.6890-6896dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b01920  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008800167520141000255592002801665650002001693650002201713650001201735650001401747650002301761650002001784650002901804650001901833653001301852653002401865653000901889653002301898653001001921700001601931700005901947773009402006856008102100852000902181655001202190IND60725115920221120045834.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072511592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnodera, Wataru10aData for positive selection test and co-evolutionary analysis on mammalian cereblon  aCereblon (CRBN) is a substrate recognition subunit of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, directly binding to specific substrates for poly-ubiquitination followed by proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins. Cellular CRBN is responsible for energy metabolism, ion-channel activation, and cellular stress response through binding to proteins related to the respective pathways. As CRBN binds to various proteins, the selective pressure at the interacting surface is expected to result in functional divergence. Here, we present two mammalian CRBN datasets of molecular evolutionary analyses. (1) The multiple sequence alignment data shows that positive selection occurred, determined with a dN/dS calculation. (2) Data on co-evolutionary analysis between vertebrate CRBN and related proteins are represented by calculating the correlation coefficient based on the comparison of phylogenetic trees. Co-evolutionary analysis shows the similarity of evolutionary traits of two proteins. Further molecular, functional interpretation of these analyses is explained in ‘Positive selection of Cereblon modified function including its E3 Ubiquitin Ligase activity and binding efficiency with AMPK’ (W.

In tropical savannahs, variation in resources in time and space is dependent on the amplitude of the rains and their predictability. We quantified the degree to which tropical savannah birds have concentrated their breeding around predicted periods of increased food availability coincident with rainfall. We used the proportion of adults caught with brood patches and/or the juvenile-to-adult ratio in 25 species of small savannah bird which were caught over a 10-year period in Nigeria, West Africa, to assess the degree to which there were clear seasonal peaks in breeding activity. We found two-thirds of species bred in all seasons (68 %), but that most species showed distinct seasonal peaks (96 %) in the timing of their breeding. Over one-half of species (60 %) varied the timing of their breeding across the years. Granivorous species bred later than insectivorous and frugivorous species, which probably indicates synchronisation with their respective peak abundance in food type. Overall we found distinct seasonal peaks in breeding effort (i.e. breeding seasons), and this is most likely in response to changing resource availability brought about by seasonal rainfall. We also demonstrated the potential utility of using brood patches to test for patterns in breeding in multi-species long-term datasets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abirds 3abreeding 3adata collection 3afood availability 3afrugivores 3ainsectivores 3arain 3asavannas 3aspace and time 3aNigeria1 aBrandt, Miriam J.1 aMcGregor, Ross1 aOttosson, Ulf1 aStevens, Matthew C.1 aCresswell, Will0 tJournal of ornithology.g2013 July, v. 154, no. 3 p.671-683dSpringer-Verlagx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-013-0930-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245014600206300001800352506007600370520053100446592002800977506003701005650001901042650002301061650002301084650002001107650002201127650003801149650002201187650003301209700002201242773010701264856007501371852000901446655001201455IND60578765120221207085323.0170814e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057876512DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502426b2doi7 aPMC41687762pmcid7 a252078042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinclair, Julie

These complications include activation of stress responses in bone such as oxidative stress and inflammation, which have been implicated in various bone diseases, including osteoporosis. Non-enzymatic glycation of proteins form and accumulate in patients under hyperglycemia condition. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a reactive advanced glycation end-product precursor.Abnormal high concentration of MG was in serum of diabetic patients. It was proven that MG induces various stress responses. This indicates that it might possibly the key metabolite leading to diabetes-associated bone loss. In this data report, using cell models, the underlying mechanism of methylglyoxal on osteoclast that may lead to bone loss was investigated.In cell cultures, RAW264.7, Macrophages, was treated with methylglyoxal and gene expressions of osteoclast bone biomarkers were investigated. Furthermore, the inhibitions of p38 and p44/42 activities were employed to investigate the osteoclast biomarkers CTSK, OSCAR, and TRACP5 gene expressions.These data implied that MG activated the p38 and p44/42, which was reported to regulate proliferation and differentiation of osteoclast. However, the decreasing MAPK though siRNA knockdown did not change expression of those target markers, TRACP5, OSCAR, and CTSK, in mRNA level. The effects of MG to other osteoclast markers through p38 and p44/42 would be worth to be investigated.For more insight please see Methylglyoxal Activates Osteoclasts through JNK Pathway leading to Osteoporosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced glycation end products 3abiomarkers 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abone resorption 3adata collection 3adiabetes mellitus 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycation 3ahyperglycemia 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3ametabolites 3aosteoclasts 3aosteoporosis 3aoxidative stress 0aMethylglyoxal 0aDiabetes 0aOsteoclast 0aPathways1 aLee, Cheuk Yan1 aZhang, Ge1 aLyu, Aiping1 aYue, Kevin Kin Man1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9250-24160 tData in Brief.g2019 Oct., v. 26 p.104500-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.1045003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03931naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245014700175300001800322500002000340520253100360592002802891650002802919650001102947650001702958650003202975650002303007650001403030650001503044650002003059650001703079650001003096650002803106650001203134650001003146650001303156650001503169700001703184700002003201700002303221773015403244856007803398852000903476655001203485IND60587962120221121064440.0180103e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058796212DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2016000592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkjold‐Jørgensen, Jakob10aUnderstanding the activation mechanism of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase using rational design and tryptophan‐induced fluorescence quenching  ap. 1644-1660.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe attractiveness of lipases as industrial biocatalysts underlines the importance of understanding their molecular action in detail, helping future efforts to improve performance and applicability. Lipases represent a special class of carboxyl ester hydrolases, which act on long‐chained water insoluble acyl‐glycerols at the water‐lipid interface. This heterogeneous catalysis makes it very difficult to monitor the structural changes taking place in the enzyme during activation in its preferred milieu. In this review, we cover recent developments toward a deeper understanding of the interfacial activation phenomenon of lipases and discuss a selection of biophysical methods suitable for studying lipase activation. For many lipases, such as that from Thermomyces lanuginosus, a structural domain called the “lid” is directly involved in the activation process. This has been shown through alteration of the lid‐residue composition using rational design. The resulting lid‐mutants have highlighted the lid's role in governing enzymatic activity and interfacial activation. Moreover, a recently developed fluorescence‐based technique called the Tryptophan Induced Quenching method has proved to enable the direct measurement of lipase activation in water‐ethanol mixtures, and thus represents an intriguing method to gain further insight into the structural movements taking place at the water‐lipid interface. Practical applications: Lipases are important industrial biocatalysts widely used in industrial applications including detergent, leather, paper, fuel, fine chemicals, baking, cosmetics, and food. Knowledge of structural changes of lipase upon activation and identification of the amino acids involved in lipase activation is crucial for design of new variants with improved or new properties. Rational design of the lid‐region in lipases has an interesting potential for optimization of lipase function and adapting them to different environments. In order to leverage on the design of new lipase variants and their altered function, methods that enable direct measurement of lipase action directly in solution, in real time, are desired. In this context, fluorescence based methods have shown great potential and provides interesting perspectives for probing the delicate movements occurring in lipases upon activation. Interfacial activation of lipases and the lid movements studied by rational design, fluorescence quenching methods, and solvent effect – polarity driven activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermomyces lanuginosus 3abaking 3abiocatalysts 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalytic activity 3acosmetics 3adetergents 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afuels 3aindustrial applications 3aleather 3apaper 3asolvents 3atryptophan1 aVind, Jesper1 aSvendsen, Allan1 aBjerrum, Morten J.0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2016 Nov., v. 118, no. 11 p.1644-1660dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2016000593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245008900204300001600293520178600309592002802095596005602123650000802179650001702187650002302204650002002227650001602247650000902263650001502272650002502287650001502312650001302327650002002340700006302360700005802423700006002481700001802541700001802559700006002577773015002637856008302787852000902870655001202879IND60774597820221117025912.0220421e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077459782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-021-09680-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCusa, Marine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4111-464812aA future for seafood point-of-origin testing using DNA and stable isotope signatures  ap. 597-621.  aDemand for seafood products is increasing worldwide, contributing to ever more complex supply chains and posing challenges to trace their origin and guarantee legal, well-managed, sustainable sources from confirmed locations. While DNA-based methods have proven to be reliable in verifying seafood authenticity at the species level, the verification of geographic origin remains inherently more complex. Both genetic and stable isotope analyses have been employed for determining point-of-origin with varying degrees of success, highlighting that their application can be effective when the right tool is selected for a given application. Developing an a priori prediction of their discrimination power for different applications can help avoid the financial cost of developing inappropriate reference datasets. Here, we reviewed the application of both techniques to seafood point-of-origin for 63 commercial finfish species certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, and showed that, even for those species where baseline data exist, real applications are scarce. To fill these gaps, we synthesised current knowledge on biological and biogeochemical mechanisms that underpin spatial variations in genetic and isotopic signatures. We describe which species’ biological and distribution traits are most helpful in predicting effectiveness of each tool. Building on this, we applied a mechanistic approach to predicting the potential for successful validation of origin to three case study fisheries, using combined genetic and isotopic methodologies to distinguish individuals from certified versus non-certified regions. Beyond ecolabelling applications, the framework we describe could be reproduced by governments and industries to select the most cost-effective techniques.  aPublisher supplied data  aEAPA87/2016 ‘SEATRACES’cInterreg Atlantic Area 3aDNA 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3aecolabeling 3afish 3aprediction 3aproduct authenticity 3aprovenance 3aseafoods 3astable isotopes1 aSt John Glew, Katie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0425-14941 aTrueman, Clive1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4995-736X1 aMariani, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5329-05531 aBuckley, Leah1 aNeat, Francis1 aLongo, Catherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8640-15900 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2022 June, v. 32, no. 2 p.597-621dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3871702x0960-31667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-021-09680-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245009400165300001800259500002000277520227300297592002802570650001202598650001402610650002902624650001502653650001302668650001302681650000902694650001502703650001502718650002402733700001602757700002502773700002702798773015402825856007802979852000903057655001203066IND60587962220221121064307.0180103e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058796222DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2015006112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieres, Pablo D.10aCatalytic valorization of oil‐derived fatty esters via cross‐metathesis with nitriles  ap. 1722-1729.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe cross‐metathesis of methyl oleate with 3‐pentenenitrile to obtain 2‐undecene, methyl 9‐undecenoate, methyl 11‐cyano‐9‐undecenoate, and 3‐dodecenenitrile was studied at 323 K in a batch reactor using second‐generation Hoveyda–Grubbs (HG) catalysts. Self‐metathesis of methyl oleate was the main undesired secondary reaction. For a 3‐pentenenitrile/methyl oleate reactant ratio (R₃PN/MO) of one, the yield (ηC−M) and selectivity (SC−M) to cross‐metathesis products were 47 and 63%, respectively. The formation of cross‐metathesis products increased with increasing 3‐pentene initial concentrations, essentially because the reaction equilibrium was shifted to higher methyl oleate conversions. Thus, ηC−M and SC−M were 74 and 83%, respectively, at R₃PN/MO = 5. Nevertheless, the HG complex was significantly deactivated when high R₃PN/MO values were employed. Practical applications: Metathesis reactions are becoming increasingly attractive in the oleochemistry industry because they offer novel routes for the valorisation of unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) that are cheap feedstocks obtained by transesterification of natural oils and fats. Recently, the cross‐metathesis of FAME with functionalized olefins such as esters, allylchlorides, and nitriles has been investigated to obtain renewable α,ω‐bifunctional compounds. In particular, the cross metathesis of nitriles with FAME constitutes an attractive synthesis route toward the production of useful polyamide precursors from natural renewable resources. In this work we investigate the cross‐metathesis of methyl oleate with 3‐pentenenitrile, an internal unsaturated nitrile that does not contain conjugated CC and CN bonds. The results presented in this work show that high yields (74%) and selectivities (88%) to cross‐metathesis products are obtained using the second‐generation Hoveyda–Grubbs Ru catalyst. The cross‐metathesis of methyl oleate with 3‐pentenenitrile is studied using the second‐generation Hoveyda–Grubbs Ru complex as homogeneous catalyst. High yields (74%) and selectivities (88%) to cross‐metathesis products are obtained when pentenenitrile/methyl oleate ratios higher than 3 are employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3acatalysts 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afeedstocks 3aindustry 3anitriles 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3apolyamides 3atransesterification1 aZelin, Juan1 aTrasarti, Andrés F.1 aApesteguía, Carlos R.0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2016 Nov., v. 118, no. 11 p.1722-1729dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2015006113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003700147245012700184520096100311592002801272650001701300650002201317650002301339650001101362650001901373650002401392650001601416650001101432650001101443650002601454650001601480650001201496650001301508651001001521653001001531653001301541653001101554700002501565700001901590773009401609856008101703852000901784655001201793IND60725116120221120045958.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072511612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1045012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdou, Oluwarotimi Delano Thierry10aTechno-economic data for decentralised energy system sizing for rural areas in Benin.

This review classifies the various microfluidic liquid–liquid extractors into three major groups based on their flow arrangement: stop-flow microfluidic extractors (MEs), cocurrent MEs, and countercurrent MEs. Each group is further classified into several subcategories based on flow pattern and/or working principle. The review focuses on how to establish these three groups of microfluidic liquid–liquid extractors, including the difficulties and corresponding solutions for establishing these MEs, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The review ends with conclusions and the outlook of the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aextractors 3aprocess design 3asolutes1 aXie, Tingliang0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 July 12, v. 56, no. 27 p.7593-7622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b017123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018500168520065700353592002801010650001201038650002001050650001501070650001201085650001401097650001901111653002301130653002401153653002001177653002501197653002401222653002201246653001701268700003001285773009401315856008101409852000901490655001201499IND60725116220221120050012.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072511622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1045022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossoni, Luciano10aBoard social capital and structure, ownership and financial variables of Brazilian companies: A three levels dataset integrating directors, board networks and firm characteristics  aThis data article incorporates, in an unbalanced panel data, five variables types: financial and market; board structure; board network and social capital; ownership and governance level; the cost of capital.

In the current research, GOS synthesized from lactose solution were fed to hypercholesterolemic female Sprague–Dawley rats. Negative control group (G1) was fed on standard basal diet alone. Positive control group (G5) was fed on inulin (154 mg/250 g body weight), while treatment groups G2, G3 and G4 received 110 mg, 154 mg and 198.4 mg/250 g body weight, respectively, of GOS along with high-fat diet for a period of 60 days. Findings from this study revealed that animals belonging to prebiotic GOS (G₂, G₃ and G₄)-fed group showed significantly decreased serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and VLDL cholesterol as compared to control group (G₀). The groups which were fed on different doses of GOS revealed a significant reduction in TC, TG, LDL, and VLDL levels and an increase in HDL level corresponding to the reference group that was fed on inulin, while G₁ negative control group revealed increased levels of TC, TG, LDL and VLDL. In contrast to positive control group G₅ (154 mg inulin), all doses of GOS lowered serum TC, TG and LDL-C and raised HDL-C; however, G₄ (198.4 mg) proved to be more effective. Hence, GOS proved to be supportive in preventing hypercholesterolemia leading cause of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. This study reported a significant reduction of serum TC, TG and LDL-C in female rats for 60 days as compared to control. Conclusively, GOS were found to be worthless against hypercholesterolemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3afemales 3agalactooligosaccharides 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahigh fat diet 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ainulin 3alactose 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aprebiotics 3arats 3atriacylglycerols 3avery low density lipoprotein1 aNaeem, Naureen1 aFarooq, Zubair1 aMasood, Saima1 aIqbal, Sanaullah1 aNaseer, Rahat0 tProbiotics and antimicrobial proteins.g2016 Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.19-30dSpringer USx1867-13067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12602-016-9206-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245011000203300001600313520158700329592002801916596010001944596006202044596009602106596009602202596009602298650000902394650002102403650001402424650002202438700001802460700001502478700001702493700001402510700001302524700001402537700001702551773015002568856008302718852000902801655001202810IND60774598020221117025218.0220421e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077459802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-021-09688-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Yintao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7310-299710aUnravelling fish community assembly in shallow lakes: Insights from functional and phylogenetic diversity  ap. 623-644.  aGlobal biodiversity loss has increased interest in identifying the patterns and mechanisms that shape community assembly. Growing empirical evidence indicates that investigating functional and phylogenetic diversity beyond purely taxonomic considerations may provide different but complementary information about community assembly. However, such multifaceted studies on community assembly from both functional and phylogenetic perspectives are rare in the context of fish assemblages in lakes. We examined patterns of functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity in fishes and explored the relationships between these patterns and their environmental drivers across broad environmental gradients in 30 shallow lakes. Furthermore, we examined community assembly mechanisms using null models to quantify the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic assembly processes. Our results revealed no clear patterns among multiple biodiversity components and their environmental drivers, and no single component could be used as a reliable proxy for another; these results suggest that accounting for functional and phylogenetic diversity can help to explain fish community variation. Null models revealed that both deterministic and stochastic assembly processes occurred simultaneously, with stochastic processes being responsible for the majority of fish community assembly processes in most of our study lakes. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of evaluating both functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity when identifying patterns of community assembly.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017ZX07302-002cMajor Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment  a31720103905cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKLPA2013-01cKey Laboratory of Plateau Aquatic Organism and Environment of Qinghai Province  aKLPA2016-01cKey Laboratory of Plateau Aquatic Organism and Environment of Qinghai Province  aKLPA2017-01cKey Laboratory of Plateau Aquatic Organism and Environment of Qinghai Province 3afish 3afish communities 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity1 aJiang, Yihang1 aLiu, Yuhan1 aSui, Xiaoyun1 aFeng, Xiu1 aZhu, Ren1 aLi, Kemao1 aChen, Yifeng0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2022 June, v. 32, no. 2 p.623-644dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3871702x0960-31667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-021-09688-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003000154245013600184300001400320520168400334592002802018650002002046650001202066650001002078650002002088650002602108650001402134650001102148650001202159650001902171650001602190650002502206650001202231650001102243650001602254650002302270650001102293650000902304650000902313650001602322650001902338650001302357650001102370651001402381653001302395653002502408653001902433653001102452653001402463653002702477653001202504653001202516700002002528700002302548700001702571773009302588856008902681852000902770655001202779IND60561845120221120114752.0190319e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056184512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcos-Martinez, Raymundo10aAgricultural land-use dynamics: Assessing the relative importance of socioeconomic and biophysical drivers for more targeted policy  ap. 53-66.  aA detailed understanding of multiple human and environmental factors influencing land allocations among agricultural uses can facilitate more efficient and targeted land policy. To show this, we used a comprehensive dataset of socioeconomic, physiographic, and climatic indicators to investigate potential determinants of land-use in Australia’s intensive agricultural region during the period 1992–2010. We applied a seemingly unrelated regressions land-use shares spatial error model with random effects coupled with variance decomposition analysis to identify the statistical significance, direction and magnitude of observed associations between land-use and its drivers.Population: density, rainfall, equity ratio, and access to markets were the most influential policy-relevant land-use factors. Land allocations to cereals and livestock production were significantly influenced by spatiotemporal rainfall and temperature variability. Improved pastures, cereals, annual and perennial crops plantations were larger in regions with better access to markets. Increases in equity ratio (i.e., better financial position) were associated with larger land allocations to improved pastures and annual crops and smaller extensive grazing area. Marginal associations were detected between land-use and output prices, and higher population density was associated with lower shares for all high value agricultural land-uses. The results suggest that improved transportation infrastructure, zoning regulations, and mechanisms to reduce farm debt exposure and risks from climate variability could have significant impact on the configuration of the Australian agricultural landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannual pastures 3aclimate 3acrops 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3afarm debt 3agrains 3agrazing 3ainfrastructure 3aland policy 3alivestock production 3amarkets 3amodels 3aplantations 3apopulation density 3aprices 3arain 3arisk 3atemperature 3atransportation 3avariance 3azoning 3aAustralia 0aLand-use 0aSpatial econometrics 0aRandom effects 0aPolicy 0aAustralia 0aVariance decomposition 0aClimate 0aDrivers1 aBryan, Brett A.1 aConnor, Jeffery D.1 aKing, Darran0 tLand use policy.g2017 Apr., v. 63 p.53-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245013800171300001300309520200500322592002802327650002902355650002602384650001502410650001602425650002502441650001302466650001702479651001002496653002202506653002202528653002702550653002702577653002102604653001002625700001502635700001402650700001302664700001602677700001402693773009202707856008902799852000902888655001202897IND60561845220221120105246.0190319e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056184522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Shiliang10aChina’s megaregion policy: Performance evaluation framework, empirical findings and implications for spatial polycentric governance  ap. 1-19.  aMegaregion has emerged as a new dimension of global urbanization. A megaregion approach based on polycentric strategy is deemed to enhance regional economic competitiveness. Numerous studies have highlighted the economic benefits, celebrated the spill-over effects, and outlined the creative potentials of contemporary megaregion policies in different nations worldwide. However, further policy instruments require the knowledge about the achievement and failure of megaregion policies that seek for spatial, economic, social, and environmental efficiency and sustainability. This paper introduces China’s megaregion policy and proposes an analytical framework for performance evaluation from four principle domains (rational urban growth, economic development, social equity, environmental protection) at three levels (internal collaboration, integral development, and overall development). Using a case of the Megaregion around Hangzhou Bay (MAHB), we find very limited success of China’s megaregion policy. In particular, the megaregion policy only accomplishes the economic goal, and fails to achieve the goals of rational urban growth, environmental protection, and social equity. A series of mechanism based regressions are established and show that the implementation duration of megaregion policy: (1) associates positively with the economic growth; (2) relates negatively to social equity and urban rational growth; and (3) has no significant relationship with improved environmental quality. Institutional fragmentation, no unified spatial planning, and inadequate legislation at megaregional level are the underlying causes of the expected performances within the policy context of governance itself. We finally propose some possible solutions and discuss the implications for spatial polycentric governance. The demonstrated methodological framework can be applicable to other megaregions around the world. This paper is thus believed to provide some new insights for land use policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental protection 3aenvironmental quality 3agovernance 3aland policy 3alaws and regulations 3aplanning 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aMega-urbanization 0aMegaregion policy 0aPerformance evaluation 0aPolycentric governance 0aSpatial planning 0aChina1 aLiu, Zebin1 aXu, Yifan1 aLi, Jing1 aPi, Jianhua1 aWeng, Min0 tLand use policy.g2017 Apr., v. 63 p.1-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011400164300001800278520088300296592002801179596006301207596005901270596009301329596005501422596005501477650001301532650001101545650001401556650001301570650001501583650002501598700001701623700001801640700001501658700001401673700001401687700001901701700001701720700002001737773011201757856008201869852000901951655001201960IND60718154120221118081818.0201120e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071815412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-020-02215-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Alei14aThe Draft Genome Sequence and Analysis of an Efficiently Chitinolytic Bacterium Chitinibacter sp.

GC72, which produces an enzyme capable of efficiently converting chitin only into N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), was successfully sequenced and analyzed. The assembled draft genome of strain GC72 is 3,455,373 bp, containing 3346 encoded protein sequences with G + C content of 53.90%. Among these annotated genes, 17 chitinolytic enzymes including 12 glycoside hydrolase family 18 chitinases, three family 19 chitinases, one family 20 β-hexosaminidase, and one auxiliary activity family 10 lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase, were found to be essential in the production of GlcNAc from chitin. The genomic information of strain GC72 provides a reference genome for Chitinibacter bacteria and abundant novel chitinolytic enzyme resources, and allows researchers to explore potential applications in GlcNAc enzymatic production.  aPublisher supplied data  aBK20170997cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  a31700092cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGrant No. 21908101cthe National Nature Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China  a2018M642237cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2020T130295cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation 3abacteria 3achitin 3achitinase 3agenomics 3aglycosides 3anucleotide sequences1 aMo, Xiaofang1 aWei, Guoguang1 aZhou, Ning1 aYang, Sai1 aChen, Jie1 aWang, Yingying1 aChen, Kequan1 aOuyang, Pingkai0 tCurrent microbiology.g2020 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.3903-3908dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-020-02215-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245007400174300001500248520073800263592002801001650002301029650001601052650000901068650001501077650001701092650001101109650002301120650001401143650001701157650001801174653002301192653001801215653002401233653002501257653001701282653001101299653001701310700002401327700001801351700002401369700002301393773009701416856008801513852000901601655001201610IND60609629220221120203411.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060962922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2016.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThongnest, Sanit10aAilanthusins A-G and nor-lupane triterpenoids from Ailanthus triphysa  ap. 98-105.  aBioactivity-guided chemical investigation of the CH2Cl2 and CH2Cl2MeOH extracts of the stem and stem bark material of Ailanthus tryphysa (Simaroubaceae) led to the isolation of five cycloapotirucallanes, ailanthusins A-E, two malabaricanes, ailanthusins F-G, and one nor-lupane triterpenoid, 29-nor-lup-1-ene-3,20-dione along with twenty known compounds.

Declining growth of R. pseudoacacia plantations has become a recently emerging challenge for revegetation and sustainable forest management in this region. In the suitable area of R. pseudoacacia, we selected four representative study sites along a precipitation gradient (aridity indexes of 1.3 at Fufeng, 1.5 at Changwu, 1.9 at Ansai, and 2.4 at Mizhi) and used an integrated Biome BioGeochemistry-plant hydraulic traits model (BBGC-SPERRY) to assess the climate change impacts on net primary productivity (NPP), maximum leaf area index (LAIₘₐₓ), actual evapotranspiration (AET), and annual average percentage loss of whole-plant hydraulic conductance (APLK) for R. pseudoacacia. We adopted climate scenario data derived from five downscaled Global Circulation Models under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and set baseline (1981–2020), near future (2021–2060, NFP) and far future (2061–2099, FFP) periods. Our projections show annual precipitation will significantly increase during the NFP and FFP at the Ansai and Mizhi sites and increase slightly at the Fufeng and Changwu sites during the FFP; annual maximum and minimum temperatures will increase under all RCPs. The mean NPP and LAIₘₐₓ of R. pseudoacacia will significantly decrease by 9.9% (RCP4.5) to 49.1% (RCP2.6) during the NFP and by 7.4% (RCP4.5) to 50.1% (RCP2.6) during the FFP at the Changwu, Ansai, and Mizhi sites; however, both measures will significantly increase during the NFP and FFP at the Fufeng site. The AET will significantly increase during the NFP and FFP at all sites. The maximum APLK will increase from south to north along the precipitation gradient, with values greater than 60% at the Changwu, Ansai, and Mizhi sites during the NFP and FFP. These results indicate the drought-induced mortality risk of R. pseudoacacia will increase under future climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aland restoration 3aleaf area index 3ameteorology 3amodels 3amortality 3anet primary productivity 3arisk 3asustainable forestry 3awater conservation 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aBBGC-SPERRY model 0aNPP 0aLAImax 0aAET 0aAPLK1 aZhang, Zhongdian1 aHuang, Mingbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9792-31241 aZhao, Xiaofang1 aYang, Fan1 aWu, Xiaofei0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 325 p.109160-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.1091603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245010200168520248600270592002802756650001302784650001202797650001602809650001002825650001402835650001502849650002202864650003402886650001302920650001402933650001302947650001402960650001402974650001702988650001503005650001803020651001103038700002303049773012303072856008103195852000903276655001203285IND60794060920221117190625.0220922e20220908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079406092DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120921352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzembor, Jerzy H.10aGenome-Wide Association Study of Agronomic Traits in European Spring Barley from Polish Gene Bank  aThe barley old cultivars can be used as a source of genetic diversity to breed new varieties well adapted to different environmental conditions. In this study, 431 European barley accessions were evaluated phenotypically across 2 years under field conditions and genotypically using DArTseq to gain insight into the genetic architecture of phenology, biomass, yield components, and seed yield traits. Accessions were grouped into sub-collections by cultivation period (group A—cultivated prior to 1985, B—cultivated after 1985, and C—Polish landraces), and by European country of origin or European region, to compare their phenological and agronomic value for 16 traits such as: days to heading (DH), days to milk-waxy stage (DMW), days to maturity (DM), days to harvest (DPH), plant height (PH), lodging (LT), row number (RN), spike density (SD), spike length (SL), grain per spike (NGS), glume colour (GC1), grain awn type (GAT), grain covering (GT), grain pericarp colour (GPC), and 1000—grain weight (TGW), and to indicate marker-trait associations (MTAs) with these traits. Based on the results, phenotypic plants per se under field conditions and spikes, or seeds under laboratory conditions it was possible to cluster the collection. DH negatively correlated with PH and important yield components, such TGW. Overall, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis identified 143 MTAs associated with these traits. Twenty-three MTAs were associated with plant phenological stages: 5 MTAs with DH, 6 MTAs with DMW, 5 MTAs with DM, and 9 MTAs with DPH. Eighty-nine SMTAs for plant phenotypic traits were identified: 1 for LT and 88 MTAs for PH. Thirty-one markers were identified for agronomic yield traits: 16 MTAs for SD, 11 MTAs for NGS, and 4 for TGW. One association result, 7241263-17 on chromosome 2H, corresponded to the genomic region mapped for DM, DPH, and SD. Marker 3258999-37-C/T on chromosome 2H, significant for NGS, was closely located to results 3263044-31-G/T for SD and 3263989-64-A/C for DMW. On chromosome 6H, closely located were markers significant for SD (3255466-35-C/G) and for NGS (3259102-57-C/A). Moreover, on chromosome 6H, closely located were markers significant for SD (3918801-14-G/A), for NGS (3666407-49-T/G), and for DMW (3663162-62-A/C). The well-characterized barley collection and identified MTAs markers will be used to create a Polish Genebank platform and will serve as a valuable resource for precise breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3achromosomes 3acolor 3acultivars 3agene banks 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3alandraces 3apericarp 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3aseed yield 3aspring barley 3aEurope1 aCzembor, Elzbieta 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Sept. 08, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120921353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245014200159520190700301592002802208650002402236650002102260650001502281650001502296650001302311650001302324650001502337650001102352650001302363650002402376650001902400650002702419650001802446650001102464650002302475650001702498650001502515700002202530700002202552700002202574700002402596700002302620700003102643700002402674700002002698700002002718773012302738856008102861852000902942655001202951IND60794061020221117190628.0220922e20220908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079406102DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120921342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuhas,  10aAdsorptive Analysis of Azo Dyes on Activated Carbon Prepared from Phyllanthus emblica Fruit Stone Sequentially via Hydrothermal Treatment  aThe present work aims to provide insight into the role of the functional group in the adsorption of azo dyes namely, ethyl orange (EO), methyl orange (MO), and metanil yellow (MY), on the activated carbon (surface area 569 m²·g⁻¹) prepared from Phyllanthus emblica fruit stone by low-pressure hydrothermal treatment (AC-HTPEFS). More specifically, this study would facilitate a better understanding of the involvement of different amino substituents (-CH₃, -C₂H₅, phenyl group) on the adsorption of azo dye molecules. The experimental adsorption isotherms of the azo dyes quantified with different adsorbents and temperatures (25–45 °C) were utilized to know the effect of functional groups on dye adsorption. Additionally, the equilibrium data were analyzed by applying isotherm models (Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin) in order to elucidate the best-fit isotherm model and adsorption capacity, with the Langmuir model fitting the isotherms best as shown by the higher correlation coefficients obtained (0.984–0.994). The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities of EO, MO, and MY obtained at 25 °C were found to be 0.202, 0.187, and 0.158 mmol·g⁻¹, respectively, which was attributed to the hydrophobicity and geometry of dye molecules. Moreover, adsorption kinetics conformed well with the pseudo-second-order model. The negative ΔG°, positive ΔH,° and positive ΔS° indicated the adsorption process to be favorable, endothermic, and increased randomness at the solid–liquid interface. Our findings indicate that the porous activated carbon from hydrothermally treated Phyllanthus emblica fruit stone exhibited a promising potential for the removal of azo dyes with rapid kinetics and high adsorption capacity. The present study could thus pave a way for future utilization of activated carbons produced via hydrothermal treatment techniques for wastewater applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllanthus emblica 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagronomy 3aazo dyes 3aendothermy 3afruits 3ageometry 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquid-solid interface 3amethyl orange 3amodels 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3awastewater1 aKushwaha, Sarita 1 aTyagi, Inderjeet 1 aAhmed, Jahangeer 1 aChaudhary, Shubham 1 aChaudhary, Monika 1 aStephen Inbaraj, Baskaran 1 aGoscianska, Joanna 1 aKarri, Rama Rao1 aSridhar, Kandi 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Sept. 08, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120921343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245015200172300001400324520127600338592002801614650002301642650002901665650001301694650001601707650002501723650001701748650002301765650002201788650002101810650002401831650002001855650001201875650001901887650002801906650001801934650001301952650002201965650000901987650001401996650002002010650002502030650001402055650001402069650002302083653002302106653001302129653002202142653002502164653002002189653002802209653003002237653001802267700001702285773009602302856008802398852000902486655001202495IND60609629420221120213926.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060962942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2016.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujiwara, Yumi10aMolecular cloning and characterization of a Perilla frutescens cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes the later steps of perillaldehyde biosynthesis  ap. 26-37.  aPerilla produces the cyclohexanoid monoterpene perillaldehyde as a major constituent of an essential oil that is accumulated in its glandular trichomes. Perillaldehyde is a marker compound for quality control of soyo and has biological activities such as antibacterial, sedative, or vasodilatory effects. The predicted perillaldehyde formation involves the cyclization of geranyl diphosphate, hydroxylation, and oxidation, and cytochrome P450 plays a crucial role in perillaldehyde biosynthesis. In this study, a cytochrome P450-type enzyme with perillyl alcohol and perillaldehyde synthase activities was isolated by analyzing an expressed sequence tag library from several oil types of pure lines of perilla. A recombinant protein with a sequence that was highly specific for the type of perillaldehyde was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and evaluated by an in vitro enzymatic reaction. The recombinant protein catalyzed the hydroxylation and oxidation of limonene to perillyl alcohol and perillaldehyde. Cytochrome P450 limonene-7-hydroxylase cDNA from Perilla frutescens has been previously isolated. The cytochrome P450 isolated in this study shares 37% amino-acid identity with the previously isolated enzyme; however, it may have different characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerilla frutescens 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcohols 3aamino acids 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acomplementary DNA 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aessential oils 3aexpressed sequence tags 3ahydroxylation 3alimonene 3amolecular cloning 3aoils 3aoxidation 3aquality control 3arecombinant proteins 3asedatives 3atrichomes 3avasodilator agents 0aPerilla frutescens 0aLabiatae 0aMolecular cloning 0aBiosynthetic pathway 0aCytochrome P450 0aPerillaldehyde synthase 0aPerillyl alcohol synthase 0aMonoterpenoid1 aIto, Michiho0 tPhytochemistry.g2017 Feb., v. 134 p.26-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2016.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011000172520195800282592002802240650001202268650001902280650002402299650004102323650004002364650001002404650002002414650001902434650002102453650002002474650001802494650003302512651001002545653004002555653003902595653002002634653003002654700002002684700002202704700001902726700002002745700002302765700002502788700002302813700006302836773009402899856008602993852000903079655001203088IND60757001320221118003027.0220214e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075700132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e083912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsare, George A.10aHigh degree of prostate related LUTS in a prospective cross-sectional community study in Ghana (Mamprobi)  aChanging voiding patterns, volume and frequency, may sometimes be mistaken for anxiety, stress or increase in fluid consumption. In the aging male population, the commencement of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may be silent and perceived as “normal” and unrelated to Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of apparently “silent LUTS” (perceived asymptomatic LUTS) in men in a Ghanaian Community as well as its underlying risk factors. One hundred and eleven (111) men (40–70 years) were recruited from a community in Ghana. The International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) questionnaire (administered in the local language and English) and ultrasonographic imaging of the prostate volume (PV) were utlized to collect data. IPSS score >7 plus PV > 30 cm³ was definitive of lower urinary tract symptoms. Eighty-one (81) participants were classified “LUTS Negative” (LN) and 30, “LUTS Positive” (LP). Risk factors i.e., cholesterol (CHOL), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), coronary risk (CR), BMI and Blood Pressure were also determined. The prevalence of LUTS using only IPSS definition alone was 42.3%. However, IPSS in combination with Prostate Volume gave a prevalence of 27.0%. LN subjects had enlarged prostate (41.98%) and LP, 100%. Quality of life (QoL) was better in the LUTS Negative than LUTS Positive group (p < 0.001). In the univariant analysis coronary risk, triglyceride and VLDL contributed to LUTS (p = 0.023, 0.22, 0.22, respectively). In a multivariant analysis HDL-C (p = 0.027), BMI (p = 0.047) and triglyceride (p = 0.019) significantly contributed to LUTS. The prevalence of LUTS (42.3%) is high. Components of Metabolic Syndrome- HDL-C, BMI, and coronary risk were associated with LUTS. This emphasizes the need for community education.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3ablood pressure 3acommunity education 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amales 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3atriacylglycerols 3aultrasonography 3aurinary tract 3avery low density lipoprotein 3aGhana 0aLower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) 0aBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 0aProstate volume 0aMetabolic syndrome (MetS)1 aSule, Derick S.1 aOblitey, Jared N.1 aNtiforo, Reese1 aAsiedu, Bernice1 aAmoah, Brodrick Y.1 aLamptey, Emmanuel L.1 aAfriyie, Daniel K.1 aBotwe, Benard Ohene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0477-640X0 tHeliyon.g2021 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.e08391-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e083913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245011000157500002000267520163600287592002801923650001401951650001901965650001301984650001901997650001402016650001502030650002302045650001602068650002202084700002202106700002802128700002102156700001902177700003302196773010802229856007302337852000902410655001202419IND60772317320221119190309.0220402e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077231732DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.36292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColado, Raquel10aClimatic stability, not average habitat temperature, determines thermal tolerance of subterranean beetles  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe climatic variability hypothesis predicts the evolution of species with wide thermal tolerance ranges in environments with variable temperatures, and the evolution of thermal specialists in thermally stable environments. In caves, the extent of spatial and temporal thermal variability experienced by taxa decreases with their degree of specialization to deep subterranean habitats. We use phylogenetic generalized least squares to model the relationship among thermal tolerance (upper lethal limits), subterranean specialization (estimated using ecomorphological traits), and habitat temperature in 16 beetle species of the tribe Leptodirini (Leiodidae). We found a significant, negative relationship between thermal tolerance and the degree of subterranean specialization. Conversely, habitat temperature had only a marginal effect on lethal limits. In agreement with the climatic variability hypothesis and under a climate change context, we show that the specialization process to live in deep subterranean habitats involves a reduction of upper lethal limits, but not an adjustment to habitat temperature. Thermal variability seems to exert a higher evolutionary pressure than mean habitat temperature to configure the thermal niche of subterranean species. Our results provide novel insights on thermal physiology of species with poor dispersal capabilities and on the evolutionary process of adaptation to subterranean environments. We further emphasize that the pathways determining vulnerability of subterranean species to climate change greatly depend on the degree of specialization to deep subterranean environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeiodidae 3aclimate change 3ahabitats 3aheat tolerance 3aphylogeny 3aphysiology 3aselection pressure 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aPallarés, Susana1 aFresneda, J.q(Javier),1 aMammola, Stefano1 aRizzo, Valeria1 aSánchez‐Fernández, David0 tEcology.g2022 Apr., v. 103, no. 4 p.e3629-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.36293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014400164300001900308520148300327592002801810650002001838650001801858650002801876650001501904650001201919650003801931650001001969650002801979650002402007650004302031650001102074650002102085650003002106650002402136650001502160650004302175650002402218650002802242653001502270653002802285653000902313653001002322653001902332653002102351700001902372700001602391700001602407700001302423700001702436700001402453700002002467700001802487773011202505856008102617852000902698655001202707IND60600623920221119144100.0180703e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060062392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lifeng10aEffect of oral consumption of probiotic Lactobacillus planatarum P-8 on fecal microbiota, SIgA, SCFAs, and TBAs of adults of different ages  ap. 776-783.e1.  aProbiotics may improve intestinal health by modulating intestinal microbiota. However, the age-related variation in response to probiotic consumption is understudied. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oral consumption of Lactobacillus plantarum P-8 (Lp-8) on human intestinal microflora, secretary immunoglobulin A (SIgA), total bile acids (TBAs), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of different aged adults.Thirty-three recruited individuals, including young (mean age 26 y), middle-aged (mean age 51 y), and elderly (mean age 76 y) volunteers, were given a single daily oral dose of Lp-8 (6 × 10¹⁰ colony forming units) for 4 wk. Fecal samples were collected before starting, during, and after stopping Lp-8 intake. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect for fecal microflora, SIgA, TBAs, and SCFAs.Results showed an increase in Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05) and other beneficial bacteria, whereas Desulfovibrio (P < 0.05) and other opportunistic pathogens decreased after taking Lp-8 for 4 wk. Lp-8 consumption also affected fecal levels of SIgA, TBAs, and SCFAs.Lp-8 administration could improve human gastrointestinal health. However, some of these effects were transient and gradually disappeared once the intervention was discontinued. Moreover, the extent of these desirable effects was age-related.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aDesulfovibrio 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3abile acids 3aelderly 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3agastrointestinal system 3agel electrophoresis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aoral administration 3aprobiotics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecondary infection 3ashort chain fatty acids 0aProbiotics 0aLactobacillus plantarum 0aLp-8 0aHuman 0aGut microbiota 0aFecal microbiota1 aZhang, Jiachao1 aGuo, Zhuang1 aKwok, Laiyu1 aMa, Chen1 aZhang, Wenyi1 aLv, Qiang1 aHuang, Weiqiang1 aZhang, Heping0 tNutrition.g2014 July,  Aug., v. 30, no. 7-8 p.776-783.e1dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2013.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010400176520134100280592002801621650001301649650002201662650001401684650000901698650001301707650000701720650001001727650001601737650002101753650002201774650001801796653001801814653001701832653001201849700002801861700001701889700006101906700001901967700002301986773009402009856008602103852000902189655001202198IND60757001420221118003225.0220214e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075700142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e083922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWulandari, Asri Peni10aEffect of harvesting age of plant and pectinolytic selected-fungi in biodegumming ramie performance  aRamie is one of the long natural fiber has strong mechanical properties. To improve the quality of ramie fiber, this study developed a bio degumming method from superior isolates of pectinolytic fungi Rhizopus sp. and optimization of raw fiber based on harvesting time. The results of the pectinolytic fungi selection were used as a bio degumming bio starter under optimum conditions of pH and temperature. Also, fiber material harvested at 50-day and 60- day to obtain an increase in the physical quality. The bio degummed fiber was analysed to determine the tenacity and fineness, the functional groups contained, thermal analysis, moisture regain and content, material polymers, and degree of crystallinity. Based on the results, the finest ramie properties with 50-day harvested fiber are as follows: strength 24.54 ± 0, 02 g/tex, elongation 12.04 ± 2,90%, fineness 1.33 ± 0,17 tex, moisture regain 8.23 ± 0,18 %, and moisture content 8.96 ± 0,21 %. Ramie fibers at initial conditions and after bio degumming at 50 and 60-day harvested had the same pattern of thermal stability. The dyeability test showed that the degummed 60-day harvested fibers has the greatest dye fixing ability. The bio degumming process with this method can improve the quality and dyeability of the rami fiber which can be used for future applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizopus 3acrystal structure 3adegumming 3adyes 3afineness 3apH 3aramie 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3athermal stability 3awater content 0aBio degumming 0aPectinolytic 0aTextile1 aPurba, Junaedy Raganzan1 aIrawan, Budi1 aMasruchin, Nanang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0866-754X1 aIsmayati, Maya1 aGustiani, Rr.

This paper presents sedimentological, high-resolution x-ray fluorescence (XRF scanning), micropaleontological, and x-ray diffraction (XRD) data from three shallow sediment cores that were retrieved from Aliki (ancient Siphai or Tipha) salt pond. The study area is located in a unique, highly tectonic geographical region, at the northeast part of the Gulf of Corinth in Greece. Beachrock deposits that form a barrier between the salt pond and the marine environment seem to play an important role in the evolution of the area. The chronological framework was set at around 3100 cal. BP by four ¹⁴C radiocarbon dates, and the evolutionary model that was established indicates four different changes taking place during this period at the study area. From around 3100 to 1600 cal. BP, a transition from a closed to an open lagoonal environment was identified, interrupted by a fluvial terrestrial deposit at around 2500 cal. BP. A shift toward a closed lagoonal system at around 1600 cal. BP and the establishment of a salt pond environment seem to correlate with tectonic activity. The study provides important information about the evolution of coastal landscape in such a tectonic active region and points the interaction between regional human activity and climatic changes during the late-Holocene period.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund (ESF)) through the Operational Program ‘Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning’ in the context of the project ‘Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research’ (MIS-5000432), implemented by the State Scholarships Foundation (ΙΚΥ).

In this work, we aimed to develop a set of simple and appropriate physiological proxies that could be used as reliable indicators to predict plant drought responses and validate the role of specific physiological traits such as root length, stomata density, and residual transpiration, in the drought tolerance and recovery in barley. Eighty barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes were subjected to progressive droughting until the soil moisture level reached 10%, followed by rewatering. Plants were visually scored at the end of drought period and two weeks after rewatering. SPAD values and chlorophyll fluorescence Fᵥ/Fₘ ratio were also measured, alongside with stomatal density (SD) and residual transpiration (RT). The same genotypes were germinated in paper rolls treated with 15% (w/v) of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 by quantification of changes in the root growth patterns. Responses to drought stress varied among the genotypes, and drought tolerance and recovery scores were significantly correlated with each other. Changes in SPAD value, Fᵥ/Fₘ ratio and root length were significantly correlated with the drought tolerance and recovery indices. Both indices correlated strongly with the SD and RT of irrigated plants, although in an unexpected direction. We have also correlated the extent of plants’ drought tolerance to their ability to grow in saline soils (a condition often termed a “physiological drought”) and found a positive association between these two traits. The fact that drought tolerant genotype also possessed higher salinity tolerance implies some common mechanisms conferring both traits. Plants having less SD and more RT under irrigated conditions showed higher drought tolerance. It is concluded that lower SD and higher RT under optimal conditions may be used as proxies for drought tolerance in barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aagronomy 3abarley 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3airrigation 3apaper 3apolyethylene glycol 3aroot growth 3asalt tolerance 3asoil water 3atranspiration 3awater content 3awater stress1 aShabala, Lana 1 aBrodribb, Timothy J.1 aZhou, Meixue 1 aShabala, Sergey 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Sept. 08, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120921363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010600159300001800265520120400283592002801487650001001515650002301525650002101548650001701569650002301586650001401609650001901623650001301642650003301655650003701688700002001725700001401745700002101759773012101780856007401901852000901975655001201984IND60667070020221118025751.0190919e20141208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066707002DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra13060j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoganci, Tugba10aPreparation of an EDOT-based polymer: optoelectronic properties and electrochromic device application  ap. 2630-2639.  aHere we present the synthesis, characterization and electropolymerization of a new EDOT-based monomer; 5,10-dihydrobenzo[f]thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxocine (DTD). Electrochemical polymerization of DTD was performed potentiostatically by using dichloromethane (DCM) as solvent and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBPF₆) as supporting electrolyte. Homopolymer [P(DTD)] films and copolymer [P(DTD-co-TPA)] films of DTD prepared by using 4-(2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-pyrrole-1-yl)butane-1-amine (TPA) were characterized via CV and UV-vis spectroscopy. Spectroelectrochemical analysis of P(DTD) revealed electronic transitions at 585 nm (π–π* transition) with an electronic band gap of 1.69 eV. Electrochromic studies revealed that P(DTD) has competitive properties to EDOT. Furthermore, a dual-type complementary colored polymer electrochromic device based on P(DTD) and P(TPA) was constructed in sandwich configuration. Spectroelectrochemical studies revealed that the oxidized state of the device shows a blue color whereas it is yellow in the reduced state. The maximum contrast (Δ%T) and switching time of the device were measured as 25.5% and 0.5 s for 385 nm and 21% and 1.0 s for 550 nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3amethylene chloride 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3asolvents 3atetrabutylammonium compounds 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aKurtay, Gülbin1 aAk, Metin1 aGüllü, Mustafa0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 08, v. 5, no. 4 p.2630-2639dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra13060j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245014000208300001600348520120100364536031501565592002801880596011001908596011602018650001902134650001002153650002002163650001002183650001602193650001502209650002602224650001602250653001802266653001102284653001902295653002902314653001502343700002102358700006402379700002002443700002302463700001902486773010502505856008002610852000902690655001202699IND60680836220221121045917.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068083622DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836198757982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJardine, Phillip E1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8268-235310aProxy reconstruction of ultraviolet-B irradiance at the Earth’s surface, and its relationship with solar activity and ozone thickness  ap. 155-161.  aSolar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiance that reaches the Earth’s surface acts as a biotic stressor and has the potential to modify ecological and environmental functioning. The challenges of reconstructing ultraviolent (UV) irradiance prior to the satellite era mean that there is uncertainty over long-term surface UV-B patterns, especially in relation to variations in solar activity over centennial and millennial timescales. Here, we reconstruct surface UV-B irradiance over the last 650 years using a novel UV-B proxy based on the chemical signature of pollen grains. We demonstrate a statistically significant positive relationship between the abundance of UV-B absorbing compounds in Pinus pollen and modelled solar UV-B irradiance. These results show that trends in surface UV-B follow the overall solar activity pattern over centennial timescales, and that variations in solar output are the dominant control on surface level UV-B flux, rather than solar modulated changes in ozone thickness. The Pinus biochemical response demonstrated here confirms the potential for solar activity driven surface UV-B variations to impact upon terrestrial biotas and environments over long timescales.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: We thank NERC (grant NE/K005294/1) for funding this research, and a previous NERC award (NER/S/A/2002/10316) to University of Birmingham–based PhD student, Ann England.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/K005294/1cNatural Environment Research Councildhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000270  aNER/S/A/2002/10316cNatural Environment Research Councildhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000270 3aHolocene epoch 3aPinus 3alight intensity 3aozone 3apine pollen 3asatellites 3aultraviolet radiation 3auncertainty 0apalaeoclimate 0apollen 0asolar activity 0aultraviolet-B irradiance 0avegetation1 aFraser, Wesley T1 aGosling, William D.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9903-84011 aRoberts, C Neil1 aEastwood, Warren J1 aLomax, Barry H0 tHolocene.g2020 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.155-161dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836198757983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013800155300001800293520160200311592002801913650001501941650001501956650001501971650001101986650001901997650001502016650001102031650002402042650001302066650000902079650001702088650001102105650001502116650001602131650001302147700001702160700002002177773010502197856007502302852000902377655001202386IND60534137420221116150848.0160802e20141218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053413742DNAL7 a10.1021/ef502066t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Yongho10aFeasibility Study of a Moving-Bed Adsorption Process with Heat Integration for CO2 Capture through Energy Evaluation and Optimization  ap. 7599-7608.  aThe feasibility of employing a moving-bed adsorption (MBA) process as a postcombustion carbon capture process was investigated using zeolite 13X as the adsorbent. The MBA process consists of an adsorption bed and two desorption beds, which are operated under different temperatures and pressures. Adsorbent particles circulate around the beds in a countercurrent direction to the gas flow in each bed. A high-efficiency heat integration scheme that recovers the heat of adsorption and reuses this energy as the heat of desorption was designed and implemented to minimize the energy requirements. A fixed-bed dehydration unit using MIL-101 (Cr) as the adsorbent was also designed for pretreatment of the flue gas and was incorporated as an integral part of the process. Models were established for predicting the operating energy for constituent process units from the dehydration to liquefaction stages, and the minimum energy requirement was calculated. The results indicated that the total energy demand per unit amount of CO₂ removal in terms of the equivalent work was intermediate to those of the optimized piperazine- and monoethanolamine-based absorption processes. The regeneration energy, which accounts for only the capture process, except for the dehydration and liquefaction processes, was estimated to be less than half of those of the absorption processes. The sensitivity of the process performance to the CO₂ selectivity and sorption capacity was also analyzed to investigate the potential improvement in the performance of the MBA process when using more efficient adsorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3aflue gas 3aheat 3aliquefaction 3amodels 3aprediction 3atemperature 3azeolites1 aKim, Kiwoong1 aLee, Kwang Soon0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2014 Dec. 18, v. 28, no. 12 p.7599-7608dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef502066t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010200167520156000269592002801829650003001857650001201887650001401899650001901913650001301932650002601945650001301971650001501984650001701999650002502016650002102041650001002062651001302072700002302085700002602108700001902134700002802153773012302181856008102304852000902385655001202394IND60794061620221117190705.0220922e20220909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079406162DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120921402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaranto, Luísa 10aResponse of the Coccinellidae Community within Sustainable Vineyards to the Surrounding Landscape  aThe family Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) includes important predatory natural enemies in agricultural crops. To survive, this group uses different occurring resources across the landscape; therefore, the landscape can influence the Coccinellidae community in agroecosystems. In this context, this work aims to evaluate the response of the Coccinellidae community to the landscape context within a gradient of distances from vineyards managed under sustainable production methods. For that, Coccinellidae were sampled in thirty-five vineyards distributed by six wine Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) regions of Portugal, and landscape metrics—composition and configuration—were calculated in a 2000 m, 1500 m, 1000 m, 750 m, and 500 m buffers around the vineyards. Then, Coccinellidae species were identified, and the response of the Coccinellidae to the landscape metrics was analyzed. In total, 326 Coccinellidae from 21 species were collected. The most abundant species were Scymnus apetzi, Scymnus interruptus, Scymnus subvillosus, Coccinella septempunctata, and Stethorus pusillus, which together represented 83.4% of the total collected individuals. Most specimens were concentrated in July and at the vegetation cover. Results from the statistical analysis (Generalized Linear Mixed Models) indicated that the presence of seminatural habitat surrounding the crop may favor Coccinellidae, while habitat fragmentation seems detrimental for them. The potential relevance of the identified Coccinellidae for pest control in vineyards is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccinella septempunctata 3aScymnus 3aStethorus 3aagroecosystems 3aagronomy 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3apest control 3astatistical analysis 3avegetation cover 3awines 3aPortugal1 aRodrigues, Isabel 1 aSantos, Sónia A.

A novel competitive immunoassay was then proposed using Cu₂S covalent conjugation with bovine serum albumin (BSA)–estradiol (E2) for the sensitive detection of trace E2 concentrations. Without using enzyme-label and acid dissolution, the Cu₂S can generate excellent electrochemical signals. The quantitative detection was based on the competitive binding of the E2 antibody with Cu₂S-labeled E2 or free E2. The redox signal decreased with increasing concentration of the free E2 as the amount of Cu₂S–BSA–E2 labels decreased at the immunosensor probe. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques were used to characterize the immunosensor. Square wave voltammetry was used to monitor the electrochemical response. The immunosensor exhibited a wide linear response from 25 to 7500 pg mL⁻¹ with a detection limit of 7.5 pg mL⁻¹. The proposed method showed good precision, broad linear range, and acceptable stability and could be used for the detection of E2 in real samples, which showed promising application in field research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abovine serum albumin 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aestradiol 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ananoparticles 3asulfides1 aWang, Yaoguang1 aZhang, Yunhui1 aYan, Tao1 aYan, Liangguo1 aWei, Qin1 aDu, Bin0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 23, v. 5, no. 9 p.6512-6517dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra13066a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006300138245011700201500002000318520138300338592002801721650003101749650001401780650001801794650001101812650001401823650001301837700003101850700002001881700001601901700006501917773010801982856007302090852000902163655001202172IND60772317720221119190300.0220402e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077231772DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.36242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoshizaki, Kazuhiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7654-912910aStochasticity of individual competition and local matchup inequality for saplings in a niche‐structured forest  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEcologists have recently accepted the notion that species coexistence involves both niche and neutral processes, but few studies have explained how both of these opposite views can explain coexistence in the same community. Here we focus on competition among sessile organisms and explored first the extent to which species‐based niche reflects local “matchups” between nearby individuals, using 726 saplings of 10 temperate tree species, and second the members engaging in the matchups, which have rarely been quantified despite the importance in mixed‐species forests. Growth responses to light showed considerable species‐level differences, suggesting commonly seen regeneration niches. Outcomes of the individual matchups were basically predictable from the species mean response, but also with substantial contribution of within‐species variation. We found strong imbalance in matchup frequencies, such that some individuals meet more individuals of differing species but others meet fewer, as well as many isolated, competition‐free ones. The niche and neutral processes appear to reflect, respectively, between‐ and within‐species differences, and our findings suggest that even when niche segregation is discernible, the role of stochasticity for the frequency of local competition, as well as its outcomes, cannot be discounted in species coexistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological differentiation 3afrequency 3amixed forests 3aniches 3aphylogeny 3asaplings1 aTakahashi, Satoshi,d1957-1 aTanaka, Hiroshi1 aOki, Shinji1 aMatsushita, Michinari1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5488-40030 tEcology.g2022 Apr., v. 103, no. 4 p.e3624-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.36243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007400166300001600240520144800256592002801704650002101732650001001753650001401763650001801777650001701795650001301812653002301825653003001848653002301878653002901901653002401930700001801954700001701972700001401989700001702003700001802020700001602038700001502054700001402069773011102083856008602194852000902280655001202289IND60793104820221119150904.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079310482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jun10aSelf-assembly hydrogels of therapeutic agents for local drug delivery  ap. 898-921.  aAdvanced drug delivery systems are of vital importance to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Among various recently developed formulations, self-assembling hydrogels composed of therapeutic agents have shown promising potential for local drug delivery owing to their excellent biocompatibility, high drug-loading efficiency, low systemic toxicity, and sustained drug release behavior. In particular, therapeutic agents self-assembling hydrogels with well-defined nanostructures are beneficial for direct delivery to the target site via injection, not only improving drug availability, but also extending their retention time and promoting cellular uptake. In brief, the self-assembly approach offers better opportunities to improve the precision of pharmaceutical treatment and achieve superior treatment efficacies. In this review, we intend to cover the recent developments in therapeutic agent self-assembling hydrogels. First, the molecular structures, self-assembly mechanisms, and application of self-assembling hydrogels are systematically outlined. Then, we summarize the various self-assembly strategies, including the single therapeutic agent, metal-coordination, enzyme-instruction, and co-assembly of multiple therapeutic agents. Finally, the potential challenges and future perspectives are discussed. We hope that this review will provide useful insights into the design and preparation of therapeutic agent self-assembling hydrogels.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3adrugs 3ahydrogels 3ananomaterials 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 0aTherapeutic agents 0aSelf-assembling hydrogels 0aMolecule structure 0aSelf-assembly mechanisms 0aLocal drug delivery1 aSong, Xianwen1 aYang, Zhaoyu1 aYin, Chao1 aLuo, Weikang1 aYin, Chunyang1 aNi, Yaqiong1 aWang, Yang1 aZhang, Yi0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Oct., v. 350 p.898-921dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014000162300001800302520174200320592002802062650001702090650001902107650001702126650002202143700003102165773010502196856007502301852000902376655001202385IND60534137620221116150938.0160802e20141218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053413762DNAL7 a10.1021/ef502101b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, Daniel G.10aChar Gasification Kinetics in Mixtures of CO2 and H2O: The Role of Partial Pressure in Determining the Extent of Competitive Inhibition  ap. 7643-7648.  aThere is considerable interest in experimental studies investigating the kinetics of the reactions of carbonaceous chars with mixtures of CO₂ and H₂O. Several studies report a range of outcomes: some conclude that there is competition between CO₂ and H₂O for active sites, leading to inhibition of reaction rates of one reactant by another; others conclude that the two reactions occur independently. This work reviews and analyses this recent research activity, highlighting the importance of experimental conditions in generating appropriate gas–solid reaction rate data (many of the published studies have been performed under conditions where it is difficult to gain insight into the mechanisms of gas–solid reaction kinetics in isolation from other chemical and physical processes that may be occurring). This work also uses new data to demonstrate how reactant partial pressures can affect the availability of the reactive surface to a second reactant and, in turn, the extent to which a competitive effect is apparent; relatively low partial pressures of reactants (approximately 0.05 MPa and below) are less likely to show evidence of competition, whereas measurements at higher partial pressures (up to 3.0 MPa) are more likely to reveal competitive behavior. This is consistent with a reaction scheme that has CO₂ and H₂O competing for reaction sites and inhibitory effects that are only apparent when surface saturation becomes high enough for competition to impact observed kinetics. This result is important and provides further evidence that conventional Langmuir–Hinshelwood reaction schemes for representing char gasification reactions can be applied over a range of pressures and mixtures of reactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acarbon dioxide 3agasification 3areaction kinetics1 aHarris, D.

Due to the spider's long life cycle two cohorts are present for the whole season and for one month three cohorts coexist, which allowed me to investigate whether coexisting spiders feed on similar or different prey. Diets of spiders from these three cohorts were found to differ in three aspects: prey taxa, prey diversity and prey size. Spiders from each cohort maintained a fairly constant ratio between prey size and their own size throughout the life cycle, which resulted in dietary separation between individuals from coexisting cohorts. Such mechanisms may reduce the intensity of competitive interactions between coexisting spiders.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSpider 0adiet 0aprey 0apolyphagy 0aintraspecific competition 0adevelopment 0aPoland0 tJournal of arachnology.g2011 Aug., v. 39, no. 2 p.230-235dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FCP10-63.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159100001600168245012900184300001800313500002400331500001500355520167000370650001502040650001902055650001902074650002602093650001902119650002702138650001402165650001302179650001902192650002002211650001102231650002402242650001202266650002902278650002802307650001902335650005302354650005502407650001702462650001902479653001902498653001302517653002202530700001602552700002302568773012502591852000902716856008002725930003302805945002502838946001302863655001202876IND4421337520221120064229.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442133752DNAL7 a196104612pmid7 a10.1603/029.102.03672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8211 aTarelli, G.10aToxicity to Vapor Exposure and Topical Application of Essential Oils and Monoterpenes on Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae)  ap. 1383-1388.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe medical and veterinary pest Musca domestica L. has developed resistance to most insecticides used against it. For this reason, there is a constant search for new alternative control tools. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the toxicological effects caused by the fumigant activity and the topical application of five essential oils and five monoterpenes in M. domestica adult males and (2) to study the variation of the fumigant activity of the essential oils and monoterpenes according to the solvent used (acetone or a silicone base). Houses flies were exposed to vapors delivered by filter paper treated with 200 μl of essential oil or monoterpene (10%) in acetone or a silicone base. The knockdown time 50% (KT50) values obtained for essential oils (expressed in minutes) were 3.3 (eucalyptus); 10.1 (orange); 10.4 (mint); 10.9 (lavender); and 17.7 (geranium). The KT50 values obtained for monoterpenes (expressed in minutes) were 2.3 (eucalyptol); 7.5 (limonene); 7.6 (linalool); 19.0 (menthone); and 22.6 (menthyl acetate). In all cases, a delay in the onset of poisoning symptoms was observed when a silicone base vehicle was used. When topically applied, the lethal dose 50% (LD50) values for essential oils (expressed in micrograms of oil/insect) were 0.07 (geranium); 0.09 (mint); 0.13 (lavender); 0.14 (eucalyptus); and 0.16 (orange). The LD50 values for monoterpenes (expressed in micrograms of monoterpene/insect) were 0.04 (linalool); 0.09 (menthyl acetate); 0.10 (limonene); 0.11 (menthone); and 0.13 (eucalyptol). These results suggest that the studied essential oils and monoterpenes are potential tools for controlling M. domestica. 3afumigation 3alethal dose 50 3amonoterpenoids 3afumigant insecticides 3aessential oils 3abotanical insecticides 3amortality 3asolvents 3ainsect control 3aMusca domestica 3avapors 3atopical application 2aAnimals 2aHousefliesxdrug effects 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMonoterpenesxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aOils, Volatilexadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aTime Factors 2aVolatilization 0aknockdown time 0atoxicity 0ahouse fly control1 aZerba, E.N.1 aAlzogaray, Raul A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2009 June, v. 102, no. 3 p.1383-1388dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/029.102.03673Available from publisher's Web site  a20090708b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/07/08  aOther US 7aarticle02526naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010600157300001600263520153000279592002801809653001301837653001701850653002301867653001801890653002401908653001201932653001401944700002201958700002301980773011302003856007502116852000902191655001202200IND60125025720221118065401.0151101e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012502572DNAL7 a10.1636/CP10-82.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaret, Marion10aComparative responses of spider and carabid beetle assemblages along an urban-rural boundary gradient  ap. 236-243.  aThe urbanization process is the motor of deep environmental changes at both local and landscape levels.

The following parameters were estimated: assemblage composition, species richness, and activity-densities overall and per life history trait (habitat preference, dispersal abilities for carabid beetles and hunting guilds for spiders). The field data were collected in 2009 using pitfall traps set randomly in hedgerows within urban, boundary and rural zones (30 traps in total). 924 adult spiders belonging to 78 species were collected, whereas the 330 captured carabid beetles belonged to 25 species. We found no evidence of any significant change in carabid beetle activity-density (overall and for most life history traits) or in species richness along the urban-rural gradient. Conversely, there was a significant change in spider activity-density, both per habitat preference and per hunting guild. We also found a progressive change in community composition for spiders. Our results suggest that studying different model groups can provide complementary information about urbanization.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHedgerow 0aurbanization 0ahabitat preference 0atrophic guild 0adispersal abilities 0aAraneae 0aCarabidae1 aPétillon, Julien1 aBurel, Françoise,0 tJournal of arachnology.g2011 Aug., v. 39, no. 2 p.236-243dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FCP10-82.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245005500196300001600251500001700267520210600284592002802390650001302418650001902431650001002450650003002460650001702490650002102507650001602528650001302544650002002557650001402577650001002591650002002601650002202621650001302643650001402656650001402670650001602684650002002700651001902720651001202739700001702751700005402768773012402822856007302946852000903019655001203028IND60683750720221121090457.0200210e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068375072DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.131572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBezdekova, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5899-492010aChronic severe pyloric lesions in horses: 47 cases  ap. 200-204.  aCase Reports  aBACKGROUND: The clinical findings and outcome associated with chronic severe equine pyloric lesions have not been well described previously. OBJECTIVES: To describe the history, clinical signs, endoscopic and ultrasound results, laboratory data, treatment, pathological findings and survival of horses with chronic severe pyloric lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Medical records from horses treated at clinics in Czech Republic and Germany in which chronic severe pyloric lesions were confirmed endoscopically and/or on post‐mortem examination were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty‐seven horses were identified, median age 3 years (range 0.8–16 years). There were 3 geldings, 23 mares and 19 stallions and the majority were Warmbloods (60%). The most common presenting signs were poor body condition (40; 87%), slow eating (39; 83%), recurrent colic (35; 74%) and selective appetite (30; 64%). The most consistent laboratory abnormality was hypoalbuminaemia (10; 36%). Slow gastric emptying was confirmed in 29 individuals during gastroscopy and/or ultrasonography. Endoscopy revealed distal oesophagitis in 9 of 47 horses, and severe equine squamous gastric disease in all cases. Pyloric lesions were depressed, flat or raised fibrinosuppurative pyloric ulcers and were seen in 45 (2 pylori were not seen endoscopically). Thirty‐two cases were treated, with 28 responding well initially. All treated cases received anti‐ulcer medication and four underwent gastrojejunostomy. Clinical signs recurred after medical treatment in at least 11 cases. Only 18 of 44 cases (41%) survived long term (3 were lost to follow‐up). Horses diagnosed at 3 years of age or younger were significantly less likely to survive more than 6 months than older horses (27.8% vs. 72.2%, P<0.001). MAIN LIMITATIONS: The study is retrospective, some records were incomplete and case identification was subjective. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic severe pyloric lesions can be associated with delayed gastric emptying identified with ultrasonography and/or endoscopy. The prognosis is poor in young horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3abody condition 3acolic 3adigestive system diseases 3adrug therapy 3agastric emptying 3agastroscopy 3ageldings 3ahypoalbuminemia 3aingestion 3amares 3amedical records 3amedical treatment 3anecropsy 3aprognosis 3astallions 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 3aCzech Republic 3aGermany1 aWohlsein, P.1 aVenner, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1062-94060 tEquine veterinary journal.g2020 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.200-204dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1170x0425-16447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evj.131573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245015700207300001800364500001900382500002000401520155800421592002801979596006002007596007102067650002502138650004402163650002202207650002002229650002802249650002902277650002502306650001602331650002502347650004702372650002002419650002102439650001402460650001202474650001302486650001702499650001702516650001302533650002102546650001702567650001302584700002402597700002502621700002402646700002402670700002802694700006702722773012202789856007302911852000902984655001202993IND60741354520221120163747.0210611e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074135452DNAL7 a10.1111/are.151842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes‐Becerril, Martha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1149-577X10aGreen synthesis of gold nanoparticles using Turnera diffusa Willd enhanced antimicrobial properties and immune response in Longfin yellowtail leukocytes  ap. 3391-3402.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant‐mediated nanoparticle synthesis is an eco‐friendly method designed to reduce toxicity. This research reports the effects of gold nanoparticle green synthesis on immune modulation for the first time, using aqueous extract from Turnera diffusa. First, the chemical composition showed that T. diffussa is abundant in compounds, such as oplopanone, γ‐eudesmol, hydroquinone‐β‐d‐glucoside (arbutin) and inositol. The synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPDam) were confirmed by ultraviolet visible (UV‐Vis) spectrophotometry; the micro‐graphical analysis confirmed the average size that was estimated about 24 nm, which were mostly spherical in shape. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) technique helped to confirm the functional groups of the synthesized AuNPDam. Its antioxidant capability was analysed using 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydarzyl (DPPH), superoxide radical scavenging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) methods. These results indicated a worthy antioxidant activity. The synthesized AuNPDam showed strong antibacterial activity against Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila. Interestingly, AuNPDam were nontoxic to Longfin yellowtail head kidney leukocytes after 24 h. The phagocytosis activity, production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide were also enhanced in leukocytes treated with AuNPDam. Overall, the results suggested that AuNPDam is non‐cytotoxic, displays strong bactericidal activity and has therapeutic properties by enhancing the immune system.  aPublisher supplied data  aFC 2016/2820cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  aINFR‐2014‐01/225924cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSeriola rivoliana 3aTurnera diffusa 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaculture 3achemical composition 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulation 3ainositols 3akidneys 3ananogold 3anitric oxide 3aphagocytosis 3aresearch 3asuperoxide anion 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aRuvalcaba, Fernando1 aSánchez, Verónica,1 aLópez, Mercedes G.1 aSilva‐Jara, Jorge1 aHernandez‐Adame, Luis1 aAngulo Valdés, Carlos,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7965-16790 tAquaculture research.g2021 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.3391-3402dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.151843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006400168300001600232520135400248592002801602650001001630650001201640650001801652650001501670650001501685650001701700650002501717650001401742650002201756650001401778650001701792653001801809653002701827653002301854653001701877700001601894700001601910700001201926700001701938700001601955700002101971700001601992773011102008856008602119852000902205655001202214IND60793105020221119151535.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079310502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiao-Xue10aResearch progress on tumor hypoxia-associative nanomedicine  ap. 829-840.  aHypoxia at the solid tumor site is generally related to the unrestricted proliferation and metabolism of cancerous cells, which can cause tumor metastasis and aggravate tumor progression. Besides, hypoxia plays a substantial role in tumor treatment, and it is one of the main reasons that malignant tumors are difficult to cure and have a poor prognosis. On account of the tumor specific hypoxic environment, many hypoxia-associative nanomedicine have been proposed for tumor treatment. Considering the enhanced targeting effect, designing hypoxia-associative nanomedicine can not only minimize the adverse effects of drugs on normal tissues, but also achieve targeted therapy at the lesion site. Mostly, there can be three strategies for the treatment of hypoxic tumor, including improvement of hypoxic environment, hypoxia responsive drug release and hypoxia activated prodrug. The review describes the design principle and applications of tumor hypoxia-associative nanomedicine in recent years, and also explores its development trends in solid tumor treatment. Moreover, this review presents the current limitations of tumor hypoxia-associative nanomedicine in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy and immunotherapy, which may provide a reference for clinic translation of tumor hypoxia-associative nanomedicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3ahypoxia 3aimmunotherapy 3ametabolism 3ametastasis 3ananomedicine 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms 3aphotochemotherapy 3aprognosis 3aradiotherapy 0aTumor hypoxia 0aHypoxia responsiveness 0aHypoxia modulation 0aNanomedicine1 aChen, Si-Yi1 aYi, Ning-Bo1 aLi, Xin1 aChen, Si-Lin1 aLei, Zhixin1 aCheng, Dong-Bing1 aSun, Taolei0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Oct., v. 350 p.829-840dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245011500174520176600289592002802055650001702083650001302100650001702113650001202130650001502142650001202157650001902169650001402188650002402202650001102226650002102237650001902258650001702277650001602294650001202310650000902322650001302331650001602344650001802360650002102378650001302399700002802412700002102440700002102461700002802482700002002510700002002530773012302550856008102673852000902754655001202763IND60794061920221117190710.0220922e20220909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079406192DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120921422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuzunaga-Rosas, Javier 10aEffect of a Biostimulant Based on Polyphenols and Glycine Betaine on Tomato Plants’ Responses to Salt Stress  aClimate change accentuates abiotic stress conditions putting at risk several commercial cultivars particularly vulnerable to salinity in the early stages of development, which makes adopting new technologies in tune with the environment necessary to mitigate its impact. In this study, we tested the possible effects of a commercial biostimulant (BALOX®) on enhancing salt stress tolerance in salt-treated tomato plants, analysing plant growth and several stress biochemical markers: photosynthetic pigments, ion contents in roots and leaves, leaf concentrations of different osmolytes, oxidative stress markers, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and the specific activities of major antioxidant enzymes. The experimental design consisted of three soil salinity levels (non-saline, saline, and very saline), two biostimulant doses (0.4 mL and 0.8 mL of the BALOX® stock per litre of irrigation water), and the non-treated control (without biostimulant), evaluated at 30 and 60 days of treatment. The biostimulant favoured plant growth, especially at the root level and in saline soils. In addition, it helped reduce Na⁺ and Cl⁻ uptake by the roots and seemed to stimulate, to some extent, K⁺ and Ca²⁺ transport to the aerial part of the plant. The BALOX® application significantly reduced the level of stress affecting the plants in saline soils, as shown by the decrease in the contents of proline and oxidative stress biomarkers and the activity of salt-induced antioxidant enzymes. Some of the biostimulant effects were also observed under low salinity conditions; therefore, in addition to enhancing salt stress responses, BALOX® appears to stimulate the growth of tomato plants through a general improvement of photosynthesis and primary metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial parts 3aagronomy 3aantioxidants 3abetaine 3abiomarkers 3acalcium 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3aexperimental design 3aleaves 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3apolyphenols 3aproline 3arisk 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asoil salinity 3astress tolerance 3atomatoes1 aGonzález-Orenga, Sara 1 aTofei, Ana Maria1 aBoscaiu, Monica 1 aMoreno-Ramón, Héctor 1 aIbáñez, Sara,1 aVicente, Oscar 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Sept. 09, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120921423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007700167300001400244520091600258592002801174650001801202650002101220650003201241650001801273650002401291650001701315653003201332653002101364653001501385653001601400653002201416700001601438700001401454700001701468700005201485773009201537856008501629852000901714655001201723IND60750329220221121053238.0211227s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075032922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotno.2021.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Junzhu10aStrategy exploration for developing robust lyophilized cell-free systems  ap. 44-50.  aCell-free protein synthesis system is emerging as a powerful tool for rapid expression of therapeutic proteins. However, one drawback of cell-free technology is the necessity to store the major components below freezing in bulky aqueous solutions. To preserve the cell-free synthesis system for a longer time, the lyophilized cell-free system was developed, and its stability under freeze-drying conditions was explored. The novelty and the difference of this study from the others lie in determining more detailed storage conditions, which could provide a more accurate storage strategy. The effects of the treatment time, the storage temperature, and the component-mixing mode on the freeze-dried cell-free system were investigated. This study explored a robust storage strategy for freeze-dried cell-free systems and could further open up a better opportunity for on-demand synthesis of therapeutic proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3acell free system 3acell-free protein synthesis 3afreeze drying 3astorage temperature 3atherapeutics 0aCell-free synthetic biology 0aCell-free system 0aFreeze-dry 0aLyophilized 0aProtein synthesis1 aCui, Yuntao1 aCao, Zhou1 aMa, Shengnan1 aLu, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4500-62300 tBiotechnology notes.g2021, v. 2 p.44-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27463x2665-90697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotno.2021.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007100171300001600242520101700258592002801275650002701303650003101330650002001361650001401381650001701395650002201412650001101434653002101445653002301466653002601489653003101515653001301546653001501559700002001574700001801594700002201612700002401634700003301658773011101691856008601802852000901888655001201897IND60793105120221119151632.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079310512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBostock, Chiara10aAffibody-mediated controlled release of fibroblast growth factor 2  ap. 815-828.  aProtein therapeutics possess high target affinity and specificity, yet short residence times, which limit their broad utility. To overcome this challenge, we used affinity interactions to modulate protein release from a hydrogel delivery vehicle thereby prolonging therapeutic availability. Specifically, we designed an affibody-modified hyaluronan (HA)-based hydrogel as a delivery platform for fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), a neuroprotective and neuroregenerative factor in the central nervous system (CNS). We identified a highly specific affibody binding partner with moderate affinity for FGF2 using yeast surface display and flow cytometry-based screening. Importantly, we demonstrated controlled release of bioactive FGF2 from the hydrogel by varying the ratio of affibody to protein and showed increased thermal stability of FGF2 in the presence of affibody. This versatile delivery platform will allow the distinct, simultaneous release of multiple proteins based on specific affinity interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentral nervous system 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogels 3atherapeutics 3athermal stability 3ayeasts 0aProtein delivery 0aControlled release 0aAffinity interactions 0aFibroblast growth factor 2 0aHydrogel 0aHyaluronan1 aTeal, Carter J.1 aDang, Mickael1 aGolinski, Alex W.1 aHackel, Benjamin J.1 aShoichet, M.

Five areas were subjected to different burning regimes. In each area, 40 pitfall traps were installed. The arachnids were sampled for three days each month from April 2007 to October 2008. Abundance was higher in the control area than in areas subjected to any fire regime. Species richness was similar in all areas. The evenness was lower in the control area. The areas subject to fires had significantly higher diversity than the control area. Although it was not possible to rank areas according to their diversity, areas burned in the middle of the dry season tended to have higher diversity than areas burned at the beginning or end of this season, indicating that the time at which fire occurs may be more important than the frequency of burning for the diversity of cursorial arachnids in the Brazilian cerrado.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFire effects 0aspiders 0aArachnida 0aAraneae1 aMotta, Paulo César,0 tJournal of arachnology.g2011 Aug., v. 39, no. 2 p.263-272dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FCP10-85.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245006900160300001600229520094500245592002801190650002501218650001401243650001701257650001001274650001801284651001201302773009601314856007201410852000901482655001201491IND60518436420221118091027.0160417e196407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051843642DNAL7 a10.2307/1936115a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabler, Ronald D.14aThe Root System of Artemisia Tridentata at 9,500 Feet in Wyoming  ap. 633-636.  aThree plants of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) were excavated on each of four sites at 9,500 ft elevation in northwestern Wyoming. All plants studied were characterized by a woody taproot which rapidly tapered to a diameter of 2 or 3 mm within the first 6 dm of soil and a dense well‐developed system of lateral roots. About 62% of the total root length was concentrated in the upper 6 dm of the soil profile. Depth of maximum penetration varied from 12.2 to 18.3 dm, and maximum radial spread from the stem ranged from 9.1 to 15.2 dm. Root penetration and depths of concentration were slightly greater on the drier ridge and west‐exposure sites as compared to the more moist valley bottom and east exposure locations. Radial root spread was greatest on plants growing on sidehill sites. The general root configuration of big sagebrush would appear to allow utilization of both surface and subsurface moisture and nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia tridentata 3anutrients 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asoil profiles 3aWyoming0 tEcology.g1964 July, v. 45, no. 3 p.633-636dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1936115a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245012500159300002000284520185500304592002802159650001902187650001702206650001402223650001402237650002102251650001002272650001302282650001302295650001802308650001102326650001202337650001302349650002002362650001902382650002002401650002002421650001902441700005502460700001402515700001702529700006102546700005802607773014902665856007602814852000902890655001202899IND60656445820221122050524.0190814e20190718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065644582DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b053512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Jianwei10aMetal–Organic Capsules with NADH Mimics as Switchable Selectivity Regulators for Photocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation  ap. 12707-12716.  aSwitchable selective hydrogenation among the groups in multifunctional compounds is challenging because selective hydrogenation is of great interest in the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals as a result of the importance of key intermediates. Herein, we report a new approach to highly selectively (>99%) reducing C═X (X = O, N) over the thermodynamically more favorable nitro groups locating the substrate in a metal–organic capsule containing NADH active sites. Within the capsule, the NADH active sites reduce the double bonds via a typical 2e– hydride transfer hydrogenation, and the formed excited-state NAD⁺ mimics oxidize the reductant via two consecutive 1e– processes to regenerate the NADH active sites under illumination. Outside the capsule, nitro groups are highly selectively reduced through a typical 1e– hydrogenation. By combining photoinduced 1e– transfer regeneration outside the cage, both 1e– and 2e– hydrogenation can be switched controllably by varying the concentrations of the substrates and the redox potential of electron donors. This promising alternative approach, which could proceed under mild reaction conditions and use easy-to-handle hydrogen donors with enhanced high selectivity toward different groups, is based on the localization and differentiation of the 2e– and 1e– hydrogenation pathways inside and outside the capsules, provides a deep comprehension of photocatalytic microscopic reaction processes, and will allow the design and optimization of catalysts. We demonstrate the advantage of this method over typical hydrogenation that involves specific activation via well-modified catalytic sites and present results on the high, well-controlled, and switchable selectivity for the hydrogenation of a variety of substituted and bifunctional aldehydes, ketones, and imines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aactive sites 3aaldehydes 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3adrugs 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3aimines 3aketones 3alighting 3anitro compounds 3aphotocatalysis 3aredox potential 3areducing agents 3athermodynamics1 aZhao, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8197-66861 aHe, Cheng1 aZheng, Sijia1 aReek, Joost N.

However, any mapping of IWPs at regional to continental scales requires images acquired on different sensor platforms (particularly satellite) and a refined understanding of the performance stability of the method across sensor platforms through reliable evaluation assessments. In this study, we examined the transferability of a deep learning Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) model for mapping IWPs in satellite remote sensing imagery (~0.5 m) covering 272 km² and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (0.02 m) imagery covering 0.32 km². Multi-spectral images were obtained from the WorldView-2 satellite sensor and pan-sharpened to ~0.5 m, and a 20 mp CMOS sensor camera onboard a UAV, respectively. The training dataset included 25,489 and 6022 manually delineated IWPs from satellite and fixed-wing aircraft aerial imagery near the Arctic Coastal Plain, northern Alaska. Quantitative assessments showed that individual IWPs were correctly detected at up to 72% and 70%, and delineated at up to 73% and 68% F1 score accuracy levels for satellite and UAV images, respectively. Expert-based qualitative assessments showed that IWPs were correctly detected at good (40–60%) and excellent (80–100%) accuracy levels for satellite and UAV images, respectively, and delineated at excellent (80–100%) level for both images. We found that (1) regardless of spatial resolution and spectral bands, the deep learning Mask R-CNN model effectively mapped IWPs in both remote sensing satellite and UAV images; (2) the model achieved a better accuracy in detection with finer image resolution, such as UAV imagery, yet a better accuracy in delineation with coarser image resolution, such as satellite imagery; (3) increasing the number of training data with different resolutions between the training and actual application imagery does not necessarily result in better performance of the Mask R-CNN in IWPs mapping; (4) and overall, the model underestimates the total number of IWPs particularly in terms of disjoint/incomplete IWPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acameras 3acoastal plains 3adata collection 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atundra 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aAlaska 3aArctic region1 aLiljedahl, Anna K.,1 aKanevskiy, Mikhail 1 aEpstein, Howard  E.1 aJones, Benjamin  M.1 aJorgenson, M.

The type of pest or disease suffered by cotton can be determined by the disease spots on the cotton leaves. This paper presents a few-shot learning framework that can be used for cotton leaf disease spot classification task. This can be used in preventing and controlling cotton diseases timely. First, disease spots on cotton leaf’s disease images are segmented by different methods, compared by using support vector machine (SVM) method and threshold segmentation, and discussed the suitable one. Then, with segmented disease spot images as input, a disease spot dataset is established, and the cotton leaf disease spots were classified using a classical convolutional neural network classifier, the structure and framework of convolutional neural network had been designed. At last, the features of two different images are extracted by a parallel two-way convolutional neural network with weight sharing. Then, the network uses a loss function to learn the metric space, in which similar leaf samples are close to each other and different leaf samples are far away from each other. In summary, this work can be regarded as a significang reference and the benchmark comparison for the follow-up studies of few-shot learning tasks in the agricultural field. RESULTS: To achieve the classification of cotton leaf spots by small sample learning, a metric-based learning method was developed to extract cotton leaf spot features and classify the sick leaves. The threshold segmentation and SVM were compared in the extracting of leaf spot. The results showed that both of these two method can extract the leaf spot in a good performance, SVM expented more time, but the leaf spot which extracted from SVM was much more suitable for classifying, thus SVM method can retain much more information of leaf spot, such as color, shape, textures, ect, which can help classficating the leaf spot. In the process of leaf spot classification, the two-way parallel convolutional neural network was established for building the leaf spot feature extractor, and feature classifier is constructed. After establishing the metric space, KNN was used as the spot classifier, and for the construction of convolutional neural networks, commonly used models were selected for comparison, and a spatial structure optimizer (SSO) is introduced for local optimization of the model, include Vgg, DesenNet, and ResNet. Experimentally, it is demonstrated that the classification accuracy of DenseNet is the highest, compared to the other two networks, and the classification accuracy of S-DenseNet is 7.7% higher then DenseNet on average for different number of steps. CONCLUSIONS: As the step increasing, the accuracy of DesenNet, and ResNet are all improved, and after using SSO, each of these neural networks can achieved better performance. But The extent of increase varies, DesenNet with SSO had been improved the most obviously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acolor 3acotton 3adata collection 3afoliar diseases 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3aneural networks 3apests 3asupport vector machines0 tPlant methods.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.114-114dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-021-00813-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245006700161300001600228520078500244592002801029650002001057650001001077650002201087650002201109650001301131650001601144653001301160653001201173653002801185653004101213700001501254700001601269700005501285700001801340773012501358856008301483852000901566655001201575IND60605199020221117225112.0201209e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060519902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Heng10aHigh-speed graphene@Ag-MnO2 micromotors at low peroxide levels  ap. 271-280.  aPlatinum (Pt) free micro/nanomotors (MNMs) using a low content of fuels are highly desired for many applications.

This review focuses on the complex chemical interactions of additives in hydraulic fracturing fluid (HFF) with minerals and organic matter in oil/gas shales. These interactions are intended to increase hydrocarbon recovery by increasing porosities and permeabilities of tight shales. However, fluid–shale interactions result in the dissolution of shale minerals and the release and transport of chemical components. They also result in mineral precipitation in the shale matrix, which can reduce permeability, porosity, and hydrocarbon recovery. Competition between mineral dissolution and mineral precipitation processes influences the amounts of oil and gas recovered. We review the temporal/spatial origins and distribution of unconventional oil/gas shales from mudstones and shales, followed by discussion of their global and U.S. distributions and compositional differences from different U.S. sedimentary basins. We discuss the major types of chemical additives in HFF with their intended purposes, including drilling muds. Fracture distribution, porosity, permeability, and the identity and molecular-level speciation of minerals and organic matter in oil/gas shales throughout the hydraulic fracturing process are discussed. Also discussed are analysis methods used in characterizing oil/gas shales before and after hydraulic fracturing, including permeametry and porosimetry measurements, X-ray diffraction/Rietveld refinement, X-ray computed tomography, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and laboratory- and synchrotron-based imaging/spectroscopic methods. Reactive transport and spatial scaling are discussed in some detail in order to relate fundamental molecular-scale processes to fluid transport. Our review concludes with a discussion of potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and important knowledge gaps that must be bridged to achieve improved mechanistic understanding of fluid transport in oil/gas shales.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-SC0019165cU.S. Department of Energydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000015  aDE-SC0019285cU.S. Department of Energydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000015 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3anatural gas 3aoils 3aorganic matter 3apermeability 3aporosimetry 3aporosity 3ashale 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aDruhan, Jennifer L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0200-39881 aIhme, Matthias1 aKovscek, Anthony R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1336-384X1 aBattiato, Ilenia1 aKaszuba, John P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8799-06731 aBargar, John R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9303-49011 aBrown, Gordon E.0 tChemical reviews.g2022 Apr. 11, v. 122, no. 9 p.9198-9263dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c005043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002800181245011900209506007600328520123400404592002801638506003701666650001101703650001001714650001401724650001401738650003601752650002301788650001201811650001201823650002201835650001301857650001601870650001501886650002101901650001501922653002701937653001901964700002001983700001602003700001802019700001502037773010702052856007502159852000902234655001202243IND60516758920221207131451.0190805s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051675892DNAL7 a10.1017/jns.2014.72doi7 aPMC41530832pmcid7 a251916172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWootton-Beard, Peter C.10aEffects of a beetroot juice with high neobetanin content on the early-phase insulin response in healthy volunteers  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProduce rich in phytochemicals may alter postprandial glucose and insulin responses by interacting with the pathways that regulate glucose uptake and insulin secretion in humans. The aims of the present study were to assess the phytochemical constituents of red beetroot juice and to measure the postprandial glucose and insulin responses elicited by either 225 ml beetroot juice (BEET), a control beverage matched for macronutrient content (MCON) or a glucose beverage in healthy adults. Beetroot juice was a particularly rich source of betalain degradation compounds. The orange/yellow pigment neobetanin was measured in particularly high quantities (providing 1·3 g in the 225 ml). A total of sixteen healthy individuals were recruited, and consumed the test meals in a controlled single-blind cross-over design. Results revealed a significant lowering of the postprandial insulin response in the early phase (0–60 min) (P < 0·05) and a significantly lower glucose response in the 0–30 min phase (P < 0·05) in the BEET treatment compared with MCON. Betalains, polyphenols and dietary nitrate found in the beetroot juice may each contribute to the observed differences in the postprandial insulin concentration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abeets 3abetalains 3abeverages 3achemical constituents of plants 3across-over studies 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3anitrates 3apolyphenols 3atest meals 3avegetable juices 3avolunteers 0aPostprandial glycaemia 0aPhytochemicals1 aBrandt, Kirsten1 aFell, David1 aWarner, Sarah1 aRyan, Lisa0 tJournal of nutritional science.g2014, v. 3dCambridge University PresswJournal:6175x2048-67907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jns.2014.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015700169300001200326520165100338592002801989596003402017650001502051650002802066650002402094650001602118650001302134650001102147700002602158700001702184700006302201773010302264856008302367852000902450655001202459IND60755999720221121053545.0220309e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075599972DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-021-02532-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfe, Jareth C.13aAn explainable artificial intelligence approach for decoding the enhancer histone modifications code and identification of novel enhancers in Drosophila  ap. 308.  aBACKGROUND: Enhancers are non-coding regions of the genome that control the activity of target genes. Recent efforts to identify active enhancers experimentally and in silico have proven effective. While these tools can predict the locations of enhancers with a high degree of accuracy, the mechanisms underpinning the activity of enhancers are often unclear. RESULTS: Using machine learning (ML) and a rule-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model, we demonstrate that we can predict the location of known enhancers in Drosophila with a high degree of accuracy. Most importantly, we use the rules of the XAI model to provide insight into the underlying combinatorial histone modifications code of enhancers. In addition, we identified a large set of putative enhancers that display the same epigenetic signature as enhancers identified experimentally. These putative enhancers are enriched in nascent transcription, divergent transcription and have 3D contacts with promoters of transcribed genes. However, they display only intermediary enrichment of mediator and cohesin complexes compared to previously characterised active enhancers. We also found that 10–15% of the predicted enhancers display similar characteristics to super enhancers observed in other species. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we applied an explainable AI model to predict enhancers with high accuracy. Most importantly, we identified that different combinations of epigenetic marks characterise different groups of enhancers. Finally, we discovered a large set of putative enhancers which display similar characteristics with previously characterised active enhancers.  aPublisher supplied data  a202012/Z/16/Zcwellcome trust 3aDrosophila 3aartificial intelligence 3acomputer simulation 3aepigenetics 3ahistones 3amodels1 aMikheeva, Liudmila A.1 aHagras, Hani1 aZabet, Nicolae Radu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9964-62710 tGenome biology.g2021 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.308-308dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02532-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012900204300001600333520180700349592002802156650001102184650001602195650001602211650003102227650002102258650001502279650002202294650001902316650002202335650001302357650001902370650001502389650001502404650001602419650001702435650002902452650001702481653002202498653001402520653001102534653001902545700001702564700001502581700001902596773013902615856008302754852000902837655001202846IND60725838020221122083345.0211114e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072583802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Bingbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0185-390510aPseudocapacitance multiporous vanadyl phosphate/graphene thin film electrode for high performance electrochemical capacitors  ap. 341-351.  aSupercapacitors are being considered as promising electricity storage devices with green sustainable energy conversion. To efficiently develop and optimize pseudocapacitive material of vanadyl phosphate, herein, multiporous vanadyl phosphate/graphene (denoted as MP-VOPO₄@rGO) is fabricated for the first time with phytic acid as a phosphorus source by extremely simple sol-gel and drop coating methods, and used as the free binder thin film electrode of supercapacitors. The smart combination of honeycomb-like architecture and graphene incorporation results in more active sites and low internal resistance, significantly improving energy storage performance. The effect of introducting polystyrene (denoted as PS) template and rGO on the performance of the nanocomposite is systematically analyzed by comparing the performance of the corresponding thin film electrodes. The MP-VOPO₄@rGO thin film electrode delivers superior pseudocapacitive performance of 672 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹ as well as a remarkable rate capability of 552 F g⁻¹ at 5 A g⁻¹, and it presents a remarkable longterm cycling stability, with a capacitance retention of 83.5% after 5000 cycles. Very interestingly, the results of surface capacitance contribution dominance clearly demonstrates its rapid capacitive response. In addition, based on MP-VOPO₄@rGO thin film as positive and negative electrodes, the corresponding assembled symmetric supercapacitors exihibits outstanding energy density of 26.3 Wh kg⁻¹ at power density of 249.9 W kg⁻¹. This investigation can not only provide a versatile strategy to design other thin film electrode materials but also open up a new insight into the development of polyanion phosphate composites for next-generation high performance energy storage systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acapacitance 3aelectricity 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy density 3afilms (materials) 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphytic acid 3apolystyrenes 3arenewable energy sources 3avanadyl ions 0aVanadyl phosphate 0aThin film 0aPorous 0aSupercapacitor1 aXu, Chuanlan1 aYu, Danmei1 aChen, Changguo0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 May 15, v. 590 p.341-351dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245011300200506007600313520178500389592002802174506003702202650001102239650002102250650001102271650001002282650001302292650001802305650002602323650001302349650000902362650002202371653001702393653002402410653002802434700001802462700001602480700002202496700002002518700001902538700002302557700002102580700002002601773010702621856007502728852000902803655001202812IND60516759120221207122849.0190805s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051675912DNAL7 a10.1017/jns.2014.92doi7 aPMC41533302pmcid7 a251916042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKakutani, Saki10aArachidonic acid intake and asthma risk in children and adults: a systematic review of observational studies  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effect of arachidonic acid (ARA) intake on asthma risk is unclear. The objective of the present review was to systematically evaluate available observational studies on the relationship between ARA exposure and asthma risk in children and adults. A PubMed search was conducted on 22 October 2013 and seventy-three publications were checked against predefined criteria for eligibility. To identify additional eligible publications, potentially relevant articles were searched from bibliographies of articles on ARA and asthma. A total of 2924 citations were scrutinised. Finally, fourteen articles were included. A quality assessment was conducted based on the reporting and methodological quality. A meta-analysis was not conducted; therefore, a qualitative assessment is presented. Three high-, two medium- and ten low-quality studies were reviewed. Eleven studies, including two high- and two medium-quality studies, did not find a significant association between ARA exposure and asthma risk. In contrast, one high-quality study indicated a significant trend toward reducing asthma risk in children with decreasing maternal ARA intake (P ₜᵣₑₙd = 0·025), and one low-quality study reported a significant trend of increasing asthma risk with higher blood ARA levels (P ₜᵣₑₙd = 0·007). In two low-quality studies, asthma patients had significantly lower blood ARA levels than controls (both P < 0·05). These studies did not sufficiently demonstrate any relationships between ARA exposure and asthma risk because of the limited number of studies and their methodological limitations. They seem to suggest that ARA exposure is not consistently associated with asthma risk. Nevertheless, further evidence is required to prove or disprove the association.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aarachidonic acid 3aasthma 3ablood 3achildren 3ameta-analysis 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3arisk 3asystematic review 0aEpidemiology 0aDietary fatty acids 0aFree-living populations1 aEgawa, Kahori1 aSaito, Kayo1 aSuzuki, Toshihide1 aHorikawa, Chika1 aRogi, Tomohiro1 aKawashima, Hiroshi1 aShibata, Hiroshi1 aSasaki, Satoshi0 tJournal of nutritional science.g2014, v. 3dCambridge University PresswJournal:6175x2048-67907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jns.2014.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245004700213300001600260520102100276592002801297653001601325653002001341653001801361653003401379700001801413773008901431856008101520852000901601655001201610IND60554961820221118224237.0161026e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055496182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbo.2013.07.0022doi7 aPMC47233812pmcid7 a269092872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasiliadou, Ifigenia14aThe role of macrophages in bone metastasis  ap. 158-166.  aThe skeleton is one of the most common sites of metastatic disease, affecting a large number of patients with advanced cancer. Although an increasing number of therapies are available for treatment of bone metastasis, this remains incurable, highlighting the need for better understanding of the underlying biology. Metastatic tumour spread to distant organs is a multistage process, involving not only cancer cells but also those of the surrounding host microenvironment. Tumour associated macrophages are multifunctional cells that contribute both to tumour development and response to treatment by regulating adaptive immunity, remodelling of stroma, mediating basement membrane breakdown and angiogenesis. Although direct evidence for a specific role of macrophages in bone metastasis is limited, their involvement in metastasis in general is well documented. In this review we provide an overview of role of macrophages in tumour progression, with particular emphasis on their potential role in bone metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMacrophages 0aBone metastasis 0aBreast cancer 0aTumour-associated macrophages1 aHolen, Ingunn0 tJournal of Bone Oncology.g2013 Dec., v. 2 p.158-166dElsevier GmbHx2212-13747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbo.2013.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006700166300001600233520102100249592002801270650002101298650002601319650002901345650001301374650001201387650002201399650001401421650001801435650001101453650001301464650003201477650001701509653001701526653001901543653001601562653001701578653001301595700002201608700002201630700002101652700001101673773012501684856008301809852000901892655001201901IND60605199420221117225237.0201209e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060519942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHazell, Gavin10aBioinspired bactericidal surfaces with polymer nanocone arrays  ap. 389-399.  aInfections resulting from bacterial biofilm formation on the surface of medical devices are challenging to treat and can cause significant patient morbidity. Recently, it has become apparent that regulation of surface nanotopography can render surfaces bactericidal. In this study, poly(ethylene terephthalate) nanocone arrays are generated through a polystyrene nanosphere-mask colloidal lithographic process. It is shown that modification of the mask diameter leads to a direct modification of centre-to-centre spacing between nanocones. By altering the oxygen plasma etching time it is possible to modify the height, tip width and base diameter of the individual nanocone features. The bactericidal activity of the nanocone arrays was investigated against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

There is currently no consensus on the main drivers of the decline. Although climate change is expected to drive biodiversity loss in the future, current warming is often suggested to have positive impacts on pollinator assemblages in higher latitudes. Consequently, pollinator conservation initiatives in Europe and the USA tend to lack climate adaptation initiatives, an omission of which may be risky if climate change has significant negative impacts on pollinators. To gain an understanding of the impacts of climate change on pollinator biodiversity in the Northern Hemisphere, we conducted a literature review on genetic, species and community level diversity. Our findings suggest that global heating most likely causes homogenization of pollinator assemblages at all levels of pollinator biodiversity, making them less resilient to future stochasticity. Aspects of biodiversity that are rarely measured (e.g. genetic diversity, β-diversity, species evenness) tend to be most affected, while some dimensions of climate change, such as fluctuations in winter weather conditions, changes in the length of the vegetational season and increased frequency of extreme weather events, that seldom receive attention in empirical studies, tend to be particularly detrimental to pollinators. Negative effects of global heating on pollinator biodiversity are most likely exacerbated by homogenous and fragmented landscapes, widespread across Europe and the US, which limit opportunities for range-shifts and reduce micro-climatic buffering. This suggests the need for conservation initiatives to focus on increasing landscape connectivity and heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3agenetic variation 3aglobal warming 3ahabitat connectivity 3ahomogenization 3apollinators 3atemperate zones 3aweather 3aEurope 0aGlobal heating 0aGenetic diversity 0aβ-Diversity 0aLife-history traits 0aPollinator conservation 0aClimate adaptation1 aGreenwood, Sarah0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 25, v. 775 p.145788-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1457883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150100001500168245015300183300001600336520200800352592002802360653002002388653001502408653002602423653002202449653002202471700002302493700001202516700001602528700001902544700001402563700001302577773009102590856008402681852000902765655001202774IND60544417920221119042706.0160901e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054441792DNAL7 a10.3724/SP.J.1261.2013.000352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChunlian, Liu1 aYuan, Wang10aLate Quaternary palaeoenvironmental changes documented by microfaunas and shell stable isotopes in the southern Pearl River Delta plain, South China  ap. 344-361.  aA high resolution study of sediments, microfaunas (ostracods and foraminifers), and stable isotopes of ostracod shells from core PRD05, sampled from the Da'ao plain of the Pearl River Delta, provides new data about palaeoenvironmental changes during the Late Quaternary. The basal fluvial gravelly sediments of the core, representing the lowest deposits of the Quaternary at the core site, were possibly formed prior to the transgression associated with the last interglacial stage. This fluvial setting changed into a marginal marine setting during the last interglacial stage, any record of calcareous fossils were destroyed by subsequent dissolution during the last glacial phase, when the upper part of the deltaic sediments experienced subaerial oxidation, indicated by a mottled clay layer in the core. The postglacial sea-level rise in the South China Sea began at ~16,700 cal yr B. P. During the first phase of sea-level rise (from ~16,700 to 10,100 cal yr B. P.), a swamp environment developed at the core site. At ~10,100 cal yr B. P., marine waters intruded onto the Da'ao plain and reached the core site through the Modaomen channel. This timing was earlier than in other parts of the Pearl River Delta. Since then, a semi-enclosed estuarine environment developed and was maintained until ~5560 cal yr B. P. During this transgressive interval, short-term environmental fluctuations can be recognized based on microfauna and shell geochemical data. From ~10,100 to 8630 cal yr B. P., the sea-level rose, which was followed by a fall from ~8630 to 8520 cal yr B. P. An expanded transgression occurred between ~8520 and 7900 cal yr B. P. The time intervals from ~8520 to 8200 cal yr B. P. and from ~8080 to 7900 cal yr B. P. were marked by peak transgression. From ~7900 to 5560 cal yr B. P., the core site generally showed a reduced marine influence and enhanced freshwater input. A fluvial environment developed from ~5560 to 3100 cal yr B. P., and was succeeded by an alluvial plain setting.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLate Quaternary 0amicrofauna 0ashell stable isotopes 0apalaeoenvironment 0aPearl River Delta1 aFürsich, Franz T.1 aJie, Wu1 aYixin, Dong1 aTingting, Yang1 aJian, Yin1 aMin, Liu0 tJournal of Palaeogeography.g2013 Oct., v. 2 p.344-361dElsevier B.V.x2095-38367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1261.2013.000353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245012900168520193000297592002802227650001302255650001202268650002002280650002102300650001502321650002102336650002102357650001502378650001102393650000702404650001002411650001602421650002402437650001902461650001702480650001502497650002502512650001502537650001302552651001302565700002102578700002302599700002302622700002702645700001702672700002302689773012802712856007502840852000902915655001202924IND60703953220221118194912.0200722e20200328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070395322DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120710902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Osvaldo  J. R.10aEstimating Water pH Using Cloud-Based Landsat Images for a New Classification of the Nhecolândia Lakes (Brazilian Pantanal)  aThe Nhecolândia region, located in the southern portion of the Pantanal wetland area, is a unique lacustrine system where tens of thousands of saline-alkaline and freshwater lakes and ponds coexist in close proximity. These lakes are suspected to be a strong source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere, the water pH being one of the key factors in controlling the biogeochemical functioning and, consequently, production and emission of GHGs in these lakes. Here, we present a new field-validated classification of the Nhecolândia lakes using water pH values estimated based on a cloud-based Landsat (5 TM, 7 ETM+, and 8 OLI) 2002–2017 time-series in the Google Earth Engine platform. Calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance collections with the Fmask method were used to ensure the usage of only cloud-free pixels, resulting in a dataset of 2081 scenes. The pH values were predicted by applying linear multiple regression and symbolic regression based on genetic programming (GP). The regression model presented an R² value of 0.81 and pH values ranging from 4.69 to 11.64. A lake mask was used to extract the predicted pH band that was then classified into three lake classes according to their pH values: Freshwater (pH < 8), oligosaline (pH 8–8.9), and saline (≥9). Nearly 12,150 lakes were mapped with those with saline waters accounting for 7.25%. Finally, a trend surface map was created using the ALOS PRISM Digital Surface Model (DSM) to analyze the correlation between landscape features (topography, connection with the regional drainage system, size, and shape of lakes) and types of lakes. The analysis was in consonance with previous studies that pointed out that saline lakes tend to occur in lower positions compared to freshwater lakes. The results open a relevant perspective for the transfer of locally acquired experimental data to the regional balances of the Nhecolândia lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aLandsat 3adata collection 3adrainage systems 3afreshwater 3afreshwater lakes 3agreenhouse gases 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apH 3aponds 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asaline water 3asalt lakes 3atime series analysis 3atopography 3awetlands 3aPantanal1 aMerino, Eder  R.1 aMontes, Célia  R.1 aBarbiero, Laurent 1 aRezende-Filho, Ary  T.1 aLucas, Yves 1 aMelfi, Adolpho  J.0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 28, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120710903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245013400199300002000333520134900353592002801702650002301730650002501753650002301778650001301801650001101814650002101825650001201846700001601858700001701874700006001891700001701951700001701968700005401985700005302039700001902092773014902111856007602260852000902336655001202345IND60656446420221122050426.0190814e20190725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065644642DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b055832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Yun-Xuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5114-035910aRhodium(III)-Catalyzed Asymmetric Borylative Cyclization of Cyclohexadienone-Containing 1,6-Dienes: An Experimental and DFT Study  ap. 12770-12779.  aBecause of the inherent difficulty in differentiating two olefins, the development of metal-catalyzed asymmetric cyclization of 1,6-dienes remains challenging. Herein, we describe the first rhodium(III)-catalyzed asymmetric borylative cyclization of cyclohexadienone-tethered mono-, 1,1-di-, and (E)-1,2-disubstituted alkenes (1,6-dienes), affording optically pure cis-bicyclic skeletons bearing three or four contiguous stereocenters with high yields (25–93%), and excellent diastereoselectivities (>20:1 dr) and enantioselectivities (90–99% ee). This mild catalytic approach is generally compatible with a wide range of functional groups, which allows several facile conversions of the cyclization products. Furthermore, on the basis of our SAESI-MS experiment and computational study, a Rh(I)/(III) catalytic cycle is proposed in this tandem reaction, and the Rh(I) active species catalyzes the overall transformation via sequential oxidative addition of B₂pin₂, olefin insertion, cyclizing conjugate addition, and reductive elimination. The irreversible conjugate addition determines the overall regioselectivity of borylative cyclization, and the ring strain favors the formation of 5,6-bicyclic structure. This highlights the control of ring strain in diene cyclizations, which provides a useful basis for future reaction designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3adiastereoselectivity 3aenantioselectivity 3amoieties 3aolefin 3aregioselectivity 3arhodium1 aZhang, Fang1 aXie, Pei-Pei1 aZhang, Shuo-Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7617-30421 aWang, Yi-Fan1 aLi, Qing-Hua1 aTian, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5612-06641 aHong, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4717-28141 aLin, Guo-Qiang0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 July 25, v. 141, no. 32 p.12770-12779dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b055833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245006300204500001900267520122200286592002801508650003001536650001901566650001201585650001901597650002301616650001701639650001601656650001601672651001001688653001901698653001801717653002401735653002301759653001801782653002001800700001801820700001501838700001501853700002101868773011601889856008502005852000902090655001202099IND60713885820221117020959.0210226e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071388582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1186422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Yu-Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1691-055410aPervasive tree-growth reduction in Tibetan juniper forests  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecent forest declines have been reported at many sites across the world and attributed largely to global-warming induced droughts. Occurrence of forest declines before the global warming is not well understood, especially with regard to its long-term characteristics. Here, we use tree-ring data to detect periods of growth reduction in 1429 juniper trees from 48 sites on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). We find that tree-growth reduction has occurred intermittently and dispersedly over the TP in the past 350 years. The growth reductions among trees could be synchronized at site level in different time, reflecting episodes of decreased forest health. Tree-growth reduction has been alleviated since the 1980s; sites that do show growth reduction events in recent decades are located at higher elevations and are more sensitive to winter mean temperature. We conclude that the pervasive tree-growth reductions may be related to irregular natural disturbances than climatic anomalies. The state of forest health can be estimated by identifying episodes of synchronous tree-growth reduction. Our findings help account for historical growth reduction in the assessment of forest health risks under future climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aforest ecology 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3agrowth retardation 3agrowth rings 3atemperature 3atree growth 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aDendroecology 0aNatural disturbance 0aOld-growth forests 0aForest health 0aTibetan Plateau1 aZhang, Qi-Bin1 aFang, Ouya1 aLyu, Lixin1 aCherubini, Paolo0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 480 p.118642-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1186423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013900173300001600312520111800328592002801446650002401474650001501498650001701513650001401530650002401544650001601568650001601584650001501600650002001615650001001635650001501645650002401660653002301684653002401707653002101731653003101752700002201783700002001805773013401825856008201959852000902041655001202050IND60516759520221120170045.0160327e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051675952DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584110003362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamala Jayanthi, P.D.10aPredicting the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera: Tephritidae) trap catch using artificial neural networks: a case study  ap. 205-211.  aThe oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) is a very serious pest of fruit trees, causing enormous economic losses globally. The present study examines the capability of an artificial neural network (ANN) with a Quasi-Newton (QN) algorithm to predict a fruit fly trap catch and compare the results with those of a traditional regression model. MATLAB 7.0 was used to develop ANN programming and the fortnightly measurement of 14 input variables (abiotic along with biotic variables) provided the database for analysing the ANN model. An input model using a total of 14 identified input nodes with a selected QN-ANN structure (14-25-20-1) gave an optimum result. In general, the present study showed that an ANN could be used to estimate fruit fly trap catch with enhanced accuracy (R² = 0.92; root mean square error (RMSE) = 23.75; Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies = 0.99) over traditional regression models (R² = 0.76; RMSE = 30.28; Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies = 0.76). This finding helps the region-specific fruit fly monitoring and management programmes that lack long-term historic data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3adatabases 3afinancial economics 3afruit flies 3afruit trees 3amonitoring 3aneural networks 3apests 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 0aoriental fruit fly 0aBactrocera dorsalis 0aprediction model 0aartificial neural networks1 aVerghese, Abraham1 aSreekanth, P.D.0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2011 Dec., v. 31, no. 4 p.205-211dCambridge University Pressx1742-75927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584110003363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04246naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245012600176300001200302520250400314592002802818650002602846650002802872650001402900650002002914650002802934650001002962650002202972650001502994650001203009650002303021650002203044650001403066650003503080650002103115650002403136650001303160651001103173651000903184651002003193651001803213700002303231700002703254700002703281700002703308700002603335700003003361700002603391700007003417773011303487856008303600852000903683655001203692IND60756000120221121053739.0220502e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075600012DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-021-05078-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSookpongthai, Pornpawee10aGlobal diversity of the gene encoding the Pfs25 protein—a Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking vaccine candidate  ap. 571.  aBACKGROUND: Vaccines against the sexual stages of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum are indispensable for controlling malaria and abrogating the spread of drug-resistant parasites. Pfs25, a surface antigen of the sexual stage of P. falciparum, is a leading candidate for transmission-blocking vaccine development. While clinical trials have reported that Pfs25-based vaccines are safe and effective in inducing transmission-blocking antibodies, the extent of the genetic diversity of Pfs25 in malaria endemic populations has rarely been studied. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the global diversity of Pfs25 in P. falciparum populations. METHODS: A database of 307 Pfs25 sequences of P. falciparum was established. Population genetic analyses were performed to evaluate haplotype and nucleotide diversity, analyze haplotypic distribution patterns of Pfs25 in different geographical populations, and construct a haplotype network. Neutrality tests were conducted to determine evidence of natural selection. Homology models of the Pfs25 haplotypes were constructed, subjected to molecular dynamics (MD), and analyzed in terms of flexibility and percentages of secondary structures. RESULTS: The Pfs25 gene of P. falciparum was found to have 11 unique haplotypes. Of these, haplotype 1 (H1) and H2, the major haplotypes, represented 70% and 22% of the population, respectively, and were dominant in Asia, whereas only H1 was dominant in Africa, Central America, and South America. Other haplotypes were rare and region-specific, resulting in unique distribution patterns in different geographical populations. The diversity in Pfs25 originated from ten single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci located in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and anchor domain. Of these, an SNP at position 392 (GGA/GCA), resulting in amino acid substitution 131 (Gly/Ala), defined the two major haplotypes. The MD results showed that the structures of H1 and H2 variants were relatively similar. Limited polymorphism in Pfs25 could likely be due to negative selection. CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully established a Pfs25 sequence database that can become an essential tool for monitoring vaccine efficacy, designing assays for detecting malaria carriers, and conducting epidemiological studies of P. falciparum. The discovery of the two major haplotypes, H1 and H2, and their conserved structures suggests that the current Pfs25-based vaccines could be used globally for malaria control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aamino acid substitution 3adatabases 3adrug resistance 3aepidermal growth factor 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amalaria 3amolecular dynamics 3anatural selection 3aparasites 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asurface antigens 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aCentral America 3aSouth America1 aUtayopas, Korawich1 aSitthiyotha, Thassanai1 aPengsakul, Theerakamol1 aKaewthamasorn, Morakot1 aWangkanont, Kittikhun1 aHarnyuttanakorn, Pongchai1 aChunsrivirot, Surasak1 aPattaradilokrat, Sittiporn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1516-19610 tParasites & vectors.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.571-571dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05078-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006400166300001600230520099300246592002801239650001301267650001001280650001001290650001501300650001201315650000901327650001601336650001301352653002401365653001501389653003901404653002401443700002101467700005501488700002201543700002201565700002401587773012401611856008301735852000901818655001201827IND60725838520221122042303.0211114e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072583852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchad, Tamara10aLess is more: Unstable foams clean better than stable foams  ap. 311-320.  aFoamed surfactant solutions can clean surfaces! We hypothesise that the cleaning efficiency depends on the liquid fraction and on the stability of the foam. We also hypothesise that the cleaning efficiency is the better the smaller the average bubble size is.The double syringe technique was used to generate foams with varying liquid fractions but the same, very small bubble sizes with and without perfluorohexane in the gas phase. We performed cleaning tests in which the foams were applied to glass substrates contaminated with a fluorescent oil.We found that unstable foams clean better than stable foams. Three cleaning mechanisms were identified: (1) imbibition at low liquid fractions, (2) wiping, i.e., shifting of the contact line between oil, foam and glass, at all liquid fractions, and (3) drainage at high liquid fractions. The change of the liquid fraction and of the foam stability lead to different combinations of these mechanisms and thus to different cleaning results.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3afoams 3aglass 3aimbibition 3aliquids 3aoils 3asurfactants 3asyringes 0aCleaning with foams 0aImbibition 0aPerfluorohexane to stabilize foams 0aCleaning mechanisms1 aPreisig, Natalie1 aBlunk, Dirk1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6365-04041 aPiening, Heinrich1 aDrenckhan, Wiebke1 aStubenrauch, Cosima0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 May 15, v. 590 p.311-320dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001300112245011400125300001400239520139200253592002801645650001401673650001101687650002301698650000901721650001801730650002401748650002201772650001801794650002001812650001601832650002301848650002001871650001701891650001801908650001601926700001601942700001701958700001801975773016501993856004702158852000902205655001202214IND60124006320221118054445.0150421e20110105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012400632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzim, A.10aEffect of Milk Replacer and Early Weaning Diets on Growth Performance of Buffalo Calves during Weaning Period  ap. 23-26.  aThis study was designed to examine the cost effective feeding system of buffalo male calves for quality meat production. Twelve buffalo male calves of 15-21 days of age and 41 ± 2 kg body weight (BW) were randomly divided into three equal groups. Group A was fed milk replacer (MR) @ 8% of BW for the entire period of 90 days, group B was fed MR @ 4% of BW + early weaning diet (EWD) on ad libitum and group C was fed MR @ 4% of BW + EWD for first 45 days and later on EWD only. Average weight gain was 0.42, 0.46 and 0.52 Kg/d and dry matter intake was 0.65, 0.72 and 1.00 kg/d in groups A, B and C, respectively and the difference was significant (P<0.01). Feed efficiency was superior (P<0.01) for group A (1.55) and B (1.62) compared to C (1.94). Feed cost per kg weight gain of group C was 52 and 25% less than calves in group A and B, respectively. In trial I (at 8th week), digestibility of both DM and CP was higher (P<0.01) in group A (96.28 and 94.32%) than B (87.53 and 85.92%) and C (88.32 and 84.46%). Similar trend of DM and CP digestibility was found in trial II (at 12th week). Dressing percentage of group C was the highest (P<0.05), however, carcass composition and weights of non-carcass components differed non-significantly among groups. Feeding calves MR @ 4% of BW + EWD on ad libitum for first 45 days and later on EWD was the most cost effective feeding system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffaloes 3acalves 3acost effectiveness 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adressing percentage 3adry matter intake 3aearly weaning 3afeed conversion 3afeed prices 3agrowth performance 3ameat production 3ameat quality 3amilk replacer 3aweight gain1 aKhan, A.

In the case of a heritage building, the Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) approach is able to cover the comprehensive restoration of the building. In contrast to BIM applied to new buildings, HBIM can address different models which represent either periods of historical interpretation, restoration phases or records of heritage assets over time. Great efforts are currently being made to automatically reconstitute the geometry of cultural heritage elements from data acquisition techniques such as Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) or Structure From Motion (SfM) into BIM (Scan-to-BIM). Hence, this work advances on the parametric modelling from remote sensing point cloud data, which is carried out under the Rhino+Grasshopper-ArchiCAD combination. This workflow enables the automatic conversion of TLS and SFM point cloud data into textured 3D meshes and thus BIM objects to be included in the HBIM project. The accuracy assessment of this workflow yields a standard deviation value of 68.28 pixels, which is lower than other author’s precision but suffices for the automatic HBIM of the case study in this research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3abuildings 3acase studies 3adata collection 3ahistoric sites 3amodels 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3astandard deviation1 aMoyano, Juan 1 aNieto-Julián, Juan  Enrique1 aAntón, Daniel 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 29, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120710943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010200168300001600270520140200286592002801688650001601716650002201732650001001754650001101764650001301775650001501788650001801803650002001821650001101841650002101852650000701873650002301880650001201903650001301915650001901928650001101947650001101958650001601969653001101985653001201996653002202008653001102030653002102041700002102062700001902083700002202102700002102124700002102145773009602166856008302262852000902345655001202354IND60573528920221121214934.0190417e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057352892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2017.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmood, Kaiser12aA review: Interaction of starch/non-starch hydrocolloid blending and the recent food applications  ap. 110-120.  aStarch is one of the most abundant polysaccharides mainly obtained from cereals and tubers. It has been used since ages in food applications as thickening, binding, sweetening and emulsifying agent. It has been known as part of the main staples for few countries as well. The abundant production of starch has a bright future in sustainable food supply to the world. However, starch appeared to have some limitations of structural stability under extreme conditions of pH and shear. Besides, starch pasting and retrogradation properties are also resist its deliberate use in food products. Thus, blending with non-starch hydrocolloid gums is one of the ways to manipulate starch properties. Non-starch hydrocolloid gums are high molecular weight polymers, usually polysaccharides, which interact with starch and impart desired functionality to the resultant blend for oriented application. In this review, we summarized a number of studies regarding the properties and applications of starch mixture with non-starch hydrocolloids such as arabic gum, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, gellan and pectin. Further, the interaction mechanism of starch with non-starch hydrocolloid and their applications in cereal based foods are also enlisted. Thus, the aim of this review is to provide data of some basic applications and recent usage trends of starch/ non-starch hydrocolloid blends in foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsifiers 3afood availability 3afoods 3agrains 3aguar gum 3agum arabic 3ahydrocolloids 3alocust bean gum 3amixing 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apasting properties 3apectins 3apolymers 3aretrogradation 3astarch 3atubers 3axanthan gum 0aStarch 0aPasting 0aHydrocolloid gums 0aBlends 0aFood application1 aKamilah, Hanisah1 aShang, Poh Lee1 aSulaiman, Syazana1 aAriffin, Fazilah1 aAlias, Abd Karim0 tFood bioscience.g2017 Sept., v. 19 p.110-120dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2017.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012000169520201400289592002802303650001202331650001602343650002902359650001802388650002102406650001102427650001502438650001902453650001302472650001802485650002202503650002802525650001502553653003002568653001802598653002902616653002002645653002202665700001502687700002002702700002002722700002002742700002202762700001902784700001702803773011902820856008802939852000903027655001203036IND60728951920221117022657.0220328e20210625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072895192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1458072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zheng10aRegional suitability prediction of soil salinization based on remote-sensing derivatives and optimal spectral index  aSoil salinization is an extremely serious land degradation problem in arid and semi-arid regions that hinders the sustainable development of agriculture and food security. Information and research on soil salinity using remote sensing (RS) technology provide a quick and accurate assessment and solutions to address this problem. This study aims to compare the capabilities of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI in RS prediction and exploration of the potential application of derivatives to RS prediction of salinized soils. It explores the ability of derivatives to be used in the Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI multispectral data, and it was used as a data source as well as to address the adaptability of salinity prediction on a regional scale. The two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) optimal spectral indices are used to screen the bands that are most sensitive to soil salinity (0–10 cm), and RS data and topographic factors are combined with machine learning to construct a comprehensive soil salinity estimation model based on gray correlation analysis. The results are as follows: (1) The optimal spectral index (2D, 3D) can effectively consider possible combinations of the bands between the interaction effects and responding to sensitive bands of soil properties to circumvent the problem of applicability of spectral indices in different regions; (2) Both the Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI multispectral RS data sources, after the first-order derivative techniques are all processed, show improvements in the prediction accuracy of the model; (3) The best performance/accuracy of the predictive model is for sentinel data under first-order derivatives. This study compared the capabilities of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI in RS prediction in finding the potential application of derivatives to RS prediction of salinized soils, with the results providing some theoretical basis and technical guidance for salinized soil prediction and environmental management planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental management 3afood security 3aland degradation 3amodels 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asalinity 3asoil salinity 3asoil salinization 3asustainable development 3atopography 0aGray correlation analysis 0aLandsat-8 OLI 0aOptimal spectral indices 0aSentinel-2A MSI 0aSoil salinization1 aZhang, Fei1 aZhang, Xianlong1 aChan, Ngai Weng1 aKung, Hsiang-te1 aAriken, Muhadaisi1 aZhou, Xiaohong1 aWang, Yishan0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 25, v. 775 p.145807-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1458073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001200188245009400200300001600294520123000310592002801540653001701568653002001585653002501605653002601630653001801656700001901674700001701693700001701710700001801727700001601745700002001761773008901781856008101870852000901951655001201960IND60554962320221118224323.0161026e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055496232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbo.2013.09.0022doi7 aPMC47233862pmcid7 a269092892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLia, K.10aTwo cases with fatal outcome following total lung irradiation for metastatic bone sarcoma  ap. 174-179.  aWe report a single institution experience with total lung irradiation in 53 metastatic bone sarcoma patients in the context of two young female patients who died from treatment-induced pulmonary toxicity. A radiation dose of 19.5Gy in 1.5Gy daily fractions was given as two opposing fields with a conventional technique. Both patients succumbed within 3 months following radiotherapy. One patient had osteosarcoma whereas the other advanced Ewing's sarcoma; both with widespread metastases to the lungs at primary diagnosis. In retrospect, most likely high dose methotrexate lung toxicity observed in the osteosarcoma patient, and the GI-toxicity following pelvic radiotherapy in Ewing's case, both observed during the initial phase of their multimodal treatment, might indicate an increased individual radiosensitivity.In view of this, a review of our experience in 53 bone sarcoma patients (19 with Ewing's sarcoma and 34 with osteosarcoma) treated at our institution was conducted. We have not previously experienced significant toxicity following total lung irradiation. Among these, 42% (8/19) with Ewing's sarcoma and 9% (3/34) with osteosarcoma are long-term survivors and without clinically significant lung toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOsteosarcoma 0aEwing's sarcoma 0aPulmonary metastasis 0aPulmonary irradiation 0aLung toxicity1 aBruland, Ø.S.1 aRandem, H.L.1 aAksnes, L.H.1 aPoulsen, J.P.1 aTaksdal, I.1 aSundby Hall, K.0 tJournal of Bone Oncology.g2013 Dec., v. 2 p.174-179dElsevier GmbHx2212-13747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbo.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01299naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006500164300001600229520033100245592002800576650001200604650001300616650001100629650001200640650002100652650001300673650001100686650001900697700001900716700001600735773011900751856008200870852000900952655001200961IND60620044020221122044257.0181105e195607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062004402DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517556026007042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrick, J.G.10aFluorine and Iodine Compounds as Flame Retardants for Cotton  ap. 525-528.  aFluorine and iodine compounds, both organic and inorganic, were tested as flame retardants for cotton.

Herein, the concept of all-round utilization on biomass derivations applying to carbon-based supercapacitors is demonstrated. Orange peel is used for all subassemblies of supercapacitor, including electrodes, separator and electrolyte. A monolithic porous carbon (OPHPC) is prepared by one-step carbonization of orange peel and another composite electrode is further synthesized by a simple hydrothermal process, based on sufficient utilization of natural structure and chemical components. OPHPC exhibits a high specific surface area of 860 m² g⁻¹ and naturally doped nitrogen. The composite electrode shows the homogeneous and high mass loading of MnO₂. Orange peel also affords the role of separator benefited from the natural porous channel structure and high porosity of 74.6%. Orange peel juice is exploited to produce the electrolyte, and exhibits the best retention in natural separator. All-orange peel all-solid-state supercapacitor shows the high areal capacitance of 3987 mF cm⁻². Furthermore, the flexibility of orange peel is also utilized to achieve the shape-tailored monolithic porous carbon electrode and device, which further extends the utilized dimensionality in biomass applying to supercapacitors. The work starts with all dimensional utilization for biomass derived supercapacitor.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3acarbonization 3aelectrolytes 3afinancial economics 3ajuices 3amanganese dioxide 3anitrogen 3aorange peels 3aporosity 3asurface area 0aBiomass 0aAll-round utilization 0aCarbon 0aAll-solid-state 0aSupercapacitors1 aXiong, Ye1 aWang, Hanwei1 aSun, Qingfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3520-49700 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 528 p.349-359dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014700171300001600318520117400334592002801508650002501536650002701561650001801588650001201606650001101618650001901629650001301648650001101661650001401672650000901686653002501695653002701720653001701747653001801764653001701782653003301799700001701832700001701849700001401866773013401880856008202014852000902096655001202105IND60516759820221120170115.0160327e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051675982DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584110003612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouro Kpindou, O.K.10aDose transfer of an oil-based formulation of Metarhizium anisopliae (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) sprays to cotton bollworm in an arena trial  ap. 262-268.  aA cotton field was used to set up an arena trial for investigating the dose transfer of oil-based ultra-low-volume sprays of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin to the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner). Two doses of conidia (75 and 50 g/ha, being 3.75 × 10¹² and 2.5 × 10¹² conidia/ha, respectively) formulated in 2 litres (70:30, kerosene–peanut oil) were applied using a Berthoud ‘Micro Ulva’ to three groups of larvae of cotton bollworms positioned in three rows downwind of a single spray line. Both the distribution of the droplets and the effect of direct contact with spray droplets were quantified. The mean number of droplets decreased from 416 (± 60) droplets per cm² (line 1; 0.4 m) to 45 (± 36) droplets per cm² (line 3; 5 m). To achieve 50% mortality, >10 and >13 days were necessary for 75 and 50 g/ha, respectively. From day 15, the difference in mortality rates was significant between the two treatments. At line 3 (5 m), at 12 days after application, the mortality rate reached 52% for 75 g/ha and 47% for 50 g/ha. The results are discussed in view of optimizing the application of the biopesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3abiopesticides 3aconidia 3acotton 3adirect contact 3adroplets 3alarvae 3amortality 3aoils 0aHelicoverpa armigera 0aMetarhizium anisopliae 0abiopesticide 0adose transfer 0acotton field 0aultra-low-volume application1 aDjegui, D.A.1 aGlitho, I.A.1 aTamò, M.0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2011 Dec., v. 31, no. 4 p.262-268dCambridge University Pressx1742-75927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584110003613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001300112245009600125300001400221520097900235592002801214650001501242650001601257650001801273650001901291650001201310650002001322650001801342650001001360700002101370700001601391700002201407700001401429773016501443856004701608852000901655655001201664IND60124006520221118054531.0150421e20110105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012400652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaqi, A.10aEthanol through Crop Route in Broilers: Effects on FCR, Live Weight and on Different Organs  ap. 31-34.  aThe aim of the present study was to compare the developmental competence of porcine parthenotes and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos after day-3 medium change with fresh embryo culture medium to that of embryos that did not have a medium change (monoculture system). The parthenogenetic and SCNT blastocyst formation rates were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the no-medium-change group (43.3±2.3, 18.5±1.1%, respectively) compared with the day-3 medium-change group (35.9±2.4, 7.9±0.9%, respectively).

A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library having a mean genomic insert size of 145 ± 20 kbp was created from a laboratory strain of H. zea, which provides ∼12.9-fold coverage of a 362.8 ± 8.8 Mbp (0.37 ± 0.09 pg) flow cytometry estimated haploid genome size. Assembly of Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads generated from 14 pools that encompassed all BAC clones resulted in 165 485 genomic contigs (N₅₀ = 3262 bp; 324.6 Mbp total). Long terminal repeat (LTR) protein coding regions annotated from 181 contigs included 30 Ty1/copia, 78 Ty3/gypsy, and 73 BEL/Pao elements, of which 60 (33.1%) encoded all five functional polyprotein (pol) domains. Approximately 14% of LTR elements are distributed non-randomly across pools of BAC clones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicoverpa zea 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aclones 3acorn 3acotton 3aevolution 3aflow cytometry 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenome 3ahaploidy 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainsect pests 3aopen reading frames 3apolyproteins 3aterminal repeat sequences 3atoxins 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aretrotransposon 0aevolutionary genetics 0aHelicoverpa 0abacterial artificial chromosome1 aAbel, Craig A.1 aPerera, Omaththage P.0 tGenome.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 60, no. 4 p.310-324dNRC Research Pressx1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2016-00673Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245011300212300001400325520188800339592002802227653000902255653000602264653000802270653001002278653000702288653001002295653000802305653000702313653001002320653000902330653001802339653001502357653002002372653001502392700006002407700002302467700001702490700002002507700002402527773008702551856008102638852000902719655001202728IND60554962420221118223930.0161026e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055496242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbo.2013.11.0012doi7 aPMC47234172pmcid7 a269092902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenad-Mehner, Peggy10aTargeting syndecan-1 in breast cancer inhibits osteoclast functions through up-regulation of osteoprotegerin  ap. 18-24.  aBreast cancer often metastasizes into bone and leads to osteolytic lesions. The underlying mechanisms, however, are complex and not fully understood. Syndecan-1 is a proteoglycan that has various functions relevant for tumor progression including cell–cell communication and cell–matrix interactions. Moreover, its two glycosaminoglycan-binding sites suggest that it may interfere with glycoproteins such as osteoprotegerin, a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis. Thus, we hypothesize that tumor-derived syndecan-1 alters osteoclast biology by modulating osteoprotegerin.Syndecan-1 expression was down-regulated via siRNA and the cell fate of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 was investigated. Furthermore, we determined the regulation of syndecan-1 by dexamethasone, a commonly used antiemetic in breast cancer therapy. Additionally, we analyzed the genesis and activity of osteoclasts in indirect co-culture experiments using supernatants from MCF-7 cells with deficient and sufficient levels of syndecan-1.Dexamethasone time- and dose-dependently increased syndecan-1 expression up to 4-fold but did not alter cell behavior. Syndecan-1 up-regulation did not affect the survival or migration of breast cancer cells. Depletion of syndecan-1 using siRNA led to decreased vitality of progesterone receptor-positive cell lines. In MCF-7 cells osteoprotegerin production was up-regulated 2.5-fold after syndecan-1 knock-down. The culture of osteoclast precursors with the supernatant of MCF-7 cells with reduced syndecan-1 levels suppressed osteoclast formation and activity by 21% and 23%, respectively. Adding neutralizing antibodies to osteoprotegerin to the breast cancer supernatants reversed osteoclastogenesis.Thus, we identified tumor-derived syndecan-1 as a novel positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis and new player in the tumor-bone dialog.  aPublisher supplied data 0aACTB 0aC 0aDEX 0aERBB2 0aER 0aGAPDH 0aOPG 0aPR 0aRANKL 0aSDC1 0aBreast cancer 0aOsteoclast 0aOsteoprotegerin 0aSyndecan-11 aThiele, Stefanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9345-026X1 aRachner, Tilman D.1 aGöbel, Andy1 aRauner, Martina1 aHofbauer, Lorenz C.0 tJournal of Bone Oncology.g2014 Mar., v. 3 p.18-24dElsevier GmbHx2212-13747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbo.2013.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001400183245011900197300002000316506007600336520183600412592002802248506003702276650001502313650001302328650003202341700001902373700005602392700001702448700006202465700005902527700005202586700005402638773014902692856007602841852000902917655001202926IND60656446920221207061222.0190814e20190726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065644692DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b057402doi7 aPMC66968862pmcid7 a313486512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qi10aAssembling a Natural Small Molecule into a Supramolecular Network with High Structural Order and Dynamic Functions  ap. 12804-12814.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProgramming the hierarchical self-assembly of small molecules has been a fundamental topic of great significance in biological systems and artificial supramolecular systems. Precise and highly programmed self-assembly can produce supramolecular architectures with distinct structural features. However, it still remains a challenge how to precisely control the self-assembly pathway in a desirable way by introducing abundant structural information into a limited molecular backbone. Here we disclose a strategy that directs the hierarchical self-assembly of sodium thioctate, a small molecule of biological origin, into a highly ordered supramolecular layered network. By combining the unique dynamic covalent ring-opening-polymerization of sodium thioctate and an evaporation-induced interfacial confinement effect, we precisely direct the dynamic supramolecular self-assembly of this simple small molecule in a scheduled hierarchical pathway, resulting in a layered structure with long-range order at both macroscopic and molecular scales, which is revealed by small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering technologies. The resulting supramolecular layers are found to be able to bind water molecules as structural water, which works as an interlayer lubricant to modulate the material properties, such as mechanical performance, self-healing capability, and actuating function. Analogous to many reversibly self-assembled biological systems, the highly dynamic polymeric network can be degraded into monomers and reformed by a water-mediated route, exhibiting full recyclability in a facile, mild, and environmentally friendly way. This approach for assembling commercial small molecules into structurally complex materials paves the way for low-cost functional supramolecular materials based on synthetically simple procedures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alubricants 3apolymers 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aDeng, Yuan-Xin1 aLuo, Hong-Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4824-93851 aShi, Chen-Yu1 aGeise, Geoffrey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5439-272X1 aFeringa, Ben L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0588-84351 aTian, He1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3547-74851 aQu, Da-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2039-35640 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 July 26, v. 141, no. 32 p.12804-12814dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b057403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04117naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245014500168300001800313520255300331592002802884596010102912650001103013650001303024650002303037650002103060650001703081650001103098650001903109650001203128650001403140650001303154650001403167650001303181650001103194650001703205650001303222650001103235700001803246700001903264700001503283700005803298700006403356773012203420856008403542852000903626655001203635IND60776903820221118065222.0220511e20220329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077690382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c008382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Hongchang10aReview of Multifunctional Separators: Stabilizing the Cathode and the Anode for Alkali (Li, Na, and K) Metal–Sulfur and Selenium Batteries  ap. 8053-8125.  aAlkali metal batteries based on lithium, sodium, and potassium anodes and sulfur-based cathodes are regarded as key for next-generation energy storage due to their high theoretical energy and potential cost effectiveness. However, metal–sulfur batteries remain challenged by several factors, including polysulfides’ (PSs) dissolution, sluggish sulfur redox kinetics at the cathode, and metallic dendrite growth at the anode. Functional separators and interlayers are an innovative approach to remedying these drawbacks. Here we critically review the state-of-the-art in separators/interlayers for cathode and anode protection, covering the Li–S and the emerging Na–S and K–S systems. The approaches for improving electrochemical performance may be categorized as one or a combination of the following: Immobilization of polysulfides (cathode); catalyzing sulfur redox kinetics (cathode); introduction of protective layers to serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) (anode); and combined improvement in electrolyte wetting and homogenization of ion flux (anode and cathode). It is demonstrated that while the advances in Li–S are relatively mature, less progress has been made with Na–S and K–S due to the more challenging redox chemistry at the cathode and increased electrochemical instability at the anode. Throughout these sections there is a complementary discussion of functional separators for emerging alkali metal systems based on metal–selenium and the metal–selenium sulfide. The focus then shifts to interlayers and artificial SEI/cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers employed to stabilize solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) in metal–sulfur solid-state batteries (SSBs). The discussion of SSEs focuses on inorganic electrolytes based on Li- and Na-based oxides and sulfides but also touches on some hybrid systems with an inorganic matrix and a minority polymer phase. The review then moves to practical considerations for functional separators, including scaleup issues and Li–S technoeconomics. The review concludes with an outlook section, where we discuss emerging mechanics, spectroscopy, and advanced electron microscopy (e.g. cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB))-based approaches for analysis of functional separator structure–battery electrochemical performance interrelations. Throughout the review we identify the outstanding open scientific and technological questions while providing recommendations for future research topics.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcLos Alamos National Laboratory IMS Distinguished Faculty Scholar programdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanodes 3acathodes 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3ahomogenization 3alithium 3amechanics 3apolymers 3apotassium 3aselenium 3asodium 3aspectroscopy 3asulfides 3asulfur1 aHutter, Tanya1 aBoyce, Brad L.1 aWatt, John1 aLiu, Pengcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9530-92671 aMitlin, D.q(David),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7556-35750 tChemical reviews.g2022 Mar. 29, v. 122, no. 9 p.8053-8125dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c008383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245017100164300001600335520123000351592002801581650001901609650002201628650001601650650001701666650001101683650001401694650001401708650001601722650001301738650002701751651001701778651001801795653001701813653002501830653001501855653001701870653002801887653002401915653002201939700001401961700001301975700001701988700001502005700001202020700001302032700001402045773011102059856008502170852000902255655001202264IND60580405220221120070204.0170917e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058040522DNAL7 a10.2989/1814232X.2017.13278862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahé, K10aRelationship between somatic growth and otolith growth: a case study of the ornate jobfish Pristipomoides argyrogrammicus from the coast of Réunion (SW Indian Ocean)  ap. 145-151.  aThe ornate jobfish Pristipomoides argyrogrammicus Valenciennes 1832 occurs in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean, where it is harvested by small-scale coastal fisheries. Management of this species is hindered by lack of adequate biological data. We sampled a total of 113 individuals from the landings of local artisanal fishers on the island of Réunion (southwestern Indian Ocean), from March 2014 to March 2015. The relationships between two types of body length (total and standard length, cm) and total weight (g) were shown to be significant (p < 0.05). The length–weight relationship was described by a power function, with the scaling factor estimated to be 0.008 and the exponent 3.146. Age was determined using whole otoliths. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was estimated to be TL ₜ = 30.68(1 – e ⁻⁰.⁵²⁽ᵗ⁾). Otolith morphometry variables (length, width and area) were significantly correlated with age estimates (p < 0.05). No significant difference in age estimates was observed between left and right otoliths used as predictors. Readings from observed age and the estimates from modelled age indicated relatively good agreement, suggesting the potential to use whole otoliths for age estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPristipomoides 3aage determination 3abody length 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aequations 3afisheries 3amorphometry 3aotoliths 3atraditional technology 3aIndian Ocean 3aPacific Ocean 0aage estimate 0ageneral linear model 0aLutjanidae 0amodelled age 0amorphometric parameters 0aotolith morphometry 0areading precision1 aAumond, Y1 aRabhi, K1 aElleboode, R1 aBellamy, E1 aHuet, J1 aGault, M1 aRoos, D.,0 tAfrican journal of marine science.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 39, no. 2 p.145-151dTaylor & Francisx1814-23387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2017.13278863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245012500132300001400257520109400271592002801365650001801393650002001411650001701431650001801448650001601466650000901482650001601491650001601507650001401523650001301537650000901550650001601559650001201575650001601587650002201603650001401625700002301639700002301662773016501685856004701850852000901897655001201906IND60124006820221118054618.0150421e20110105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012400682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjakaiye, J.

Hybrid White Leghorn (L33) layer hens (n=720) and 39 weeks old, were randomly allotted to 4 treatments containing 0, 150 mg vitamin C, 150 mg (150 IU) vitamin E, and 150 mg vitamin C plus 150 mg vitamin E/Kg of diet. Final live weight in supplemented groups were significantly (P<0.05) higher than control. Egg, egg yolk and egg albumen weight in groups administered with vitamins E and C+E were very significantly higher compared with control, meanwhile, the same indicators were only significantly (P<0.05) higher in vitamin C group compared with control. Similarly, eggshell weight was significantly (P<0.05) higher in all treated groups, with the highest value recorded in group supplemented with vitamins C+E compared with control. By sustaining bird’s live weight and increasing egg quality indicators, it is concluded that both antioxidants offered protective effect against the thermally stressful hot-humid condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhite Leghorn 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abody weight 3adiet 3aegg albumen 3aegg quality 3aegg shell 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aheat stress 3ahybrids 3alaying hens 3aprotective effect 3avitamin E1 aCuesta-Mazorra, M.1 aGarcia-Diaz, J.

The ability to adapt and design increasingly sophisticated capsid structures and functions stands to benefit the fields of catalysis, materials science, and medicine.  aPublisher supplied data  a844006cH2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actionsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010665  aNAcSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F?rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001711  a19-2c, Eidgen?ssische Technische Hochschule Z?richdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003006  a42250.1cInnosuisse - Schweizerische Agentur f?r Innovationsf?rderungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100013348 3acapsid 3acatalytic activity 3adirected evolution 3aencapsulation 3aevolution 3aferritin 3amedicine1 aLevasseur, Mikail D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4228-08751 aTetter, Stephan1 aSteinauer, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1495-93301 aHori, Mao1 aHilvert, Donald1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3941-621X0 tChemical reviews.g2022 Apr. 08, v. 122, no. 9 p.9145-9197dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c008773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007700169300001400246520180300260592002802063650001502091650001802106650001302124650001802137650002302155650001802178650001402196650001802210650002102228650002102249650002802270650001302298650001202311650002202323650002002345650001502365650001202380650001502392650001102407650002902418650001502447650000902462650001102471650001402482653001802496653001802514653002202532653002902554653003102583653002002614653002102634700001902655700001802674700002102692700002302713773011902736856008302855852000902938655001202947IND60573529320221120074719.0190417e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057352932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcdf.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoff, H. Douglas10aDietary fibre for glycaemia control: Towards a mechanistic understanding  ap. 39-53.  aOne of the many functional benefits of dietary fibre when present in the human diet is its ability to reduce the rate of absorption of glucose after consumption of high glycaemic carbohydrate-containing foods, leading to a blunted blood glucose response curve and less demand for insulin. Glycaemia control through dietary intervention is of significant importance to those at high risk for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D), or those with Impaired Glucose Tolerance or with T2D, populations that are growing globally at an alarming rate. The soluble polysaccharide gums are well known to induce viscosity and/or gelation in solution, and their physiological function is often related to this rheological behaviour. However, gastrointestinal secretions and dilution, and acidification and re-neutralization, can affect the rheological properties of the polysaccharides in vivo. When one considers the physiology of starch and sugar digestion and glucose absorption, it is possible to elucidate several plausible mechanisms by which both soluble and insoluble fibres might contribute to Glycaemia control: reduction in gastric emptying, modification of release of digestion- and fermentation-related hormones, inhibition of amylase activity and delayed starch hydrolysis, reduction in diffusion of amylolytic products to the small intestinal microvilli, and/or the development of an absorptive barrier layer through interactions with the mucosa. Scientific evidence suggests that all of these mechanisms are involved to some extent. Understanding the relationships between molecular structure, physical functionality and physiological functionality of dietary fibres should enable the food industry to deliver more fibre-enriched functional food products to consumers, especially for Glycaemia control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacidification 3aamylases 3ablood glucose 3achemical structure 3adietary fiber 3adigestion 3afood industry 3afunctional foods 3agastric emptying 3agastrointestinal system 3agelation 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahuman nutrition 3ahydrolysis 3ainsulin 3amicrovilli 3amucosa 3anutritional intervention 3aplant gums 3arisk 3astarch 3aviscosity 0aDietary fibre 0aSoluble fibre 0aGlycaemia control 0aBlood glucose regulation 0aImpaired Glucose Tolerance 0aType 2 diabetes 0aGastric emptying1 aRepin, Nikolay1 aFabek, Hrvoje1 aEl Khoury, Dalia1 aGidley, Michael J.0 tBioactive carbohydrates and dietary fibre.g2018 Apr., v. 14 p.39-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:21611x2212-61987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcdf.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245012700177300001400304520120200318592002801520650002001548650001701568650002501585650001601610650002701626650001401653650001001667650001901677650002101696650002801717650001701745650001501762650001601777650001301793650001501806650001101821650002701832650002501859650001501884700002701899700002401926700002701950773011801977856008102095852000902176655001202185IND50089143820221119095844.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008914382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-013-9165-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegura-Campos, Maira Rubi10aFunctional and bioactive properties of Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) protein hydrolysates produced by enzymatic treatments  ap. 61-69.  aVelvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) protein hydrolysates were produced with gastrointestinal enzymes. Functional properties such as nitrogen solubility, emulsifying capacity and emulsion stability, foam capacity and stability of the hydrolysates were determined. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory, antioxidant and antithrombotic capacities were evaluated to determine the biological activity of hydrolysates. For pepsin, degree of hydrolysis (DH) increased sharply between 5 min (22.33 %) and 60 min (28.07 %), respectively, with a maximum DH of 33.50 % (90 min). For pancreatin, DH increased sharply between 5 min (25.08 %) and 90 min (34.92 %), respectively, with a maximum DH of 37.23 % (120 min). For sequential system pepsin–pancreatin, DH increased sharply between 5 min (25.21 %) and 60 min (32.82 %), respectively, with a maximum DH of 34.14 % (120 min). Hydrolysates with the lowest DH and the highest DH were selected to assess the functional and biological potential.

However, such supervised CD networks require a large amount of data and only use information from current images. In addition, it is time consuming to manually acquire the ground truth data for newly obtained images. Here, we proposed a novel method for CD in case of a lack of training data in an area near by another one with the available ground truth data. The proposed method automatically entails generating training data and fine-tuning the CD network. To detect changes in target images without ground truth data, the difference images were generated using spectral similarity measure, and the training data were selected via fuzzy c-means clustering. Recurrent fully convolutional networks with multiscale three-dimensional filters were used to extract objects of various sizes from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The CD network was pre-trained on labeled source domain data; then, the network was fine-tuned on target images using generated training data. Two further CD networks were trained with a combined weighted loss function. The training data in the target domain were iteratively updated using he prediction map of the CD network. Experiments on two hyperspectral UAV datasets confirmed that the proposed method is capable of transferring change rules and improving CD results based on training data extracted in an unsupervised way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3afilters 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aKim, Yongil 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120710993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245008200206300001400288520083600302592002801138653002101166653001601187653003301203653001301236653001601249700005501265700002101320700005901341700002201400700005801422773008601480856008101566852000901647655001201656IND60554962820221118224151.0161026e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055496282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbo.2014.02.0022doi7 aPMC47236122pmcid7 a269092992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDachs, Robert10aDouble pathology, sarcoidosis associated with multiple myeloma: A case report  ap. 61-65.  aThe association of sarcoidosis with multiple myeloma is not well known.

Likewise, bioaugmentation seems a promising approach to improve the functioning of treatment wetlands, considering that natural mycorrhization has been detected in treatment wetlands and that bacteria are the main driver of contaminant degradation processes. However, to date, full scale implementation seems to be rare. This review synthesizes the effects of bioaugmentation on different types of treatment wetlands, to a large extent performed on a microcosm (<0.5 m²) or mesocosm scale (0.51 to 5 m²). While inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi tended to show a positive effect on the growth of some wetland plants (e.g. Phragmites australis), the mechanisms underlying such positive effects are not well understood and the effects of upscaling to full scale treatment wetlands remain unknown. Bacterial inoculation tended to promote plant growth and pollutant degradation, but longer term data is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aactivated sludge 3abioaugmentation 3aenvironment 3aplant growth 3apollutants 3asoil remediation 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awetlands 0aBacterial inoculation 0aArbuscular mycorrhize 0aConstructed wetland 0aWastewater treatment 0aPhytoremediation1 aChazarenc, Florent1 aChagnon, Pierre-Luc1 aBrisson, Jacques0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 25, v. 775 p.145820-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1458203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011400164300001400278520136600292592002801658650002301686650002701709650001201736650002601748650001701774650001801791650001101809650001501820650001301835650002601848650003001874650001401904650001701918650001201935653001901947653002501966653001601991653002502007653001902032700001402051700001702065700001702082700001502099700001702114700001402131700001802145700001502163700001802178773011002196856008602306852000902392655001202401IND60793101820221119151031.0220921e20221110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079310182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2022.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Ping10aRegulation of carbon flux and NADH/NAD+ supply to enhance 2,3-butanediol production in Enterobacter aerogenes  ap. 67-75.  aAs a valuable platform chemical, 2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BDO) has a variety of industrial applications, and its microbial production is particularly attractive as an alternative to petroleum-based production. In this study, the regulation of intracellular carbon flux and NADH/NAD⁺ was used to increase the 2,3-BDO production of Enterobacter aerogenes. The genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and pyruvate formate lyase (pfl) were disrupted using the λ-Red recombination method and CRISPR-Cas9 to reduce the production of several byproducts and the consumption of NADH. Knockout of ldh or pfl increased intracellular NADH/NAD⁺ by 111 % and 113 %, respectively. Moreover, two important genes in the 2,3-BDO biosynthesis pathway, acetolactate synthase (budB) and acetoin reductase (budC), were overexpressed in E. aerogenes to further amply the metabolic flux toward 2,3-BDO production. And the overexpression of budB or budC increased intracellular NADH/NAD⁺ by 46 % and 57 %, respectively. In shake-flask cultivation with sucrose as carbon source, the 2,3-BDO titer of the IAM1183-LPBC was 3.55 times that of the wild type. In the 5-L fermenter, the maximal 2,3-BDO production produced by the IAM1183-LPBC was 2.88 times that of the original strain. This work offers new ideas for promoting the biosynthesis of 2,3-BDO for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aEnterobacter aerogenes 3aacetoin 3aacetolactate synthase 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3afermenters 3aformates 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aliquid state fermentation 3apetroleum 3apyruvic acid 3asucrose 0a2,3-butanediol 0aBiosynthetic pathway 0aCRISPR-Cas9 0aCofactor engineering 0aMetabolic flux1 aGao, Ting1 aBai, Ruoxuan1 aYang, Jiayao1 aXu, Yudong1 aChu, Wanying1 aJiang, Ke1 aZhang, Jingya1 aXu, Fangxu1 aZhao, Hongxin0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2022 Nov. 10, v. 358 p.67-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2022.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245008700165520185000252592002802102650001302130650001902143650001202162650001902174650001302193650001602206650002402222650002402246650002202270650001602292650000902308651001002317700001802327700001602345700001902361700001702380700001802397700001502415773012202430856008102552852000902633655001202642IND60794058520221119035250.0220922e20220824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079405852DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120919952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingfu 10aGreenhouse Natural Ventilation Models: How Do We Develop with Chinese Greenhouses?  aGreenhouse technology has advanced over the past few decades in terms of environmental control (e.g., indoor temperature, relative humidity, and CO₂ concentration). Ventilation is an effective way to adjust the indoor climate. Natural ventilation has gained significant research attention recently because of its low energy requirement. To evaluate the ventilation effectiveness, the ventilation rate is often used. This review summarizes the published review papers related to greenhouse ventilation. Ventilation models are reported under different conditions, including wind-induced, buoyancy-induced, and combined effects-induced ventilation in greenhouses. The influencing factors are described, such as the wind and buoyancy strength and distribution, greenhouse geometry, and vent arrangement. Various methods assessing natural ventilation in greenhouses are introduced, consisting of tracer gas techniques, the pressure difference method, the energy balance method, the emptying fluid-filling box method, and numerical simulation. The values of the key coefficients deduced and used in the literature are listed. This paper reports what has been done in the world and where we can start to develop dynamic ventilation models for solar and tunnel-type greenhouses in China. Further valuable investigations are discussed. The pressure distribution function in greenhouses with horizontal openings, a model for cross-ventilation induced by combined wind and buoyancy force, and an analytical plant-considered ventilation model with higher applicability are described. To ensure the accuracy of the ventilation models, other environmental variables, especially geography-dependent ones, can be added. More criteria are suggested to evaluate the ventilation performance rather than the ventilation rate to provide a comprehensive assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aenergy balance 3ageometry 3agreenhouses 3amathematical models 3anatural ventilation 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3awind 3aChina1 aZhao, Shumei 1 aDai, Anguo 1 aWang, Pingzhi 1 aLiu, Zhiwei 1 aLiang, Bohua 1 aDing, Tao 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Aug. 24, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120919953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245009900181300001600280520167400296592002801970650002901998650001502027650001602042650001702058650001302075650001002088650001602098650002702114650001502141650002002156650002102176650001902197650001802216650001802234650000902252650001302261650002302274650001502297650002302312650001102335650003202346650000902378653001002387653001502397653002302412653002002435700002502455700002302480700003602503700002202539700002902561700003102590773010002621856008102721852000902802655001202811IND60600621520221118152355.0180703e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060062152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaz-Tostes, Maria das Graças10aYacon effects in immune response and nutritional status of iron and zinc in preschool children  ap. 666-672.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of yacon flour on iron and zinc nutritional status and immune response biomarkers in preschool children.Preschool children ages 2 to 5 y were selected from two nurseries and were placed into a control group (n = 58) or a yacon group (n = 59). The yacon group received yacon flour in preparations for 18 wk at a quantity to provide 0.14 g of fructooligosaccharides/kg of body weight daily. Anthropometric parameters were measured before and after the intervention and dietary intake was measured during the intervention. To assess iron and zinc status, erythrograms, serum iron, ferritin, and plasma, and erythrocyte zinc were evaluated. Systemic immune response was assessed by the biomarkers interleukin IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α). Intestinal immune response was analyzed by secretory IgA (sIgA) levels before and after the intervention. Statistical significance was evaluated using the paired t test (α = 5%).Before and after the study, the children presented a high prevalence of overweight and an inadequate dietary intake of zinc and fiber. The yacon group presented with lower hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration at the end of the study (P < 0.05). Erythrocyte zinc was reduced in both groups at the end of the study (P < 0.05). Yacon intake increased the serum levels of IL-4 and fecal sIgA (P < 0.05). The control group had lower serum TNF-α after the study period (P < 0.05).Yacon improved intestinal immune response but demonstrated no effect on the nutritional status of iron and zinc in preschool children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSmallanthus sonchifolius 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3aerythrocytes 3aferritin 3aflour 3afood intake 3afructooligosaccharides 3ahemoglobin 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin A 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3airon 3anecrosis 3anutritional status 3aoverweight 3apreschool children 3at-test 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3azinc 0aYacon 0aPrebiotics 0aNutritional status 0aImmune response1 aViana, Mirelle Lomar1 aGrancieri, Mariana1 aLuz, Tereza Cecília dos Santos1 aPaula, Heberth de1 aPedrosa, Rogério Graça1 aCosta, Neuza Maria Brunoro0 tNutrition.g2014 June, v. 30, no. 6 p.666-672dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2013.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245014300198300001600341500002000357520150300377592002801880596005701908596005701965650001602022650001502038650002302053650001602076650001202092650002802104650001502132650001002147650001402157650001402171650001602185700001902201700002002220700006402240773013302304856007402437852000902511655001202520IND60766809020221122220329.0220211e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076680902DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.139552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, Ryosuke K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9697-527X10aMolecular evolution and convergence of the rhodopsin gene in Gymnogobius, a goby group having diverged into coastal to freshwater habitats  ap. 333-346.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAdaptive evolution of vision‐related genes has been frequently observed in the process of invasion of new environments in a wide range of animal taxa. The typical example is that of the molecular evolution of rhodopsin associated with habitat changes in aquatic animals. However, few studies have investigated rhodopsin evolution during adaptive radiation across various habitats. In the present study, we examined the link between molecular evolutionary patterns in the rhodopsin gene and macroscopic habitat changes in Gymnogobius species (Gobiidae), which have adaptively radiated to diverse aquatic habitats including the sea, brackish waters, rivers and lakes. Analysis of amino acid substitutions in rhodopsin in the phylogenetic framework revealed convergent substitutions in 4–5 amino acids in three groups (four species), including two spectral tuning amino acid sites known to change rhodopsin's absorption wavelength. Positive selection was detected in the basal branches of each of these three groups, suggesting adaptive molecular convergence of rhodopsin. However, no significant correlation was observed between amino acid substitutions and the species’ habitat changes, suggesting molecular adaptation to some unidentified micro‐ecological environments. Taken together, these results emphasize the importance of considering not only macroscopic habitats but also micro‐ecological environments when elucidating the driving forces of adaptive evolution of the visual system.  aPublisher supplied data  a17H03720cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a26291079cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aGymnogobius 3aabsorption 3aadaptive radiation 3aamino acids 3aanimals 3aevolutionary adaptation 3afreshwater 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3arhodopsin 3awavelengths1 aHarada, Shigeo1 aTabata, Ryoichi1 aWatanabe, Katsutoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2244-29020 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2022 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.333-346dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.139553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012300158300001800281520158900299592002801888650001501916650001801931650001101949650001701960650002401977650000902001650000702010650001402017650001102031650002002042650001602062700003002078700002402108773010502132856007502237852000902312655001202321IND60534135020170629000000.0160802e20141218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053413502DNAL7 a10.1021/ef50175222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutin, Anthony10aMass Transfer between Crude Oil and Water. Part 2: Effect of Sodium Dodecyl Benzenesulfonate for Enhanced Oil Recovery  ap. 7337-7342.  aIn enhanced oil recovery, synthetic surfactants are usually added to decrease the interfacial tension between oil and water. When alkaline are used, endogenous natural surfactants bearing acidic groups that can be found in acidic or heavy crude oils are activated in situ by ionization; they accumulate at the oil–water interface and reduce the interfacial tension. These crude oils are called “interfacially reactive”. In alkaline surfactant flooding, the interaction between synthetic surfactants and natural surfactants allows for the acquisition of ultralow interfacial tensions, lower than 10–³ mN/m. When reactive crude oils and water at different pH values are contacted, mass transfers of natural species (asphaltenes, naphthenic acids, etc.) from oil to water are observed. We report an experimental study of the influence of sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS) on mass transfer between oil and water phases, in which the final pH of the water phase was measured as a function of the SDBS concentration and initial pH. We also developed a model to account for the influence of the SDBS concentration on exchanges between the reactive crude oil and the aqueous phase. We found that the final pH of the water phase increases when the SDBS concentration increases, revealing a larger transfer of oil species into water. Finally, we show that a comparison between the mass transfer and interfacial tensions between crude oil and water allows for better insight into the interactions between synthetic and natural surfactants in alkaline surfactant flooding processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aionization 3amass transfer 3amodels 3anaphthenates 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3apH 3apetroleum 3asodium 3asurface tension 3asurfactants1 aArgillier, Jean-François1 aLangevin, Dominique0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2014 Dec. 18, v. 28, no. 12 p.7337-7342dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef50175223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245012200173520136900295592002801664650001301692650002001705650001101725650001501736650001601751650002401767700002201791700002401813700002801837773012301865856008101988852000902069655001202078IND60794058720221119035217.0220922e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079405872DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120921132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChariskou, Chrysanthi 10aVariable Selection on Reflectance NIR Spectra for the Prediction of TSS in Intact Berries of Thompson Seedless Grapes  aFourier-transform near infrared (FT-NIR) reflection spectra of intact berries of the grape variety Thompson seedless were used to predict total soluble solids (TSS) content. From an initial dataset, 12 subsets were considered by applying variable selection to extract the reflectance values at wavenumbers most correlated to the chemometrically measured TSS content. The datasets were processed by both multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS) methods towards predicting the TSS content from the reflection values of each spectrum. Prediction accuracy was measured in terms of both the coefficient of determination R² and the root mean squared error (RMSE). It was found that variable selection improved the prediction accuracy with both processing methods; values of R² of up to 0.972 and 0.926 and RMSE of up to 0.306 and 0.472 were reported with MLR and PLS, respectively. The combination of variable selection and MLR displayed (a) higher accuracy when the spectra dataset variation was limited, (b) lower accuracy with datasets of large variation such as those with spectra from a variety of maturity stages, and (c) failed with more complex spectra sets such as those from different harvest years. The combination of variable selection and PLS has demonstrated reliable prediction results with various degrees of dataset complexity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3adata collection 3agrapes 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aregression analysis1 aVrochidou, Eleni 1 aDaniels, Andries J.1 aKaburlasos, Vassilis G.0 tAgronomy.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120921133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015100155300001800306500001900324500002000343520175200363592002802115596007502143596006602218650001602284650002802300650001302328650000902341650002002350650001302370650002102383650001502404650002202419650000902441700001702450700001802467700001502485700001902500700001602519700001802535700001802553700001502571773015402586856007402740852000902814655001202823IND60741351520221120173503.0210611e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074135152DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.110552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Bin10aDirect separation and purification of α‐lactalbumin from cow milk whey by aqueous two‐phase flotation of thermo‐sensitive polymer/phosphate  ap. 4173-4182.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: α‐lactalbumin (α‐La) is of great interest to the industry as a result of its excellent functional properties and nutritional value. Aqueous two‐phase flotation (ATPF) of thermo‐sensitive polymer poly (ethylene glycol‐ran‐propylene glycol) monobutyl ether (UCON) and KH₂PO₄ was applied to directly separate and purify α‐La from milk whey, which was purposed to simplify the production process and reduced cost of production. RESULTS: The effect of ATPF composition and operating parameters on the flotation efficiency (E) and purity of α‐La were investigated. The optimal conditions included 2 min of premixing time, 30 mL min⁻¹ flow velocity and 20 min of flotation time, whereas the composition conditions comprised 35.0 mL 0.18 g mL⁻¹ phosphate solution (containing 10% (cow milk whey/salt solution, v/v) cow milk whey, 50 ppm defoamer and 2 g NaCl) and 5.0 mL of 40% (w/w) UCON solution. Under the optimal conditions, E of α‐La was 95.67 ± 1.04% and purity of α‐La was 98.78 ± 1.19%. UCON was recovered by a thermally‐induced phase separation and reused in next ATPF process without reducing E of α‐La. Purified α‐La was characterized by several key technologies. The results indicated that α‐La in cow milk whey could be directly separated and purified by the ATPF and the purity was satisfactory. Moreover, it was suggested there was no obvious structure difference between the α‐La separated by ATPF and the α‐La standard. CONCLUSION: The present study enabled the recycling of UCON, providing an effective, economically viable and environmentally friendly approach for the separation and purification of protein. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0400304cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aC2018019cNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province 3aagriculture 3aeconomic sustainability 3aindustry 3amilk 3anutritive value 3apolymers 3aproduction costs 3aseparation 3athermosensitivity 3awhey1 aWang, Linlin1 aWang, Meichan1 aWu, Shuang1 aWang, Xiaojing1 aLi, Dongmei1 aLiu, Chunhong1 aFeng, Zhibiao1 aChi, Yujie0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 101, no. 10 p.4173-4182dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.110553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245016300181300001800344520054100362592002800903650002300931650002300954650002600977650002001003650000901023653002601032653002201058653003101080653003401111700002801145700002601173700003201199773010401231856008201335852000901417655001201426IND60613090820221118203644.0181011e20181018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061309082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Giovanny Carvalho10aNbCl5 a multifunctional reagent for the synthesis of new halogenated aminoquinoline compounds through innovative one-pot reaction and the acidochromism effect  ap. 6144-6149.  aThis paper describes an original one-pot way to synthesize nine new halogenated aminoquinoline derivatives using reactions conducted by niobium pentachloride.

Controlled‐release urea (CRU) is widely adopted to increase rice yields, but the synchronicity of N release from CRU with uptake of N by plants has rarely been studied. A 2‐year field experiment involving CRU and urea applications at three different N rates (240, 192 and 144 kg N ha⁻¹, equal to 100%, 80% and 60% of the recommended rate, respectively) was performed to compare their effects on N uptake, soil N content and rice yields. RESULTS: The successive release curves of CRU in the soil matched the corresponding N uptake curves of rice plants, and significant linear correlations were observed. Grain yield and N uptake under the CRU treatment increased by 5.25–7.88% and 7.13–17.94% than urea treatments, at the same N rate, and no obvious difference was found between CRU60% and Urea100%. CRU80% and CRU60% presented the highest NUE. The contents of ammonium‐nitrogen (NH₄⁺‐N), nitrate‐nitrogen (NO₃‐‐N), and total N and the chlorophyll relative value – SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) values – of the leaves under the CRU treatments were significantly higher than those under the urea treatments from heading to harvest. The contents of exchangeable sodium ion (Na⁺) and calcium ion (Ca²⁺) and the cation exchange capacity increased in response to CRU. CONCLUSION: CRU increased rice yields by providing N strongly in synchrony with the N requirements of the plants, and applying CRU at 192 kg N ha⁻¹ was an effective strategy to conserve N fertilizer, increase soil N contents and enhance NUE. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2020QC163cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China  a42007091/41977262/42077061cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cProject of Introducing and Cultivating Young Talent in the Universities of Shandong Province (Soil Erosion Process and Ecological Regulation) 3aagriculture 3aammonium nitrogen 3acalcium 3acation exchange capacity 3achlorophyll 3aexchangeable sodium 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplant analysis 3arice 3atotal nitrogen 3aurea1 aGeng, Jibiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2972-083X1 aLiu, Qianjin1 aZhang, Hanyu1 aHao, Xiaodong1 aSun, Yunbao1 aLu, Xiaofeng0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 101, no. 10 p.4183-4192dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.110563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245011800187300001600305520141800321592002801739650001801767650001201785650001301797650001801810650002101828650000901849650000901858650001201867650001301879650002501892650001201917650003801929650002601967650003501993650001102028650002302039650003902062650001102101650001002112650004202122650001902164650000902183650000902192650001902201650002402220650002602244700002302270773011202293856008102405852000902486655001202495IND50070524920221118011258.0141111e20131125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007052492DNAL7 a241205192pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKebebew, Zerihun10aEvaluation of anxiolytic and sedative effects of 80% ethanolic Carica papaya L.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the anxiolytic and sedative effects of 80% ethanolic Carica papaya (Caricaceae) pulp extract in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carica papaya pulp extract was screened for anxiolytic effect by using elevated plus maze, staircase and open field tests, and ketamine-induced sleeping time test for sedation at doses of 50, 100, 200, 400mg/kg. Distilled water and Diazepam were employed as negative and positive control groups, respectively. RESULTS: Carica papaya pulp extract 100mg/kg significantly increased the percentage of open arm time and entry, and reduced the percentage of entry and time spent in closed arm in elevated plus maze test; reduced the number of rearing in the staircase test; and increased the time spent and entries in the central squares while the total number of entries into the open field were not significantly affected, suggesting anxiolytic activity without altering locomotor and sedative effects. A synergistic reduction in the number of rearing and an inverted U-shaped dose response curves were obtained with important parameters of anxiety CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study established a support for the traditional usage of Carica papaya as anxiolytic medicinal plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3aanxiety 3adiazepam 3adose response 3amedicinal plants 3amice 3apulp 3arearing 3asedation 3atraditional medicine 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Anxiety Agentsxpharmacology 2aAnxietyxdrug therapy 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aCarica 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aExploratory Behaviorxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aHypnotics and Sedativesxpharmacology 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMale 2aMice 2aPlant Extracts 2aSolventsxchemistry 2aToxicity Tests, Acute1 aShibeshi, Workineh0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Nov. 25, v. 150, no. 2 p.665-671dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011200157300001600269520116400285592002801449653001401477653001501491653001501506653001601521653002101537700002201558700002001580773011301600856007501713852000901788655001201797IND60125022220221118065235.0151101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012502222DNAL7 a10.1636/Hi09-70.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCady, Alan B.10aContrasting energetic costs of courtship signaling in two wolf spiders having divergent courtship behaviors  ap. 161-165.  aEnergetic costs of courtship behavior were measured for two sympatric wolf spiders that are reproductively isolated based on distinct male courtship behaviors with different signaling modes and activity levels: Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz 1844) uses multi-modal communication (visual and seismic signals) and an actively-moving courtship display, whereas S. rovneri (Uetz & Dondale 1979) uses only seismic signals produced while stationary. To test for increased energetic expense of more complex multimodal courtship in S. ocreata, we recorded peak CO₂ output for male spiders standing, walking, or courting. We found that peak CO₂ output while standing or walking was similar between species. Courtship behavior of S. ocreata produced greater peak CO₂ output than these other behaviors, and was significantly greater than peak CO₂ output of S. rovneri courtship, which was not different from that of locomotion. Hence, unequal energy expenditure related to the modality of the males' courtship displays resulted in different energetic costs for courting male spiders. Male courtship vigor may serve as a criterion for female mate choice in Schizocosa.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCourtship 0aenergetics 0aSchizocosa 0arespiration 0asexual selection1 aDelaney, Kevin J.1 aUetz, George W.0 tJournal of arachnology.g2011 Apr., v. 39, no. 1 p.161-165dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FHi09-70.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016800166300001800334520155000352592002801902650000801930650002201938650000901960650001201969650002101981650002102002650001002023650001602033650001802049700002602067700002202093773009802115856008602213852000902299655001202308IND60577417120221122085926.0170808e20160524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057741712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b009352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Joaquim10aTime- and Space-Resolved SAXS Experiments Inform on Phase Transition Kinetics in Hydrated, Liquid-Crystalline Films of Polyion–Surfactant Ion “Complex Salts”  ap. 5102-5110.  aDetailed time- and space-resolved SAXS experiments show the variation with hydration of liquid crystalline structures in ethanol-cast 5–80 μm thick films of polyion–surfactant ion “complex salts” (CS). The CS were dodecyl- (C₁₂) or hexadecyl- (C₁₆) trimethylammonium surfactants with polyacrylate (DP 25 or 6000) counter-polyions. The experiments were carried out on vertical films in humid air above a movable water bath, so that gradients of hydration were generated, which could rapidly be altered. Scans over different positions along a film, kept fixed relative to the bath, showed that the surfactant aggregates of the various liquid-crystalline CS structures grow in cross-sectional area with decreasing hydration. This behavior is attributed to the low water content. Studies of films undergoing rapid dehydration, made possible by the original experimental setup, gave strong evidence that some of the investigated systems remain kinetically trapped for minutes in a nonequilibrium Pm3n micellar cubic phase before switching to the equilibrium P6mm 2D hexagonal phase. Both the length of the polyion and the length of the surfactant hydrocarbon “tail” affect the kinetics of the phase transition. The slowness of the cubic-to-hexagonal structural transition is attributed to the fact that it requires major rearrangements of the polyions and surfactant ions relative to each other. By contrast, other structure changes, such as between the hexagonal and rectangular phases, were observed to occur much more rapidly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acrystal structure 3aions 3aliquids 3aphase transition 3apolyacrylic acid 3asalts 3asurfactants 3awater content1 aGustavsson, Charlotte1 aPiculell, Lennart0 tLangmuir.g2016 May 24, v. 32, no. 20 p.5102-5110dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b009353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245014000167300001800307520189500325592002802220650001102248650002402259650002202283650005302305650001602358650001702374650002102391650001702412650002102429650002102450650004402471650001402515650002202529650002302551650001102574650001902585700001702604700002102621700001702642700001902659700001702678773010502695856007502800852000902875655001202884IND60534135520221120223720.0160802e20141218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053413552DNAL7 a10.1021/ef50181692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez-Majmutov, Anton10aDeriving the Molecular Composition of Middle Distillates by Integrating Statistical Modeling with Advanced Hydrocarbon Characterization  ap. 7385-7393.  aTo fully advance our understanding of hydrocarbon conversion chemistry requires powerful analytical methods to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize complex petroleum fractions at the molecular level. In the absence of such tools, an alternative solution is to model the molecular composition of hydrocarbon mixtures with limited analytical data. The objective of this study is to integrate modeling techniques with conventional and advanced petroleum characterization methods to derive the composition of middle distillate fractions at the molecular level. In the present approach, analytical petroleum characterization data are used as input to computationally generate a mixture of representative molecules that mimics the properties of the real sample. The representing molecules are constructed according to coherent chemical/thermodynamic criteria by Monte Carlo sampling of a set of statistical functions assigned to each possible molecular feature. The assembled mixture is built on a large set of chemical species and is further optimized with the principle of Maximum Entropy. The approach is applied to simulating two middle distillates differing significantly in hydrocarbon type composition and origin. The samples are experimentally characterized by standard and advanced analytical methods: density, simulated distillation, elemental analysis, hydrocarbon types/distributions and sulfur compound speciation by two-dimensional gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC × GC–FID) and sulfur chemiluminescence detector (GC × GC–SCD), and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to obtain sufficient information for parameter fitting and model validation. Simulation results showed that the model is capable of generating representative mixtures that reasonably match the actual physical samples in analytical properties and carbon number distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical speciation 3achemiluminescence 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3adistillates 3adistillation 3aflame ionization 3ahydrocarbons 3amodel validation 3amolecular models 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apetroleum 3asimulation models 3astatistical models 3asulfur 3athermodynamics1 aChen, Jinwen1 aGieleciak, Rafal1 aHager, Darcy1 aHeshka, Nicole1 aSalmon, Sara0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2014 Dec. 18, v. 28, no. 12 p.7385-7393dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef50181693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011000160300001400270520167700284592002801961653002501989653001802014653002802032653001602060700002402076700002202100773011102122856007502233852000902308655001202317IND60125022520221118065205.0151101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012502252DNAL7 a10.1636/Hi10-11.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuter, Robert B.10aEgg capsule architecture and siting in a leaf-curling sac spider, Clubiona riparia (Araneae: Clubionidae)  ap. 76-83.  aFemales of the leaf-curling sac spider Clubiona riparia build three-sided capsules, in which they enclose both themselves and their eggs. A capsule is usually constructed by bending a single blade of grass or other leaf twice, each time causing a fold that is perpendicular to the long axis of the blade, and joining the edges with silk. When constructed with monocot leaf blades, the resulting capsule is roughly triangular in cross section and 2––4 times as long as it is wide. We sampled occupied capsules from a 0.16––hectare marsh in central Ontario, Canada. Although we found capsules built with the leaves of cattails (Typha latifolia), iris (Iris versicolor), a grass (Calamagrostis sp.), and an unidentified willow shrub (Salix sp.), for the current analysis we concentrated on the monocots because of their structural similarity. Capsules built on cattails (2.13 ±± 0.14 ml) were more voluminous than those on iris (1.63 ±± 0.14 ml), and capsules made of grass blades (0.67 ±± 0.08 ml) were the smallest. Nearly 70%% of the total variation in capsule volume was associated with differences between the plant species. Only among capsules built on cattails was there a significant positive relationship between pre-oviposition spider mass and capsule volume; it accounted for about 37%% of the variability in capsule volume. On willow leaves, spiders always constructed capsules with the lower surface of the leaf to the inside of the capsule; and on cattail blades, spiders always made their bends in a clockwise direction. We discuss the implications of our findings for an understanding of the choices these spiders make just prior to oviposition.  aPublisher supplied data 0aReproductive ecology 0aparental care 0aoviposition site choice 0aclutch mass1 aMiller, Patricia R.1 aStratton, Gail E.0 tJournal of arachnology.g2011 Apr., v. 39, no. 1 p.76-83dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FHi10-11.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003700139245013400176300001800310500001900328500002000347520125100367592002801618596009901646650002701745650003101772650002501803650001501828650001701843650001201860650001101872650001401883700002301897700005601920700007001976773012602046856007302172852000902245655001202254IND60741352120221120173508.0210611e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074135212DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.133622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEcheverría‐Bugueño, Macarena10aEvidence for the existence of extracellular vesicles in Renibacterium salmoninarum and related cytotoxic effects on SHK‐1 cells  ap. 1015-1024.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExtracellular vesicles (EVs) in bacteria have been implicated in invasive and, through enzymes, infective processes. One Gram‐positive bacterium lacking any EV research, despite having commercial impacts on the aquaculture industry, is Renibacterium salmoninarum. We addressed this gap in knowledge by utilizing scanning electron microscopy to provide the first reported evidence for the production of EVs by R. salmoninarum strain H‐2. Dispersive light scattering detected that the EVs were heterogeneous in size, and the protein compositions were similar to the bacterial membrane and contained the virulent protein factors p22 and p57. The EVs additionally had a concentrated negative charge compared with R. salmoninarum H‐2, as determined by Z potential. Finally, these particles seemed to play a role in host invasion in vitro in the salmon head kidney cell line, as demonstrated by the occurrence of a cytotoxic effect within the first 48 hr post‐infection. Higher EV concentrations (i.e. 52.6 µg/ml) were more toxic than R. salmoninarum H‐2. This information serves as a foundation to develop and test possible uses for R. salmoninarum EVs in salmon aquaculture, inspiring future advances against bacterial kidney disease.  aPublisher supplied data  aCONICYT/FONDAP Grant No. 15110027cAgencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, ANID Chile 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aRenibacterium salmoninarum 3aaquaculture industry 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3akidneys 3asalmon 3avirulence1 aBalada, Cristóbal1 aIrgang, Rute1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5608-00601 aAvendaño‐Herrera, Ruben1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5368-44750 tJournal of fish diseases.g2021 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.1015-1024dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.133623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011600159300001800275520145300293592002801746650001701774650001301791650001601804650001801820650002701838650001701865650001501882650002201897650001701919650001301936650001301949700001301962700001901975700001601994700001602010773012102026856007402147852000902221655001202230IND60667067920221118025751.0190919e20141202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066706792DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra13015d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Youfang10aGraphene/carbon aerogels derived from graphene crosslinked polyimide as electrode materials for supercapacitors  ap. 1301-1308.  aCarbon aerogels with hierarchical porous structures are highly promising for developing novel electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their substantial active sites for ion and electron transfer. Herein, a new type of graphene/carbon aerogels with multimodal pores have been facilely synthesized via carbonization of graphene crosslinked polyimide aerogels. Compared to most carbon aerogels based on organic aerogels reported previously, this preparation process is facilitated by the exclusion of harmful formaldehyde. Moreover, graphene is demonstrated as a powerful crosslinking agent, allowing acceleration of the gelation process, improvement of the porous structures inside carbon aerogels, and enlargement of specific surface area and conductivity of carbon aerogels. SEM observation shows the multimodal pores and three-dimensional nano-network of carbon aerogels, which provide short diffusion lengths for both charge and ion transport and high electroactive regions. With graphene involved, the as-prepared carbon aerogels possess high specific surface area up to 998.7 m² g⁻¹ and specific capacitance up to 178.1 F g⁻¹ at a current density of 1 A g⁻¹, which is much higher than that of pure carbon aerogels (193.6 m² g⁻¹ and 104.2 F g⁻¹). This work provides a new and facile avenue for fabricating high performance carbon aerogels with hierarchical structures and broadens the potential applications of polyimide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aaerogels 3acapacitance 3acarbonization 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aformaldehyde 3agelation 3agraphene1 aFan, Wei1 aHuang, Yunpeng1 aZhang, Chao1 aLiu, Tianxi0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 02, v. 5, no. 2 p.1301-1308dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra13015d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245013800174520144400312592002801756650001301784650002501797650001801822650001701840650001601857650001701873650002401890650001201914650001301926650001401939650001201953650001201965650001401977650002701991650001502018650001702033650001402050650001002064650002302074700002102097700002202118700002002140700002002160700002202180773012302202856008102325852000902406655001202415IND60794059420221119035231.0220922e20220907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079405942DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120921202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiguori, G.q(Giorgia),10aInfluence of Cactus Pear Mucilage-Based Edible Coating on Marketability and Edibility Parameters of Minimally Processed Loquat Fruits  aLoquat fruit, popular all over the world for its mild, subacid, and sweet taste, has been classified as a non-climacteric fruit with a very short postharvest life. The fruit decays quickly after harvest, and losses in titratable acidity, taste, and juiciness, and internal browning occurs rapidly during shelf life. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of cactus pear mucilage-based coating on quality, nutraceutical value, microbiological growth, and sensorial parameters of minimally processed white-flesh Martorana and orange-red-flesh Gigante Rossa loquat fruits during cold storage. The effect of mucilage edible coating on the postharvest life, qualitative attributes, and nutraceutical value of fruit were evaluated by coloring, firmness, total soluble solids content, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, antioxidant activity, total phenols, and total carotenoids content. Our data showed a significant effect of mucilage coating on preserving quality, nutraceutical value, sensorial parameters, and improving postharvest life of minimally processed loquat fruits. Furthermore, coated fruits showed a significantly lower microbiological growth than uncoated loquat fruits during the cold storage period. Our study suggests that minimally processing coated loquat fruit could allow producers to also sell to the market loquat fruits that present large spotted areas in the epicarp, which are usually considered unmarketable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acactus pears 3acarotenoids 3acold storage 3adietary supplements 3aexocarp 3afirmness 3ajuiciness 3aloquats 3amarkets 3amucilages 3anon-climacteric fruits 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3asweetness 3ataste 3atitratable acidity1 aGreco, Giuseppe 1 aGaglio, Raimondo 1 aSettanni, Luca 1 aInglese, Paolo 1 aAllegra, Alessio 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120921203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007900162300001400241520137000255592002801625653001301653653001901666653001501685653001501700773011101715856007501826852000901901655001201910IND60125022720221118065109.0151101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012502272DNAL7 a10.1636/Hi10-26.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorse, Douglass H.10aDo cannibalism and kin recognition occur in just-emerged crab spiderlings?  ap. 53-58.  aMost spiders are aggressive, socially intolerant predators; however, broods develop inside a common site and thus should benefit from restraining aggression at this time and until they disperse. I tested single and mixed-brood groups of Misumena vatia (Clerck 1757) (Thomisidae) spiderlings that had just emerged from their nests to determine whether they cannibalized other young under crowded conditions comparable to the immediate area of their nests, and if so, whether they distinguished between sibs and non-sibs. Young M. vatia provide an interesting test case, since some broods remain in close contact for a short period of time after emerging from their nests. Mortality remained low over one month in provisioned young under crowded conditions, and no cannibalism occurred in these individuals. Cannibalism remained low in most broods of unprovisioned young, even though most of them eventually starved over this time. Just-emerged spiderlings placed in the field for three days and then run similarly also showed initially low tendencies toward cannibalism. However, larger free-ranging spiderlings that overlapped in size with provisioned spiderlings in the study cannibalized freely when confined similarly to the other spiderlings in this study. During this period the spiderlings showed no clear evidence of distinguishing between sibs and non-sibs.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCrowding 0aMisumena vatia 0astarvation 0aThomisidae0 tJournal of arachnology.g2011 Apr., v. 39, no. 1 p.53-58dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FHi10-26.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245011500178520155900293592002801852650002101880650002201901650002301923650001601946650001001962650003501972650002002007650001602027650001302043650001902056650001402075650001802089650002802107651001102135653002002146653001302166653001702179700002102196700003002217700004602247700003402293700002902327700003002356700003202386700002302418700003902441700003302480773013402513856008402647852000902731655001202740IND60750326820221122050647.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075032682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2021.1006342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Arlan Araújo10aSeroprevalence and risk factors for Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii in goats of Maranhão State, Brazil  aWe estimated the seroprevalence and possible risk factors for neosporosis and toxoplasmosis in goats in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. In addition, the variables related to these animals and the management of the farm were investigated in terms of the significance of the associations. In total, 383 serum samples from goats, of both sexes and different ages, were collected from 15 farms in four municipalities. The indirect immunofluorescence test was used for antibody detection against Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii. The overall seroprevalence of N. caninum in goats was 26.4% (101/382; IC 95% 22.3–31.1), and 114 out of 383 serum samples were T. gondii-seropositive (29.8%, IC 95% 25.4–34.5). In addition, the seroprevalence of coinfection of T. gondii and N. caninum in goats was 8.6% (33/382; IC 95% 6.2–11.8). The risk factors significantly associated with the seroprevalence of N. caninum were age, type of sheepfold floor, rearing system, feeding, pasture area cultivated, cats having access to the feed deposits, worming, slaughter place of the animals, history of abortion and the presence of dogs and cats. Regarding the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection, age, category, presence of other species and purpose of breeding were the risk factors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the seroprevalence and risk factors for N. caninum and T. gondii in goats in the state of Maranhão, Brazil, which provides basic data for the implementation of strategies and control measures against neosporosis and toxoplasmosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeospora caninum 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aantibody detection 3ablood serum 3afarms 3afluorescent antibody technique 3amixed infection 3aneosporosis 3apastures 3aseroprevalence 3aslaughter 3atoxoplasmosis 3aveterinary parasitology 3aBrazil 0aSmall ruminants 0aSerology 0aEpidemiology1 aReis, Sara Silva1 ada Silva Moraes, Elinalva1 ado Nascimento Souza Filho, José Gracione1 ados Santos Reis, Maria Helena1 aMartins, Thais Agostinho1 aBernardes, Juliana Correa1 aNino, Beatriz De Souza Lima1 aGarcia, João Luis1 aNascimento, Thiago Vinícius Costa1 ada Cunha, Ivo Alexandre Leme0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2021 Dec., v. 26 p.100634-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2021.1006343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245007200178300001400250500001900264520123700283592002801520650001701548650002501565650001801590650001701608650001501625650001101640650002101651650001701672650001101689650001901700650001601719650001901735650002901754650002801783650002201811653001001833653001601843653002301859653001101882653001201893700004101905700003001946773012001976856008502096852000902181655001202190IND60680834520221121132925.0200110e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068083452DNAL7 a10.1080/87559129.2019.16136622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolim, Priscilla Moura10aMelon By-Products: Biopotential in Human Health and Food Processing  ap. 15-38.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFood waste utilization is a strategy to reduce residues and add value to new products. Fruits, particularly their residues, are associated with a decreased risk of cancer; this may be attributed to the presence of phytochemical constituents, such as polyphenols. Melon is a fruit consumed worldwide, especially in tropical countries. The high consumption of melon is accompanied by large amounts of waste generated from its processing, including waste from barks, peels and seeds. These data are significant, especially in the current scenario of sustainable development, with the proposal to reduce waste in industries and foodservice sectors. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding melon residues (Cucumis melo L.) and their role in health promotion and biotechnology applications. Discussion of the potentialities of the melon and its application for value aggregation are encouraged, based on its nutritional properties, antioxidant capacity, antiproliferative effect and its potential for substrate to solid state fermentation. Melon wastes, such as seeds and peel, are of interest thanks to their bioactive compounds that makes them a good alternative for valorization of fruit processing by-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3aantioxidant activity 3abiotechnology 3afood service 3afood waste 3afruits 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3amelons 3aphytochemicals 3apolyphenols 3arisk reduction 3asolid state fermentation 3asustainable development 3awaste utilization 0amelon 0aby-products 0abioactive products 0acancer 0aenzymes1 aSeabra, Larissa Mont’Alverne Jucá1 ade Macedo, Gorete Ribeiro0 tFood reviews international.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 36, no. 1 p.15-38dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl46802x1525-61037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/87559129.2019.16136623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245006900158300001600227520124600243592002801489650003001517650002401547650001601571650002201587650001901609650002001628650001501648650001001663650000901673650002301682650001901705650001101724650001601735650001101751651001901762651001901781700002001800773009601820856007101916852000901987655001201996IND60518434220221118090855.0160417e196404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051843422DNAL7 a10.2307/19338342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolley, Frank B.10aBioenergetics of the Southern Harvester Ant, Pogonomyrmex Badius  ap. 217-225.  aThe bioenergetics of the southern harvester ant were studied on the Savannah River Project, Aiken, South Carolina. Excavation of hills revealed that density of ants ranged from 4,000 to 6,000 per hill. Labeling ants with P32 indicated that only 10% of the ants in a colony were active above ground during any 2—week period (the limit of recognition of the label); thus, short—term marking recapture estimates based on above—ground individuals greatly underestimate the size of the colony. There were 27 hills per hectare on the study area. The consumption of oxygen of workers at various temperatures was determined in a simple respirometer, and the temperature at which the ants were living in the field was determined during a year's observation at mounds. The energy expense of heat production was calculated from the oxygen consumption and activity temperature records. Total energy flow (heat production plus tissue growth) was highest in summer and lowest in winter. The annual range was from 14 to 48 kgcal/m2/yr. Tissue growth was estimated to amount to only 0.09 kgcal/m2/yr. Energy flow in this species was higher than that of 2 vertebrate granivores studies in the same field, the old—field mouse and the savannah sparrow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasserculus sandwichensis 3aPogonomyrmex badius 3aenergy flow 3aenergy metabolism 3aharvester ants 3aheat production 3aherbivores 3ahills 3amice 3aoxygen consumption 3aseed predation 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aSavannah River 3aSouth Carolina1 aGentry, John B.0 tEcology.g1964 Apr., v. 45, no. 2 p.217-225dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19338343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007500162300001800237520184000255592002802095650002402123650001002147650001202157650001302169650001602182650002102198650000902219650002002228650001602248650001502264650004102279650001702320650002102337650001702358650001302375650004402388650000902432650001102441650001402452650001102466650001902477700002402496773010502520856007502625852000902700655001202709IND60534135920221120090051.0160802e20141218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053413592DNAL7 a10.1021/ef50187082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartman, Blaine
E.10aValuable Crude Oil from Hydrothermal Liquefaction of an Aliphatic Coal  ap. 7538-7551.  aArtificial maturation techniques, such as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), have demonstrated the ability to generate petroleum-like products, termed bio-oils, from feedstocks including manure, algae and agricultural wastes; however, the oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur content of bio-oils often requires upgrading. The objective of this study was to utilize HTL on a low rank coal to produce a high quality crude oil sample that can be used as a transportation fuel. Coal from the Wyodak-Anderson coal seam was selected for HTL due to its predominant aliphatic character and low heteroatom content. HTL was performed at 360 °C for 72 h. The untreated coal, spent solid, and expelled oil were analyzed using several advance analytical techniques including solid-state ¹³C NMR, two-dimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry to achieve a comprehensive molecular characterization. Solid-state ¹³C NMR analyses of the untreated and spent coal estimate that 22% of the untreated coal, mostly the aliphatic portion, is lost as expelled hydrocarbon products. The expelled oil exhibits molecular characteristics similar to high quality crude oils, including low heteroatom content, n-alkanes ranging from C₉–C₃₂, and other desirable crude oil components such as cycloalkanes, alkyl benzenes and naphthalenes. It is suggested here that upon thermal maturation of the coal, preserved ester bonds in refractory biopolymers present in the coal are being cracked to yield fatty acids, which upon heating undergo decarboxylation, and finally random cleavage of C–C bonds to yield the lower molecular weight n-alkanes. Our results confirm that HTL is an effective technique for the production of a high quality crude oil from a low rank coal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3aalgae 3aalkanes 3abiofuels 3abiopolymers 3achemical bonding 3acoal 3adecarboxylation 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aliquefaction 3amolecular weight 3anaphthalenes 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3asulfur 3atransportation1 aHatcher, Patrick G.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2014 Dec. 18, v. 28, no. 12 p.7538-7551dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef50187083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245018100166300001800347520117400365592002801539650002301567650001301590650002601603650001401629650001801643650001901661650001701680700001701697700001801714700001801732700001601750773009801766856008601864852000901950655001201959IND60577417620221122085851.0170808e20160531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057741762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b046532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Eunae10aShape-Encoded Chitosan–Polyacrylamide Hybrid Hydrogel Microparticles with Controlled Macroporous Structures via Replica Molding for Programmable Biomacromolecular Conjugation  ap. 5394-5402.  aPolymeric hydrogel microparticle-based suspension arrays with shape-based encoding offer powerful alternatives to planar and bead-based arrays toward high throughput biosensing and medical diagnostics. We report a simple and robust micromolding technique for polyacrylamide- (PAAm-) based biopolymeric–synthetic hybrid microparticles with controlled 2D shapes containing a potent aminopolysaccharide chitosan as an efficient conjugation handle uniformly incorporated in PAAm matrix. A postfabrication conjugation approach utilizing amine-reactive chemistries on the chitosan shows stable incorporation and retained chemical reactivity of chitosan, readily tunable macroporous structures via simple addition of low content long-chain PEG porogens for improved conjugation capacity and kinetics, and one-pot biomacromolecular assembly via bioorthogonal click reactions with minimal nonspecific binding. We believe that the integrated fabrication-conjugation approach reported here could offer promising routes to programmable manufacture of hydrogel microparticle-based biomacromolecular conjugation and biofunctionalization platforms for a large range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achitosan 3adiagnostic techniques 3ahydrogels 3amanufacturing 3amicroparticles 3aporous media1 aJung, Sukwon1 aAbel, John H.1 aPine, Allison1 aYi, Hyunmin0 tLangmuir.g2016 May 31, v. 32, no. 21 p.5394-5402dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b046533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245005100169300001600220520143700236592002801673650001401701650001101715650001601726650001701742650001301759650001701772650001701789650001001806650001001816653001301826653001501839653001601854653000901870653001701879773010001896856008101996852000902077655001202086IND60600622520221119144151.0180703e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060062252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenkin, Robert I.10aEffects of smell loss (hyposmia) on salt usage  ap. 690-695.  aSmell loss (hyposmia) inhibits flavor perception and influences food intake. To compensate for flavor loss, some patients with hyposmia appear to increase salt usage. The purpose of this study was to compare self-reported salt usage in patients with hyposmia with that in normal volunteers.Salt usage was compared in 56 patients with hyposmia but with normal taste function with that in 27 normal volunteers. Salt usage was formulated with respect to 1) a standard quantitative salt intake scale, 2) salt addition related to food intake, 3) intake of foods and beverages with high salt content, and 4) salt intake related to presence or absence of hypertension.Eighteen (32%) of the 56 patients self-reported increased salt usage; they were labeled “increased users.” The other 38 hyposmic patients (68%) did not report increased salt usage; they were labeled “non-changers.” Increased users estimated their salt usage rose an average 2.8 times that experienced before their hyposmia onset. They also reported adding salt to their food before tasting it and ate more highly salted foods than did the non-changers. Salt usage was not increased further among increased users with hypertension but was increased further among non-changers with hypertension.Salt usage is increased among some patients with hyposmia presumably to enhance flavor perception to compensate for diminished flavor perception related to loss of smell.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3aflavor 3afood intake 3ahypertension 3apatients 3asalt content 3asalted foods 3asmell 3ataste 0aHyposmia 0aSmell loss 0aSalt intake 0aNaCl 0aHypertension0 tNutrition.g2014 June, v. 30, no. 6 p.690-695dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2013.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01588naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245010100181500002200282520042300304592002800727650001400755650002300769650001300792650004400805650002400849650001400873653001300887653003200900653003100932653001700963653001000980653002700990700002501017773007901042856008401121852000901205655001201214IND60613091920221118203607.0180911s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061309192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2018.08.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjan Chakraborty, Rakesh10aTiCl3 catalyzed one-pot protocol for the conversion of aldehydes into 5-substituted 1H-tetrazole  aPre-press version  aAn efficient protocol has been explored for the one-pot synthesis of tetrazole derivatives with wide functional group compatibility in moderate to very high yields starting from aliphatic and aromatic substituted aldehydes.

Metabolites of TRP have been identified as important mediators in immune regulation and function of the central nervous system. Inflammation strongly stimulates to the breakdown of TRP into Kynurenine (KYN), representing the initial step of the KYN pathway. Recently, exercise interventions have been able to demonstrate a modification of the KYN pathway plausibly by altering inflammation. However, modifications differ between acute and chronic exercise interventions. As such, this review examines the current studies that have investigated the effect of an acute (single bout) or chronic (training) exercise intervention on levels of TRP and KYN in both healthy and diseased populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentral nervous system 3aessential amino acids 3aexercise 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3akynurenine 3akynurenine pathway 3along term effects 3ametabolites 3atryptophan 0aExercise 0aTryptophan 0aPhysiology 0aImmunology1 aKoliamitra, Christina1 aJavelle, Florian1 aBloch, Wilhelm1 aZimmer, Philipp1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9631-45030 tPhysiology & behavior.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 194 p.583-587dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245008300127300001600210520119200226592002801418650001501446650002401461650001201485650001501497650001501512650001701527650001401544650001301558653002101571653001001592653002101602653001601623700001401639773013701653852000901790655001201799IND60710203920221120183156.0200908e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071020392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBana, J.K.10aBioefficacy and economics of IPM modules against major insect pests of cabbage  ap. 256-260.  aThe bio-efficacy IPM modules against aphid and diamondback moth were evaluated and the module M₃ (NSKE + Lufenuron + endosulfan) followed by M₁ (spinosad + B.t.k. + endosulfan) and M₈ (NSKE + spinosad + endosulfan) were proved most effective against aphid. But this was next to standard check M₁₀(endosulfan + endosulfan + endosulfan). Modules, M₆(endosulfan + NSKE + lufenuron), M₂(imidacloprid + NSKE + spinosad), M₉ (endosulfan + B.t.k. + lufenuron) and M₇ (imidacloprid + lufenuron + B.t.k.) were found moderately effective and modules M₄ (NSKE + B.t.k. + spinosad) and M₅ (endosulfan + spinosad + B.t.k.) were least effective. Against diamondback moth Module M₁ followed by M₅ and M₉ were proved most effective. Whereas, modules M₁₀, M₈, M₄, M₆ and M₃ were found moderately effective and modules M₇ and M₂ were least effective. The maximum yield of cabbage heads was obtained in module M₁ followed by M₅ however, less than standard check M₁₀ and minimum was in module M₄ and M₇.The highest benefit: cost ratio was obtained in standard check M₁₀ followed by modules M₉, M₃ and M₆ while, it was minimum in module M₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aPlutella xylostella 3acabbage 3aendosulfan 3aentomology 3aimidacloprid 3alufenuron 3aspinosad 0aDiamondback moth 0aAphid 0aLipaphis erysimi 0aIPM modules1 aJat, B.L.0 tIndian journal of entomology.g2012 Sept., v. 74, no. 3 p.256-260dThe Entomological Society of IndiawJournal:2027x0974-81727nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle
